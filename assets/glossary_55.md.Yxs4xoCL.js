He had a great variety of literary and scientific friends, who periodically met at Whitsunday (a springtime holiday) gatherings at his home at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. Biography Although born in Margate, where his father was captain of a trading brig, the family moved soon afterward to Aldeburgh, his father's ancestors deriving from Parham and Framlingham in Suffolk. Born to a Baptist family, his parents wished him to become a minister, but he instead began a career in accountancy and banking, relocating to London in 1855. He was the only surviving child of seven.Joseph McCabe, Edward Clodd: A memoir, John Lane The Bodley Head, 1932, p.1. Edward first worked unpaid for six months at an accountant's office in Cornhill in London when he was 14 years of age. He worked for the London Joint Stock Bank from 1872 to 1915, and had residences both in London and Suffolk. He married his first wife Eliza Garman, a doctor's daughter in 1862. He had eight children with Eliza, though two died when they were young. In his old age, he married his secretary, Phyllis Maud Rope (born 1887), who survived him by 27 years. Clodd was an early devotee of the work of Charles Darwin and had personal acquaintance with Thomas Huxley and Herbert Spencer. He wrote biographies of all three men, and worked to popularise evolution with books like The Childhood of the World and The Story of Creation: A Plain Account of Evolution. Clodd was an agnostic and wrote that the Genesis creation narrative of the Bible is similar to other religious myths and should not be read as a literal account. He wrote many popular books on evolutionary science.Bernard Lightman. (1997). Victorian Science in Context. University of Chicago Press. pp. 222‚Äì223. He wrote a biography of Thomas Henry Huxley and was a lecturer and populariser of anthropology and evolution.Francis O'Gorman. (2010). The Cambridge Companion to Victorian Culture. Cambridge University Press. p. 28. He was also a keen folklorist, joining the Folklore Society from 1878, and later becoming its president.Rosemary Hill. (2008). Stonehenge. Harvard University Press. p. 134. He was a Suffolk Secretary of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia from 1914 to 1916. He was a prominent member and officer of the Omar Khayyam Club or 'O.K. Club', and organised the planting of the rose from Omar Khayyam's tomb on to the grave of Edward Fitzgerald at Boulge, Suffolk, at the Centenary gathering. Clodd had a talent for friendship, and liked to entertain his friends at literary gatherings in Aldeburgh at his seafront home there, Strafford House, during Whitsuntides. Prominent among his literary friends and correspondents were Grant Allen, George Meredith, Thomas Hardy, George Gissing, Edward Fitzgerald, Andrew Lang, Cotter Morison, Samuel Butler, Mary Kingsley and Mrs Lynn Linton; he also knew Sir Henry Thompson, Sir William Huggins, Sir Laurence Gomme, Sir John Rhys, Paul Du Chaillu, Edward Whymper, Alfred Comyn Lyall, York Powell, William Holman Hunt, Sir E. Ray Lankester, H.G. Wells and many others as acquaintances. His hospitality and friendship was an important part of the development of their social relations. George Gissing's close friendship with Clodd began when he accepted an invitation to a Whitsuntide gathering in Aldeburgh in 1895.Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.371.

It debuted on Monday, October 4, 1943, replacing Norman Marsh's Dan Dunn, and was syndicated continuously through June 26, 1983. According to Saunders, Dan Dunn rivaled Dick Tracy in pioneering themes and techniques of the American detective comic‚Äîuntil 1942 when Marsh had an argument with Publishers Syndicate and \\"stormed out.\\" The syndicate then had Saunders (as writer and the syndicate's comics editor) and artist Andriola take over the abandoned newspaper strip and subsequently replace it in 1943 with a new detective strip, Kerry Drake.Saunders, Allen. 1983-6. Autobiography \\"Playwright for Paper Actors,\\" Nemo, the Classic Comics Library, no. 4-7, 9, 10, 14, 18, 19. Among Andriola's many assistants or ghosts over the years, specifically in drawing, were artists Hy Eisman, Jerry Robinson, Fran Matera and most notably Sururi G√ºmen, the last of whom worked on the strip for 30 years and shared credit with Andriola from 1976 to 1983.Kerry Drake at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on November 17, 2015. Eisman has said he ghosted the strip from 1957 to 1960. Characters and story When the strip began, Drake was a criminal investigator for the district attorney. Later, after the murder of his secretary and fianc√©e, Sandy Burns, by Trinket and Bulldozer, he left the DA's office and joined his city's police force. Kerry fought Dr. Prey, the Man with No Face, and many others. The stories had plenty of suspense, action and danger, but unlike Dan Dunn, who had followed early Dick Tracy in often explosive shoot-out resolutions of crime, the emphasis was on how Drake traced clues with up-to-date crime analysis tools to solve complex cases that gradually unfolded and intrigued readers. White- haired Drake was attractive and intelligent, while his nefarious opponents were initially drawn with facial distortion (an evil-is-ugly convention for villains that was also found in the cartooning of Pete Hoffman and Chester Gould). Under Gumen, however, the artwork became more consistently photorealistic. Meanwhile, Drake advanced in his career and developed in his personal life as Saunders combined action and drama. In 1957, Drake married Mindy, a police widow, and when they had quadruplets, he had to balance the conflicting demands of work and family. His younger brother, private eye David, better known as Lefty, then took over more of the adventuring and case resolution. Awards and reprints right In 1970, Andriola received a Reuben Award for \\"Kerry Drake by Alfred Andriola,\\" without acknowledging that it was written by Saunders and ghost-drawn by Gumen.Marschall, Rick. \\"Kerry Drake,\\" Nemo, the Classic Comics Library. No. 19, June 1986. Saunders quit shortly after that, at which point Andriola became the official writer, although even then, according to Markstein, he hired ghost authors. That Andriola had, for many years, been doing nothing, not even inking or lettering, on the strip - other than collecting the credit and the lion's share of the remunerative rewards - was fairly well known to comics industry professionals, resulting in the thinly-veiled comic story Success Story in the 1964 debut issue of Warren Publishing's black&white; horror-comic magazine Creepy. In the story, written by Archie Goodwin and illustrated by Al Williamson, a successful strip creator, Baldo Smudge, has been farming out the various tasks involved in his strip to a ghost writer, ghost penciller, and ghost inker. When all three 'ghosts' meet due to unfortunate timing outside Smudge's house, they march in as a trio to demand fair credit and wages. Smudge kills all three and throws their bodies in a swamp - of course the corpses come back to exact revenge. When Andriola died in 1983, Drake ended with him, with the last strip running June 26, 1983. After the strip no longer was produced for American newspapers, a comic book version was produced by the Swedish publisher Semic Press from 1984 through the late 1990s. Many of the earlier episodes were republished in comic book form by Harvey Comics and later by Blackthorne Publishing in its Reuben Award Winner Series.NCS Awards Cultural mentions In Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film Lolita, Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers) is seen reading Kerry Drake in a hotel lobby.

It was first published in September 1990. Plot summary Michael is a trucker who picks up a blonde, blue-eyed, young female hitchhiker, Sati, in the Arizona desert. Sati claims that she is God, to Michael's disbelief, and sets out to prove this by spreading this message through organized meetings, and convinces many people of her divinity. She is challenged numerous times, once by a fundamentalist preacher, but emerges unscathed in his claims. Meanwhile, Michael sets out to find out where this \\"Sati\\" came from, only to find nothing. The book opens as such: \\"I once knew this girl who thought she was God. She didn't give sight to the blind or raise the dead. She didn't even teach anything, not really, and she never told me anything I probably didn't already know. On the other hand, she didn't expect to be worshiped, nor did she ask for money. Given her high opinion of herself, some might call that a miracle. I don't know, maybe she was God. Her name was Sati, and she had blonde hair and blue eyes.\\" Pike, Christopher. Sati. New York: TOR Publishing Company, 1991. Retrieved from: https://www.scribd.com/doc/6479439/Christopher- Pike-Sati Influences Like many other books written by Pike, this book is clearly influenced by The Bible, and Hindu philosophy as well as modern day Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism, as shown in Sati's philosophy and persona which is a mixture of these beliefs. The name may be derived from a Hindu goddess named \\"Sati\\", but it is never mentioned in the book. There are many similarities between the character Sati and the similarly named Sita from Pike's The Last Vampire series written later: both are blonde, blue-eyed young females with supernatural powers, and have beliefs similar to those of Hinduism (Sita practises Hinduism).

It originated in parallel in the British Isles and the Nordic countries. In Scotland, the name first appeared in records of the 14th century as \\"Fitz Andreu\\" (meaning son of Andrew), and developed in various forms by the Scottish Gaelic patronymic of \\"MacGhilleAndrais\\" which means the servant of St. Andrew. Variations of this name were MacAndrew, Gillanders and Anderson. The name soon migrated to other parts of Scotland due to the popularity of the name \\"Andrew\\" as associated with the Patron Saint of Scotland, and the largest grouping lies in the north-east of Scotland from the Mearns through Aberdeenshire, Banff and Moray.

It has been the home of many important figures in the history of Presbyterianism in the United States as a result of its proximity to Princeton University and the Princeton Theological Seminary. The church operates the Princeton Cemetery and is a contributing property to the Princeton Historic District. The current pastor is The Reverend Dr. David A. Davis. History First Presbyterian Church on a vintage postcard. Second Presbyterian Church on a vintage postcard. First Church The Presbyterians of central New Jersey had two places of worship in either Lawrenceville or Kingston. In 1756 the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) opened in Princeton and services were held in Nassau Hall. A few years later funds were collected to build a church to serve the growing population of students and teachers. The newly constructed First Presbyterian Church of Princeton opened in 1766. John Witherspoon, the President of the College, began his 25 years tenure as pastor of First Church in 1768. Witherspoon Church and Second Church As time progressed, divisions within the church occurred and the church spun off two local Presbyterian Churches. After the building burned down in 1835 church notes indicate that African-American members were encouraged to leave the congregation leading to the founding of Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church. Later that same decade the Second Presbyterian Church was chartered by those who sought a less formal worship style and desired different pastoral leadership. Efforts to merge the three congregations back into one were attempted at various times over the years including an effort led by Woodrow Wilson. Nassau Presbyterian Church In the early 1970s, First Church and St. Andrews (the new name of Second Church) were without installed pastors. The churches decided to merge but were concerned about one church absorbing the other. The decision was made to create a new church out of the two (the Witherspoon Church was invited to the merger but declined) and Nassau Presbyterian Church was chartered in 1973. The initial congregation had 2,335 members with 1,759 and 576 coming from First and St. Andrew's, respectively. The former building of St. Andrews was sold in 1978 to a new church plant of the Assemblies of God, the Nassau Christian Center. The church is part of the national Presbyterian Church USA.

Biography  Moores was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, on December 12, 1909. After graduating from high school in Fort Wayne, Indiana, he attended Fort Wayne Art School. He also received a year of training at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts before spending five years working for Chester Gould on Dick Tracy. While working for Gould in Chicago, he met and married Gretchen, a musician. Moores Bio He met Frank King while in Chicago, sharing a studio with him while drawing his own strip, Jim Hardy, from 1936 to 1942. The strip, distributed by United Features Syndicate, was about a young man, down on his luck. It was never a success, and in its later years, pivoted to focus on a cowboy supporting character, Windy, and his horse Paddles. The title character left the strip in 1940, and it was retitled Windy and Paddles from 1941 to 1942.Jim Hardy at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on October 8, 2016.Dick Moores at the Lambiek Comiclopedia. Retrieved on October 8, 2016. Note: Misspelled \\"Padles\\" in source. That was followed by 14 years working on Disney comics, inking the Mickey Mouse comic strip, drawing the Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br'er Rabbit strip and later Scamp, and a short period in the 1950s at Western Publishing drawing funny animal comic books. The best known of these is the Mickey Mouse story \\"The Wonderful Whizzix\\" (Four Color #427, Oct. 1952), which some regard as the inspiration for the Disney's The Love Bug. Dick Moores In 1942, Moores teamed up with Jack Boyd, an effects animator at Walt Disney Studios, to form the company Telecomics, Inc. Their intention was to produce a television show that would present still panels from a comic strip on television, with a narrator and voice actors performing the characters' voices, including an adaptation of Jim Hardy. The program finally reached the air in September 1950 as NBC Comics, which ran for six months, until March 1951. After the cancellation, Moores and Boyd continued to try to pitch a Telecomics series to sponsors, but they were not successful. Gasoline Alley Moores moved to Florida when he was hired by Frank King in 1956 to assist him on the Gasoline Alley dailies. King's former assistant Bill Perry had taken over doing the Sunday strip in 1951. Moores' signature began to appear on the strip in 1964, and when King died in 1969, Moores assumed writing and drawing duties for the daily strip. When Perry retired in 1975, Moores added the Sunday strip to his workload and combined the stories into one continuing story. Moores relocated near Asheville, North Carolina, where he spent the rest of his life. In his later years, Moores composed stories, penciled faces and sketched the action, and then sent the strips to another artist for inking, such as his assistant, Jim Scancarelli, who took over the strip upon his death. Moores died of liver and kidney failure. Although in other strips, children would mature into adults, Gasoline Alley was the first comic strip in which adults aged. Allison \\"Skeezix\\" Wallet started out at a foundling left on bachelor Walt's doorstep in 1921, grew up to fight in the Pacific during WWII, married Nina Clock, and they had a daughter, Clovia, in 1949, who married Slim, a mechanic at Skeezix's Gasoline Alley garage. Moores introduced local events into the comic strip. At the same point that Fort Wayne residents were trying to raise money to save a grand old theatre, the Embassy, from the wrecker's ball, and to restore it, the characters in Gasoline Alley were trying to do the same with their Emboyd Theatre. Even many Fort Wayne residents were unaware that their theatre had been originally called the Emboyd, named after Emma Boyd, daughter of the owner. (For that matter, neither of the Fort Wayne newspapers carried the syndicated Gasoline Alley strip.) Gasoline Alley had strong characters that were animals. Joel was always with his mule (Becky), and Rufus carried his cat (Kitty) under his arm. A Doberman Pinscher (Kleine) and a Great Dane (Sieg) comically shared Slim and Clovia's already too-small apartment. One memorable story introduced a baby donkey with a forked tail, which the neighbors accuse of being a demon. While the Los Angeles Times speculated that the use of animal characters may be due to his Disney experience, Moores did not market as Disney did, though Frank King licensed a Clovia doll and held a contest to name Clovia.Gasoline Alley Family History Moores said that Walt Wallet was his alter ego. \\"I use Walt to create homey situations and for anybody who's feeling his age to identify with,\\" Moores said two months before his death. \\"He's the father figure. He's what keeps them together. He's the one I go to when I want to pull the strip together.\\" Dick Moores, 'Gasoline Alley' Cartoonist, Dies Awards Moores received the National Cartoonists Society Story Comic Strip Awards for 1973, 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1985, and their Reuben Award for 1974 for his work on this strip.

The chassis was a strengthened and slightly longer version of that used in the J-type with suspension by half-elliptic springs all round with rigid front and rear axles.

Most cars were open two-seaters, but streamlined Airline coup√© bodies were also made. The P-type was also available as a four-seater, a car that suffered from a lack of power and poor rear ground clearance.

It was founded on September 19, 1963, at Morgan State University (then Morgan State College) in Baltimore, Maryland, and now has initiated over 30,000 members. There are currently over 301 undergraduate and alumni chapters (including colonies), as well as colonies located in 40 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, The Bahamas, Colombia, South Korea, and Japan. The fraternity holds membership in the National Pan- Hellenic Council (NPHC), an umbrella organization comprising nine international historically African-American Greek letter sororities and fraternities, and the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC). History The fraternity was founded by 12 men (giving the organization the distinction of having more founders than any other NPHC fraternity) ‚Äî Albert Hicks, Lonnie Spruill Jr., Charles Briscoe, Frank Coakley, John Slade, Barron Willis, Webster Lewis, Charles Brown, Louis Hudnell, Charles Gregory, Elias Dorsey Jr. and Michael Williams ‚Äî during the Civil Rights Movement. On September 19, 1963, the twelve founders gathered together on the steps of Hurt Gymnasium on the campus of Morgan State College (now Morgan State University) and unyielding desired & agreed to form Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc., a support system for militant men of color in the era's turbulent social climate. At the time of the fraternity's founding, several NPHC organizations ‚Äúexisted on Morgan State‚Äôs campus‚Äù, however the NPHC fraternities and sororities were outwardly far more engaged in social activities than serving as advocates for social change and political justice. Iota Phi Theta's founders were extremely devoted to Civil Rights and reenergizing the movement. Many early members of the fraternity were also actively involved in the Black Power and Pan-Africanism Movements, movements begun due to perceived and actual failures of many Civil Rights Movement initiatives. Influencers of Iota Phi Theta include organizations such as the Black Panthers, SNCC, the original Rainbow Coalition (Fred Hampton) and individuals like Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael. Additionally, unlike most of their fraternity peers, the founders were all non-traditional students. Many were long-time friends. Spruill, Coakley, Dorsey, and Gregory had known one another since grade school, and Spruill and Coakley had been friends since pre-school.Iota Phi Theta Historical Overview Many of them were three to five years older, worked and attended classes full time, had served in the military and had families with small children. Based upon their ages, heightened responsibilities and increased level of maturity, the group had a slightly different perspective than the norm for typical fraternity members. It was this perspective from which they established the Fraternity's purpose, \\"The development and perpetuation of Scholarship, Leadership, Citizenship, Fidelity, and Brotherhood among Men.\\" Additionally, they conceived the Fraternity's motto, \\"Building a Tradition, Not Resting Upon One!\\". Early activism ‚Äì Northwood Theater Brothers participated in various protests and sit-ins throughout Baltimore to fight racial segregation. The earliest was a protest organized with a civic interest group, composed mostly of Morgan State College students, against the theater at Northwood Shopping Center in Baltimore, Maryland, located diagonally across the street from Morgan State College. In the majority-white area, Northwood continued to segregate its services, affecting thousands of students at the historically black college. In many theaters, only white people could occupy seating on the main floor, while black people were restricted to the \\"Jim Crow\\" balcony, often with a separate ticket booth and entrance. This protest started February 15, 1963, and over the course of the six days, the total number of picketers involved reached 1500, and over 400 individuals were arrested. The protest took place in the context of a longer history of protests against the theater's white-only policy. Annual demonstrations against the theater had been held since 1955, including a sit- in at Northwood and picketing downtown. The theater was a last holdout of racial segregation in the blocks surrounding the college. On February 22, 1963, the theater capitulated to student demands and ended its white-only policy.\\"23 Negroes See Northwood Film: No Incidents At Theater During integration Move\\". The Baltimore Sun. February 23, 1963. p. 28. Incorporation, philanthropy, and growth The fraternity functioned as a local entity until the first interest groups were established in 1967 at Hampton Institute (Beta Chapter) and Delaware State College (Gamma Chapter). Further expansion took place in 1968, with chapters formed at Norfolk State College (Delta Chapter) and Jersey City State College (Epsilon Chapter). The fraternity was legally incorporated on November 1, 1968, as a national fraternity under the laws of the State of Maryland. Zeta Chapter (North Carolina A&T; State University) was founded in spring 1969. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the fraternity supported the Big Brothers of America. In 1974, the then Grand Polaris, Thomas Dean, appeared in a local television commercial on behalf of Big Brothers of America. The fraternity continues to support service initiatives with national organizations such as the NAACP, the United Negro College Fund, the National Sickle Cell Disease Foundation, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the American Red Cross, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National Institutes of Health All of Us (initiative), the National Federation of the Blind, and the Inroads (organization). Additionally the fraternity‚Äôs chapters continues to support and lead Iota‚Äôs own initiatives: I-S.H.I.E.L.D, the I.O.T.A. (‚ÄúIntelligent, Outstanding Talented Achievers‚Äù) Youth Alliance, the Iota Phi Theta Men‚Äôs Health Program, I-PhiT (\\"Impact Others Through Awareness by Implementing Public Health Initiatives Throughout the World\\"), the #MuchMoreThanAHashtag Program and Project IMAGE. Originally, the organization‚Äôs members had no aspiration of national or international recognition. The first steps toward moving the fraternity from a regional to a national scope were taken with the creation of Upsilon Chapter at Southern Illinois University in 1974. It was also during this period that the fraternity's first four graduate chapters were formed across the South and the East Coast, which created a base for the organization in the Northeast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest regions of the country. The next regional expansion occurred in 1983 with the establishment of the Alpha Chi (San Francisco State University) and Xi Omega (San Francisco Bay Area Alumni Chapter) in California.  Joining the NIC and NPHC  While eventually joining the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) was an important objective for younger members, it was not an objective for the fraternity as a whole. The fraternity prioritized entering an affiliation that would provide resources and relationships essential for Iota's long-term growth and development. With that in mind, Iota Phi Theta successfully petitioned for membership in the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC; a federation of 69 North American men's fraternities) in 1985. Iota Phi Theta became the second historically African American fraternity to join the NIC and remains one of only four historically African-American fraternities which are NIC members. While its NIC membership was and is beneficial, later Iota began contact with the NPHC, which at the time had no expansion policy with which to accept new members. At its 1993 national convention, the NPHC adopted a constitutional amendment which provided for expansion, and years later, a NPHC expansion committee developed criteria for potential new member organizations and a procedure by which they might apply. In 1996, Iota Phi Theta submitted a formal application to the NPHC expansion committee for review, after which it was delivered to the NPHC Executive Board. After deliberation, the board unanimously approved Iota Phi Theta's membership application. Effective November 12, 1996, Iota Phi Theta was accepted as a full member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council, with all its rights, privileges, and responsibilities. To commemorate Iota's entry, the NPHC conducted a formal induction ceremony at its February 1997 leadership conference. This ceremony was attended by hundreds of Iota men, including the Grand Council and a number of the fraternity's founders, as well as hundreds of well-wishers and supporters from the NPHC community.  1990s to 2000s and international expansion  In 1992, the fraternity established the National Iota Foundation, Inc., a tax-exempt entity which grants scholarships and other financial assistance to those in need. Since its creation, the foundation has distributed over $250,000 in programs and services. The fraternity became an international entity with the establishment of a colony in Nassau, Bahamas in 1999, military chapters in South Korea (Alpha Rho Omega, 2005) and Japan (Beta Pi Omega, 2009), and Theta Mu (The Diego Luis Cordoba Tech University of Choco; Quibd√≥, Choc√≥, Colombia, South America, 2013). Since its founding date, Iota Phi Theta has continued to grow and has become the fifth-largest and fastest growing predominantly black fraternal organization in the United States. , there have been over 30,000 members initiated in the US and overseas. Traditionally, only the fraternity's members display its name \\"Iota Phi Theta\\", letters ŒôŒ¶Œ∏, and shield in Charcoal Brown (PMS 469) and Gilded Gold (PMS 871 Metallic). In 2012, Iota Phi Theta was ranked #20 on Newsweeks \\"Top 25 Fraternities\\" list.Newsweek: \\"College Rankings 2012: Top Fraternities\\" September 19, 2013 marked the fraternity's 50th anniversary. Prior to the fraternity‚Äôs 50th anniversary, fraternity members aligned themselves with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) Movement. The fraternity and BLM maintain similar stances, societal inequalities and injustices must permanently end across the United States. In 2019 the Zeta Delta Chapter at the University of South Florida helped raise $10,000 for Tampa Bay's Grant Park Community. In 2020 the Beta Omega Washington, DC Alumni Chapter (in conjunction with Beta Omega Social Services) awarded $55,000 in scholarship funds to high achieving underprivileged college bound youth. In February 2020, fraternity member, Congressman Bobby Rush successfully passed the historic Emmett Till federal anti-lynching bill in the US House of Representatives. In May, Iota's Grand International Polaris (President), along with the four other NPHC fraternity Presidents, formally called for the filling of criminal charges stemming from the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery. That same month, Iota's President, as well as the other NPHC fraternities and sororities' presidents, formally called for the filing of criminal charges against police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. On May 29, Iota's leadership, along with the other NPHC organizations' leadership, accepted an invitation to begin a series of meetings with presidential candidate Joe Biden regarding the highest priorities facing Black America.  Leadership  Iota Phi Theta is led by a Grand Council with a Grand Polaris at its head. Grand Polari (1963‚Äìpresent): Programs and initiatives Iota Phi Theta has a publication and several affiliated programs. The Centaur magazine is the official publication of the Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc. First published as a newsletter, the Centaur is now published biannually.  Audrey Brooks and Iota Sweethearts  In the early growth and development of the fraternity, Morgan State College staff member Audrey Brooks assisted the Brothers and became a vital resource to Iota Phi Theta, providing protection and support for the fledgling organization. In recognition of her support, the fraternity granted Ms. Brooks the title of \\"Eternal Sweetheart\\". Brooks continued to support Iota Phi Theta through her life and was a frequent guest at Iota conclaves and workshops until her passing in 2003. The Iota Sweetheart Auxiliary was formed soon after in her honor and has become a fraternity tradition. During a Sweetheart Workshop held during the 1999 Iota Phi Theta Conclave in Oakland, California, Ms. Brooks stated, \\"The Purpose of Iota Sweethearts is to smile and be gracious on behalf of Iota. Anything else is inappropriate,\\" which became the philosophical foundation of the Sweetheart Auxiliary. The Iota Sweethearts, Inc. (ISI) was founded in September 2014 to reorganize the Iota Phi Theta Sweetheart Auxiliary, which the fraternity then dissolved in January 2015. In October 2015, ISI and the fraternity signed an agreement which officially formalized the historical relationship between the organizations.

Born in the Bronx, Scaduto attended high school at the School of Industrial Art, where he focused on cartooning and won several awards. He also studied at the Art Students League. After graduating from the School of Industrial Art in 1946, he joined the art department at King Features, and two years later, he teamed with cartoonist Bob Dunn on They'll Do It Every Time. Over a 14-year period, Scaduto drew both the Little Iodine newspaper strip and comic books. The character appeared in a series of 56 Dell Comics published between 1949 and 1962. Scaduto continued to work with Dunn after Hatlo's death in 1963. Hatlo to Dunn to Scaduto After Dunn's death in 1989, Scaduto took over They'll Do It Every Time, doing the writing and art for both the daily and the Sunday strip. He continued on the feature into his seventies, commenting, \\"What I like most about being a cartoonist is starting with a fresh piece of paper and ending up with an idea. You're the writer, the actor and the director. I never thought about retiring. I enjoy what I do.\\" He often listened to opera while he worked. Rather than hire a new cartoonist after Scaduto's death, King Features chose to cancel They'll Do It Every Time, and the last strip was published February 2, 2008.Perrefort, Dirk. Connecticut Post, February 11, 2007.King Features Syndicate: Al Scaduto In addition to illustrating for magazines, ads and children's books, Scaduto designed greeting cards, games, toys and packaging. Awards Al Scaduto's They'll Do It Every Time (March 7, 2007) In 1979, Scaduto and Dunn received the National Cartoonists Society's Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award. In 1991, Scaduto was again honored with the same award.NCS Awards Personal life For his NCS profile, written in 2003, Scaduto described his personal life: \\"Married 50 years to Joyce Lawrence. Currently keeping company with fiancee Claire Adelman. Two daughters Deby and Patricia. Grandkids--Allison, Atticus & Lazarus.\\" After the death of his wife in 2000, Scaduto moved to Milford, Connecticut to live with his youngest daughter, Patricia Violette.

When a neuron generates an action potential, the signal propagates down the neuron as a current which flows in and out of the cell through excitable membrane regions in the soma and axon. A microelectrode is inserted into the brain, where it can record the rate of change in voltage with respect to time. These microelectrodes must be fine-tipped, low-impedance conductors; they are primarily glass micro-pipettes, metal microelectrodes made of platinum, tungsten, iridium or even iridium oxide. Microelectrodes can be carefully placed close to the cell membrane, allowing the ability to record extracellularly. Single-unit recordings are widely used in cognitive science, where it permits the analysis of human cognition and cortical mapping. This information can then be applied to brain machine interface (BMI) technologies for brain control of external devices. Overview There are many techniques available to record brain activity‚Äîincluding electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)‚Äîbut these do not allow for single-neuron resolution. Neurons are the basic functional units in the brain; they transmit information through the body using electrical signals called action potentials. Currently, single-unit recordings provide the most precise recordings from single neurons. A single unit is defined as a single, firing neuron whose spike potentials are distinctly isolated by a recording microelectrode. The ability to record signals from neurons is centered around the electric current flow through the neuron. As an action potential propagates through the cell, the electric current flows in and out of the soma and axons at excitable membrane regions. This current creates a measurable, changing voltage potential within (and outside) the cell. This allows for two basic types of single-unit recordings. Intracellular single-unit recordings occur within the neuron and measure the voltage change (with respect to time) across the membrane during action potentials. This outputs as a trace with information on membrane resting potential, postsynaptic potentials and spikes through the soma (or axon). Alternatively, when the microelectrode is close to the cell surface extracellular recordings measure the voltage change (with respect to time) outside the cell, giving only spike information. Different types of microelectrodes can be used for single-unit recordings; they are typically high-impedance, fine-tipped and conductive. Fine tips allow for easy penetration without extensive damage to the cell, but they also correlate with high impedance. Additionally, electrical and/or ionic conductivity allow for recordings from both non-polarizable and polarizable electrodes. The two primary classes of electrodes are glass micropipettes and metal electrodes. Electrolyte-filled glass micropipettes are mainly used for intracellular single-unit recordings; metal electrodes (commonly made of stainless steel, platinum, tungsten or iridium) and used for both types of recordings. Single- unit recordings have provided tools to explore the brain and apply this knowledge to current technologies. Cognitive scientists have used single-unit recordings in the brains of animals and humans to study behaviors and functions. Electrodes can also be inserted into the brain of epileptic patients to determine the position of epileptic foci. More recently, single- unit recordings have been used in brain machine interfaces (BMI). BMIs record brain signals and decode an intended response, which then controls the movement of an external device (such as a computer cursor or prosthetic limb).  History The ability to record from single units started with the discovery that the nervous system has electrical properties. Since then, single unit recordings have become an important method for understanding mechanisms and functions of the nervous system. Over the years, single unit recording continued to provide insight on topographical mapping of the cortex. Eventual development of microelectrode arrays allowed recording from multiple units at a time. *1790s: The first evidence of electrical activity in the nervous system was observed by Luigi Galvani in the 1790s with his studies on dissected frogs. He discovered that you can induce a dead frog leg to twitch with a spark. *1888: Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, a Spanish neuroscientist, revolutionized neuroscience with his neuron theory, describing the structure of the nervous system and presence of basic functional units‚Äî neurons. He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work in 1906. *1928: One of the earliest accounts of being able to record from the nervous system was by Edgar Adrian in his 1928 publication \\"The Basis of Sensation\\". In this, he describes his recordings of electrical discharges in single nerve fibers using a Lippmann electrometer. He won the Nobel Prize in 1932 for his work revealing the function of neurons. *1940: Renshaw, Forbes & Morrison performed original studies recording discharge of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus using glass microelectrodes in cats. *1950: Woldring and Dirken report the ability to obtain spike activity from the surface of the cerebral cortex with platinum wires. *1952: Li and Jasper applied the Renshaw, Forbes, & Morrison method to study electrical activity in the cerebral cortex of a cat. Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model was revealed, where they used a squid giant axon to determine the exact mechanism of action potentials. *1953: Iridium microelectrodes developed for recording. *1957: John Eccles used intracellular single-unit recording to study synaptic mechanisms in motoneurons (for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1963). *1958: Stainless steel microelectrodes developed for recording. *1959: Studies by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel. They used single neuron recordings to map the visual cortex in unanesthesized, unrestrained cats using tungsten electrodes. This work won them the Nobel Prize in 1981 for information processing in the visual system. *1960: Glass-insulated platinum microelectrodes developed for recording. *1967: The first record of multi- electrode arrays for recording was published by Marg and Adams. They applied this method to record many units at a single time in a single patient for diagnostic and therapeutic brain surgery. *1978: Schmidt et al. implanted chronic recording micro-cortical electrodes into the cortex of monkeys and showed that they could teach them to control neuronal firing rates, a key step to the possibility of recording neuronal signals and using them for BMIs. *1981: Kruger and Bach assemble 30 individual microelectrodes in a 5x6 configuration and implant the electrodes for simultaneous recording of multiple units. *1992: Development of the \\"Utah Intracortical Electrode Array (UIEA), a multiple-electrode array which can access the columnar structure of the cerebral cortex for neurophysiological or neuroprosthetic applications\\". *1994: The Michigan array, a silicon planar electrode with multiple recording sites, was developed. NeuroNexus, a private neurotechnology company, is formed based on this technology. *1998: A key breakthrough for BMIs was achieved by Kennedy and Bakay with development of neurotrophic electrodes. In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurological condition affecting the ability to control voluntary movement, they were able to successfully record action potentials using microelectrode arrays to control a computer cursor. *2016: Elon Musk co-founded and invested $100 million for Neuralink, which aims to develop ultra-high bandwidth BMIs. In 2019, he and Neuralink published their work followed by a live-stream press conference.https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/703801v4 Electrophysiology The basis of single-unit recordings relies on the ability to record electrical signals from neurons. Neuronal potentials and electrodes When a microelectrode is inserted into an aqueous ionic solution, there is a tendency for cations and anions to react with the electrode creating an electrode-electrolyte interface. The forming of this layer has been termed the Helmholtz layer. A charge distribution occurs across the electrode, which creates a potential which can be measured against a reference electrode. The method of neuronal potential recording is dependent on the type of electrode used. Non-polarizable electrodes are reversible (ions in the solution are charged and discharged). This creates a current flowing through the electrode, allowing for voltage measurement through the electrode with respect to time. Typically, non-polarizable electrodes are glass micropipettes filled with an ionic solution or metal. Alternatively, ideal polarized electrodes do not have the transformation of ions; these are typically metal electrodes. Instead, the ions and electrons at the surface of the metal become polarized with respect to the potential of the solution. The charges orient at the interface to create an electric double layer; the metal then acts like a capacitor. The change in capacitance with respect to time can be measured and converted to voltage using a bridge circuit. Using this technique, when neurons fire an action potential they create changes in potential fields that can be recorded using microelectrodes. Intracellularly, the electrodes directly record the firing of action, resting and postsynaptic potentials. When a neuron fires, current flows in and out through excitable regions in the axons and cell body of the neuron. This creates potential fields around the neuron. An electrode near a neuron can detect these extracellular potential fields, creating a spike. Experimental setup The basic equipment needed to record single units is microelectrodes, amplifiers, micromanipulators and recording devices. The type of microelectrode used will depend on the application. The high resistance of these electrodes creates a problem during signal amplification. If it were connected to a conventional amplifier with low input resistance, there would be a large potential drop across the microelectrode and the amplifier would only measure a small portion of the true potential. To solve this problem, a cathode follower amplifier must be used as an impedance matching device to collect the voltage and feed it to a conventional amplifier. To record from a single neuron, micromanipulators must be used to precisely insert an electrode into the brain. This is especially important for intracellular single-unit recording. Finally, the signals must be exported to a recording device. After amplification, signals are filtered with various techniques. They can be recorded by an oscilloscope and camera, but more modern techniques convert the signal with an analog-to-digital converter and output to a computer to be saved. Data-processing techniques can allow for separation and analysis of single units. Types of microelectrodes There are two main types of microelectrodes used for single-unit recordings: glass micropipettes and metal electrodes. Both are high-impedance electrodes, but glass micropipettes are highly resistive and metal electrodes have frequency-dependent impedance. Glass micropipettes are ideal for resting- and action-potential measurement, while metal electrodes are best used for extracellular spike measurements. Each type has different properties and limitations, which can be beneficial in specific applications. Glass micropipettes Glass micropipettes are filled with an ionic solution to make them conductive; a silver-silver chloride (Ag-AgCl) electrode is dipped into the filling solution as an electrical terminal. Ideally, the ionic solutions should have ions similar to ionic species around the electrode; the concentration inside the electrode and surrounding fluid should be the same. Additionally, the diffusive characteristics of the different ions within the electrode should be similar. The ion must also be able to \\"provide current carrying capacity adequate for the needs of the experiment\\". And importantly, it must not cause biological changes in the cell it is recording from. Ag-AgCl electrodes are primarily used with a potassium chloride (KCl) solution. With Ag-AgCl electrodes, ions react with it to produce electrical gradients at the interface, creating a voltage change with respect to time. Electrically, glass microelectrode tips have high resistance and high capacitance. They have a tip size of approximately 0.5-1.5 ¬µm with a resistance of about 10-50 MŒ©. The small tips make it easy to penetrate the cell membrane with minimal damage for intracellular recordings. Micropipettes are ideal for measurement of resting membrane potentials and with some adjustments can record action potentials. There are some issues to consider when using glass micropipettes. To offset high resistance in glass micropipettes, a cathode follower must be used as the first-stage amplifier. Additionally, high capacitance develops across the glass and conducting solution which can attenuate high-frequency responses. There is also electrical interference inherent in these electrodes and amplifiers.Geddes, L. A. (1972). Electrodes and the Measurement of Bioelectric Events. New York, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Metal Metal electrodes are made of various types of metals, typically silicon, platinum, and tungsten. They \\"resemble a leaky electrolytic capacitor, having a very high low- frequency impedance and low high-frequency impedance\\". They are more suitable for measurement of extracellular action potentials, although glass micropipettes can also be used. Metal electrodes are beneficial in some cases because they have high signal-to-noise due to lower impedance for the frequency range of spike signals. They also have better mechanical stiffness for puncturing through brain tissue. Lastly, they are more easily fabricated into different tip shapes and sizes at large quantities. Platinum electrodes are platinum black plated and insulated with glass. \\"They normally give stable recordings, a high signal-to-noise ratio, good isolation, and they are quite rugged in the usual tip sizes\\". The only limitation is that the tips are very fine and fragile. Silicon electrodes are alloy electrodes doped with silicon and an insulating glass cover layer. Silicon technology provides better mechanical stiffness and is a good supporting carrier to allow for multiple recording sites on a single electrode. Tungsten electrodes are very rugged and provide very stable recordings. This allows manufacturing of tungsten electrodes with very small tips to isolate high-frequencies. Tungsten, however, is very noisy at low frequencies. In mammalian nervous system where there are fast signals, noise can be removed with a high-pass filter. Slow signals are lost if filtered so tungsten is not a good choice for recording these signals. Applications Single-unit recordings have allowed the ability to monitor single-neuron activity. This has allowed researchers to discover the role of different parts of the brain in function and behavior. More recently, recording from single neurons can be used to engineer \\"mind- controlled\\" devices. Cognitive science Noninvasive tools to study the CNS have been developed to provide structural and functional information, but they do not provide very high resolution. To offset this problem invasive recording methods have been used. Single unit recording methods give high spatial and temporal resolution to allow for information assessing the relationship between brain structure, function, and behavior. By looking at brain activity at the neuron level, researchers can link brain activity to behavior and create neuronal maps describing flow of information through the brain. For example, Boraud et al. report the use of single unit recordings to determine the structural organization of the basal ganglia in patients with Parkinson's disease. Evoked potentials provide a method to couple behavior to brain function. By stimulating different responses, one can visualize what portion of the brain is activated. This method has been used to explore cognitive functions such as perception, memory, language, emotions, and motor control. Brain-machine interfaces Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have been developed within the last 20 years. By recording single unit potentials, these devices can decode signals through a computer and output this signal for control of an external device such as a computer cursor or prosthetic limb. BMIs have the potential to restore function in patients with paralysis or neurological disease. This technology has potential to reach a wide variety of patients but is not yet available clinically due to lack of reliability in recording signals over time. The primary hypothesis regarding this failure is that the chronic inflammatory response around the electrode causes neurodegeneration that reduces the number of neurons it is able to record from (Nicolelis, 2001). In 2004, the BrainGate pilot clinical trial was initiated to \\"test the safety and feasibility of a neural interface system based on an intracortical 100-electrode silicon recording array\\". This initiative has been successful in advancement of BCIs and in 2011, published data showing long term computer control in a patient with tetraplegia (Simeral, 2011).

Aposymbiosis occurs when symbiotic organisms live apart from one another (for example, a clownfish living independently of a sea anemone). Studies have shown that the lifecycles of both the host and the symbiont are affected in some way, usually negative, and that for obligate symbiosis the effects can be drastic.A. E. Douglas, Requirement of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) for their symbiotic bacteria, Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata (Historical Archive), Volume 65, Issue 2, Nov 1992, Pages 195‚Äì198 Aposymbiosis is distinct from exsymbiosis, which occurs when organisms are recently separated from a symbiotic association. Because symbionts can be vertically transmitted from parent to offspring or horizontally transmitted from the environment, the presence of an aposymbiotic state suggests that transmission of the symbiont is horizontal. A classical example of a symbiotic relationship with an aposymbiotic state is the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes and the bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri. While the nocturnal squid hunts, the bacteria emit light of similar intensity of the moon which camouflages the squid from predators. Juveniles are colonized within hours of hatching and Vibrio must outcompete other bacteria in the seawater through a system of recognition and infection.  Use in research  Aposymbiotic organisms can be used as models to observe a variety of processes. Aposymbiotic Euprymna juveniles have been studied throughout colonization in order to determine the system of recognizing Vibrio fischeri in seawater. Coral polyps without their symbiont algae are models for coral calcification and the effects of the algae on coral pH regulation. Aposymbiotic insects are used to model insect-bacteria relationships and modes of infection. These models are also used in arthropod vectors and disease transmission. Wolbachia species are common insect endosymbionts and investigation into this species has yielded potential human health implications. Additionally, aposymbiotic wasps without Wolbachia are unable to reproduce. This relationship between Asobara tabida wasps and Wolbachia is an important model for insect microbiome study.  Health  Women who are aposymbiotic for certain Lactobacillus species are more susceptible to urinary tract infections and bacterial vaginosis. Additionally, these Lactobacilli are of interest for use as a probiotic therapeutic alternative to antibiotics. Aposymbiotic vectors, especially insects, have been used to study disease transmission. Furthermore, aposymbiotic and dysbiotic vectors are being engineered to change the rate and efficiency of disease transmission. Arthropod infection with Wolbachia can cause sterility and inhibit the transmission of vector-borne diseases.

He made his major league debut on April 14, 1925 and played his last game August 25, 1940. After his playing career, he spent 36 years as a member of the Detroit City Council. Playing career=Early career Born in Springfield, Illinois, Rogell was originally signed by the Boston Red Sox prior to the campaign after two seasons in the Southwestern League. The Red Sox quickly tried to convert the switch-hitting Rogell into solely a right-handed batter, thinking that he would benefit from more appearances from the right side, hence more chances to drive balls off the Green Monster. \\"They just screwed me up for a couple years,\\" Rogell would say later. He appeared in 58 games for the last-place Red Sox‚Äî49 at second base‚Äîwhile hitting .195 in 169 at-bats. He was sent back to the minors for more grooming during the 1926 season before being recalled by Boston for . Rogell played in 82 games, hitting .266 while splitting time between third and second. The Red Sox again finished in the cellar, losing 100 games for the third year in a row. During the 1928 season he appeared in games at short, third, second, as well as all three outfield positions, and the Red Sox released him at the conclusion of the season. Rogell played for the St. Paul Saints of the American Association, batting .336 and driving in 90 runs. Following the season, amid offers from a handful of teams, Rogell signed with the Detroit Tigers, where he would spend the next ten seasons. The Tigers YearsBuilding a contender= Rogell struggled out of the gate and the club acquired shortstop Mark Koenig from the Yankees mid-season and plugged him into the lineup. Koenig, the same age as Rogell but already a household name, had been an integral part of the Yankees' famed Murderers' Row lineup in 1927 and was still considered by many as one of the premier shortstops in the American League. Rogell finished the year with a .167 average in 54 games, splitting his time between short and third. Though his start in Detroit was unimpressive, by the time the 1931 season had ended it was clear to the Tigers that they had found their shortstop of the future. Rogell unseated Koenig late in the year and finished the year hitting .303 in 48 games, all at shortstop. Koenig was released after the season ended. Rogell was the Tigers' Opening Day shortstop for the 1932 season, a position he would hold for the next eight years. A sure-handed fielder, he and Hall of Fame double-play partner Charlie Gehringer would give the Tigers one of the best keystone-combinations in baseball history. Marv Owen, who would man the left side of the Detroit infield with Rogell for five years, said of Rogell's fielding prowess, \\"He's the only player I ever knew who could catch a bad hop‚Ä¶ I don't know how he did it.\\" Rogell's offense continued to show the promise it had with the St. Paul club. He hit .271 with 29 doubles and 88 runs scored during the '32 campaign, and improved the following year to .295, 44 doubles, 11 triples, and drew 79 walks to post a .381 on-base percentage while playing in every game. The 1933 season also marked the first time Rogell, Gehringer, Owen, and first baseman Hank Greenberg appeared in the same lineup. =The Tigers break through= The Tigers, perennial second division finishers, acquired catcher/manager Mickey Cochrane from the Philadelphia A's during the winter. With him in place, the Tigers entered the 1934 season poised to take the American League by storm. Rogell, leading off in front of four future Hall of Famers (Cochrane, Gehringer, Greenberg, as well as Goose Goslin), had the best season of his career, hitting .296, driving in 100 runs and scoring 114. The infield combined for a major league record 462 runs batted in. The Tigers won the league by seven games and were set to square off against the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series. Rogell, unbeknownst to the Cardinals or the media, played the series on a broken ankle. Despite the injury he was able to collect eight hits and drive in four runs over the seven game series. He also found his way into one of the most popular plays in World Series history. =The Dizzy Dean Incident= After driving in a run with a single to right in the fourth inning of game four, Spud Davis was replaced by Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean as a pinch runner at first base. Pepper Martin then stepped in and hit a ground ball to Gehringer at second. Gehringer turned and threw to Rogell who forced out Dean at second, and then fired the ball squarely into Dean's forehead on the relay throw to first. The ball ricocheted off Dean's head and landed over a hundred feet away in the outfield. Dean, always known for his quick wit and humorous nature, remarked after a visit to the hospital, \\"The doctors X-rayed my head and found nothing.\\" Rogell would say of the play later, \\"If I'd have known his head was there, I would have thrown the ball harder.\\" =World Series Champion= After losing in seven games to the Cardinals, the Tigers returned to the series the following season. Again led by their stellar infield, the Tigers won the pennant by three games over the Yankees and earned a trip to face the Chicago Cubs for the world championship. Rogell finished with another solid year at the bat, hitting .275 with 88 runs scored while drawing 80 walks. Although he had shown speed in the minors, Rogell rarely had a chance to move on the bases with Detroit. \\"They didn't want me to steal,\\" he would say after retiring. \\"I had Gehringer and Cochrane and Greenberg hitting behind me.\\" Even with American League MVP Greenberg out for much of the series, the Tigers finished off the Cubs in six games. Rogell had another good showing in the fall classic hitting .292 during the series. The end in Detroit and a year in Chicago Although continuing to post winning records through the rest of the decade, the Tigers could not bring home another pennant. Rogell, after two more solid seasons at the bat, began to slip during the 1938 campaign. He did, however, set a Major League record on August 19 of that year when he was walked in 7 consecutive plate appearances (a record tied by three other players since, but never eclipsed). He accomplished the feat over a three-game span. He injured his arm after the season playing handball, and by the close of the 1939 season he had been replaced by 24-year-old Frank Croucher at short. He was traded to the Cubs during the winter for shortstop Dick Bartell. The deal was described in the papers as being a trade of \\"one worn-out shortstop for another.\\" While Bartell would be a key part of the pennant winning Tiger club, Rogell entered a hornets nest the moment he stepped foot into the Cubs' spring training camp. Holdovers from the 1935 team still held resentment toward Rogell and his Tiger teammates. Rogell, defending his former mates, got into a posturing match with manager/catcher Gabby Hartnett, who finally shouted, \\"You don't belong here!\\" Rogell immediately asked for his release which the Cubs refused. He spent the year riding the bench, as the Cubs rode their way into the second division of the National League, and retired at the conclusion of the season. He appeared in only 33 games, collecting just eight hits. Rogell and Gehringer Rogell led American League shortstops in fielding percentage in 1935, '36, and '37. He also led the league once in both putouts and assists, and twice paired with Gehringer to lead the league in double plays. The two played over 1000 games together, making them one of the longest tenured double-play combinations in the history of the game. A fiery competitor, Rogell provided an intriguing foil to \\"The Mechanical Man\\" throughout their careers. Gehringer recalled in his Hall of Fame induction speech, \\"I wasn't a rabble rouser. I wasn't a big noisemaker in the infield, which a lot of managers think you've got to be or you're not showing. But I don't think it contributes much.\\" Rogell, however, did not employ Gehringer's ideals when it came to on-field dialogue. On one occasion, after both failing to cover second on a steal attempt, Cochrane charged out from behind the plate shouting at Rogell and Gehringer. From The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract: > Rogell, astonished, looked at Gehringer to see if he was going to say > anything. Gehringer, of course, had nothing to say. \\"Goddamn you,\\" yelled > Rogell. \\"Don‚Äôt you come charging out here telling me how to play shortstop. > You go back there and do the catching, and I‚Äôll play shortstop. If I‚Äôm not > good enough, you can find someone else.\\" Cochrane went back to his own > position. Retirement from baseball Rogell spent the bulk of his \\"retirement\\" as a member of the Detroit City Council. After a brief stint in the minors as a player and coach, he returned to Detroit and began his civil service career in 1942. He would serve on the council, with a two-year break in the late forties, until 1980, playing a key role on the city's planning commissions. \\"I think I did a lot for that city,\\" he would say after leaving his post. \\"I was chairman of the committee that built the big airport there. Also the roads and bridges committee.\\" The road entering Detroit's Metropolitan Airport from the north, Merriman Road, changes its name to William G. Rogell Drive as it enters the airport. Rogell also used his position to help old ballplayers in the Detroit area. Former Tiger teammate Tommy Bridges (who came to the Tigers the same year as Rogell), a sober man throughout his career, started to drink while serving in World War II. After trying to restart his career with Tigers following the war Bridges moved on to the Pacific Coast League. His drinking became more and more prevalent until he finally collapsed drunk on the mound during a game. He divorced his wife, married a waitress from a bar he often visited, moved back to Detroit, and caught up with some of his old teammates. Rogell, upset with the condition his former mate was in, lined up for Bridges a sales job in Detroit. Bridges never came to work, but Rogell did not hold any kind of resentment toward Bridges. \\"It was terrible to see that,\\" he said. \\"But nice guys go, too, you know.\\" Numerous other former players also turned to Rogell when they had run out of options, and he always worked hard to try to provide them with whatever assistance he could. Rogell, after leaving the council, spent the rest of his retirement in Detroit. At age 94 he threw out the first pitch at the final game at Tiger Stadium on September 27, 1999, nearly 70 years after he had debuted for the Tigers in the same park. Billy Rogell died of pneumonia at the age of 98 in the Detroit suburb of Sterling Heights. See also * 1935 Detroit Tigers season References * James, Bill.

Throughout its lifespan it was minimally updated, and is comparable to early versions of MacWrite. Early versions of Write only work with Write (.wri) files, but after Windows 3.0, Write became capable of reading and composing early Word (.doc) documents. With Windows 3.1, Write became OLE capable. In Windows 95, Write was replaced with WordPad. If you try to open Write from the Windows folder, it will open WordPad instead. Being a word processor, Write features additional document formatting features that are not found in Notepad (a simple text editor), such as a choice of font, text decorations and paragraph indentation for different parts of the document. Unlike versions of WordPad before Windows 7, Write could justify a paragraph.  Platforms = Atari ST  In 1986, Atari announced an agreement with Microsoft to bring Microsoft Write to the Atari ST. Unlike the Windows version, Microsoft Write for the Atari ST was the Atari version of Microsoft Word 1.05 released for the Apple Macintosh while sharing the same name as the program included with Microsoft Windows during the 80s and early 90s. While the program was announced in 1986, various delays caused the program to arrive in 1988. The Atari version was a one time release and was never updated. Microsoft Write for the Atari ST retailed at $129.95 and was one of two high-profile PC word processors that were released on the Atari platform. The other application was WordPerfect.  Macintosh  In October 1987, Microsoft released Microsoft Write for Macintosh. Write was a version of Microsoft Word with limited features that Microsoft hoped would replace aging MacWrite in the Macintosh word processor market. Write was priced well below Word, though at the time MacWrite was included with new Macintoshes. Write is best described as Word locked in \\"Short Menus\\" mode, and as such it used the same file format so that users could exchange files with absolutely no conversion necessary. Write did not sell well and was discontinued before the System 7 era. Microsoft Write was part of a short-lived trend for \\"lightweight\\" Macintosh word processors initiated by the introduction of the Macintosh Portable and early PowerBook systems. Others included LetterPerfect and Nisus Compact.  Microsoft Windows  In 1985, Windows 1.0 was released with Microsoft Write. It was a basic word processor, intended to be more complex than Notepad. It was very similar to the Macintosh version, and had all of the same features. It saved and wrote to Write .wri files, a new format created specifically for Microsoft Write. Later versions could save to the Word .doc format. Write was replaced with WordPad in Windows 95. WordPad can read .wri files, but is unable to save to them.

It is located in the Salmo River Valley, surrounded by the Selkirk Mountain range. Situated at the junction of the Crowsnest Highway and Highway 6, Salmo is about a 30 minute drive from the communities of Castlegar, Nelson, and Trail. Salmo is the western terminus of the Salmo- Creston highway constructed in the late 1950s (now Highway 3) as a shortcut to avoid the long route north to Nelson and crossing Kootenay Lake by ferry between Balfour and Kootenay Bay. Originally known as Salmon Siding (named for the original name of the Salmo River, i.e. the Salmon River), the village was founded as a small mining town near the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway during a gold rush in 1896. The name of the town was changed to Salmo to avoid confusion with other places with similar names. When dams were created along the Columbia River in the 1960s and 1970s, Salmo's fish stocks were depleted. It is a quiet community with numerous outdoor activities including hiking, fishing, biking, golfing and skiing. Shambhala Music Festival Great Northern station at Salmo Since 1998, the community of Salmo has hosted the Shambhala Music Festival every August. In 2017, the festival celebrated its 20th anniversary. Television Salmo was featured on the historical television documentary series Gold Trails and Ghost Towns (season 3, episode 1).

In the Black Country, Netherton is bordered by nature reserves to the east and west, and an industrial area and the Dudley Southern By-Pass to the north. History=Early history Netherton means \\"lower farm\\" in Old English (the corresponding upper farm may have been the original settlement in present-day Dudley). For most of its history, Netherton was a small village centred around the point where a brook crossed the Baptist End Road, near the boundary of Pensnett Chase, a partially wooded common. Netherton is mentioned in legal records dating from 1420 and the first mention of a Netherton nailor, an occupation that became very important locally in later years, is dated 1559. The village is called 'Nederton' in the earliest available documents. The village was included in the Manor of Dudley, which was a Lordship of the Barons of Dudley who once owned a manor house in Netherton. This property is mentioned in documents dating from the 15th‚Äì17th centuries. In the 17th century, a Baptist Congregation (the Messiah Baptist Church) started meeting in Netherton. The church book for this congregation lists the names of those baptised from the year 1654. Netherton is shown in Joseph Browne's 1682 map of Staffordshire, although like its larger neighbour Dudley, it lay in a small enclave of Worcestershire completely surrounded by Staffordshire. In 1684, King Charles II of England granted a charter to Netherton allowing the village to hold an annual market fair. The fair was held in Netherton's market place in the last week of October until 1848. Although records of local government in the early years of Netherton are rather scarce, records exist of the procedures of the Court Leet of the barons of Dudley from the year 1701. Two juries were sworn in: one to deal with the town of Dudley and one to oversee the 'foreign' which is the name given to areas of the manor outside of Dudley town. Netherton was part of the foreign. In 1729 the court ordered the construction of a pair of stocks at Netherton to 'punish such as the Law directs'. Bumble Hole Nature Reserve, a former industrial area of Netherton Industrial Age Following the Enclosure Acts of the late 18th century, allowing building in Pensnett Chase, the present town centre took shape further up the hill than its original site. Netherton expanded rapidly in the industrial age and the thick seams of coal underlying the region were extensively mined. Blast furnaces were constructed in Netherton for iron making and the area became home to many industries including chain and anchor making, nail making, brick making, enamelling, and the construction of boilers. In 1874, Dr. Ballard, sent by the Local Government Board to inspect the sanitary conditions of the Borough of Dudley, described Netherton as: 'a village of such size it almost deserves to be termed a town'.Ballard,Dr, Report to the Local Government Board on the sanitary condition of the Municipal Borough of Dudley, 1874. In the mid-19th century, the area was notorious for its bad sanitary conditions. In 1852 an inquiry into the sewerage, drainage and supply of water was carried out, reporting to the General Board of Health. Its conclusions were very damning for Netherton. A typical comment was: 'Old Netherton Town, Mr. Thomas Woodall's buildings.- Drainage very horrible, with privies and piggeries as usual, and no pavement. Procure water from a horse-pit nearly half a mile, and it has to be carried up hill, mostly by girls, in little pails of about three gallons, on their heads. This was a bad place for cholera'.Lee, William, Report to the General Board of Health on a preliminary inquiry into the sewerage, drainage and supply of water, and the sanitary condition of the inhabitants of the Parish of Dudley in the county of Worcester, London, 1852. In 1844, Netherton became an ecclesiastical parish. It was made an Electoral ward of the Municipal Borough of Dudley in 1865, thereafter following the same pattern of local government reorganisations as the town of Dudley itself. Modern history The 20th century saw the gradual decline of mining and the heavily polluting industries such as iron-making. At the same time, Dudley Council sought to redevelop areas of Netherton for housing either by demolishing existing older housing (as occurred in areas adjacent to the Halesowen Road in the town centre) and rebuilding or by reclaiming abandoned industrial areas (for example in the Dudley Wood and Saltwells area to the south of the town). Other former industrial sites were transfomed into parkland (Netherton Park) or nature reserves (e.g. Bumble Hole). Some of the first council houses in the Dudley borough were constructed around Netherton Park in the early 1920s, around the same time as the Yew Tree Hills area, to rehouse families from older and dilapidated houses around Dudley and Netherton. Notable buildings Netherton's parish church, St Andrew's, consecrated in 1830, is situated on Netherton Hill at the highest point in Netherton. It was originally just a chapel-at-ease to St Thomas's of Dudley, only becoming Netherton's parish church in 1844. The church is surrounded by the gravestones of many of the former residents of the area. The churchyard also contains the mass unmarked graves of the victims of cholera that struck Dudley in 1831 and 1832. Netherton's most notable public building is probably the Victorian era Netherton Arts Centre at the top of Northfield Road. A fire station and a number of police houses were constructed at the same time on an adjacent site. These buildings are being transformed for commercial and community use. Old Swan, Netherton Another local landmark is a pub on the A459 Dudley-Halesowen Road called the Old Swan. The current building dates from the 1860s but there has been a pub on the site since at least 1835. It has been known as Ma Pardoe's since the interwar years, as its long-term landlady was Doris Clare Pardoe (born 1899) who owned it until her death in 1984, when she was 85 years old. Such was its fame among the lovers of real ale, that when the pub came up for sale in 1985, a company was set up by CAMRA to purchase and run the pub. Although this company was short-lived, the pub and brewery survived and it is now one of only a handful of pubs in the West Midlands that still brews beer on its own premises. As well as for its beer, the pub is also known for its decor including a ceiling decorated with vitreous enamelled iron plates. The pub has been designated a Grade II listed building. Two old landmarks of Netherton can now be viewed only in the Black Country Living Museum. These include Harold Emile Doo's chemist shop and Providence Church. Schools and education The first school in Netherton was a Church of England establishment built in 1836 at the corner of Halesowen Road and Church Road, providing education for children aged 5 to 11 years. The school was rebuilt in 1907 following problems with subsidence and remained in use until December 1988, by which time it was an 8‚Äì12 middle school and merged with a nearby 5‚Äì8 first school to form a new primary school. The old school building is still in existence and currently it is a furniture store. The Link Academy, Netherton The town has a postwar comprehensive school, Hillcrest School and Community College, which was one of the worst secondary schools in the West Midlands during the 1990s but improved dramatically following the arrival of head teacher Maureen Brennan. She became Dame Maureen Brennan DBE in 2005 for her outstanding efforts which saw Hillcrest School become one of the most successful schools in the borough just five years after an OFSTED report had slammed its weak management and placed it in special measures. In 2002, it was mentioned in parliament for its substantial turn-around. The new head teacher is now April Garrat. Other schools in Netherton include Netherton CE Primary School on Highbridge Road, Northfield Road Primary School on Northfield Road and Netherbrook Primary School on Chester Road. In 2010, Hillcrest achieved its best results yet ‚Äì 55% of the GCSE students left the school with 5 or more grades at C or above, placing it 10th out of 21 secondary schools in the borough. Netherton is also home to Saltwells Education Development Centre, the Dudley EDC which was Saltwells Secondary School until 1986. Parks and recreation Saltwells Nature Reserve stands on the Netherton ‚Äì Brierley Hill border, next to Netherton Reservoir. It takes its name from Saltwells Wood, now just part of the reserve, named for its saline springs where people came to bathe in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Doulton's Claypit, a Geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, lies within the reserve. Netherton Park Netherton Park is located near the town centre and was laid out in about 1900 on an area that had once been colliery waste. Another old industrial area that has been reclaimed for public recreation is the Bumble Hole Local Nature Reserve. This region lies to the east of the town adjacent to the boundary with the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell. The Dudley No. 2 canal runs through the reserve and is the site for an annual narrowboat festival. A canalside visitor centre provides information on the reserve and on the adjacent Warrens Hall Local Nature Reserve, which is in Sandwell. A rare Timber Gallows crane, a Scheduled Ancient Monument, stood in the reserve but is currently (2008) undergoing restoration. Netherton Cricket Club was founded in 1866. It is situated on Highbridge Road and celebrated its 140th anniversary in 2006. Netherton Reservoir stands approximately one mile to the south-west of the town centre, and is a popular resort for speedboat enthusiasts as well as scuba divers. Dudley Water Ski Club meet regularly at the reservoir. Facilities The majority of Netherton's shops lie along or just off the A459 Halesowen Road. Most of the shops in the centre of Netherton are fairly small including a bakery and a butchers shop. There are also three convenience stores in the town centre: a Costcutter, a Nisa and a Premier. There are two medium-sized supermarkets to the south of the town centre (an Aldi and a Lidl). A post office and a Lloyds Bank also lie on the Halesowen Road. The most unusual shop in Netherton is probably one selling Western (i.e. cowboy) outfits. Netherton's former triangular-shaped marketplace was situated in the fork of the junction of the Halesowen Road and Northfield Road. Old photographs show it to be still in use at the beginning of the 20th century. The area is now a small public garden on which has been positioned a full sized replica of an anchor of the RMS Titanic (the original anchors for the ship were manufactured locally). There are no proper restaurants in Netherton but there are caf√©s, fish and chip shops, Chinese take-aways and an Indian take-away. There are a number of pubs in Netherton although far fewer now than in former days. The Old Swan (Ma Pardoe's) has already been mentioned above in notable buildings. Not far away from the Old Swan, at the junction of Cinder Bank and Swan Street, is the Hope Tavern. At the other end of Swan Street one can find the White Swan pub, also known as Turners. Other pubs near the centre of Netherton include the Bulls Head, Ella's Bar, Netherton Sports and Social Club (also known as the Liberal) and the Crown Inn. At Windmill End stands the Wheatsheaf. Inside Saltwells Woods one can find the Saltwells Inn and a short distance from the woods along Saltwells Road are the Bunch of Bluebells pub and the Woodman. Darby End has two pubs: the Gate Hangs Well and the Red Lion. On Yew Tree Hill one can find the Yew Tree Inn. In the Bowling Green area one can find the Cottage Spring pub and in Dudley Wood there is the Victoria Inn. One unusual pub in Netherton was the Little Dry Dock in Windmill End, which, before closure, had a bar made from a canal barge. It has now been converted into flats. Netherton is well supplied with hairdressers and barbers, there being several such shops along the main shopping street. Netherton Health Centre, a clinic, is situated on the Halesowen Road. The Savoy Centre (named after Netherton's demolished cinema which used to occupy the site), which lies next to the Arts Centre on Northfield Road, provides training, adult education and conference facilities. The Savoy Centre also houses Netherton Library, a facility run by the local authority. There is a small Police Station on Church Road. Age UK, a charity that helps elderly people, has a prominent office and drop-in centre in the former pub, The Junction Inn, on the corner of Cradley Road and the Halesowen Road. Netherton's Conservatives have their club house (including a bowling green) on Halton Street. Netherton Sports & Social Club can be found in St. Thomas Street. Churches and chapels St Andrew's church, on the hill Netherton contains a number of churches and chapels. The most prominent, St Andrew's, an Anglican church, was consecrated and opened by the Lord Bishop Folliott on 16 July 1830. The foundation stone of the church had been laid by Dr. Booker, the Vicar of Dudley, on 30 November 1827. The other Church of England churches in Netherton are St Peter's, Darby End and St John the Evangelist, Dudley Wood. Perhaps more characteristic of Netherton are the nonconformist chapels of which there are several. In St Andrews Street, near the town centre, can be found the Ebenezer Baptist Church. In St Giles Street, the former Sweet Turf Baptist chapel has had its frontage altered and is now named the Champions Church. More evidence for Baptist activity in Netherton can be found on Cinder Bank where the burial ground for the Messiah Baptist church can be found (the church itself has been demolished). The Methodists have a church, The Trinity Methodist Church, on Church Road and another one, the Cole Street Methodist Church at Darby End. A former Methodist chapel, the Noah's Ark on Cradley road is presently (2008) being converted into apartments. On Chapel Street in the Primrose Hill locality one can find the Primrose Hill Community Church (Previously Primrose Hill Congregational Church). The People's Mission have a chapel on Swan Street. The Champions Church have built a new church (opened January 2010) just off Cinder Bank near the junction with Simms Lane. In 1868 a Sunday School Union was arranged between several of the churches in Netherton and a hymn composed to commemorate the event was sung on Netherton market place. The hymn mentions some of the above chapels. Part of it went: Trinity Methodist Chapel, Church Road May Sweet Turf join with Cinder Bank, And Ebenezer join the rank; And may St. John's and Primrose Hill, With Noah's Ark their stations fill. And may Church Road, and Darby Hand, All join in one harmonious band; To spread the triumph of our King, Who did for all salvation bring. Transport With the exception of the occasional canal boat, transport in Netherton today is exclusively by road. The major road link for the town is the A459 running from Dudley to Halesowen. This route was once a turnpike road, the Netherton toll gate being situated near to the junction with Swan Street. Frequent buses link Netherton directly with Dudley, Cradley Heath, Merry Hill Shopping Centre, Wolverhampton, Old Hill, Halesowen, West Bromwich, Bilston and Brierley Hill. The Dudley No. 2 Canal runs through Netherton, linking the Dudley No. 1 canal at Parkhead Junction with the south entrance of the Netherton Tunnel. When first constructed in 1798 it ran as far as Selly Oak where it connected with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. Netherton has had no rail service since the 1960s when the line, sometimes called the Bumble Hole Line, which linked the town with Dudley and Old Hill was taken out of service. The line had stops at Baptist End, Windmill End and Darby End. A small branch line from Baptist End led to Withymoor Goods Station, which was near where the Dudley No. 2 canal crosses the Halesowen Road. There were once many industrial and mineral rail lines running through the Netherton area but these have been long closed. For example, the steel firm Grazebrook's had a line running from their factory on Pear Tree Lane to an interchange on the Great Western Railway mainline near the former Blowers Green railway station to the south of Dudley. A branch of the Earl of Dudley's extensive private railway network, which is usually known as the Pensnett Railway, ran through the Saltwells locality. Localities To the north of the town centre lies the locality of Baptist End. This area is thought to encompass the site of medieval Netherton. It's not known for sure how the area got this name although there have been Baptists meeting in the general locality since 1654 The town centre encompasses the main shopping street where Cinder Bank meets the Halesowen Road and the residential area on the roads leading up Netherton Hill from the shops. Other localities in Netherton include Darby End which, according to local legend, was named after the nailmakers from Derbyshire who settled there but is more likely to have taken its name from the Darby family, who were prominent in the early days of the settlement. This area, which has a few shops of its own, is to the south east of the town centre. In the 19th century this area was also commonly referred to as 'Darby Hand'. Nearby, and bordering the Bumble Hole Local Nature Reserve is Windmill End. St Peter's Church, Darby End Primrose Hill, despite its name, is an industrial area immediately to the south of the town centre. Dudley Wood and Bowling Green are two residential areas at the south end of the town. The now demolished Dudley Wood Stadium, sited in the former locality, hosted the Cradley Heathens speedway team until the mid-1990s. The Lodge Farm Estate lies near Saltwells woods. It is named after the farm which was here before the housing estate was built. In medieval times, the lodge was where the forester (a person responsible for managing the hunting within a wood) lived and it is likely that this is the ultimate origin of the name of this locality, which is sited in what once was Pensnett Chase. Finally, Mushroom Green is a former industrial hamlet to the south west of the town. It is now a Conservation Area. Industry Sited as it was on top of what was later called the South Staffordshire coal field with its numerous coal seams interspersed with layers of iron ore, fire clay and brick clay, Netherton was probably always destined to become an area dominated by industry. Mining Coal mining in the thick seam at the Earl of Dudley's Saltwells Colliery Mining in the Netherton area has taken place since at least the 14th century. According to the Rent Rolls of Lord Dudley and Ward, the income from coal mining on Knowle Hill (the former name for Netherton Hill) formed a large fraction of the total income of the Dudley Estate in 1701. In the 19th century, mining in the Netherton area was particularly extensive. Some of the collieries were: the Baptist End, Dudley Wood, Netherton, Netherton Old, Saltwell and Yew Tree Hill. Coal mining was still being carried out in the 1970s when coal was removed from Netherton Hill by the open cast method. Nailmaking Nailmaking in Netherton has been recorded since the 16th century. Netherton became one of the centres in the Black Country of the hand- made nail trade which reached its peak around 1830. As the hand-made nail trade went into decline, mainly due to the availability of cheaper machine- made nails, wages for nailmakers were decreased leading to industrial unrest such as the events known as the 'Blackcountry Nailer's Riots' of 1842, and the Nailmakers' Strike of 1852. The last type of nail to be made by hand were those used to shoe horses. The Midland Counties Express reported in 1904: 'a few horse-nailers at Netherton and about a dozen female workers at Cawney Hill are the only remaining representatives of the nail trade'. Some nail-makers in the area turned to chain-making. A working chainshop is preserved in the Mushroom Green locality of Netherton. Chain and anchor making Sculpture of an anchor in Netherton commemorating the local anchor and chain industry Once located in Netherton, was a firm of chainmakers called N. Hingley & Sons, which was famous for making the anchors for the ocean liner RMS Titanic . Noah Hingley, who founded the firm, started making chain cable for ships in nearby Cradley in the year 1820. The company N. Hingley & Sons was set up in 1837 and anchor manufacture commenced in 1848. The Netherton works were set up in 1852 on the banks of the Dudley No. 2 canal. The main anchor for the Titanic weighed fifteen and a half tons and, on completion, was hauled from the factory to the rail head at Dudley Port by 20 Shire horses. Hingleys also produced anchors for the Lusitania and a number of other ocean liners. A replica of the anchor now stands on the old marketplace. Hingleys' success in international markets and their use of the Netherton name for their trademarked wrought iron products (e.g. Netherton Crown Special Best Best Iron) caused the name of Netherton to be known more widely both in the UK and overseas. A sculpture of an anchor stands at the junction of Castleton Street and Halesowen Road commemorating the local anchor and chain industry and the anchor motif can be found in a number of places around Netherton (e.g. on the metal park benches in Netherton Park). Immediately adjacent to the works of N. Hingley & Sons on the Dudley No. 2 canal was Lloyds Proving House where chain was subjected to a variety of tests to show it was of suitable quality. Boulton & Watt blowing engine re-erected on the Dartmouth Circus roundabout (at ), on the A38(M) in Birmingham. It was built in 1817 and used in Netherton, at the ironworks of M W Grazebrook Brewing Brewing was a major industry in 19th-century Netherton. Some of the large scale brewers were: William Hotchkiss at Castle Street, William Smith at Simms Lane, John Rollinson of St Andrew's Street, and Samuel Bagley at Cole Street. The largest brewery belonged to Thomas Plant and was known as the Netherton Steam Brewery. Plant's malthouse was on Raybould's Fold and the brewery in St John's Street. The only brewing today in Netherton takes place at the Old Swan pub (Ma Pardoe's). However, two of the remaining Black Country brewers, Holdens and Bathams, have Netherton links. Edwin Alfred Holden and Lucy Blanche Holden, founders of the Holdens brewing concern, had their first pub in Netherton, whilst Daniel Batham, son of Daniel and Charlotte Batham who had started the family beer production, brewed at the King William in Cole Street, Netherton before moving the brewery to its present location at the Vine on the Delph. Other industries One of the earliest manufacturing firms established in Netherton was Samuel Lewis & Co Ltd which was set up in 1750. Other notable firms were: Danks, which made boilers; John Barnsley and Co., specialists in cranes and hoists; and Grazebrook's, which had furnaces for iron-making. The latter firm was established at Netherton in 1800 by Michael Grazebrook.Chandler, G. and Hannah, I.C., Dudley: As it was and as it is to- day, B.T.Batsford Ltd., London, 1949 Industry today Although not of the scale of previous times, industrial firms can still be found in Netherton; for example, in the Washington Centre between the Halesowen Road and Cradley Road or in the Blackbrook Business Park, Narrowboat Way, the latter of which was developed in the 1980s as part of the Dudley Enterprise Zone that stretched beyond Netherton's borders into Brierley Hill and covered the land which became the Merry Hill Shopping Centre. Notable residents Statue of Joe Darby in Netherton Netherton was the birthplace of spring-jumping champion Joe Darby, born at Windmill End in 1861. Not only was he a superb athlete but a showman as well, appearing before King Edward VII in Covent Garden, London. In 1887 he defeated W.G Hamlington, then the World Champion spring-jumper. A statue showing the athlete in a crouched position, about to leap, stands on the junction of the Halesowen Road and Church Road. Some of his more famous exploits are written on plaques on the plinth of the statue. Another notable resident of Netherton was England footballer Joe Smith (1890‚Äì1956). He was born in Darby End and played for local teams until he signed for West Bromwich Albion in 1910. He put in 470 appearances for Albion, was a member of the 1920 side that won the First Division and was capped two times for England. Other Netherton-born footballers include Tom Grosvenor (1908‚Äì1972) who played for Birmingham City and was capped 3 times for England and Billy Wooldridge (1878‚Äì1945) who played for Wolverhampton Wanderers and represented the English Football League in two games against the Irish League. Sammy 'Pigiron' Whitehouse was a strongman from Darby End, who worked unloading canal boats and in a foundry in the earlier part of the 20th century. He became well known locally for his feats of strength. His nickname 'Pigiron' was earned in 1921 when he won a 4-mile race from Dudley Top church through Netherton following the Halesowen Road carrying a hundredweight (112 lb) of pigiron. Theophillus Dunn, also from Darby End, was a notable 19th-century character, known locally as the 'Dudley Devil'. He was an astrologer and claimed magical healing abilities, charging a shilling for a charm to cure toothache. He also claimed to be able locate stolen property by using charms. In one story, he is said to have prophesied that a certain Mr Hickman would die by being crushed by coal. As Hickman was not a miner he doubted the prophecy ‚Äì but later was run over by a coal waggon and killed. Dunn later prophesied the downfall of William Perry (the boxer known as the 'Tipton Slasher') at the hands of Tom Sayers. The prophecy was given in the form of a rhyme with the final line: \\"Tom Little will mek it come true.\\" (Tom Sayers was considerably smaller than Perry). Folklore, legends and customs of Netherton Like many villages in former times, Netherton had a local celebration known as a Wakes. In Netherton it was held on the last Sunday in October. On May Day there were festivities connected with the 'Clubs' which met at the various pubs in the village. The 'Clubs', such as the 'Odd Fellows', 'Free Gardeners', 'The Druids', and 'Foresters' put on their regalia and paraded around the village. The met at noon for a special service at the Church before heading to their own taverns for dinner. Cockfighting took place in Netherton at a number of cock-pits: at Yew Tree Hills, Northfield Road and at Bumble Hole. Mark Fletcher describes the court proceedings resulting from the arrest of people suspected of being involved in cockfighting in 1885. The cock-pit was stated to be at the rear of the 'Malt Shovel', Bumble Hole. There are a number of stories and legends regarding the Baptist church in the locality. It is widely believed that original site of the Messiah Baptist Church was near the junction of Baptist End Road with Swan Street (where the White Swan pub is today) and that Oliver Cromwell passed by on one of his campaigns According to some sources, the church itself was destroyed during riots in 1715 and a new church was built on the nearby Cinder Bank. It has also been stated that at Baptist End, the church adherents were baptised in a local canal, taking advantage of the warm water flowing into the canal from the local industry. In Victorian times, a legendary terrifying character known as 'Spring-heeled Jack' was reportedly spotted at a number of locations. The creature was often described as having blazing eyes and had the ability to leap great distances. Joe Darby, the spring jumper from Netherton supposedly started a local 'Spring-heeled Jack' scare when he was seen practising leaping over a local canal at night time, using a miner's lighted helmet to see his way.

Version 3.1, the last update of the program, was released on February 26, 1997. Hit points, sounds, frame sequences, text strings, and several other miscellaneous values can be changed. Modifications can be distributed in the form of DeHackEd \\"patches\\" which can be applied to the executable. At the time DeHackEd was released, Doom was a closed-source program, and thus to allow new features to be made available, the only choice was to patch the executable (as opposed to being able to change the source, which can now be done since id Software has made public a release of the sources). The most common patches add fast monsters and weapons, player-seeking-self-detonating barrels, and so on. However, more balanced and artistic modifications can and have been made. Even though many advanced effects can be achieved with DeHackEd, it does not offer the complete flexibility that a custom source port can provide. Monster AI and armor classes are fixed for example. Older DeHackEd patches use a binary format of data to be applied to an executable file using the DeHackEd patching utility. Later versions of DeHackEd save their patches in a human-readable plain text format that can be edited with any text editor. Boom included the ability to load DeHackEd patches and effect changes to the game upon startup without any modification to the executable file. Other source ports added similar functionality, and command-line loadable DeHackEd support is now common with most modern source ports. Boom also provided the BEX (Boom EXtended) extensions for DeHackEd support. BEX allows greater flexibility in string editing, application of codepointers to any frame, and extra codepointers.

Deveraux has written over 40 novels, many of which have been on The New York Times Best Seller list, including such titles as A Knight in Shining Armor and Remembrance; she has sold over 50 million copies as of 2016. Deveraux appeared as herself in the 1987 romance novelist documentary Where the Heart Roams. Literary work Known for her historical romances with storylines centered on strong, capable heroines, Deveraux has written stories set in several time periods, including post-Revolutionary America, nineteenth century Colorado, and nineteenth century New Mexico. She has written several time-travel romances, and her later novels have had a contemporary setting. Many of her more recent books feature paranormal storylines. Many of her books follow the Montgomery and Taggert families and contain recurring characters. In 2009, she was one of four authors who produced works for the debut of Vook, a company which produces \\"video books\\" by combining text, video and internet links into a single experience. Deveraux wrote \\"A Girl From Summer Hill,\\" a contemporary take of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice in 2016. Personal life Deveraux's 8-year-old adopted son, Sam Alexander Montassir, died in 2005 when he was hit by a truck near their home in North Carolina. After the death of Deveraux's son, she came under the influence of psychic Rose Marks, who offered her the ability to continue to contact her son as well as to save him from being \\"caught between heaven and hell\\". Deveraux had already known Marks, who used an assumed name of \\"Joyce Mitchell\\" to Deveraux, from marriage counselling as well as difficulties in becoming pregnant, but the relationship strengthened after the death, and Deveraux was encouraged to break ties with other friends. Marks extracted between 17-20 million dollars from Deveraux, leaving her with almost no money left despite her lucrative writing career. Marks told Deveraux as well as other victims that their money and valuables were cursed by malign influence and needed to be given to her for \\"cleansing rituals\\" and that they would be returned; yet the items never were returned. Marks was found guilty of fraud in a trial in 2013, and lost an appeal of her sentence in 2016.Author Jude Deveraux Was Suicidal After Losing $20 Million to Fortune Telling ConConvicted 'psychic' loses bid for new trial in $17M fraud case Bibliography=The Montgomery/Taggert Family *Chronological order # The Black Lyon (1980) [Ranulf de Warbrooke & Lyonene Tompkins, 1275] # The Maiden (1988) [Prince Rowan & Princess Jura, 1299] # The Velvet Promise (1981) [Gavin Montgomery & Judith Revedoune, 1501] # Highland Velvet (1982) [Stephen Montgomery & Bronwyn MacArran, 1501] # Velvet Song (1983) [Raine Montgomery & Alyxandra Blackett, 1502] # Velvet Angel (1983) [Miles Montgomery & Elizabeth Chatworth, 1502] # The Heiress (1995) [Axia Maidenhall & Jamie Montgomery, 1572] # The Raider (1987) [Jessica Taggert & Alexander Montgomery, 1766] # Mountain Laurel (1990) [Maddie Worth & Christopher Hring \\"'Ring\\" Montgomery, 1859] # Eternity (1992) [Carrie Montgomery & Joshua Greene Templeton, 1865] # The Duchess (1991) [John \\"Trevelyan\\" Montgomery & Claire Willoughby, 1883] # Twin of Fire (1985) [Leander Westfield & Blair Chandler, 1892] # Twin of Ice (1985) [Kane Taggert & Houston Chandler, 1892] # The Temptress (1986) [Christiana Montgomery Mathison & Tynan Dysan, 1896] # Wishes (1989) [Jocelyn \\"Jace\\" Montgomery & Nellie Grayson, 1896] # The Awakening (1988) [Amanda Caulden & Henry \\"Hank\\" Montgomery, 1913] # \\"The Invitation\\" from The Invitation (1994) [Jacqueline O'Neill & William \\"Billy\\" Montgomery, 1934] # The Princess (1987) [Jarl Tynan \\"J.T.\\" Montgomery & Princess Victoria Jura \\"Aria\\" Cilean Xenita, 1942] # A Knight in Shining Armor (1989) [Nicholas Stafford & Dougless Montgomery, 1988-1564] # Sweet Liar (1992) [Samantha Elliot & Michael Taggert, 1991] # \\"Matchmakers\\" from The Invitation (1994) [Cale Anderson & Kane Taggert, 1991] # \\"Change of Heart\\" from Holiday of Love (1994) [Frank Taggert & Miranda Harcourt (Stowe)] # \\"Just Curious\\" from A Gift of Love (1995) [Macallister J.

The event has been copied by the Columbus, Ohio, Ocean City, New Jersey, and Kalamazoo, Michigan Doo Dah Parades. The original Pasadena parade Pasadena Doo Dah Parade, 2009 Doo Dah history Conceived in 1978 by several friends, including Peter Apanel, Ted Wright, Charles \\"Skip\\" Finnell, and Richard Caputo, sitting in a bar called Loch Ness Monster Pub in Pasadena, as an irreverent alternative to the traditional formality of the Rose Parade, which is also held in Pasadena. In 1978, January 1 fell on a Sunday, and the Rose Parade, which typically takes place on January 1, will not march on a Sunday. So they decided it would be fun to have an alternate parade on January 1 that year. Some of the early participants were Wright as first grand marshal, Snotty Scotty and the Hankies, the Lawn Mower Drill Team, Macho Dog, the Briefcase Drill Team and General Hershy Bar, among many others. It was the first Pasadena Doo Dah Parade. The throwing of tortillas into and from the crowds was a signature event during the parade. Contemporary Doo Dah The Pasadena Doo Dah Parade today features absurd and unique participants such as the BBQ & Hibachi Marching Grill Team, the Shopping Cart Drill Team, the Bastard Sons of Lee Marvin, the Men of Leisure Synchronized Nap Team, The Marching Lumberjacks, The Army of Toy Soldiers, Claude Rains & the 20-Man Memorial Invisible Man Marching Drill Team, Uncle Fester, Count Smokula, The Radioactive Chicken Heads and the Committee for the Right to Bear Arms, a group that marches in precise formations while carrying mannequin arms. Snotty Scotty and the Hankies is still the official band. Many groups participate in the Doo Dah Parade as a fundraising effort for various charities. In 2010 the parade was moved to May 1, and also moved from Old Pasadena to East Pasadena. This Parade has spawned many others like it. In August 2012, the Pasadena Museum of History opened an exhibit entitled, \\"What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been: 35 Years of the Pasadena Doo Dah Parade\\", containing donated items and photographs from the past 35 years of the parade and including a recreation of part of the original Chromo's bar. Over 400 people attended the opening reception, many in costume. In 2016, Route 66 Magazine ran a story on the Doo Dah parade. In mid-July 2020, officials cited the COVID-19 pandemic as grounds for cancellation. Like the Rose Parade, which was postponed to 2022, the 43rd Doo Dah Parade was deferred to 2021. Parades inspired by Pasadena Doo Dah The 2005 Doo Dah Parade in Columbus, Ohio. Columbus Doo Dah Parade A popular Doo Dah Parade takes place in Columbus, Ohio. The Columbus Doo Dah Parade was inspired by the Pasadena event and began in 1983 as a small, disorganized march down the sidewalks of High Street in The Short North district of the city by regulars of the Short North Tavern. The Columbus Doo Dah Parade takes place yearly on the Fourth of July (rain date, July 3) in the Short North and Victorian Village neighborhoods of Columbus. The parade route begins on Park Street near Goodale Park and ends at the Short North Tavern. One of the most popular and longest-running participant groups is the Marching Fidels, a group dressed like Fidel Castro who take siestas along the parade route and conscript bystanders into the Cuban army, dressing them in camouflage and \\"forcing\\" them to march in the parade. Also featured are the Emperor of the Short North and the King and Queen of DooDah. In recent years, participants have included groups such as the Fishnet Mafia, the Wilber Hills Country Club, Feature Creatures Haunted Acting Troupe of Central Ohio, Four Men Walking Abreast (four men carrying a pink balloon adorned with a brighter pink spot in the middle), Deri Air, the Ohio Roller Derby, and the Doo Dah Band. At one time, the parade featured a limosine: a stretched Yugo. Judging takes place along the route and participants bribe judges to vote for their entries. Prizes for Best and Worst Entries are rewarded with gift certificates to Short North businesses. Ocean City Doo Dah parade A long-running parade, in Ocean City, New Jersey, is held every April (usually on the Saturday after Tax Day) on the New Jersey shore. The Ocean City DooDah Parade originally took place in Pitman, New Jersey, but migrated closer to the ocean a couple of years later. The route starts from 6th Street and goes down Asbury Avenue through downtown Ocean City, turns east on 12th Street and then proceeds up the boardwalk, ending at the historic Music Pier. OC's parade is billed as a salute to humor and comedy, featuring impersonators of Groucho Marx, Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Abbott & Costello and many other classic movie stars. Celebrity comedians and TV stars have served as grand marshal in this parade, including Joan Rivers, Joe Franklin, Larry Storch, Mickey Rooney, Soupy Sales, Bill Dana, Captain Noah and many others. After his grand marshal appearance, legendary kids' TV host Soupy Sales became a regular guest at DooDah and following the parade, was honored by presiding over the \\"Pieasco\\" in which participants are invited to toss shaving cream pies at each other, just like the ones Soupy got hit with on his classic show. All parade participants receive a free commemorative T-shirt and hot dog courtesy of sponsor Dietz & Watson. Other parade regulars include \\"Trash Buster\\" (played by chief DooDah organizer Mark Soifer from Ocean City's Community Affairs department), \\"Underdog Lady\\" Suzanne Muldowny, the \\"Wizard of Odd\\", the Pitman NJ Hobo Band, kids radio host Kathy O'Connell, and hundreds of dogs taking part in the annual Bassett Hound Waddle as part of the weekend's festivities. Also appearing are the costume character host and friends of the New York City cable & Internet TV show \\"Rapid T. Rabbit and Friends\\". The parade recognizes those who support humor and entertainment that appear in the DooDah Parade by giving out award plaques in a ceremony at the Music Pier immediately at the conclusion of the march. The \\"Golden Hot Dog\\" award is given to those entertainers from the extended local area. The \\"Double Doggy DooDah Glutton- For-Punishment Award\\" is given to anyone who appears in the Ocean City Parade after being in any other DooDah Parade elsewhere in the country. Rapid T. Rabbit was the first such award recipient in 1995 after having marched in the Pasadena parade in the early 90s, and has also since appeared in the parades at Columbus, Ohio, and Illion, New York. 2020's parade was cancelled because of COVID-19 outbreak concerns; it'll return come 2021. Kalamazoo Doo Dah Parade In 1984, WKMI (Kalamazoo, Michigan) started their version of the Doo Dah Parade (stylized Do-Dah). It was started by Lori Moore in reaction to the need for more fun, innovative, and silly family programming. The parade was a ‚Äúspin off‚Äù from the Pasadena Parade. Similar to how the original Pasadena parade is an alternative to the traditional formality of the Rose Parade, the Kalamazoo Do-Dah parade is the opposite of the Kalamazoo Holiday parade. Additionally, it also filled a need to provide a ‚Äúsilly parade‚Äù for all those businesses that couldn't meet the guidelines of the Holiday Parade On average, the Kalamazoo Do-Dah Parade attracts about 60 units including 1,500 participants and approximately 40,000 spectators. In the mid-1990s WKFR took over the parade operation and in 2004 they approached DKI to partner with them to host the parade and eventually take over the operation and ownership of the parade. As of 2015, the Kalamazoo Do-Dah Parade is now organized by the Kalamazoo Experiential Learning Center. It suffered its only cancellation: in 2020.

One of the so-called Sanseki ‰∏âË∑° (Three Brush Traces), along with Fujiwara no Sukemasa and Fujiwara no Yukinari, T≈çf≈´ is considered the founder of Japanese style calligraphy or way≈çshod≈ç (ÂíåÊßòÊõ∏ÈÅì).  Life  Michikaze was born in the present Kasugai, Aichi prefecture, as the grandson of a courtier-poet, Ono no Takamura. He was a government official, a poet and a calligrapher. He provided highly distinguished calligraphic services for three emperors during his career: Daigo (reigned from 897 to 930), Suzaku (reigned from 930 to 946) and Murakami (reigned from 946 to 967). Michikaze's fame permitted him to serve, at the age of twenty-seven, in the Seiryoden, the residential quarters of the imperial court. As a recognition of his high skill, Emperor Daigo offered the Buddhist monk Kanken two volumes of Michikaze's works in 927, and urged him to take them with him on a voyage to China, and commend Michikaze‚Äôs calligraphic achievements to the Chinese. Michikaze had lost much of his sight by the time he died.  Works  Draft for an inscription on byoubu detail Gyokusen-jo Opening Michikaze took the first step in Japanizing the art of calligraphy, imported from China around the 5th century. His works were slightly influenced by the style of the legendary 4th-century Chinese calligrapher Wang Xizhi, however, he added his own refinements, that resulted in a softer feel with more freedom of movement than was common under the strictures of Chinese calligraphy. He created the Japanese style calligraphy (way≈ç) that was later refined by other two masters, Fujiwara no Sukemasa and Fujiwara no Yukinari. Way≈ç was accredited and practiced, as a pure Japanese art form, until the mid-19th century. Michikaze showed great diligence in his works, which resulted in grandiose character forms, and powerful lines. None of Michikaze's kana calligraphy are extant. A number of extant kanji works are believed to be by Michikaze, but only a few are positively attributed. One of the well-known works ascribed without much evidence to Michikaze is a draft for an inscription on a byoubu (Japanese folding screen) now mounted as a handscroll in the Tokyo Imperial Household collection. It was executed in semi-cursive script (gy≈çsho), and consisted of ten poems by Michikaze's contemporary Oe no Asatsuna. The collection also has his other masterpieces, like the Gyokusen-Jo handscroll, which are poems by a Tang poet. Michikaze also was attributed to many kohitsu-gire (famous calligraphic works) of the Heian era, among which a scroll containing forty- nine waka poems from the twelfth volume ‚Äì \\"Poems of Love\\" ‚Äì of the early-Heian poetry anthology, Kokin Wakash≈´. Among his last works are eleven letters, in one of which he bemoans the evanescence of life.  Legend  Ono no Michikaze and the frog Michikaze became well known due to his depiction in Hanafuda cards. As the story goes, one day when Michikaze was feeling inadequate about his calligraphy he took a walk outside in the rain. Seeing a frog trying to jump on a willow branch, again and again missing its mark, he thought to himself \\"Stupid frog! No matter how many times you try you will never be able to reach the willow\\". Upon thinking this, the willow curved in a big breeze allowing the frog to jump onto the willow. Michikaze then realized \\"I myself am the stupid one. The frog created this chance with his determination. Up until now I haven't been as diligent as this frog\\". This story made him famous during the Edo period and earned him his place on the willow set in Hanafuda cards.  Legacy *On 20 October 2000 (Heisei 12), an 80 yen \\"Willow and frog\\" postal stamp was issued, depicting Michikaze watching a leaping frog. *There is a shrine to his spirit in Kyoto, where his divine soul is considered to be protecting the women of the region in maternity. *Ono no Michikaze is depicted on the \\"rainman\\" of the traditional Japanese playing cards Hanafuda.

O. Paton Electric Welding Institute in Kyiv. Paton was a people's deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (1946‚Äì1953). He was the father of Borys Paton. Early career Born in 1870 in Nice, France, he studied at the Dresden Technical University (graduated in 1894), and at the Petersburg Institute of Railway Roads (graduated in 1896). He designed the structure of the train station in Dresden, and was a lecturer at the Moscow Engineering College of Railway Roads (1889‚Äì1904). Paton was a Professor at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute and the Chairman of the Bridge Department from 1904 to 1938. In 1929 he organized a welding laboratory and the Electric Welding Committee. In 1934 Paton founded the Electric Welding Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Ukrainian SSR in Kyiv. From 1945 to 1952 he was a Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of Ukrainian SSR. Welding research Paton was a pioneer researcher of joining and welding technology. In order to make welding a reliable technological process, it was necessary to conduct comprehensive research regarding the mechanics of welded structures, the metallurgical processes involved, and the physics of the arc, as well as to develop welding equipment, tools, and techniques. Paton created methods used in the design of rational bridge spans, investigated the conditions of their operation, and suggested methods for restoring damaged bridges. He carried out research on the fundamentals of welding, how to calculate the strength of welded structures, and the mechanization of welding processes. He supervised the development of automatic submerged arc welding. During World War II Paton supervised the design and production of equipment and technology for automated welding of special steels for tanks, bombs, and other military hardware. Paton Bridge, a fully welded steel construction, was built in Kyiv in 1953 using technology developed by Evgeny Paton. Paton supervised the wide implementation of welding in industry, including the design and production of assembly-line welding systems. He designed welded bridges and founded a domestic school of metal welding. Paton was awarded almost all of the highest Soviet government and scientific awards and prizes, and received the title of the Hero of Socialist Labour. External links * Biography at the E.O.

It is so named because it is just south of the border between North Carolina and South Carolina, and was the half way point to Florida from New York in the early days of motor travel. The area is themed in faux-Mexican style. The rest area contains restaurants, gas stations, a video arcade, and a motel, and truck stop as well as a small amusement park, a mini golf course, shopping and fireworks stores. Its mascot is Pedro, a caricature of a Mexican bandido. South of the Border is known for its roadside billboard advertisements, which begin many miles away from and incorporate a mileage countdown to the attraction itself. The stop has since fallen on hard times as more modern hotel areas have grown along I-95. Design The entire motif of South of the Border can be described as intentionally campy. South of the Border is located at the intersection of I-95 and US 301/US 501 just south of the border between South Carolina and North Carolina. The site is a compound that contains a miniature golf course, truck stop, 300-room motel, multiple souvenir shops, a campground, multiple restaurants, amusement rides, and a observation tower with a sombrero shaped observation deck. It is also home to \\"Reptile Lagoon\\", the largest indoor reptile exhibit in the US.http://www.thesouthoftheborder.com/2010/08/11/reptile-lagoon-south-of-the- borders-newest-attraction/ Architectural features include \\"a Jetsons-esque starburst chandelier\\" in the lobby and Mimetic. Pedro's Pleasure Dome is a swimming pool inside \\"a junkyard version\\" of a geodesic dome. A Washington Post review says, \\"[F]lashing signs ... throw technicolor pink and green and blue onto every surface. No destination or sentiment is too small to be blared out in bright orange.\\" Numerous large statues of animals such as dolphins, horses, dogs, gorillas and dinosaurs can be found. The Peddler Steakhouse, the nicest of the restaurants, is shaped like a sombrero, while the Mexican-themed Sombrero restaurant is not, though its d√©cor includes sombreros, cactus and terra cotta, with lots of lime green. There are areas that bring to mind the photography of William Eggleston, the cinematography of David Lynch, and the gas station art of Ed Ruscha. History South of the Border was developed by Alan Schafer in 1950. He had founded South of the Border Depot, a beer stand, at the location in 1949 adjacent to Robeson County which was, at one time, one of many dry North Carolina counties. Business was steadily expanded with Mexican trinkets and numerous kitsch items imported from Mexico. The site itself also began to expand to include a cocktail lounge, gas station and souvenir shop and, in 1954, a motel. In 1962, South of the Border expanded into fireworks sales, potentially capitalizing on the fact fireworks were illegal in North Carolina. In 1964 it was announced that the route for I-95 would pass right by South of the Border, and the facility would be next to two exits and within view of the highway. By the mid-1960s, South of the Border had expanded to include a barber shop, drug store, a variety store, a post office an outdoor go-kart track complete with other outdoor recreational facilities and the tall image of the mascot, Pedro. Over the years, the billboards with messages some considered racist and offensive changed to become tamer while still retaining the same tongue-in-cheek tone. Schafer continued to deny his attraction was racist, citing the fact that he was known for hiring African Americans, and even helping them to vote, and standing up to the Ku Klux Klan. About 300 people, mostly local employees, work at South of the Border. At one time, with 700 working there, it was the largest employer in Dillon County, South Carolina. Mascot Initially, Schafer only employed sombreros and serapes to advertise South of the Border. Schafer went to Mexico because of his import business and came back with two men he hired as bellboys, who people began calling Pedro and Pancho. From there, the Pedro mascot developed. Schafer eventually created Pedro, to add to the exotic element and theme of the attraction. Pedro is an exaggerated, cartoon-like representation of a Mexican bandit. Pedro wears a sombrero, a poncho and a large mustache. Minstrel shows were still popular in Dillon County in the 1940s and 1950s, at about the time Pedro was created and P. Nicole King argues Pedro embodies the way in which people exoticized Mexico or Mexicans at the time while also remaining intentionally campy. Pedro has likewise been referred to as culturally offensive, politically incorrect or racist. P. Nicole King described Pedro's image as a \\"southern Jewish guy in brown face\\" that was perhaps made, partially, in Schafer's image. Schafer himself had previously dismissed criticism that Pedro is an unfair characterization of Mexicans arguing it's a light-hearted joke. Today, all South of the Border employees, regardless of race, creed or color are referred to as Pedro. Pop culture American storyteller, radio and TV personality, Jean Shepherd began his TV movie, The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters, with a trip to South of the Border. He stops at a fireworks market called Fort Pedro, which leads him into the story of the most memorable Fourth of July during his childhood in the fictional town of Hohman, Indiana. The opening scene of Season 3, Episode 5 of Eastbound & Down shows characters Eduardo Sanchez Powers and Casper robbing a Mexican store leading the viewers to believe they were still in Mexico. The scene later reveals they were actually robbing the gift shop at South of the Border and are now traveling in the United States. Canadian Twitch streamer ProtonJon talks about South of the Border on the Disc Only Podcast with Tom Fawkes, Stephen Georg, and 8BitDrummer, where the latter two reminiscence about their experiences at the attraction.

Retrieved September 12, 2009. In its daily form, Channel Chuckles is a single-panel gag on the general theme of television, or specifically relating to a popular television series or TV commercial. The Sunday version of Channel Chuckles consists of several unrelated spot gags in color. Most of the Channel Chuckles gags are simple wordplay references to the titles of contemporary television programs. For example, one gag shows a small TV set on top of a larger TV set, each of them displaying on its screen the title of a current TV sitcom. While the upper TV set showed Love on a Rooftop, the one underneath blared Hey, Landlord!. One Channel Chuckles gag is a caricature of Mr. Spock from Star Trek receiving letters requesting advice on child-rearing (a reference to Doctor Benjamin Spock). Another Channel Chuckles gag depicts a mad scientist working in his laboratory while a nearby television intones the slogan of a current DuPont ad campaign: \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\". Another familiar slogan is lampooned in a panel showing a little boy watching a General Electric commercial while his father says, \\"And progress is our most important product. Do your homework!\\" Keane would sometimes subdivide the narrow space allotted to his Channel Chuckles feature in order to squeeze in two panels. One two-panel gag is based on the titles of two then-current TV series. In the first panel, a man asks his wife \\"Why can't you be more like that show?\\" while pointing to a TV set as it displays the title Occasional Wife. In the second panel, the wife points to the same TV while asking her husband \\"And why can't you be more like that show?\\". Her TV screen showed the title The Man Who Never Was. Some gags feature \\"Aunt Tenna\\", a matronly woman with her hair done in the form of a TV antenna, who spends all of her time watching television or engaged in TV-related activities. The other recurring character in Channel Chuckles is \\"Dim Viewer\\", a grumpy old man who always has something negative to say about television programming, commercials or reception. Other gags poke fun at the genre of mother-daughter look-alikes television commercials of the late 1960s, such as the Grape-Nuts look-alikes, Mrs. Burke and her daughter Dale.

He explained that when the CDC's Division of Select Agents and Toxins detects possible SAP misconduct by an HHS worker, it coordinates with the OIG to gather facts; if it concludes that a civil violation might have occurred, it turns the case over to the OIG for possible enforcement. But if it suspects a crime, it pursues the matter with the FBI. Since passage of the Bioterrorism Act of 2002, the OIG had received 68 referrals from the CDC for possible Select Agent enforcement and found violations in 30 of those cases.

This was a low-quality coal, unsuitable for most other purposes, and had mostly been disregarded previously. Its low sulfur content made it very suitable for power station use. The Upper Hirst coal is found within the Upper Limestone Group of strata, above the Limestone Coal Group, but below the Productive Coal Measures. The latter two groups of strata may be separated by up to 1,000 metres. In the Central Coal Field, which is in the form of a basin, the Productive Coal Measures, if they were ever deposited, have been lost by erosion except near the centre, where they outcrop near Alloa and Clackmannan, and have been mined until recently. The Limestone Coal Group of strata have been mined only around the edge of the basin, although in the 1950s there were plans for deep mines at Airth, where two large shafts were constructed to rockhead and then abandoned, and at Gartarry Toll, which was not begun. At Manor Powis, for example, the useful seams in the Limestone Coal Group were at a depth of about 400 metres, and included valuable anthracite; the Upper Hirst was above this and as well as being mined at mid-shaft in the old colliery, was reached by a pair of sloping adits constructed near the bank of the River Forth. The slope of the seam was followed for some distance down the dip of the basin, to the east. The Upper Hirst was initially mined experimentally at the site of Bannockburn colliery by a small drift mine, then at mid-shaft in Polmaise 3/4 (commonly called Fallin), Manor Powis, and later the drift mines at Dollar and Bogside, to supply Kincardine Power Station, but when Longannet Power Station was built, an innovative scheme was developed to mine the coal at Dollar, Castlehill and Solsgirth, and bring the coal from Solsgirth, Bogside and Castlehill to the surface by conveyor at Longannet, immediately adjacent to the power station. Bogside, on the eastern extremity of the basin, could access the coal at no great depth, and it was worked down the dip to the west, via a large, deep shaft at Castlehill, which was latterly used for personnel access, the coal all emerging at Longannet, except that from Dollar, which due to faulting could not be economically linked to the main conveyor system. This scheme was a great success, although the focus of mining shifted to the south as the Dollar basin was exhausted. Eventually coal was being extracted from south of the River Forth, and there were adequate reserves to last for at least the predicted lifetime of Longannet Power Station. A disastrous flood on 23 March 2002 terminated production of the Upper Hirst coal, and brought deep mining in Scotland to an end. The source of the flooding was allegedly the failure of a dam constructed to keep water which accumulated in the old workings to the north out of the working part of the mine, but there are substantial gaps in the known facts. A local mine manager claimed that the water, about 20 million gallons (a small amount in mining terms) could be pumped out for ¬£55,000, which is probably much less than the redundancy payments to the approximately 200 staff when the company went into receivership in indecent haste. The investigation by HM Inspectorate of Mines is thorough and meticulous, but does not conceal the fact that nothing has been proved about what really happened underground. Meanwhile, many tens of millions of tons of Upper Hirst coal remain inaccessible, the water level has reached the now closed adit entrance at Longannet, and the UK imported large quantities of foreign coal to burn in Longannet Power Station until its closure in 2016. History One of the few successful early workings of the Upper Hirst also ended in a flood. The eastern outcrop was mined by Sir George Bruce, using methods technically advanced for the time, such as a horse-powered bucket and chain pumping system. But the finest achievement was the Moat Pit, a shaft (actually two concentric shafts, for ventilation) constructed in an artificial island in the River Forth, where ships could directly load coal from the mine. On one occasion the mine was visited by King James, who entered from the shore and emerged on the artificial island. But in a great storm on 30 March 1625, coinciding with high tide, the colliery was flooded. Sir George Bruce died later that year, and no attempt was made to rescue the colliery.

Origins The name bullarium seems to have been invented by the canonist Laertius Cherobini who in 1586 published under the title \\"Bullarium, sive Collectio diversarum Constitutionum multorum Pontificum\\". It was a large folio volume of 1404 pages containing 922 papal constitutions from Gregory VII down to Sixtus V, the pope then reigning. With regard to this and all subsequent collections, three things have carefully to be borne in mind. First, whatever may have been the intrinsic importance or binding force of any of the bulls so published, the selection itself was a matter that depended entirely upon the arbitrary choice of the various editors. As a collection the publication had no official character. The only recognized exception to this assertion is the first volume of a collection of his own bulls which was sent by Benedict XIV in 1746 to the University of Bologna to serve as a fons iuris, or source of legal principles. Secondly, it was never seriously maintained, despite some pretentious title pages, that these collections were in any sense complete, or that they even contained all the constitutions of more general interest. Thirdly, it was the intention of the editors, at least at first, rather to exclude than to include the papal pronouncements which had already been incorporated into the text of canon law. The avowed object of the early collections was to render assistance to canonists by bringing within their reach papal enactments which either had been overlooked by the compilers of the \\"corpus\\" or which had been issued subsequently to the latest decrees included in it. Various collections of relatively recent papal constitutions were published in the early part of the sixteenth century. A typical specimen of such booklets is supplied by a rare little volume of sixty-two pages printed at Rome per Stephanum Guillereti in regione Parionis 1509, a copy of which is in the British Museum Library. A contribution of more substantial volume appears to have been a volume edited by Mazzutellus in 1579 which contained 723 documents. But it is to Laertius Cherubini that the credit is usually given of creating the bullarium in substance as well as in name. In the preface to the volume of which the title has already been given, the editor refers to his experiences in the ecclesiastical courts of Rome. In these courts I have noticed (he says) that certain advocates and judges went completely astray because they had not at hand the text of those apostolic constitutions a knowledge of which is most necessary in treating and pronouncing upon causes, seeing that in such constitutions is embodied the whole of the most recent pontifical law. After this explanation it is not surprising to find that out of Cherubini's 922 documents more than 800 were of recent date, that is to say they belonged to the hundred years immediately preceding the appearance of the volume. Of this collection, a second edition in three volumes, was printed at Rome in 1617, and a third edition in four volumes extending in this case from Leo I to Urban VIII, was prepared by the editor's son, Angelo Cherubini, in 1638, with a supplement added in 1659. Other editions followed, always somewhat enlarged. The fifth in six volumes was brought out by two Franciscans at Rome, 1669‚Äì72. The Luxembourg Bullarium Moreover, a fuller but not more accurate reprint with supplementary volumes appeared in the eighteenth century, nominally at Luxembourg, although the actual place of impression is said to have been Geneva. Of this edition, which is one of the most commonly met with in libraries, the first eight volumes coming down to Benedict XVIII all bear the date 1727, while a ninth and tenth volume, supplementing the earlier portion, appeared in 1730. Other supplements followed at intervals. Four volumes were published in 1741 covering respectively the periods 1670‚Äì89, 1689‚Äì1721, 1721‚Äì30, 1730‚Äì40. In the same series, and still later, we have the following volumes: XV (1748), extending over 1734‚Äì40; XVI (1752) 1740‚Äì45; XVII (1753), 1746‚Äì49; XVIII (1754), 1748‚Äì52; XIX (1758), 1752‚Äì57. The last four volumes are entirely taken up with the Bulls of Benedict XIV. This Luxembourg edition appears to have been in part the source of the great confusion which is to be found in many accounts of the subject, notably in the article \\"Bullaire\\" in the Dictionnaire de theologie catholique. It is not quite true, as has sometimes been supposed, that the \\"Luxembourg\\" editors contributed nothing of their own to the collection. For example, in Vol. IX (1730) we have two bulls of the English pope, Adrian IV, printed from the originals at Geneva with engraved facsimiles of the rota and the leaden bulla, and in fact the whole of the content of Vols. IX and X represent a large measure of independent research. The later volumes of the series, however, have simply been copied from the Roman edition next to be mentioned. Mainardi's Roman Bullarium This Roman edition of the bullarium, which still remains the most accurate and practically useful, bears on the title pages of its thirty-two volumes, the name of the publisher, Girolamo Mainardi, while the dedications to the cardinals prefixed to the different volumes and extending from 1733 to 1762 are also signed by him. The arrangement of the volumes, however, is peculiar, and the neglect to indicate these peculiarities has made the accounts given to this edition in most bibliographies almost unintelligible. Mainardi began with the idea of printing a supplement to the latest Roman edition of Cherubini's bullarium. As this was six volumes and stopped short at the pontificate of Clement X (1670‚Äì76), Mainardi called his first published volume Tome VII, and reprinted the bulls of Clement X from the beginning of his pontificate to his death. Moreover, an engraved frontispiece prefixed to this volume, printed in 1733, bears the words \\"Bullarium Romanum Tom. VII.\\" The book further contains a promise that the six volumes of Cherubini's bullarium should in the course of time be reprinted in a corrected and enlarged form, with the aid of the documents contained in the secret archives of the Holy See. Seven other volumes followed in sequence to this first. They were printed from 1734 to 1744 and brought the collection from Clement X in 1670 to the accession of Benedict XIV in 1740. Meanwhile, the publisher had engaged an able scholar, Charles Cocquelines, to re-edit the six volumes of Cherubini's bullarium from Leo I to Clement X. In his hands an immense mass of material accumulated. The first volume was printed in 1739 and it bore a slightly different title from that of the installment which Mainardi had already published, beginning at \\"Tom VII.\\" Cocquelines' section was headed \\"Bullarium privilegarium ac diplomatum Romanorum Pontificum amplissima collectio\\" and in comparison with Cherubini's meager gleanings from antiquity the epithet amplissima was fully deserved. This series, like all good work, advanced very slowly. A tabular arrangement will best show the details. The editor had to make his numbering correspond with Cherubini's six volumes and consequently some of the nominal tomi of the new edition were divided into several parts. Some time before the compilation of this series, Cocquelines had died, and the last five volumes to appear did not bear his name. Simultaneously with this amplified edition of Cherubini, Mainardi had also been publishing, in folio, but somewhat smaller, the four volumes of the bullarium of Benedict XIV, the first of which, as already noted, appeared with that pontiff's own authentication. In sum, the whole collection which issued from Mainardi's press amounted to thirty-two folio volumes and extended from Leo I in 450 to the death of Benedict XIV, 1758. As this in time grew antiquated, Andrew Barberi began in 1835 the publication of the Bulls of Pope Clement XIII and his successors \\"Bullarii Romani Continuato\\" (19 volumes, fol.), Rome, 1835‚Äì57. These came down to the fourth year of Gregory XVI, i.e. to 1834. There is also another series of the same kind which appeared as a continuation of the Bullarium of Benedict XIV at Prato in 1843‚Äì67 (10 vols., folio). The Turin Bullarium Finally, a large quarto edition of the bullarium was begun at Turin under the auspices of Cardinal Gaudi in 1857, edited by Tomasetti. It claims to be more comprehensive, better printed, and better arranged than the work of Cocquelines, but the additions made are insignificant and the typographical errors are numerous. Moreover, among the documents added, especially in Appendix I (1867), are included some whose authenticity is more than doubtful. At Turin, twenty-two volumes were printed (1857‚Äì72) down to Clement XII and five more, continuing the work to the end of Benedict XIV, were added at Naples (1867‚Äì85). Particular Bullaria Bullaria have been compiled collecting the papal documents relating to a religious order, institution or locality. For example, eight volumes have recently been published by R. de Martinis under the title \\"Jus Pontificium de Propaganda Fide\\" (Rome, 1888‚Äì98). This is in substance the bullarium of the Congregation of Propaganda brought up to date. Similarly, an exhaustive collection or rather calendar of early papal documents concerning the churches of Italy has been undertaken by P. F. Kehr under the title \\"Italia Pontificia\\" (Berlin 1906). The expense is defrayed by the Gottinger Academy. Of the more important religious orders, nearly all have at some time or other collected their privileges in print. Among the most extensive of such compilations, which formerly often went by the name \\"Mare Magnum\\" (the Great Ocean) may be mentioned the Bullarium of the Dominicans, edited by Ripoll and Br√©mond (eight vols., Rome, 1729‚Äì40); that of the Franciscans, edited by Sbaralea (4 vols., Rome, 1758‚Äì80), with a more modern continuation by Eubel, (3 vols., Rome, 1897‚Äì1904); that of the Capuchins (7 vols., Rome, 1740‚Äì52); that of the Benedictines of Monte Cassino (2 vols., Venice, 1650). All the volumes mentioned here were folios, mostly of considerable bulk. Historically speaking, the most interesting papal volumes are often those contained in the \\"Regesta\\" which have never been included in the general Bullarium. Since the archives of the Vatican were thrown open to students by Leo XIII in 1883, immense labor has been spent upon the copying and publication of the Bulls contained in the \\"Regesta.\\" but even before this date, facilities for research were not infrequently accorded. Many hundreds of copies of documents relating to Great Britain were made for the British Government by Marino de Marinis in the early part of the nineteenth century and are now preserved in the British Museum. In 1873 the Reverend Joseph Stevenson was sent to Rome for a similar purpose and transcripts made by him during four years' residence may be consulted at the Record Office, London. Since then, Messrs Bliss and Tenlow have been engaged in the same task and have published at the expense of the British Government seven volumes of a \\"Calendar of Entries in the Papal Register illustrating the History of Great Britain and Ireland.\\" These are primarily papal letters, and they extend from the beginning of the thirteenth to the middle of the fifteenth century. The members of the Ecole Fran√ßaise de Rome have been equally active, with the publication of the \\"regesta\\" of various pontificates, mostly of the thirteenth century. Those of * Honorius IV (1285‚Äì87), * Nicolaus IV (1288‚Äì92), * Benedict XI (1304‚Äì04) have been published and are complete. Those of * Innocent IV (1243‚Äì54), * Urban IV (1261‚Äì64), * Clement VI (1265‚Äì68) are all but complete; while great progress has been made with those of * Gregory X and John XXI (1271‚Äì77), * Nicolaus III (1271‚Äì80), * Martin IV (1281‚Äì85), * Boniface VIII (1291‚Äì03), * Gregory IX (1227‚Äì41), and * Alexander IV (1254‚Äì61). Besides these, the \\"Regesta\\" of Clement V (1305‚Äì1314) have been published by the Benedictines in nine volumes folio at the cost of Leo XIII, and those of John XXII (1316‚Äì34), as far as they relate to France, are being printed by A. Coulon, while those of the other Avignon popes are also in hand. The Regesta of Innocent III and his successor Honorius III have long been printed, and they are among the last volumes printed in the Patrology of Migne. Finally among local bullaria we may mentioned the considerable collections published some time ago by Augustin Theiner for various countries under the general heading of \\"Vetera Monumenta.\\" With regard to the early centuries, where no originals of official copies exist to which we can make appeal, the task of distinguishing genuine from spurious papal letters becomes exceedingly delicate. The collection of Dom Coustant, \\"Epistolae Romanorum Pontificorum\\" (Paris, 1721), is of the highest value, but the compiler only lived to carry his work down to the year 440, and A. Thiele, who continued it, brought it no further than 553. Some further help has been provided by Hampe, regarding the papal letters to Charlemagne and to Louis the Pious, and by Herth-Gerenth for Sergius II. For practical purposes the chief court of appeal for an opinion on all papal documents is the \\"Regesta Pontificorum Romanorum\\" of Philipp Jaff√©, much improved in its second edition by its editors, Wattenbach, Ewald, Kalterbrunner, and L√∂wenfeld. In this a brief synopsis of given of all existing papal documents known to be in existence, from the time of Peter to that of Innocent III (1198), with indications of the collections in which they have been printed and with an appendix dealing with spurious documents. This has been continued by August Potthast to the year 1304 (2 vols., Berlin). It may be added that compendiums have also been published of the \\"Bullarium Romanum\\" as printed in the eighteenth century. Of these the most valuable is probably that of Guerra \\"Pontificarium Constitutionem in Bullario Magno contentarum Epitome\\" (4 vols., Venice, 1772), which possesses a very complete and useful index. Commentaries on the bullarium or on large portions of it have been published by the Jesuit J. B. Scortia (Lyons, 1625), by the Dominican, M. de Gregorio (Naples, 1648), and by Cardinal Vincent Petra (Rome, 1705‚Äì26). Finally, attention may be called to the bulls contained in volume edited by Galante, \\"Fontes Juris Canonici\\" (Innsbruck, 1906).

It was based on ARPANET technology. History Project plan for creating the Defense Data Network, as envisioned by the Defense Science Board, December 1982 As an experiment, from 1971‚Äì1977, the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) purchased and operated an ARPANET-type system from BBN Technologies for the Prototype WWMCCS Intercomputer Network (PWIN). The experiments proved successful enough that it became the basis of the much larger WIN system. Six initial WIN sites in 1977 increased to 20 sites by 1981.\\"ARPANET\\", DARPA Technical Accomplishments: An Historical Review of DARPA Projects, vol. 1, Chapter 20, by Sidney G. Reed, Richard H. Van Atta, and Seymore J. Deitchman, IDA Paper P-2192, 1990. In 1975, the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) took over operation of the ARPANET as it became an operational tool in addition to an ongoing research project. At that time, the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN), carried most of the Defense Department's message traffic. Starting in 1972, attempts had been made to introduce some packet switching into its planned replacement, AUTODIN II.IDA Paper P-2192. AUTODIN II development proved unsatisfactory, however, and in 1982, AUTODIN II was canceled, to be replaced by a combination of several packet-based networks that would connect military installations. The DCA used \\"Defense Data Network\\" (DDN) as the program name for this new network. Under its initial architecture, as developed by the Institute for Defense Analysis, the DDN would consist of two separate instances: the unclassified MILNET, which would be split off the ARPANET; and a classified network, also based on ARPANET technology, which would provide services for WIN, DODIIS, and SACDIN.IDA Paper P-2192, page 20-18. C/30 packet switches, developed by BBN Technologies as upgraded Interface Message Processors, would provide the network technology. End-to-end encryption would be provided by ARPANET encryption devices, namely the Internet Private Line Interface (IPLI) or Blacker.IDA Paper P-2192, page 20-18. After MILNET was split away, the ARPANET would continue be used as an Internet backbone for researchers, but be slowly phased out. Both networks carried unclassified information, and were connected at a small number of points which would allow total separation in the event of an emergency. As a large-scale, private internet, the DDN provided Internet Protocol connectivity across the United States and to US military bases abroad.Corrigan, M., \\"Defense Data Network Protocols\\", Proceedings, EASCON 82, 1982. The Defense Communications Engineering Center (DCEC), part of DCA, handled DDN network engineering and DDN network operations. The DCEC was located in Reston, Virginia from the mid-1980s until it was closed and merged with a DISA site in Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia in the early 2000s (long after DCA had been merged into the new Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)). Throughout the 1980s it expanded as a set of four parallel military networks, each at a different security level. The networks were: * Military Network (MILNET) for Unclassified traffic * Defense Secure Network One (DSNET 1) for Secret traffic * Defense Secure Network Two (DSNET 2) for Top Secret traffic * Defense Secure Network Three (DSNET 3) for Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) MILNET and DSNET 1 were common user networks, much like the public Internet, but DSNET 2 was dedicated to supporting the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) and DSNET 3 was dedicated to supporting the DOD Intelligence Information System (DODIIS). These networks transitioned to become the NIPRNET, SIPRNET, and JWICS networks in the 1990s. DDN-NIC DDN-NIC or Network Information Center (NIC) was located at the DDN Installation and Integration Support (DIIS) program office in Chantilly, Virginia. It provided general reference services to DDN users via telephone, electronic mail, and U.S. mail. It was the first organization responsible for the assignment of TCP/IP addresses and Autonomous System numbers.

The abbey church is part of the Romanesque Road scenic route. History The monastery was founded upon the death of King Henry the Fowler in 936 by the Saxon count Siegfried of Merseburg, brother of Margrave Gero the Great, and his second wife Guthia (Jutta) at their residence on the Bode river. Its first monks were sent by Volkmar I, abbot of Corvey, of which Gr√∂ningen was a priory. It was vested with extended estates in the Saxon Harzgau, which later became part of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt. After the last Catholic provost retired from office in 1542, the priory was dissolved in the course of the Protestant Reformation. The monks took the relics with them back to Corvey, the Gr√∂ningen lands were leased, and large parts of the monastery complex were demolished. A building of particular interest is the preserved monastery church of Saint Vitus, set on a slight eminence. It was dedicated on St Vitus' Day in 940 by Abbot Volkmar of Corvey and from about 1070 re-built in the style of Hirsau Abbey as a Romanesque basilica with three aisles and a number of features of architectural interest. Of particular note is the very unusual octagonal crossing tower, similar to Armenian architecture, and the relief of Christ Pantocrator on a balustrade from the 12th century, a copy whose original is kept at the sculpture collection of the Bode Museum in Berlin.

Morris Ernst was Jewish.Langer, ‚ÄúThese 16 Jewish Heroes Rescued Books From The Jaws Of The Censors‚Äù. The Forward, Sep 22, 2019 Background Morris Leopold Ernst was born in Uniontown, Alabama, on August 23, 1888, to Carl and Sarah Bernheim Ernst. His father, born in what is now Czechoslovakia, worked as a peddler and shopkeeper. His mother graduated from Hunter College. The family moved to New York when Morris was two, and lived in several locations in Manhattan.Whitman, Alden, ‚ÄúMorris Ernst, ‚ÄòUlysses‚Äô‚Äù. The New York Times, May 23, 1976, p. 40. He attended the Horace Mann School and graduated from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, in 1909. He studied law at night at New York Law School where he graduated in 1912 and was admitted to the New York bar in 1913. Career Ernst practiced law in New York City and in 1915 co-founded the law firm of Greenbaum, Wolff & Ernst. He joined the board of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 1927 and was one of the most prominent and successful ACLU attorneys from the 1920s through the 1960s. From 1929 to 1954, he shared the title of general counsel at the ACLU with Arthur Garfield Hays. He became vice chairman of the ACLU's board in 1955. In 1933, on behalf of Random House, he successfully defended James Joyce's novel Ulysses against obscenity charges, leading to its distribution in the U.S.TIME: A Welcome to Ulysses\\", December 18, 1933 He won similar cases on behalf of Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness and Arthur Schnitzler's Casanova's Homecoming.Sherri Machlin, \\"Banned Books Week: The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall\\", New York Public Library, September 26, 2013. In 1937, as attorney for the American Newspaper Guild, he argued successfully in the Supreme Court that it should uphold the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) as applied to the press. The case established the right of media employees to organize labor unions. Ernst was a strong supporter of J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI. In 1940, as head of the ACLU, he agreed to bar communists from employment there and even discouraged their membership, basing his position on a distinction between the rights of the individual and the rights of groups. In 1946, President Harry Truman appointed him to the President's Committee on Civil Rights. He counted Justice Louis Brandeis as a close friend and later had close personal relationships with Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and New York Governor Herbert Lehman. Besides politicians, he also was friendly with many cultural figures, including Edna Ferber, E. B. White, Groucho Marx, Michael Foot, Compton Mackenzie, Al Capp, Charles Addams, Grandma Moses, Heywood Broun, and Margaret Bourke-White. In 1956, Jes√∫s Gal√≠ndez, a critic of the regime of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, disappeared, abducted from New York City, it was charged, by Trujillo's agents. Hired by Trujillo to investigate the affair, Ernst's resulting report cleared the Trujillo regime of involvement in Galindez's disappearance, but the FBI and the press remained unconvinced.TIME: \\"Whitewash for Trujillo\\", June 9, 1958 Personal life In 1912, he married Susan Leerburger, with whom he had a son (who died in infancy) and a daughter. Susan died in 1922. Ernst married Margaret Samuels in 1923, and together they had a son and a daughter. Margaret died in 1964. Ernst kept a summer home on Nantucket, Massachusetts, and enjoyed sailing small boats. He died at home in New York City on May 21, 1976. He was survived by his son, both daughters, and five grandchildren.

The Pomeranchuk instability, the pomeron, and a few other phenomena in particle and condensed matter physics are named after him. Life and career Pomeranchuk's mother was a medical doctor and his father a chemical engineer. The family moved from his birthplace, Warsaw, first to Rostov-on-Don in 1918 and then Donbass in the village of Rubezhno in 1923, where his father worked at a chemical plant. He graduated from school in 1927 and from a factory and workshop school in 1929. From 1929-31, he also worked at a chemical plant. In 1931, he left for the Ivanovo Institute of Chemical Technology and then in 1932 joined the Department of Physics and Mechanics of the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute under Alexander Shalnikov, specialising in chemical physics and graduating in 1936. He had begun working at the Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology under Lev Landau the previous year, and remained a devoted collaborator with Landau. His first paper, in Nature, was published with Landau and Aleksander Akhiezer, entitled 'Scattering of light by light'. After Landau moved to the Kapitza institute in Moscow (to avoid arrest for comparing Stalinism to Nazism), Pomeranchuk also moved there, working for the tanning industry. He returned to Leningrad in 1938, lecturing, completing his Ph.D. and becoming employed as a junior scientist. He joined the Lebedev Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in Moscow as a senior scientist in 1940. In 1941 the institute was evacuated to Kazan. Under Abraham Alikhanov, he studied cosmic rays in Armenia from 1942. In 1943, he transferred to Laboratory No.2 under Igor Kurchatov as part of the Soviet project to develop nuclear weapons. Alikhanov founded Laboratory No.3 (which became the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP)) and Pomeranchuk worked there from 1946 (and for the rest of his life), founding and leading the Theoretical department, as well as being Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Moscow Mechanical Institute where students admired his infectious enthusiasm for his subject. Rudolf Peierls was consoled by the fact that it was \\"very clever Pomeranchuk\\" - and no-one else - who corrected his 1/T law for heat conduction in high-temperature condensed matter physics. His work in the 1940s was dominated by neutron research and his manuscript with Akhiezer was the basic guide for Soviet nuclear reactor construction. In 1950, he published a paper suggesting that the entropy of helium-3 as a liquid was less than as a solid. In 1950, Pomeranchuk received an order from Josef Stalin to go to Arzamas-16, located in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region, to work on Soviet nuclear weaponry. Missing his family and his 'hobby physics' problems, he was advised not to apply for a revocation but wait until the order was \\"forgotten.\\" He returned to ITEP within a year. He continued enthusiastically with work on quantum field theory and S-matrix theory, particle collisions and Regge theory, the latter in vigorous collaboration with Vladimir Gribov. His last paper on Regge theory was published posthumously. For his work, Pomeranchuk was twice awarded the Stalin Prize (1950, 1952). He was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1953 and full member in 1964. In 1965 he was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus and underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although it was too late for his own treatment, he arranged for physicists from ITEP and the scientific research town of Dubna (which he had visited many times) to work together and with radiologists to commence proton- beam therapy research. He continued to practice physics during this time but died the following year. The first medical proton beam began at ITEP in 1969. Awards and legacy * 1950, 1952: Stalin Prize, Order of Lenin. A number of phenomena bear his name: * Pomeron: named after Pomeranchuk by Vladimir Gribov and indicating a particular trajectory in Regge theory (the name 'Pomeranchuk trajectory' was made at the suggestion of Murray Gell-Mann). * Landau‚ÄìPomeranchuk‚ÄìMigdal effect: a reduction in 'bremsstrahlung' and pair production in particle collisions. * Pomeranchuk's theorem: compares particle and antiparticle collision cross sections. * Pomeranchuk cooling: unique cooling of liquid helium-3 under pressure. * Pomeranchuk instability: a deformation of a material's Fermi surface between interacting fermions. * Pomeranchuk Prize: awarded from 1998 for outstanding work in theoretical physics.

Under the leadership of founder and president Michael Weinstein, AHF has since 2015 become highly active in sponsoring ballot initiatives in multiple states, exclusively financing multiple high profile campaigns, including two measures seeking to cap prescription drug prices (California Proposition 61 (2016) and Ohio Issue 2 (2017)), as well as one seeking to block local development in Los Angeles (2017 Los Angeles Measure S), and one seeking to introduce rent control in California (2018 California Proposition 10), all of which failed at the polls.See the section: Ballot_initiatives for more information and sources. History= Early years: AIDS Hospice Foundation and Chris Brownlie Hospice  In 1987, activists Chris Brownlie, Michael Weinstein,Michael Weinstein - The C.E.O. of H.I.V. \\"The New York Times Magazine\\", April 26, 2017 Sharon Raphael, PhD, Mina Meyer, \\"Los Angeles Times Obituaries - Mina Kay Meyer\\", Published from Aug. 1 to Aug. 7, 2016 MA, and other advocates were among the earliest champions of the AIDS hospice movement as co-founders of the Los Angeles AIDS Hospice Committee, the catalyst organization which gave rise to the AIDS Hospice Foundation and, ultimately, to today's AIDS Healthcare Foundation. \\"AHF Timeline 1983 to 1999\\" As members of the inaugural AIDS Hospice Committee, Brownlie, Weinstein, Myer, Raphael, Paul Coleman and others were involved with the planning and negotiations for the opening of Chris Brownlie Hospice on the grounds of the Barlow Respiratory Hospital. In those early years, following an emotional plea for hospice care to the Los Angeles County Commission on AIDSLos Angeles County Commission on AIDS (HIV), Official Government Website and a protest and picketing of then-Supervisor Mike Antonovich's home, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors eventually committed $2 million to AIDS care. The group began converting a facility in Elysian Park that had been Barlow's old nursing quarters into Chris Brownlie Hospice ‚Äîthe County's first AIDS hospice‚Äîwhich was named in Brownlie's honor when it first opened December 26, 1988. Meyer, who also served as Treasurer of the AIDS Hospice Committee, was honored in 1987 by the Los Angeles AIDS Hospice Committee with its 'Heart of Gold Award' for her early work in the effort to formulate AIDS hospice care in Los Angeles. The 25-bed hospice‚Äîthe first of three operated by AHF, including the Carl Bean House and Linn House, which opened in 1992 and 1995, respectively‚Äîprovided 24-hour medical and palliative care to people living through the final stages of AIDS. Brownlie died at the age of 39, on November 26, 1989, \\"Los Angeles Times Archives - Chris Brownlie; Crusader for AIDS Care, Hospices\\", November 29, 1989 less than a year after the hospice named in his honor first opened, survived by his father, sister, brothers, his longtime partner, Phil Wilson and countless friends and fellow AIDS activists. In addition to Brownlie, over 1,000 people had been given dignified, specialized, compassionate final care at the Chris Brownlie Hospice by the time it ended hospice operations in September 1996. The building that housed the Brownlie Hospice went through its own rebirths, housing various departments of AHF, including the headquarters for AHF's Public Health Division, before the organization officially turned the property back over to the City of Los Angeles with a sunset memorial ceremony on January 26, 2013.\\"LA‚Äôs First AIDS Hospice Returned To City In Memorial Service\\", January 26, 2013  AIDS Hospice Foundation becomes AIDS Healthcare Foundation  As medical opportunities for managing HIV became more available, AHF changed its mission to helping individuals with HIV/AIDS live well with the disease through advanced medical care. This shift was marked with the change of the Foundation's name to AIDS Healthcare Foundation in July 1990.  AIDS Healthcare Foundation Today  AHF operates the Out of the Closet thrift store chain. AHF acquired the MOMS Pharmacy chain of pharmacies in 2012, and in 2013, rebranded the chain as AHF Pharmacy. AHF sponsored HIV awareness themed Rose Parade floats in 2012 and 2013, each winning the Queen's Trophy for best use of roses. AHF produced the documentary film Keep The Promise: The Global Fight Against AIDS, depicting the AHF sponsored protest of government anti-HIV funding levels and anti-HIV drug prices at the XIX International AIDS Conference, 2012. The film premiered on March 29, 2013 at the Vail Film Festival. Advocacy for reducing drug prices  At a Washington, DC press conference in February 2002, AHF President Michael Weinstein addressed exorbitant drug prices by GlaxoSmithKline pharmaceutical company (GSK). AHF filed suit against GSK in July in a Los Angeles federal court to protest antitrust and patent violations regarding GSK's antiviral drugs AZT, 3TC and Ziagen. AHF amended its lawsuit against GSK in November 2002 to include a request that the drug company's patents be invalidated so U.S. residents can take advantage of cheaper, generic versions. In February 2003, GSK cuts the cost of Trizivir and Combivir in developing countries by as much as 90 percent. In February 2004, AHF filed an antitrust and restraint of trade lawsuit against pharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories concerning its drug prices and policies on its key AIDS drug, Norvir (ritonavir) and its subsequent derivative drug, Kaletra. In December 2003, Abbott announced an unprecedented 400% price hike for Norvir, while leaving the price of Kaletra‚Äîwhich has Norvir as a significant component‚Äîunchanged. In August 2005, AHF criticized drug manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim for pricing its latest AIDS drug Aptivus (tipranavir), at $13,000 a year, the highest price for a protease inhibitor of its time. In November 2006, AHF asked Indian anti-HIV drug manufacturer Cipla to reduce the price of its combination drug Viraday from its launch price of about Rs 62,000 per year. Cipla CEO Y. K. Hamied cited taxes and custom duties on raw materials as reasons for the high price, but agreed to a price cut. In January 2007, AHF filed suit in Los Angeles over Pfizer's direct-to-consumer marketing of Viagra, accusing Pfizer of promoting off-label, recreational use of Viagra, and suggesting a link between Viagra, methamphetamine, and unsafe sex. Pfizer denied AHF's claims, and mentioned that AHF had recently asked Pfizer to fund an educational program about meth. In August 2007, AHF began purchasing full-page ads in Indian newspapers accusing Cipla of overpricing. According to AHF, a year's worth of Viraday cost Rs 54,000 when sold in India, but only Rs 21,000 when exported to Africa. Some NGOs declined to join AHF in criticizing Cipla's drug prices, citing a potential conflict of interest: Cipla's opposition to the patent application for Viread, a component of Viraday, filed by AHF contributor Gilead Sciences. Gilead denied involvement in AHF's complaint, and an AHF regional chief stated that AHF also opposed Gilead's patent application for Viread. After months of AHF campaigning against Cipla, the company is brought under investigation by the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission (MRTPC) and moves to reduce the price of Viraday and Efavir in India by 15%. In March 2008, AHF petitioned drug manufacturers including Abbot, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol- Myers Squibb, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Pfizer, Roche and Tibotec to freeze the price of their HIV drugs in the U.S, stating that as a result of regular drug price increases \\"HIV/AIDS assistance programs will essentially be flat funded and unable to provide access to additional people in need of lifesaving drugs.\\" In June, the organization applauded decisions by Boehringer Ingelheim and Gilead Sciences to freeze prices on antiretroviral medications purchased by government agencies. In September 2013, AHF filed a lawsuit in California against GSK alleging that the company \\"...failed to fully satisfy its obligations with respect to discounts for drugs it sold to AIDS Healthcare Foundation over a period of many years,\\" under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, a federal drug discount program designed to stretch scarce federal resources as far as possible for community healthcare providers such as AHF.  Global healthcare and events = Clinics  AHF currently serves 1,355,493 people in 45 countries through global clinics offering HIV testing, antiretroviral and other HIV/AIDS prevention, and treatment services. South Africa became home to AHF's first treatment center outside of the U.S. with the establishment of the Ithembalabantu (People's Hope) clinic in the Durban township of Umlazi in 2002 through a partnership with the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health. A second site was opened in 2008 in Middledrift, Easter Cape Province. Through these sites, AHF South Africa offers comprehensive HIV and tuberculosis testing, treatment and care. Nationwide services include antiretroviral medication, CD4 testing, lab monitoring, treatment of opportunistic infections, on-site pharmacy services, distribution of free condoms to the public, and community outreach programs to test the population for HIV and link those who test positive into care. AHF operates a total of 34 clinics in the Durban and Eastern Cape provinces, and in May 2014 AHF broke ground on K Clinic, the first South African AHF clinic to be built from the ground up. AHF's other worldwide clinics span Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, the U.S., and Latin America.  World AIDS Day  Each year on December 1, AHF celebrates World AIDS Day with a series of international events. In 2014, AHF hosted over 160 World AIDS Day events in twenty-eight countries, including the U.S., to promote testing and treatment for HIV/AIDS. International events promoted AHF's 20X20 campaign, a global initiative to have 20 million people living with HIV linked to medical care and on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) by December 31, 2020. The King and Queen of Lesotho attended AHF's event in their country that year. Each World AIDS Day event has a unifying theme, though events in each country are adapted to the local setting with a specific focus on the populations most impacted in the respective regions.  International Condom Day  AHF is a large proponent of condom use in preventing HIV/AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases. International Condom Day, created by AHF, promotes an increased focus on access to condoms in conjunction with the convenient, free Rapid Testing and the Universal Access to anti-retroviral treatment as the integral components of the global fight against HIV/AIDS. Since the inception of the LOVE Condom campaign in 2008, AHF-branded LOVE Condoms have gained popularity across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America. Each year AHF and its partners commemorate the International Condom Day on February 13 with LOVE Condoms events such as marches and public outreach.  International Women's Day  On International Women's Day, March 8, 2016, AHF hosted events and activities in 12 countries throughout Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Americas. While the official theme for International Women's Day 2016 was \\"Pledge for Parity,\\" AHF encouraged teams in each participating country to adopt their own tagline tailored to their particular message. Nigeria's tagline was \\"For Women by Women,\\" designating a day on which HIV-positive women participated in a series of activities championing positive living and reminding them they are not alone. AHF's other worldwide events included leadership activities for young women, financial independence workshops, and motivational talks from prominent female figures. Zambia held a \\"Diva's Nite\\" concert featuring all-female artists and South Africa a hip-hop competition encouraging young people to discuss gender inequality. HIV/AIDS outreach, testing and counseling accompanied most of the events.AIDS Healthcare Foundation: Cutting Edge Medicine and Advocacy of Ability to Pay\\". AIDS Healthcare Foundation.  Research  AHF's anti- retroviral (ARV) studies include: * Studies of new ARV medications, both before and after FDA approval * Studies for people who already take ARV medications and are failing, as well as studies for people who have not yet begun ARV therapy * Studies comparing different combinations of ARV medications * Studies to reduce the number of pills a person must take, and to reduce dosing frequency * Women's studies, looking at the quality of life for women with HIV * Studies examining obstacles that prevent people from taking their ARV medications as prescribed * Research into related conditions such as Hepatitis C and neurological disorders Dr. Otto Yang, AHF's Scientific Director, also heads the HIV Immunotherapy Institute. Litigation In May 1999, AHF filed a lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles over the mismanagement of AIDS Housing Funds. Following a state legislator's audit, the Los Angeles City Controller revealed that more than $17 million in federal funds for people with AIDS went unspent as an AIDS homeless crisis raged in Los Angeles.https://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/11/local/me-36092 Condom laws litigation in Los Angeles and Las Vegas In 2004, Darren James and three other adult film actors tested positive for HIV. In response to the outbreak, AHF began lobbying in favor of laws requiring condom use by male actors during sex scenes in adult films. In 2010, AHF unsuccessfully sued the Los Angeles County government to compel its health department to mandate condom use in adult film productions. In 2012, AHF supported a Los Angeles city ordinance requiring condoms in certain adult films. Later the same year, the organization spent US$1,654,681 funding the successful campaign to pass Measure B, a ballot initiative that expanded the condom requirement countywide. AHF again sued the Los Angeles County government, alleging that an August 2012 audit conducted by the county was an illegal retaliation for AHF's support for Measure B. In 2013, AHF began collecting signatures for a ballot measure to create a Los Angeles city health department that would take over part of the county health department's jurisdiction. The City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles oppose the measure, and the city has filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the measure. In August 2014, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation filed a formal complaint with Nevada OSHA, against Cybernet Entertainment LLC, which does business as Kink.com and related spin-offs. The complaint alleges the California porn company did not require its actors to use condoms during an adult film shoot in Las Vegas. 2014 San Francisco lawsuit In 2014, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation filed suit against the City of San Francisco. AHF claimed that city restrictions on chain stores targeted them unfairly when the organization attempted to open a retail store. 2014 Dallas County lawsuit In 2014, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation filed suit against the County of Dallas. AHF claimed that the County of not giving the agency a fair chance to bid for federal AIDS funding. http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150331-aids-healthcare-foundation- sues-to-get-portion-of-federal-funds.ece 2013 Los Angeles lawsuit In 2013, AHF found itself entangled in dual lawsuits when AHF attempted to use political clout to force the City of Los Angeles to develop health services independent from the county. Health officials in affected departments filed responsive suits, arguing massive wastes would result in a transition or duplication of services.https://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/24/local/la-me- ln-health-department-lawsuit-20140124 2014 Los Angeles lawsuit In 2014, AHF was audited by Los Angeles county and billed $1.7 million for duplicated services. AHF filed suit, arguing that they were targeted on the basis of their political actions in the 2013 lawsuit. The lawsuit filed by AHF was thrown out by a judge.http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20140212/us-court- throws-out-aids-healhcare-foundation-suit-against-la-county 2014 Tarrant County Texas lawsuit In 2014, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation filed suit against the County of Dallas.

The suit specifically targeted funds given to longtime- standing local AIDS service organizations such as HIV/AIDS Alliance for Region Two, Family Service of Greater Baton Rouge, and others.http://theadvocate.com/news/15354646-123/aids-healthcare-group-sues- city-parish-non-profits-complains-federal-funds-not-distributed- fairlyhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzkco6M5XgAGNzR4SDlOTEhLYlE/view (from http://www.thebody.com/content/77390/louisiana-hiv-agencies-respond-to- shocking-ahf-law.html) The suit was settled with funding left unchanged.http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_340eee67-78f8-54cc-9f7f-62b478fff469.html 2016 Los Angeles Palladium Development lawsuit The AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) filed suit against the City of Los Angeles, alleging that the city violated laws and the city charter when it approved the development of two residential towers that are expected to be up to 30 stories tall. The City Council changed existing zoning and height limitations to allow the development, which would be next to AHF's Hollywood headquarters. A spokesperson for the development accused Michael Weinstein of filing the suit to maintain the view from his office. In 2019, the California Supreme Court Refused to hear the case, leaving in place a lower court decision against the foundation. Ballot initiatives= 2016 California Proposition 60 \\"Adult Film Condom Requirements\\" - failed  AHF spent $4.6 million supporting an initiative that would have allowed Cal/OSHA to prosecute an enforcement action anytime a condom is not visible in a pornographic film.  2016 California Proposition 61 \\"California Drug Price Relief Act\\" - failed  AHF spent $19 million supporting the California Drug Price Relief Act, a statewide 2016 ballot initiative that would have revised California law to require state programs to pay no more for prescription medications than the prices negotiated by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (notwithstanding any other provision of law and insofar as permissible under federal law), while exempting managed care programs funded through Medi-Cal. It failed by a 6% margin.  2017 Ohio Issue 2 \\"Ohio Drug Price Relief Act\\" - failed  On August 3, 2015, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine approved petition language for a drug pricing 2016 statewide ballot initiative to enact Section 194.01 of the Ohio Revised Code to seek United States Department of Veterans Affairs prescription drug pricing for state programs. On August 13, the Ohio Ballot Board approved the proposed statute as a single issue. As a result, that measure, backed by AHF and Ohioans for Fair Drug Prices, was cleared for signature gathering to begin collecting the 91,677 signatures of registered Ohio voters required to put the issue before the Ohio General Assembly. According to the Ohio petition language, \\"The Ohio Drug Price Relief Act would ... require that notwithstanding any other provision of law and in so far as permissible under federal law, the State of Ohio shall not enter into any agreement for the purchase of prescription drugs or agree to pay, directly or indirectly, for prescription drugs, including where the state is the ultimate payer, unless the net cost is the same or less than the lowest price paid for the same drug by the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\\" 2017 Los Angeles city Measure S \\"Neighborhood Integrity Initiative\\" - failed  In 2016, the foundation sponsored and provided more than 95% of the funding ($5.5 million) for an anti-development ballot initiative, Measure S, which was rejected with 70.4% voting against. This initiative would have imposed a two-year moratorium on spot zoning as well as developments requiring height and density variances and other changes that would, it claimed, prevent the city from gentrifying and growing too fast. \\"As we work to house patients in L.A., City Hall focuses on approving $3,500 apartments that sit empty,\\" Weinstein wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. Opponents, who included many advocacy groups for the homeless as well as the city's business community, building trades unions, and developers, said that while the measure addressed some real problems, it went too far and would have not only prevented the construction of new affordable housing but made the city's overall quality of life worse by aggravating an existing housing shortage. They questioned whether the money spent by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation to get the initiative on the ballot was related to the foundation's mission, and suggested that it was motivated by AHF director Michael Weinstein's desire to block a development that would have dominated the view from his office window. 2018 California Proposition 10 \\"Repeal of Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act\\" - failed  The AIDS Healthcare Foundation contributed $22.5 million to the campaign for Proposition 10, a ballot initiative which sought to repeal the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Act. The measure would have allowed local governments to adopt rent control on any kind of building. Costa-Hawkins is a state law which disallows local governments (cities and counties) from enacting rent control on buildings constructed after 1995, all single-family homes (regardless of construction date), and disallows laws that keep a property under rent control when tenants change (vacancy control). The proposition failed, 59% to 41%.

It was released in 1994 on Setanta to much critical acclaim but little commercial success. It is a concept album about two lovers who spend a day at the seaside. Background The album's style is even more classical-influenced than its predecessor, Liberation. The string arrangements are reminiscent of the works of Michael Nyman, with whom The Divine Comedy would later collaborate. Neil once said that after attending one of Michael Nyman's shows he went up to the composer, handed him a copy of Promenade, and jokingly said, \\"You can sue me if you like.\\" Years later Nyman said he did not remember the incident, but he said he felt more \\"flattered than ripped off.\\" Promenade, like Liberation, was recorded by Neil and co-producer Darren Allison, with the addition of String Quartet, and oboe/cor anglais courtesy of Joby Talbot, thus marking his first appearance in The Divine Comedy's history. Joby would go on to become the arranger for most of The Divine Comedy's post-Casanova work, even co-writing two Divine Comedy songs. Promenade is even more overtly literary than Liberation. It opens with a quote from Isaac Watts' hymn \\"Our God, Our Help in Ages Past\\" and ends with a quote from John Dryden's translation of one of Horace's odes (which is also sung as the chorus of \\"The Booklovers\\"). \\"The Booklovers\\" is a list of over seventy different authors. Concept Promenade can be interpreted as a concept album about two lovers who spend a day at the seaside. There are many different interpretations of the story, but it may run something like this: \\"Bath\\" is about the female character taking a bath, and \\"Going Downhill Fast\\" is about the male character bicycling over to her house. \\"The Booklovers\\" is about the two discussing their favourite authors. \\"A Seafood Song\\" is about them enjoying a meal comprising different types of fish. In \\"Geronimo\\" they get caught in the rain as they head back to his place, and they go on a Ferris wheel ride in \\"Don't Look Down\\", where the thrill of the moment causes the man to announce his atheism. Later, in \\"When the Lights Go Out All Over Europe\\" (the title alluding to the famous World War I quote \\"The lights are going out all over Europe\\") they see a French film, and in \\"The Summerhouse\\" they reminisce about their childhood. The girl almost drowns during an evening stroll in \\"Neptune's Daughter\\", they then get drunk in \\"A Drinking Song\\", and \\"Ten Seconds to Midnight\\" is about counting down to the New Year and the anniversary of the time when they first met. Finally, in \\"Tonight We Fly\\", they transcend everyone through their ecstasy. One recurring element in Promenade is water. Water is mentioned in one way or another in the following songs: \\"Bath\\", \\"A Seafood Song\\", \\"Geronimo\\", \\"The Summerhouse\\", \\"Neptune's Daughter\\", and \\"Tonight We Fly\\". The North Sea, itself, even plays a part in the album ‚Äì producer Darren Allison made field recordings at North Blyth and Druridge Bay on the Northumberland Coast, which can be heard at the beginning of \\"Bath\\", and again, in \\"Neptunes Daughter\\". Another recurring element is gods from mythology. Aphrodite is mentioned in \\"Bath\\". Mercury is mentioned in \\"Going Downhill Fast\\". Neptune is in the title of \\"Neptune's Daughter\\". References to French New Wave cinema occur in two of the songs. \\"When the Lights Go Out All Over Europe\\" alludes to Fran√ßois Truffaut's Jules et Jim, contains excerpts of dialogue from Jean-Luc Godard's √Ä Bout de Souffle and contains the line \\"and when she asks for his ambition, Jean-Pierre replies 'My mission is to become eternal and to die'\\", describing a scene in √Ä Bout de Souffle in which a novelist character played by Jean-Pierre Melville replies \\"devenir immortel et puis, mourir\\". This song also contains a reference to √âric Rohmer's Claire's Knee. \\"The Booklovers\\" contains the line \\"Tu connais William Faulkner?\\", also a quote from √Ä Bout de Souffle. Responses Neil Hannon used to send all of his albums to Scott Walker, of whom Neil is a very big fan. After Neil sent Scott a copy of Promenade Scott sent him a letter back stating that he particularly liked \\"The Booklovers\\".

His 1978 novel The Murderer won the Guardian Fiction Prize. He went on to become more noted for his \\"Georgetown Trilogy\\" of novels (also published in an omnibus volume as The Armstrong Trilogy, 1994), consisting of From the Heat of the Day (1979), One Generation (1980), and Genetha (1981). Heath said that his writing was \\"intended to be a dramatic chronicle of twentieth-century Guyana\\". His work has been described as \\"marked by comprehensive social observation, penetrating psychological analysis, and vigorous, picaresque action.\\"Roy Heath Biography, JRank. Biography Roy Heath was born and grew up in Georgetown in what was then British Guiana, and \\"had African, Indian, European and Amerindian blood running through his veins\\".\\"Roy A. K.

Retrieved 2 March 2015. Educated at Central High School, Georgetown, Heath worked as a Treasury clerk (1944‚Äì51) before leaving for England in 1951. He attended the University of London (1952‚Äì56), earning a B.A. Honours degree in Modern Languages. He also studied law and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1964 (and to the Guyana bar in 1973), although he never practised as a lawyer, pursuing a career since 1959 as a writer and a schoolteacher in London, where he lived until his death at the age of 81. In his later years he had suffered from Parkinson's disease.Margaret Busby, \\"Roy AK Heath\\" (obituary), The Guardian, 20 May 2008. Rohan Heath, founder of the band Urban Cookie Collective, is his son.\\"Urban Cookie Collective\\", The Audio DB. Writing Although Heath left British Guiana in 1951, \\"it never left him. He only ever wrote about his mother's land, never his adopted home.\\" As Mark McWatt notes: \\"Guyana is always the setting for his fiction, and its capital and rural villages are evoked in the kind of powerful and minute detail that would seem to require the author's frequent visits.\\"Mark A. McWatt, \\"Roy A. K. Heath\\", in Daryl Cumber Dance, Fifty Caribbean Writers: A Bio-Bibliographic-Critical Sourcebook, Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1986, pp. 207‚Äì16. However, \\"Although [Heath's] fiction has fed richly upon his obsessive and meticulous memories of Georgetown and the coastland, his novels cannot be called celebrations of the place and its people. They seem to reveal instead the failures and shameful inadequacies of individual and community.\\"Mark McWatt, Routledge Encyclopaedia of Literatures in English, 1996. His short story \\"Miss Mabel's Burial\\" was published in 1972 in the Guyanese journal Kaie; another story, \\"The Wind and the Sun\\", appeared in the Jamaican journal Savacou two years later.David Katz, \\"Roy Heath: A Man Goes Home\\", Caribbean Beat, Issue 93, September/October 2008. Heath's first novel, A Man Come Home, was published in 1974 by Longman, where Anne Walmsley was Caribbean publisher, with a limited focus on the local educational market. When Heath completed his next book, Walmsley \\"urged him to look elsewhere for a firm that could bring his work the acclaim, the wide sales, that it deserved. Who better than the then fledgling Allison and Busby?\\"\\"Roy AK Heath  Anne Walmsley\\", The Guardian, 20 May 2008. Taken on by A&B;, with Margaret Busby as editor, Heath's next novel, published in 1978, was The Murderer, which that same year won the Guardian Fiction Prize and was described by The Observer as \\"mysteriously authentic, and unique as a work of art\\". The Murderer was also listed in 1999's The Modern Library: 200 Best Novels in English since 1950 by Carmen Callil and Colm T√≥ib√≠n. Heath's next three novels were From the Heat of the Day (1979), One Generation (1980) and Genetha (1981), eventually published in a single volume under the title The Armstrong Trilogy. His other published novels are Kwaku; or, The Man Who Could Not Keep His Mouth Shut (1982), Orealla (1984), The Shadow Bride (1988) and The Ministry of Hope (1997).

In 1983, during a vacation to Guyana, Heath delivered the Edgar Mittelholzer Memorial Lecture, entitled \\"Art and Experience\\",\\"UK-based novelist Roy Heath dies at 82\\", Kaieteur News obituary, 16 May 2008. in Georgetown. In the lecture Heath stated: \\"The price the artist pays for his egotism is a high one. On one level egotism obliges him to create, while the same egotism threatens to destroy him. Success not only goes to his head, it remains there, creating demands he cannot hope to satisfy. I am acutely aware of all of this and therefore try to shun gratuitous publicity.\\"Art and Experience, p. 28, quoted in McWatt (1986), p. 208. In 1989 he was awarded the Guyana Prize for Literature for his novel The Shadow Bride, which was also shortlisted for the 1991 Booker Prize,Linda Parent Lesher, \\"Heath, Roy (Guyana/UK)\\", The Best Novels of the Nineties: A Reader's Guide, McFarland, 2000, pp. 167‚Äì168. and about which Publishers Weekly said: \\"Heath's modest, unpretentious style undergirds a powerful realism as his subtle analysis of family conflicts builds to a tragic and moving climax.\\"\\"The Shadow Bride: A Novel by Roy Heath\\" (review), Publishers Weekly, 30 October 1995. Reception Heath's writings have been widely acclaimed and he has been called \\"truly one of the most brilliant story tellers ever\\",Arnon Adams, \\"Remembering Roy Heath\\", Stabroek News, 28 May 2008. with reviewers at different times comparing his work to that of such great writers as D.

Naipaul and others.James Polk, \\"Outrun by Demons\\", The New York Times, 23 August 1993.Al Creighton, \\"Roy Heath: 'A writer of prodigious talent'\\", Stabroek News, 22 June 2008. Described by Salman Rushdie as \\"a beautiful writer\\" and by Edward Blishen as \\"simply one of the most astonishingly good novelists of our time\\", Heath might have been better known outside literary circles had he not eschewed personal publicity, believing that his work should speak for itself. The Murderer Winner of the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1978, The Murderer was well reviewed on first publication and later reissues, being described by The Observer as \\"mysteriously authentic, and unique as a work of art\\" and by Publishers Weekly as \\"an impressive study of a man's descent into paranoia and madness.\\"\\"The Murderer  Roy Heath, Author Persea Books\\", Publishers Weekly, 3 March 1993. \\"What is impressive about The Murderer is the execution of a style that truncates emotion...\\" (Wilson Harris, World Literature Written in English)Wilson Harris, \\"Roy Heath.

The Armstong Trilogy \\"A spare, bleak saga of two generations in the life of a Guyanese family struggling for respectability but unable to snatch any but the most fleeting moments of happiness. ... Like the early D.H. Lawrence, Heath endows the familiar trials of this family with an elemental power, as if each were happening for the first time. The result is harrowing in its simplicity and cumulative force.\\" (Kirkus Reviews)\\"The Armstrong Trilogy\\", Kirkus Reviews, 1 March 1994. \\"Mr. Heath is a gentle social satirist with a concise, probing style; his prose is filled with ironies, both overt and subtle.... Roy Heath's solid devotion to character, plot and emotion, to the minutiae of daily life and its buried tragedies, is not post-modern or even modernist. It is impossible, despite his work's affinities to Dostoyevsky and Hardy and the Joyce of 'Dubliners,' to put a date on it: the post-colonial world has its own unique time lines. To call this author old-fashioned, however, is nothing but praise.\\" (The New York Times)Suzanne Ruta, \\"Reader, She Married Him, Alas\\", The New York Times, 27 June 1993. Kwaku; or, the Man Who Could Not Keep His Mouth Shut  \\"Heath is a master of droll, understated comedy; his affectionate empathy with his characters is never for a moment compromised by condescension. He's a somewhat flintier R.K. Narayan, and there's more than whiff of Kipling in his avuncular fascination with scramblers and hustlers. A wonderful novel, which stands impressively both on its own and in tandem with its equally irresistible sequel. There's no longer any doubt that Heath is one of the world's best writers.\\" (Kirkus Reviews)\\"KWAKU or The Man Who Could Not Keep His Mouth Shut\\", Kirkus Reviews, 15 February 1997. \\"Kwaku comes from a long line of literary buffoons who manage to triumph over the intelligent people around them. The language Mr. Heath employs to describe this process is luxurious and densely baroque in places, sweetly comic in others. The hero's clowning conceals an essential wisdom and goodness. In the end, he is unable to become as hardened and corrupt as the people he tries so desperately to emulate, and in this lies his greatest success.\\" (Mark Childress, The New York Times)Mark Childress, \\"No Ordinary Idiot\\", The New York Times, 11 May 1997.

The Shadow Bride \\"The Guyanese-born Heath (the superb Armstrong Trilogy, 1994, etc.) surpasses himself with this ambitious, vividly written, psychologically rich chronicle‚Äîset in his own colorfully multiracial native country‚Äîof compromised ambition and family conflict. ...And in the harrowing progression from mother's love through sexual enslavement to climactic violence and madness of Betta's larger-than-life mother, the author has achieved a masterly feat of characterization: This is a woman whom no reader will easily forget.

Initially an investigation by the United States Capitol Police into a single embezzlement charge against a single employee, evidence rapidly led to the inclusion of several other employees, before top Democrats in the House of Representatives moved to shut down the whole line of inquiry, despite protests from Frank Kerrigan, chief of the Capitol Police. A new investigation was started by the United States Postal Service, which eventually submitted a report to Congress. This was held by Speaker Tom Foley (D-WA) until media reports of embezzlement and money laundering leaked out in 1992. Following public outcry, Democratic leaders of the House were forced to refer the matter to the United States House Committee on House Administration, which started its own investigation. That committee broke into two parts along party lines, with the Democrats issuing a report saying the matter was closed, but the Republicans issuing a dissenting report, including a number of unanswered questions and problems with the investigation. The Republican charges were largely ignored until July 1993, when Robert Rota, the Congressional Postmaster, pleaded guilty to three criminal charges, implicating Representatives Dan Rostenkowski (D-IL), Joe Kolter (D-PA) and his then Chief of Staff. They were accused of heading a conspiracy to launder Post Office money through stamps and postal vouchers. Rostenkowski pleaded guilty in 1996 to mail fraud and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. In 2000, just before he left office, U.S. President Bill Clinton pardoned Rostenkowski, which became part of a larger controversy about Clinton's pardons.

The ceramics were made mostly by hand, although in some cases a pottery wheel was used. In many cases, signs of smoothing and flattening are visible on the pots. Themes The designs on the pottery are predominantly globe-like and spherical. Another common characteristic is that the designs often include one or more wings. The walls are generally flat and even, while the bottom remains unfinished, though there are some exceptions. The decorative themes on the pottery are fairly uniform. Common designs are of parallel vertical and horizontal lines, triangles, stars, S-shaped patterns, and fish-spine designs. Also common were interlaced designs, impressions using ropes or \\"mamel√≥ns\\", as well as other varied ornamental designs. The major part of the ceramics were plain and undesigned, however. Uses The larger bowls were mainly used to store food (such as grains) or liquids. Other pots were used for cooking in a fireplace type area. Smaller ones were used for food and drink in everyday meals. Some of these ceramics were used in conjunction with or instead of tools made of wood or wicker. Also common was a form of barbecue grill, using spits, for grilling food. These are easily identifiable as a result of the holes in the walls and the back of the stone structure where the food was cooked. The materials used to make these ovens were made by hand and were also made and fashioned using small ovens to help the metals become ductile or malleable.

Released in 2002, it is the fourth installment in the Clock Tower series, and the first and only video game directed by Japanese film director Kinji Fukasaku. The plot and characters have very little relation with the previous Clock Tower games. The story follows 14-year-old Alyssa Hamilton who is part of a family lineage of female warriors who travel through time to defeat evil spirits. Alyssa travels from her time in 2003 London to the 1940s and 1960s in order to defeat these \\"Entities\\" and bring peace to troubled souls. As opposed to the point-and-click gameplay used in the previous games, Clock Tower 3 is the first game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist. Alyssa is given no weapon for the majority of the game, and must evade and hide from her pursuers. These enemies, known as \\"Subordinates\\", are fought at the end of each level, during which Alyssa is armed with a longbow. The game received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure, selling considerably less than anticipated. The presentation, writing, and graphics were positively received, with many critics praising the cutscenes and Fukasaku's direction. However, the gameplay was criticized for its repetitive mechanics, and the game itself was felt to be too short. Gameplay Clock Tower 3 is a survival horror game played from a fixed third-person camera perspective in which players control 14-year-old school girl Alyssa Hamilton. Clock Tower 3 is the first game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist, as opposed to the point-and- click gameplay used in the previous games. To progress through the game, the player must find items to unlock new areas, solve puzzles, and flee and hide from enemies (\\"Subordinates\\"). Eventually, each Subordinate must be defeated in battle. Throughout each level, the player also encounters the spirits of innocent people slain by the Subordinates. These spirits will attack Alyssa if she approaches them. In order to pacify them, an item of sentimental value must be found and returned to the spirit's corpse. Alyssa is given no weaponry during the majority of the game, other than a limited supply of holy water, which can be used to temporarily stun pursuing Subordinates. Within each level, the Subordinate can appear in any location after a set period of time, but also randomly or if Alyssa makes noise. They also appear in certain set locations. When one appears, it immediately begins to chase Alyssa, attempting to kill her. The player must either hide from or evade it. Evasion can only be accomplished in certain places, and each evasion point can only be used once. Using an evasion point does not kill the Subordinate, but instead renders them unconscious for a set amount of time. The primary means of eluding one, however, is by hiding. There are multiple hiding points throughout each level, and each one can be used multiple times. However, hiding places are ineffective if the Subordinate sees Alyssa enter them. Alyssa stumbles as she runs away from Sledgehammer in \\"Panic mode\\". Throughout most of the game, Alyssa has a \\"Panic Meter\\" visible on screen. If she is scared by a Subordinate, attacked by a spirit or simply frightened by her surroundings, the meter will begin to rise. If it fills, she enters \\"Panic mode\\". In this state, the screen starts flashing, Alyssa becomes difficult to control and begins stumbling and falling over. She is also unable to use holy water and cannot enter hiding spots. After a few seconds, she will momentarily freeze, covering her ears. Panic mode only lasts for a certain amount of time, and its duration can be reduced by using \\"Lavender water\\". However, if she is hit by a Subordinate while in Panic Mode, she will die instantly. After the majority of each level has played out, Alyssa must confront the Subordinate who has been chasing her. At this point, her holy water bottle transforms into a longbow, allowing her to fight back. Each battle is confined to a single area, and both Alyssa and the Subordinate have onscreen life bars. During the fight, Alyssa must dodge attacks while firing arrows. In order to inflict any real damage, she must power-up her attacks. However, while powering-up, Alyssa cannot move or re-adjust her aim. This leaves her vulnerable to attacks, and makes it possible for her enemy to move out of her line of sight. A fully powered-up shot will tether the Subordinate to the ground. If it is transfixed with multiple powered-up shots, Alyssa can perform a highly damaging \\"Super attack\\", killing or severely wounding it. Plot The story of Clock Tower 3 is set in London in 2003. Alyssa Hamilton is a 14-year-old girl who has been living at a boarding school for three years. Her mother, Nancy, sent her there after her grandfather, Dick, disappeared. The game begins with Alyssa receiving a letter from her mother telling her to go into hiding until after her fifteenth birthday. Alarmed, Alyssa decides to go against her mother's wishes and return home. However, when she arrives at the boarding house in which they live, her mother is absent, and the only person there is a man called \\"The Dark Gentleman\\". Determined to find her mother, Alyssa explores her mother's room. Suddenly, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu begins to play with no apparent source, and Alyssa is transported back in time to the streets of London during World War II. She enters a tailor shop where she witnesses the murder of a young girl by a man wielding a sledgehammer. Eventually, Alyssa is able to piece together what happened: May Norton was killed on Christmas Eve 1942 by Sledgehammer, a stonecutter who went on a killing spree before being caught and executed. Alyssa comes to realise that she must free May's spirit, which is trapped on Earth, by giving her her father's pocket watch. On her way to do so, she is confronted by Sledgehammer, whom she destroys. She then gives the watch to May's spirit, reuniting her with her father. At that moment, Alyssa faints and wakes up back in the boarding house. She explores the house further with her friend, Dennis Owen, and learns more about her past: the girls in her family are known as \\"Rooders\\", young women with supernatural powers. Rooders are the sworn enemies of \\"Entities\\", beings which can infect innocent humans and drive them to acts of murder, at which point the human becomes a \\"Subordinate\\". Rooder powers peak at the age of fifteen, and wane afterward, disappearing completely by the age of twenty. boss mode. She has tethered him twice, but three tethers are necessary to use the Super Attack. Alyssa then travels to the 1960s, where she enters the house of Dorothy Rand, a blind elderly woman and her son, Albert, and sees them murdered by a man known as Corroder, who throws them into a vat of acid. Alyssa destroys Corroder, and returns a lost shawl to Dorothy's spirit, freeing both herself and Albert. She then returns to the present, where The Dark Gentleman congratulates her on killing two Subordinates. He sends her to the top of a massive clock tower where he tells her that when her fifteenth birthday arrives they will be united for eternity. He also tells her that her mother is dead. When she refuses to believe him, he flings her from the tower. Regaining consciousness in a sewer system, she is forced to confront another Subordinate, Chopper. She defeats him, but fails to kill him and is sent to a graveyard. She then learns of the \\"Ritual of Engagement\\"; if a human wishes to become an Entity, they must remove the heart of a Rooder to whom they are related on her fifteenth birthday and drink her blood. Eventually, Alyssa fights Chopper again and is able to destroy him. Dennis arrives, and he and Alyssa find their way to an abandoned hospital where they encounter Scissorman and Scissorwoman, who kidnap Dennis. Alyssa is then transported to a castle, where she sees Dick reciting a strange incantation. She learns Dick knew of the Ritual of Engagement, and had discovered that Lord Burroughs, the owner of the castle and from whom he is descended, also knew of the ritual. She then sees an incident from the past of Dick asking for Burroughs' help to become an Entity, inviting Burroughs to enter his body and for them to complete the Ritual together. Burroughs' spirit takes possession of Dick, turning into The Dark Gentleman. Meanwhile, Alyssa is able to rescue Dennis from the twins, killing them in the process. The Dark Gentleman then tells Alyssa if she wants to save Nancy's soul, she must come to the top of the tower. There, The Dark Gentlemen turns into Lord Burroughs and begins the Ritual. However, Dennis distracts Burroughs, allowing Alyssa to fight back. Nancy's spirit transfers what is left of her own Rooder power into Alyssa, giving her the strength to destroy Burroughs. After she defeats him, she reunites with her mother's spirit. The tower then collapses. Alyssa awakens in a field, where she sees Dennis. She runs to him and hugs him as she says \\"Mum...we did it. We did it, Mum.\\" Development After Human Entertainment went out of business in 2000, Sunsoft became the sole owner of the Clock Tower intellectual property. IGN reported that during a meeting in Tokyo on April 11, 2001, Capcom announced they were bringing Clock Tower 3 to the PlayStation 2 and that Capcom was co-producing the game with Sunsoft. They also revealed that acclaimed Japanese film director Kinji Fukasaku would be directing the cutscenes, Keita Amemiya was in charge of character designs, Noboru Sugimura was writing the scenario, and Kouji 'Cozy' Kubo was composing the music. At the time of the announcement, the game was still in the casting phase; over two hundred actresses had auditioned for the motion capture of Alyssa. The game was first shown at E3 in May 2002, where a non-playable demo was on show at the Capcom booth.  Release  In November, Capcom announced the game would be released in Japan on December 12. Commercially, the game was a failure. Capcom had projected sales of at least 450,000, but the game fell considerably short of that number. By the end of 2002, it had sold 78,961 units, making it the 151st highest selling game in Japan across all systems. In 2003, it sold a further 43,061 units, bringing its total to only 122,022 units sold. Reception Clock Tower 3 received \\"mixed or average reviews,\\" with an aggregate score of 69 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 28 reviews. The game's presentation was strongly praised, with many pointing out the excellent cinematic style brought together by a strong script and well- directed cutscenes. GameSpy's Alan Pavlacka felt the script was the game's strongest point, and wrote that the \\"excellent cinema scenes\\" and \\"distinct visual style\\" also contributed to the high quality presentation. The graphics and atmosphere were also well received. IGN's Jeremy Dunham noted that \\"Clock Tower 3 successfully captur[es] the dirty, musty look of England's serial killer underworld...[it] is straight out of a Mary Shelley novel.\\" The cutscene direction from Kinji Fukasaku was positively noted, with Eurogamer Kristan Reed calling the cutscenes \\"exceptionally well-realised.\\" The camerawork and scariness of the game were both lauded and criticized. While the presentation was received positively, the gameplay received criticism from multiple reviews. More specifically, the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were cited as weak. GameSpot Brad Shoemaker argued the cinematic portions were underpinned by the gameplay, believing that players would more likely want to finish the game for its storyline than the fun they'll have playing it. Game Revolution's AA White stated \\"Clock Tower 3 is ultimately one of those games whose cinemas are more interesting than the actual gameplay and from a gamer's standpoint, that's never a good thing.\\" Critics also agreed that the game felt too short.

It opened in May 2006. Located in Bloomington, Minnesota, it was a half mile from the Mall of America and close to the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. The water park was attached to the Radisson Hotel. Both the hotel and the water park were managed by Evolution Hospitality. In January 2017, it was announced that Great Wolf Resorts had purchased the property. The hotel and waterpark closed for renovations and rebranding as a Great Wolf Resort. Great Wolf reopened the property in December 2017. Water rides The park had a slide tower containing several water slides, and an open area at ground level that contained water rides. The slide tower contained three body slides, two tube slides, and one family slide (this was the tallest slide, that started at the tenth level of the building and ended at the bottom). Body slides were slides on which riders slid directly on their body, without an innertube. Ground level Below the slide tower was a wave pool, a lazy river, a swimming pool, a small pool with floating \\"logs\\" which children leaped across, a flow rider, two hot-tubs, and a children's area for smaller children. Wave Pool The wave pool ran for ten minutes and then was turned off for five minutes to let the machine that produced the waves cool. The wave pool was a tapered pool that started with a beach entry and that got about five and a half feet deep. It was the beginning and end of the lazy river. The lazy river was three-feet deep and made a circuit around the outer perimeter of the park. The lazy river was ridden on a one-person or two-person innertube through ‚Äúcaves,‚Äù under bridges and waterfalls, past pools. The ride ended in the wave pool. The swimming pool, also known as the \\"activity pool,\\" was four feet deep. One end had four basketball hoops for games of water ball, the other end was for general swimming. Next to the swimming pool was a smaller pool that had floating cross-sections of ‚Äúlogs‚Äù attached to the floor of the pool like lily pads. Suspended above the pool was a cargo net for children to hold onto as they jumped from log to log. Flow Rider The flow rider was a shallow but fast moving sheet of water, moving from 30‚Äì35 miles per hour, on which the rider could surf or \\"boogie-board\\". The flow rider was . The park had two cave-pool themed hot tubs. The children‚Äôs playground area contained a playground with stairs that led to towers, cargo netting, and slides sitting in a few inches of warmer water. At the top of the playground was a wooden bucket that filled with water. Once full, it dumped water on anyone below, resulting in laughter and excitement from the children. The children‚Äôs playground had three water slides for small children but which older children and adults could use. The playground contained numerous other water toys and devices. Life-vests The water park also provided free life-vests for children which could be brought as long as one was a Coast Guard approved flotation device. Northern Lights Arcade The Northern Lights Arcade was located between the entrance to the water park and the main lobby of the hotel. It was an arcade primarily consisting of redemption games. It included favorites such as Pac-Man, and Pinball as well as newer games like Initial D, Maximum Tune, and Pump It Up.  Characters  This waterpark before the Great Wolf Lodge takeover, had its own set of characters geared towards children. They were known as Hobey and Friends. Hobey the Bear is Water Park of America‚Äôs main mascot. He‚Äôs named after the Hobey Baker award, which is only fitting as his favorite sport is hockey! Hobey hails from Eveleth, Minnesota, and enjoys fishing, picking berries, and wandering the North Woods. Despite being from this cold state, Hobey prefers warm and humid weather. In fact, his love for warmer temperature is what brought him to Water Park of America! When he‚Äôs not busy surfing the Cascade Falls FlowRider¬Æ or sliding down the Eagles Nest 10th Floor Body Slide, Hobey enjoys making sure that everyone enjoys their time at Water Park of America. Garry the Groundhog is a distant cousin of Goldy Gopher, the famous and much-beloved mascot for the University of Minnesota sports teams. Here at Water Park of America, Garry likes to keep a decidedly lower profile, basking in the warm waters of the St. Croix Lazy River, snacking on berries and nuts, and finding cozy spaces to burrow and take a nap. He also loves to help water park guests have a great time at the park, so be on the lookout for him during your stay. Ollie the Otter joined the team at Water Park of America after Hobey saw him fishing on the banks of the Minnesota River. After showing Hobey some tricks of the trade, Ollie was invited to join the helpful team at Water Park of America. Ollie enjoys eating seafood and swimming when he‚Äôs not having fun with guests at the park. Roxi the Raccoon is more commonly known as the happiest raccoon in Minnesota! She loves eating delicious food at Water Park of America and snoozing near the FlowRider¬Æ. If you need any help during your trip to the park, feel free to ask Roxi the Raccoon for advice. Controversy=Lawsuit Shortly before opening day, the Mall of America filed a lawsuit against Water Park of America claiming trademark infringement. The Mall of America claimed the water park's name was too similar to the Mall of America's name and could cause some to associate the two. The Water Park of America filed a counterclaim in the matter accusing the Mall of America of, among other things, knowing about Water Park of America's use of the name since the fall of 2003, encouraging the use of the name, and encouraging the Water Park of America to spend millions of dollars advertising and promoting the name up until March 2006. Water Park of America went on to claim that the reason Mall of America changed its position became clear in a press release, in which the Mall of America announced it was going to build its own water park as part of Phase II. The parties have settled the dispute under confidential terms.

Intended for pre-teens and teenagers, the novel deals with puberty from a 1970s male perspective as well as the other trials of growing up. Judy Blume claimed that she was inspired to write the story following the success of her preceding novel Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. Given her earlier novel was about a girl entering puberty making the transition to womanhood, she decided to write one about a boy going through puberty and making a transition to manhood. Plot summary Twelve-year-old Tony Miglione lives with his hardworking extended family in a working-class neighborhood in Jersey City, New Jersey. After Tony's family experiences a major increase in wealth due to his father's successful sale of his electronics invention, the family relocates to an upper-class community in Rosemont, New York. His mother becomes absorbed with climbing the social ladder in her new, wealthier neighborhood, while his maternal grandmother becomes angry and withdrawn when she is no longer allowed to cook for the family as she loves to do. Tony's older brother, a new father who was previously a well-respected junior high school teacher, gives up teaching to make more money working for Tony's father, causing Tony to feel that his brother is \\"selling out\\". Tony meets a seemingly polite and respectful neighbor, a boy his own age, Joel Hoober. While Joel's manners impress Mr. and Mrs. Miglione, Tony sees Joel's true colors in private. Joel secretly engages in misbehavior such as prank calls, underage drinking, hiding issues of Playboy magazine under his bed, and shoplifting, and encourages Tony to participate as well. Tony starts to experience inexplicable abdominal pain brought on by his anxiety over his new friend's antics. Tony also develops an infatuation with Joel's beautiful teenage sister Lisa, who routinely undresses near her uncovered bedroom window, as Tony watches from his own bedroom window. He is going through puberty and must deal with the physical changes in his body, such as wet dreams and erections, on top of the major changes in his family life. It is implied that he masturbates and thinks of Lisa when he does it. After witnessing one of Joel's misdeeds, Tony faints from anxiety, where he is then admitted to the hospital for a brief stay and sent to therapy after doctors determine the malady is not medical. The therapy helps Tony learn new ways to cope with his problems. Joel is eventually caught stealing golf balls from a sports store, and Tony refuses to stand up for him when they are stopped by security. Surprisingly, Joel isn't angry at him and the two boys agree amicably to end their friendship, and Joel is sent to a military academy after explaining to Tony that he acted out to see if he could get away with it. When Joel's mother rationalizes his behavior by announcing the forthcoming enrollment in the military academy, Tony's mother is considering sending him there too, until Tony's father intervenes and says this is a key decision that only Tony should make. Tony regains some respect for his parents after realizing they do pay attention to him, unlike the Hoober parents towards Joel. Tony also overcomes his infatuation with Lisa and curtails watching her window after learning of her relationship with his youth group leader. At the final chapter, Tony is bicycling and talking to himself about his parents building a swimming pool and he is approaching his 14th birthday. Tony is also now more at ease with himself and the family changes, and had the courage to tell the therapist he spied on Lisa. Tony thinks it would be best if he cuts it out with his Peeping Tom behavior for good, but finally says to himself \\"Then again, maybe I won't\\".

Theme While this novel is similar to aspects of Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret., it differs mainly in the secondary themes. While Margaret struggles with her issues of religion and being raised in an interfaith family, Tony Miglione struggles with the issues of his family's social status and to a lesser extent, American society. A similarity of both stories, aside from the physical maturity of both characters, is that Tony develops a crush on the eldest daughter of his next door neighbors, just as Margaret has feelings for her neighbor's friend. However, Tony also has to deal with the fact that she is three years older than he is, and, that if such a crush developed further, the age difference would be uncommon among boys he knows. Both stories also deal with moving from an urban area to the suburbs, but the reason behind the move for Tony's family is his father's success with his invention and desire to move to a wealthier community. Themes dealt with include the effects on Tony of losing the working-class life he had been used to in his Italian- American neighborhood in Jersey City, and being ill at ease in his new upper- class community. In addition, Tony's grandmother has been marginalized, as she loved to cook for the family in Jersey City but is told that this would be inappropriate in their new home. She confines herself to her room after the Migliones hire Maxine, a maid who takes advantage of the family's inexperience with their new lifestyle, and essentially directs the household to her taste instead of taking orders from the family. Another slight theme touched upon is Tony regaining slight respect for the working class life his parents left behind. Tony and his friends are drinking milkshakes at a malt shop when Joel thinks it is cute to hide the tip inside a partially unconsumed milkshake glass, causing the waitress to make a scene and remark how Joel and his ilk know nothing of working for a living and that \\"your crummy coins buys me a loaf of bread; ever stop and think of that\\". Tony later remarks to himself he thought for a long time how his spending money goes from his pocket to a supermarket in some low-income neighborhood. The penultimate chapter in the book deals with the consequences of Joel's immoral actions. Tony and Joel are at a sporting goods store where the employees successfully catch Joel shoplifting golf balls and Tony refuses to aid Joel in lying. Tony anticipates that his parents will learn for themselves of Joel's true nature when they read tomorrow's newspaper and see Joel will be remanded to the juvenile facility, but is surprised when he learns the owner of the sporting goods store declines to press charges against Joel for shoplifting. Joel's father then decides to enroll Joel in a military academy, which he believes will cure Joel of his \\"I will do what I want, when I want\\" attitude and deprive him of his pampered lifestyle at the Hoober home, but also shows Mr. Hoober pigeonholing the problem so his work and golf games are not interrupted. Setting The time frame of this story is evidently the late 1960s or early 1970s, as Tony's eldest brother, Vinnie, has been killed in action in the Vietnam War. Initially set in Jersey City, New Jersey, the family eventually moves to Rosemont, New York on Long Island. Other themes touched upon are how Tony's family seems to be knowingly and willingly distancing themselves from their Italian heritage as not many Italian-Americans live in Rosemont (evidence of this is shown when Tony's mother allows herself to be called \\"Carol\\" by Mrs. Hoober instead of Carmella, her true name). Another theme is how Tony's family is keeping up with the Joneses by emulating their next door neighbors, the Hoobers (although Tony's mother is clearly more concerned with social image than his father). Mr. Hoober is vice president of a pharmaceutical company and is apparently extremely well compensated, which gives his wife the chance to spend her days playing golf and socializing. The Hoobers are representative of the \\"high-powered American family\\" and seem to believe the \\"American way\\" is about money, affluent living, social status and not much else. As a result, they do not seem to give much attention to the trouble-making son Joel, who has the idea he can get away with anything because nobody is watching over him or enforcing discipline.

The district encompasses what is essentially a linear town center, strung out principally along Main Street (Massachusetts Route 117), with a well-preserved collection of residential and civic architecture spanning more than two centuries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history Although the town's first meetinghouse (built c. 1740 and no longer extant) lay outside the current center, by the early 19th century the town's focus had moved to the main east-west road through the town (now Route 117), where it developed as a major stagecoach stop, with several inns and taverns serving travelers and local business. By 1830, the center had achieved much of its present appearance, with most of the later development either replacing older buildings or infilling between others. The district includes a variety of houses from the 18th century onward, including the house of the first town minister (c. 1741, 752 Main Street). Institutional buildings in the district include the 1853 Town House, four historic school buildings (including an 1825 one room schoolhouse), and the 1928 Colonial Revival Federated Church of Bolton. Architecturally distinguished buildings include the Tudor Revival library, built in 1903 as a gift from the Whitney family, and the 1923 Elementary School, a fine example of Colonial Revival architecture.

It is a well-preserved industrial village that experienced its most significant period of growth in the mid-19th century. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history Ashburnham was first settled in 1739, but was abandoned due to the danger of Native American attacks in the 1740s, and was not permanently settled until 1753. The town was incorporated in 1765, and achieved its present boundaries in 1824. The original town center was located atop a hill north of the present town center, where its first meeting house was built. Its economic and civic focus shifted south, to the area between two branches of Phillips Brook, both of which were dammed for industrial purposes in the late 18th century. Development was only modest until the industrial period of 1830‚Äì1855, when industrial development along Phillips Brook spurred significant growth, and the old meeting house was abandoned for a new Congregational church (1834) on Main Street (the timbers of the old meeting house were used to build a town house, which still stands at 79 Main Street). The economic activity resulted in the construction of a significant number of Greek Revival houses, many of which survive in some form. In the second half of the 19th century, residential growth was modest, but a number of notable civic buildings were built, including a Methodist (later Roman Catholic) church in 1870, the Stevens Library (1890), and a new Town Hall (1904). The historic district is a roughly triangular area in size, defined by Main Street (Massachusetts Route 12) on the south, Proctor Street on the east, and Chapel Street on the northwest. It extends as far south as Academy Street, and beyond the main roads for short distances. There are now only vestiges of the village's industrial 19th-century history; most of the 189 historically significant buildings are either residential or civic in nature. Most of the commercial buildings in the district are found on Main Street, and include a number of examples of early 19th-century commercial architecture.

It is located in the unitary authority of North Somerset, on the western edge of the Mendip Hills, about east of Weston-super-Mare, and about south-west of Bristol. The parish, which includes the village of Lower Langford and the hamlet of Upper Langford, has a population of 2,250. Although relatively close to large urban centres, Churchill has the character of a small country village. The village is settled around the junction of the A38 and A368 and is overlooked by Dolebury Warren, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Windmill Hill to the north, and the Mendip Hills, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), to the south. Churchill, like many villages, grew around its medieval church, and has many listed buildings reflecting the history of the parish. There is one primary school, a secondary school, a post office, several shops and small businesses, three churches, and four pubs serving the area. There is also a doctor's surgery, allotments at Pudding Pie Lane, a hotel, and a number of bed and breakfast establishments. Recreation facilties include a sports centre with swimming pool, a dry ski slope and an outdoor pursuits. There are active cricket, en-AU=association football}} and skittles clubs, and many other leisure and sporting activities, including music and walking groups. History= Toponymy  The origin of the name Churchill is uncertain. The word \\"cruc\\" meaning hillock or peak, survives from Anglo-Saxon as \\"crook\\" (Crook Peak), \\"creech\\" (Evercreech), \\"critch\\" (Critchell Farm near Frome). Consequently, one suggestion is that Churchill derived its name from the hillock which is now known as Windmill Hill at Churchill and became Cruc-hill or Cric-hill, often Chirchulle and later distorted to the more familiar Churchill. Attempts to explain its name by reference to the Norman, Roger de Courcelle, the holder of many Manors in Somerset, have been inconclusive and its origin may be nothing more than the proximity of an earlier chapel or church to Windmill Hill.  Pre-history  The village is settled around the junction of the A38 and A368 and is overlooked by Dolebury Warren, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Finds from the site demonstrate an extensive period of occupation, and include Palaeolithic flintwork, Bronze Age pottery, a bronze spearhead and Roman coins and pottery. In addition to the remains of double ramparts of an Iron Age hill fort still being visible there is also evidence of a medieval rabbit warren. At Dinghurst south of the village is the site of an Iron Age univallate hill fort and Roman fort. There is also some archaeological evidence to support Windmill Hill being used in Iron Age and Roman times as a hill fort and look-out point respectively. A prominent feature in the parish, Windmill Hill divides Churchill from Lower Langford, and gained its name from a windmill recorded in Churchill Manor in 1652. There is thought to have been a windmill there as early as the 13th or 14th century when they were first introduced to the region. Medieval The present village of Churchill, together with Lower Langford, has its more populous part either on or in close proximity to the A38 road: Churchill Court, the former Manor house, and the Church of St John the Baptist that adjoins it, is isolated on its western edge. Furthermore, Barrow Fields, The Berrys, and Pitchbury, are bare fields in front and beside the church. It has been suggested that the field names are corruptions of the Anglo-Saxon words \\"burh\\" or \\"beorg\\", meaning townships or mounds of ruined buildings, and that they refer to a medieval settlement now vanished and buried. A large scale map shows a clear pattern of ancient strip fields. Even where later enclosures and the amalgamation of adjoining strips have put hedges around the medieval plots, the lines of these boundaries run at a right-angle to the original strip lynchets and ridge and furrow pattern, both common medieval agricultural practices. In the dry summer of 1996 cropmarks emerged in Barrow Fields, visible from surrounding high ground, showing outlines of dwellings and field boundaries. There was a settled and developed farming community within Churchill, with the strip fields running out towards the open marshy levels, used for summer grazing, and with drove roads, still existing: Yanel Lane, Sandmead Drove and Common Lane giving access to them. It has been proposed that these droves converged at Churchill Green, the place where cattle, sheep and produce would be conveniently gathered and markets held. Accordingly, there is no clear reason why a village should disappear unless dispossessed by a landlord, anxious to surround his house with a park, or decimated by plague, of which there is no evidence. It is possible that as wheeled vehicles began to replace the packhorse trains, and traffic grew through the gap in the hills beyond Churchill Gate, the eastern end of the settlement grew and the houses around the church were deserted. The Domesday survey did not mention Churchill since it was part of the Manor of Banwell, in the Hundred of Winterstoke, belonging to the Bishop of Bath and Wells and not held in fee direct from the King. Churchill is first mentioned as a separate Manor in 1231 in an award made by Bishop Jocelin of Wells concerning the \\"chapel of Churchill\\", and in the same document Robert Fitzpayne, Sheriff of Somerset under Henry II, and John de la Stocke, are mentioned as local landowners. Stock Lane still carries the name of the 13th century inhabitant and the Fitzpaynes lived at Churchill Court for some two hundred years. Post-medieval Sir John Churchill, knighted in 1670, purchased the Manor of Churchill from Richard Jenyns in 1671. He died in 1685, greatly in debt, and Churchill Manor, which he left to his daughter Lady Scroggs, was sold, after complicated litigation, with his other property. The deer park (Churchill Park) enclosed large swathes of land to the north of the main village, with some of the walls still standing around the boundary. There is also evidence of mills and fishponds associated with the manor. 18th and 19th centuries Broad areas of land were enclosed by the Enclosure Acts in the 18th and 19th centuries. A steep, rocky and untarmacked lane called the Batch was the old Bristol and Exeter coach road, until 1824, when the Commissioners of the Bristol Turnpike Trust determined that they would create a new toll road to avoid the steep incline of the original. A new toll house was built and gate installed across Churchill Gate near Four Cross. The new road, now New Road that constitutes part of the A38, joined the Bristol Turnpike road of Winford and was completed by November 1826. Before that year, the toll road passed in front of the inn called the Nelson Arms in the corner of Skinners Lane and Dinghurst Road, and up to the top of the Batch, coming out into the present road again in Star, a hamlet in the parish of Shipham. Geography The area is predominantly agricultural, with a high proportion of pasture land. The southern border of the parish lies within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and rises to a height of about . This southern area is extensively wooded but also contains large areas of open downland. Much of Churchill parish is low lying moorland to the west and north west where it is less than feet above sea level. The lowest part is on the North Somerset Levels where it is only above sea level. Further north the land descends into the valley of the Congresbury Yeo river which ultimately drains westward into the Bristol Channel between the coastal towns of Clevedon and Weston-super-Mare. This northern area is sparsely populated and artificially drained, lying almost at sea level, where drainage ditches, or rhynes, replace stone walls and hedges as the field boundaries. The streams, together with the Congresbury Yeo, delineate much of the parish boundary and in the east, the Langford Brook, flowing through Lower Langford, divides that community into two; only the western part being included within Churchill Parish. Windmill hill is high and gives good views across the Vale of Wrington, towards the Mendip Hills, the iron age hillfort at Dolebury, the Bristol Channel and Wales to the west and towards the Chew Valley to the east. On Dinghurst Road, the views are dominated by the meadows on Lyncombe Hill and the Mendip Hills. The land is of the fertile Mercia Mudstone Group, formed of red layers of mudstone and siltstone of Triassic age (see Keuper marl), with peat at the Somerset Levels, giving good pasture on the Mendip Hills. The edge of the hills has carboniferous limestone that has been exposed on the Black Down Pericline due to the erosion of the overlying Triassic dolomitic conglomerate. The dolomitic conglomerate and limestone is used in local buildings and walls. A quarry for conglomerate stone was on the north side of Windmill Hill. Mines in Dolebury Warren have sought lead (galena) with silver, iron (haematite), ochre (limonite), manganese (for glass making) and zinc carbonate (calamine); the latter for brass manufacture. Important features like Dolebury Warren and Burrington Combe were formed by the action of water. Like Cheddar they may be collapsed caves or created by meltwater rushing off the hills during the end of glacial periods. Governance Sculpture made from the Wellingtonia tree planted for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 From 1894 to 1974 Churchill was part of the Axbridge Rural District. When this was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 it became part of the Woodspring district in the new county of Avon. In 1996 this became the North Somerset unitary authority, as established by the Local Government Act 1992, which remains part of the ceremonial county of Somerset. The Blagdon and Churchill ward is represented by one councillor on the North Somerset Council. There are thirteen parish councillors, either elected on a four-yearly basis or co-opted when a vacancy occurs. The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the memorial hall, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Weston-super-Mare county constituency. The MP for the constituency is John Penrose of the Conservative Party, who first won the seat in the 2005 General Election. Population After World War II new houses were built around the crossroads and towards Lower Langford. The parish contains two substantial population groupings, Churchill and Lower Langford, and their centres are separated by about a mile. However, beginning in the late 1980s, development of an area lying between these centres has added some 200 new homes, and this development has served substantially to unite the two centres. Nevertheless, Churchill is still an important agricultural area and retains its rural appeal. Consequently, it has now developed into both a retirement area and a dormitory for people working in Weston-super-Mare and Bristol.  Transport  The South West Falcon coach The village is not well-served by buses, but services are available to Weston-Super-Mare, Bristol, Wells, Cheddar, Shipham, and a limited number of other destinations. A Stagecoach bus, known as the \\"South West Falcon\\", connects Devon with Somerset, Bristol Airport and Bristol, and can be boarded from a number of bus stops in the parish. Three heavily trafficked major roads traverse the parish: the A38, the A368 and the B313. Congestion results from the lack of an adequate east-west road link immediately south of Bristol. However, Churchill's proximity to Bristol Airport and Yatton Railway Station, and to the M5 Motorway, junction 21 is , and junction 22 is , make it a good location for people whose work takes them about the country. The second Severn Crossing adds to mobility and the M4 is away. Education Churchill Academy and Sixth Form exterior There are two schools within the parish: a Church of England Voluntary Controlled (CEVC) primary school, serving both Churchill and Langford, and Churchill Academy and Sixth Form, a large state-run secondary school and specialist Arts College, serving nearby villages in North Somerset. Churchill Primary School has around 200 pupils aged 4 to 11 years and is located in the adjacent village of Lower Langford. It was newly built in 2002 after relocating from its former location at Ladymead Lane. Churchill Academy, built in the 1960s, has around 1,550 students between the ages of 11 and 18 years and is located on Churchill Green. Facilities include the sixth form centre, cafeterias and the neighbouring Churchill Sports Centre with playing fields. Langford House, built in the middle of the 19th century, has more recently become home to the Veterinary School of the University of Bristol, with around 650 undergraduate and postgraduate students and 300 staff. About half of the veterinary students live on site, or in surrounding villages, and others reside in Bristol. Religious sites Churchill Methodist Church, Front Street, Churchill, Somerset The church of St John the Baptist was built around 1360 and restored in 1879.

In popular culture On 18 November 1940, American magazine Life published a major feature on the village and its residents. It was intended as an American wartime propaganda exercise to show the world \\"the secret of British courage under the German bombs\\" and sought to gain American support for the British war effort. Included were many photographs taken by Cecil Beaton. In December 1940, Path√© News followed-up the article with a short film on village life in Churchill. During the fifth episode of series three of Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson crashed a Toyota Hilux into an oak tree in the car park of St John the Baptist Church. The churchwarden had presumed that the damage had been accidental until the Top Gear episode was broadcast. After the BBC was contacted, the director of Top Gear admitted guilt and the broadcaster paid compensation.

This is one of the busiest days in the shooting season, with large amounts of game being shot. The date itself is traditional; the current legislation enshrining it in England and Wales is the Game Act 1831 (and in Northern Ireland, the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985). Not all game (as defined by the 1831 act) have the same start to their open seasons ‚Äì most begin on 1 September, with 1 October for woodcock and pheasant. Since English law prohibits game bird shooting on a Sunday, the start date is postponed to 13 August on years when the 12th falls on a Sunday. Because grouse are in effect farmed for shooting, their population density is unnaturally high and they are particularly liable to outbreaks of disease such as sheep tick, heather beetle and the gut parasite Trichostrongylus tenuis, their numbers fluctuate considerably from year to year. In recent years, the Glorious Twelfth has also been hit by hunt saboteurs, the 2001 foot and mouth crisis (which further postponed the date in affected areas) and severe flooding and bad weather. In some seasons where certain moors are hit by low numbers of grouse, shooting may not occur at all or may be over by September.

He is the founder and CEO of Whalerock Industries, a Los Angeles based media and technology company. Early life and education Braun was born in New York, the son of Merna and David Braun, an entertainment attorney. He was raised in New Hyde Park. He earned a B.A. degree from Vassar College in 1980, and received a J.D. degree from the University of California's Hastings College of the Law in 1983. Career Braun began his career as an entertainment attorney. His clients included Larry David, Howard Stern and David Chase. The character Lloyd Braun on the sitcom Seinfeld, created by David, was named after him. In an interview between Larry David and Howard Stern, David said that a conversation he had with Braun about Braun's father served as a 'jumping-off point' for the writing of his Broadway play 'Fish In The Dark'.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj2xtjq_ppg American Broadcasting Company Braun's first major success came with producer David Chase for their idea for the show The Sopranos. He went on to serve as the Chairman of the ABC Entertainment Group from 2002 to 2004. Braun was forced out of his position at ABC shortly after greenlighting the $13 million pilot to the television show Lost, one of the most expensive in modern broadcasting. The script of Lost had been heavily criticized by Michael Eisner and Robert Iger, who were CEO and COO of ABC's parent Disney, nonetheless Braun pushed on with filming the pilot episode in Hawaii saying \\"If we are pregnant enough, they won't shut us down\\". Braun's decision was vindicated, however, when the show went on to become a huge success. Braun and his partner, Susan Lyne, also greenlit other ABC shows that went on to great success in the years following his dismissal, including Desperate Housewives, Extreme Makeover Home Edition, Boston Legal and Grey's Anatomy. These shows began an unprecedented turnaround for ABC. Yahoo! Media Group and Whalerock Industries In November 2004, Braun joined Yahoo! to run Yahoo! Media Group, the company's content division. While at Yahoo!, Braun initiated and oversaw the development of the highly successful celebrity site OMG! Braun also developed the daily video show \\"The 9\\" and oversaw major redesigns of Yahoo!'s media sites. Braun resigned from Yahoo! in December 2006 to partner with Gail Berman to form the entertainment company BermanBraun. BermanBraun entered into a strategic alliance with NBC to create television programming for which NBC would have a first look. In August 2010, BermanBraun announced a multiyear partnership with Starcom MediaVest to create new digital content and advertising solutions available \\"first\\" to SMG clients. SMG is part of Publicis Groupe, the world's third-largest communications group. Since 2007, BermanBraun has established itself in content production, with properties across three platforms: television, digital and film. In scripted television, BermanBraun is currently producing Alphas on the Syfy network. Also in production is the second season of the unscripted series Brad Meltzer's Decoded for History Channel and Unchained Reaction, to be produced with MythBusters stars Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage for Discovery Channel. BermanBraun is also launching two unscripted shows: Polyamory for Showtime and Junk Gypsies for HGTV later in 2012. In March 2012, BermanBraun purchased Whiskey Media, acquiring the websites Tested, Screened, and Anime Vice. Tested was quickly redesigned and rebranded as MythBusters' Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage's personal website.

It provides an alternative to the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable but is only supported by a small number of games. The Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter is also compatible with the Game Boy Advance SP, Game Boy Player, and e-Reader. Connectivity A Pearl Pink Game Boy Advance SP with the wireless adapter attached Like the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable, this device allows for multiplayer gaming with the Game Boy Advance, and attaches via the External Extension Connector. The range of this adapter is short compared to the built-in wireless function of the Nintendo DS; Nintendo recommends players stay within 10 ft. (about 3m) of each other for best results. Note that due to the Game Boy Micro's different style link cable port, the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter will not attach to it. However, a Game Boy Micro Wireless Adapter is available for the Game Boy Micro which is compatible for linking with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter. Neither wireless adapter can connect with the Nintendo DS since the DS does not support multiplayer mode in Game Boy Advance games. The Wireless Adapter plugged in to a Game Boy Player. One of the wireless adapter's greatest uses is in Pok√©mon FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald. While all three still support the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable, up to thirty-nine wireless adapter- connected players can convene in a virtual in-game lobby called the \\"Union Room\\" for battles and trades. The wireless adapter is also used in Pok√©mon games to download special data via the Mystery Gift option at various Pok√©mon- related events. Besides the Union Room in certain Pok√©mon versions, the wireless adapter only supports up to five players. A major drawback of the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter is that it is not backwards compatible; that is, it will only work with games that have been programmed to support the wireless adapter, excluding all older model Game Boy games. As of July 2009, only about 30 Game Boy Advance games support the wireless adapter, and many of the few supported games are the bit Generations series (Japan only) and the Classic NES Series.

It is located at the corner of Logan Street and Colfax Avenue in the North Capitol Hill neighborhood of central Denver. History A statue of John Paul II commemorates his 1993 Mass Construction of the cathedral started in 1902 and was completed in 1911 with a final cost of approximately $500,000. The inaugural Mass was held on October 27, 1912, and consecration was in 1921. On August 7, 1912, lightning struck the west tower causing damage to the upper ; however, this was repaired before the opening. The cathedral was raised to the status of minor basilica on Christmas Day 1979. On August 13 and 14, 1993 (for World Youth Day), Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass at the cathedral, one of only a few cathedrals in the United States so honored. In June 1997, lightning struck a second time, but this time damaged the east tower. The parish completed work to restore the tower within eight months. Architecture Architect Leon Coquard of Detroit designed the cathedral in the French Gothic style. Its character is influenced by the 13th-century Saint Nicholas Collegiate church (coll√©giale Saint-Nicolas) of Munster, Moselle, France, which is the birthplace of Bishop Nicholas Chrysostom Matz, who supervised cathedral construction. The building is in the shape of a Latin cross measuring with the nave rising to . The main fa√ßade houses three entrances and is framed by two spires. The structure is constructed of Indiana limestone and granite from Gunnison, Colorado. The altar, statuary, and bishop's chair are all made of Carrara marble, while other elements feature Yule marble stone from Marble, Colorado. The 75 stained glass windows are from the Royal Bavarian Art Institute in Munich founded by Franz Xaver Zettler. When opened, the cathedral could accommodate 1,000 worshipers. However, due significant alterations in the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council (including the removal of the historic stone altar rail and the expansion of the chancel to accommodate a second, freestanding altar) the church now accommodates only 800. Ministries The cathedral offers three daily and six Sunday Masses as well as other sacraments regularly. Additional services to the community include the yearly provision of 50,000 - 60,000 lunches to the poor in the area.

History The initiative for the canal came from Providence, where a merchant community wished to profit from trade with the farming country of the Blackstone Valley and Worcester County.Teachushistory.orgBlackstone Canal-artery-heart of the Commonwealth The people of Worcester and the Blackstone Valley, eager for transport that would enable them to get better prices for their produce, welcomed the plan. However, since the trade of central Massachusetts was at that time going overland through the port of Boston, Massachusetts commercial interests succeeded in stalling the project for several years. Finally, in 1823, the Blackstone Canal Company was organized through an act of the Massachusetts legislature, with a Rhode Island company soon following.Muir, Diana, Reflections in Bullough's Pond, University Press of New England, p.112 The canal's construction may have been motivated by competition among rival industrialists to curtail \\"water rights\\". Construction began in 1825 and cost $750,000 (twice its initial estimate). The canal opened on October 7, 1828 when the packet boat Lady Carrington arrived in Worcester, the first vessel to make the trip. The canal brought immediate prosperity to Worcester and the Valley; farmers' profits increased and mills were built, especially in Worcester. Using water to transport goods was a great improvement over the rough roads of the era. At the time of its construction, it represented the best available transportation technology. It was a two-day trip for the canal boats from Worcester to Providence and another two-day trip to return to Worcester. The overnight stopping point was in Uxbridge. Boston merchants moved to recapture the trade moving down the canal to Providence, opening a rail line to Worcester in 1835. (Boston merchants opened three railroads in 1835, one to Lowell, one to Worcester, and one to Providence, RI. These were very new technology.) In 1847 the parallel Providence and Worcester Railroad began operation, and the canal closed in 1848. The canal was 35 feet or more in width. It ascended 451 feet, passing through an original 49 locks. The canal used \\"slack-water\\" to bypass narrow valley areas and intersected the Blackstone River 16 times over its 45-mile course. It ran in the river itself for 10% of its length. These portions proved troublesome since in summer, water was sometimes too low for navigation. In other periods, flooding was the problem. Winter added ice to the issues. Each lock was 70 feet long by 10 feet wide and apparently 4‚Äì4.5 feet deep. All, except the wooden tide lock at Providence, were built of granite on a wooden foundation. The average lift of each lock was 9.2 feet, but there were variations. The canal was engineered by Benjamin Wright (chief engineer of the Erie Canal) and Holmes Hutchinson (later Chief Engineer of New York's canals) as they were concluding work on the original Erie Canal. Its locks are therefore similar, although smaller, than the original Erie's. The canal followed the course of Mill Creek from the center of Worcester, MA to the southern part of that community. It then followed the Blackstone River downstream to Ashton, RI. At Ashton, it paralleled the river's west bank, maintaining elevation until it entered Cranberry and Scotts Ponds on the divide of the watershed with the Moshassuck River. It then locked down into the Moshassuck Valley and followed that stream into Providence, RI. The canal today Since the canal's closure, parts of its watercourse were filled and other segments are now heavily overgrown with brush and trees. Other sections were converted to hydraulic canals for textile mills. Much of the lock masonry was sold for other purposes. Its remains, however, are still visible in many locations. About 85% of the canal remains. Two long sections of the canal exist in the Blackstone River and Canal Heritage State Park in Massachusetts and the Blackstone River State Park in Rhode Island. Other sections are also publicly owned. The canal is the subject of several listings on the National Register of Historic Places. The southernmost portion of the canal, between Providence and the Ashton Dam in Lincoln, Rhode Island, was listed in 1971; this list was expanded in 1991 to include the entire Rhode Island section. A section of the canal in Uxbridge and Northbridge Massachusetts was listed in 1973; this listing was expanded in 1995 to encompass the entire historic footprint of the canal in Massachusetts. A section of the Blackstone River Bikeway in Lincoln, Rhode Island follows the original canal towpath with the river on one side of the riders and the canal on the other.  Significance  The Blackstone Canal is historically significant as a transportation network arising from a canal- building frenzy of the early 19th-century. The canal played a key role in stimulating the industry between Providence and Worcester and the towns and villages along the Moshassuck and Blackstone Rivers. Though its useful service life was just twenty years long, the canal and the parks incorporating the canal are \\"visible and tangible parts of the city's and the state's history of growth, planning, commercial ambition and prosperity\\".

He was known for his provocative lingerie collections, which, though designed for elegant boudoirs, were often worn in public. He created the two famous dresses of Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin\\" music video. Sanchez was awarded several Coty fashion awards, as well as a Council of Fashion Designers of America Award in 1981. Biography Sanchez was born into a wealthy family in Antwerp, Belgium. His father died when he was very young. When Sanchez was in his teens, he would go with his mother to Paris to see Jacques Fath's designs. Later, he sent a portfolio to Fath, who recommended him to the √âcole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, a fashion school in Paris. There, he ended up a classmate of Yves Saint Laurent. While St. Laurent would later revolutionize how women dressed during the day, Sanchez would revolutionize how women dressed at night. In 1960, inspired by the movie West Side Story, he moved to New York City fifteen days after watching it.Wendy Goodman, \\"Scenes From a Classic Fourteen\\" , New York, Nov. 15, 2004 Sanchez started his own company in 1974, where he introduced techniques normally used in dress construction to slips and caftans, making underwear resemble outerwear. He did not deem his work to be merely lingerie, and it was not treated as such by the fashion world. His fashion shows were as highly attended as those of more conventional designers. His work foreshadowed the mainstream acceptance of lingerie-like clothing in the 1990s. He designed the lingerie used by Cher in the comedy horror The Witches of Eastwick and some dresses for Tina Turner shows. Elizabeth Taylor wore one Sanchez dress for one Vanity Fair cover in 1992. Very known in New York, he was a regular at Studio 54 nightclub and his agenda of friends and contacts included Yves Saint Laurent, Liza Minnelli, Andy Warhol, Jerry Hall... Sanchez later worked for Nina Ricci, Christian Dior (where St. Laurent hired him to design lingerie), the New York lingerie company Warner's, and Yalla Inc.

Her original song, Boys and Girls, a rock ballad themed after the Beslan school hostage crisis, was chosen by a jury after a pre-selection vote by Belarusian viewers. However, due to the song's poor reception across Europe, the Belarusian state broadcaster decided in a highly unusual move to allow Angelica to sing a different song in Kyiv. She ordered songs from two composers with successful Eurovision records: the Israeli author of 1998 winner Diva Svika Pick, and the author of Antique's hit Die For You Nikos Terzis. After long hesitation, Agurbash picked the Greek disco anthem Love Me Tonight.

The four- disc set contains all 45 singles released by Sinatra during his tenure at the label between 1953 and 1961. Of those, 25 made the Top 40 on the Billboard singles chart. It does not include releases specifically for jukeboxes or for extended play singles, with one exception. The original tapes were digitally remastered by Bob Norberg. Content The packaging includes many photographs, detailed session notes, and a long essay by Will Friedwald, who explains that Sinatra followed a \\"singles aesthetic\\" that set these songs quite apart from the \\"concept\\" albums he was recording at Capitol simultaneously. Of the 96 tracks included in the box, six were not Sinatra singles. \\"Well, Did You Evah!,\\" a duet with Bing Crosby, is the b-side to Capitol single 3507A \\"True Love\\" by Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly. The five others are tracks 23 through 27 on disc four: \\"Look to Your Heart\\" appeared on an EP single released to promote the 1955 television production of Our Town with Sinatra cast as the stage manager; two appeared on compilation albums; two others were introduced on this set. Several songs are duets with other artists. \\"How Are Ya' Fixed for Love\\" and its flip \\"Nothing in Common\\" present Sinatra with Keely Smith, the usual singing partner of Louis Prima. The Pied Pipers, whom Sinatra had worked alongside while with Tommy Dorsey, appear with their new singer June Hutton on \\"Don't Change Your Mind About Me.\\" Celeste Holm appears on \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\"; those two songs along with the aforementioned Crosby duet \\"Well, Did You Evah!,\\" \\"Mind if I Make Love to You?,\\" and \\"You're Sensational\\" also appear in the 1956 film High Society. A doo-wop vocal group the Nuggets provide vocal backing for his rock and roll single \\"Two Hearts, Two Kisses,\\" and the Ralph Brewster Singers are credited for the holiday single \\"The Christmas Waltz\\" with \\"Mistletoe and Holly.\\" Most tracks were arranged by Sinatra's mainstay while at Capitol, Nelson Riddle; exceptions are listed below.

Folsey earned his first screen credit for His Bridal Night in 1919. Leading lady Alice Brady was so satisfied with the way he photographed her she offered him a contract to shoot all her films. He worked for both Associated First National and Paramount Astoria Studios before relocating to Hollywood and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he spent the bulk of his career.Encyclopedia of Cinematographers Folsey's many credits include The Letter, The Cocoanuts, Animal Crackers, The Great Ziegfeld, A Guy Named Joe, The White Cliffs of Dover, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Clock, The Harvey Girls, Adam's Rib, A Life of Her Own, Million Dollar Mermaid, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, The Cobweb, Cash McCall, and The Balcony. For television he served as director of photography for various episodes of the ABC series The Fugitive and an NBC special starring figure skater Peggy Fleming, for which he won an Emmy Award for Best Cinematography For Nonfiction Programming. Folsey was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography thirteen times but never won. Eight months before his death, he was honored with the first Lifetime Achievement Award presented by the American Society of Cinematographers, for which he served as President in 1956‚Äì57.

The term was popularized by Soviet writer and sociologist Aleksandr Zinovyev, who wrote the book titled Homo Sovieticus. Michel Heller asserted that the term was coined in the introduction of a 1974 monograph \\"Sovetskye lyudi\\" (\\"Soviet People\\") to describe the next level of evolution of humanity thanks to the success of Marxist social experiment. In a book published in 1981, but available in samizdat in the 1970s, Zinovyev also coined an abbreviation homosos (–≥–æ–º–æ—Å–æ—Å, literally a homosucker). Characteristics The idea that the Soviet system would create a new, better kind of Soviet people was first postulated by the advocates of the system; they called the prospective outcome the \\"New Soviet man\\". Homo Sovieticus, however, was a term with largely negative connotations, invented by opponents to describe what they saw as the real result of Soviet policies. In many ways it meant the opposite of the New Soviet man, someone characterized by the following: * Indifference to the results of his labour (as expressed in the saying \\"They pretend they are paying us, and we pretend we are working\\"). * Lack of initiative and avoidance of taking any individual responsibility for anything. Jerzy Turowicz wrote: \\"it's a person enslaved, incapacitated, deprived of initiative, unable to think critically; he expects ‚Äì and demands ‚Äì everything to be provided by the state, he cannot and doesn't want to take his fate in his own hands\\".Liberi sine fano. * Indifference to common property and to petty theft from the workplace, either for personal use or for profit.1917‚Äì1987: Unsuccessful and Tragic Attempt to Create a \\"New Man\\" . A line from a popular song, \\"Everything belongs to the kolkhoz, everything belongs to me\\" (\\"\\" / vsyo teper—å kolkhoznoe, vsyo teper—å moyo), meaning that people on collective farms treasured all common property as their own, was sometimes used ironically to refer to instances of petty theft. * Chauvinism. The Soviet Union's restrictions on travel abroad and strict censorship of information in the media (as well as the abundance of propaganda) aimed to insulate the Soviet people from Western influence. There existed non-public \\"ban lists\\" of Western entertainers and bands, which, in addition to the usual criteria of not conforming to fundamental Soviet values, were added to the list for rather peculiar reasons; one such example being the Irish band U2, the name of which resembled that of Lockheed U-2, a high-altitude U.S. reconnaissance airplane. As a result, \\"exotic\\" Western popular culture became more interesting precisely because it was forbidden. Due to limited exposure, entertainers considered minor, B-list, or of low artistic value in the West were regarded as A-list in the Soviet sphere. Soviet officials called this fascination \\"Western idolatry\\" / \\"Idolatry before the West\\" ( / idolopoklonnichestvo pered Zapadom). * Obedience to or passive acceptance of everything that government imposes (see authoritarianism). * In the opinion of a former US ambassador to Kazakhstan, a tendency to drink heavily: \\"[a Kazakh defence minister] appears to enjoy loosening up in the tried and true Homo Sovieticus style ‚Äì i.e., drinking oneself into a stupor\\".Greg McArthur \\"Vain, shady and stupendously fat: Latest WikiLeaks like a teen's diary\\", The Globe and Mail, 30 November 2010. According to Leszek Kolakowski, the Short course history of the CPSU(b) played a crucial role in forming the key social and mental features of the Homo Sovieticus as a \\"textbook of false memory and double thinking\\". Over the years, Soviet people were forced to continuously repeat and accept constantly changing editions of the Short course, each containing a slightly different version of the past events. This inevitably led to forming \\"a new Soviet man: ideological schizophrenic, honest liar, person always ready for constant and voluntary mental self-mutilations\\".

Kelvin referred to the device as his water-dropping condenser. The apparatus is variously called the Kelvin hydroelectric generator, the Kelvin electrostatic generator, or Lord Kelvin's thunderstorm. The device uses falling water to generate voltage differences by electrostatic induction occurring between interconnected, oppositely charged systems. This eventually leads to an electric arc discharging in the form of a spark. It is used in physics education to demonstrate the principles of electrostatics. Fig. 1: Schematic setup for the Kelvin water dropper.  Description  A typical setup is shown in Fig. 1. A reservoir of water or other conducting liquid (top, green) is connected to two hoses that release two falling streams of drops, which land in two buckets or containers (bottom, blue and red). Each stream passes (without touching) through a metal ring or open cylinder which is electrically connected to the opposite receiving container; the left ring (blue) is connected to the right bucket, while the right ring (red) is connected to the left bucket. The containers must be electrically insulated from each other and from electrical ground. Similarly, the rings must be electrically isolated from each other and their environment. It is necessary for the streams to break into separate droplets before reaching the containers. Typically, the containers are made of metal and the rings are connected to them by wires. The simple construction makes this device popular in physics education as a laboratory experiment for students.  Principles of operation  A small initial difference in electric charge between the two buckets, which always exists because the buckets are insulated from each other, is necessary to begin the charging process. Suppose, therefore, that the right bucket has a small positive charge. Now the left ring also has some positive charge because it is connected to the bucket. The charge on the left ring will attract negative charges in the water (ions) into the left-hand stream by the Coulomb electrostatic attraction. When a drop breaks off the end of the left-hand stream, the drop carries a negative charge with it. When the negatively charged water drop falls into its bucket (the left one), it gives that bucket and the attached ring (the right one) a negative charge. Once the right ring has a negative charge, it similarly attracts positive charge into the right-hand stream. When drops break off the end of that stream, they carry positive charge to the positively charged bucket, making that bucket even more positively charged. Thus positive charges are attracted to the right-hand stream by the ring, and positive charge drips into the positively charged right bucket. Negative charges are attracted to the left-hand stream and negative charge drips into the negatively charged left bucket. This process of charge separation that occurs in the water is called electrostatic induction. The higher the charge that accumulates in each bucket, the higher the electrical potential on the rings and the more effective this process of electrostatic induction is. During the induction process, there is an electric current that flows in the form of positive or negative ions in the water of the supply lines. This is separate from the bulk flow of water that falls through the rings and breaks into droplets on the way to the containers. For example, as water approaches the negatively charged ring on the right, any free electrons in the water can easily flee toward the left, against the flow of water. Eventually, when both buckets have become highly charged, several different effects may be seen. An electric spark may briefly arc between the two buckets or rings, decreasing the charge on each bucket. If there is a steady stream of water through the rings, and if the streams are not perfectly centered in the rings, one can observe the deflection of the streams prior to each spark due to the electrostatic attraction via Coulomb's law of opposite charges. As charging increases, a smooth and steady stream may fan out due to self-repulsion of the net charges in the stream. If the water flow is set such that it breaks into droplets in the vicinity of the rings, the drops may be attracted to the rings enough to touch the rings and deposit their charge on the oppositely charged rings, which decreases the charge on that side of the system. In that case also, the buckets will start to electrostatically repel the droplets falling towards them, and may fling the droplets away from the buckets. Each of these effects will limit the voltage that can be reached by the device. The voltages reached by this device can be in the range of kilovolts, but the amounts of charge are small, so there is no more danger to persons than that of static electrical discharges produced by shuffling feet on a carpet, for example. The opposite charges which build up on the buckets represent electrical potential energy, as shown by the energy released as light and heat when a spark passes between them. This energy comes from the gravitational potential energy released when the water falls. The charged falling water drops do work against the opposing electric field of the like-charged containers, which exerts an upward force against them, converting gravitational potential energy into electrical potential energy, plus motional kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is wasted as heat when the water drops land in the buckets, so when considered as an electric power generator the Kelvin machine is very inefficient. However, the principle of operation is the same as with other forms of hydroelectric power. As always, energy is conserved.  Details  Fig. 3: A Kelvin water dropper set up at the 2014 Cambridge Science Festival If the buckets are metal conductors, then the built-up charge resides on the outside of the metal, not in the water. This is part of the electrical induction process, and is an example of the related \\"Faraday's ice bucket.\\" Also, the idea of bringing small amounts of charge into the center of a large metal object with a large net charge, as happens in Kelvin's water dropper, relies on the same physics as in the operation of a van de Graaff generator. The discussion above is in terms of charged droplets falling. The inductive charging effects occur while the water stream is continuous. This is because the flow and separation of charge occurs already when the streams of water approach the rings, so that when the water passes through the rings there is already net charge on the water. When drops form, some net charge is trapped on each drop as gravity pulls it toward the like-charged container. When the containers are metal, the wires may be attached to the metal. Otherwise, the container-end of each wire must dip into the water. In the latter case, the charge resides on the surface of the water, not outside of the containers. The apparatus can be extended to more than two streams of droplets.Markus Zahn, \\"Self-excited a.c. high voltage generation using water droplets,\\" American Journal of Physics, vol. 41, pages 196-202 (1973). In 2013, a combined group from the University of Twente (the Netherlands) constructed a microfluidic version of the Kelvin water dropper, which yields electrical voltages able to charge, deform and break water droplets of micrometric size by just using pneumatic force instead of gravity.Alvaro G.

Contrasting fabrics, slashes, embroidery, applied trims, and other forms of surface ornamentation remained prominent. The wide silhouette, conical for women with breadth at the hips and broadly square for men with width at the shoulders had reached its peak in the 1530s, and by mid-century a tall, narrow line with a V-lined waist was back in fashion. Sleeves and women's skirts then began to widen again, with emphasis at the shoulder that would continue into the next century. The characteristic garment of the period was the ruff, which began as a modest ruffle attached to the neckband of a shirt or smock and grew into a separate garment of fine linen, trimmed with lace, cutwork or embroidery, and shaped into crisp, precise folds with starch and heated irons. General trends Isaac Oliver's allegorical painting of 1590‚Äì95 contrasts virtuous and licentious dress and behavior. Spanish style Charles V, king of Spain, Naples, and Sicily and Holy Roman Emperor, handed over the kingdom of Spain to his son Philip II and the Empire to his brother Ferdinand I in 1558, ending the domination of western Europe by a single court, but the Spanish taste for sombre richness of dress would dominate fashion for the remainder of the century.Boucher, Fran√ßois: 20,000 Years of FashionAshelford, Jane: The Art of Dress: Clothing and Society 1500‚Äì1914, Abrams, 1996. New alliances and trading patterns arose as the divide between Catholic and Protestant countries became more pronounced. The severe, rigid fashions of the Spanish court were dominant everywhere except France and Italy. Black garments were worn for the most formal occasions. Black was difficult and expensive to dye, and seen as luxurious, if in an austere way. As well as Spanish courtiers, it appealed to wealthy middle-class Protestants. Regional styles were still distinct. The clothing was very intricate, elaborate and made with heavy fabrics such as velvet and raised silk, topped off with brightly coloured jewellery such as rubies, diamond and pearls to contrast the black backdrop of the clothing.Fernand Braudel, Civilization and Capitalism, 15th‚Äì18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life, p. 317, William Collins & Sons, London 1981 Janet Arnold in her analysis of Queen Elizabeth's wardrobe records identifies French, Italian, Dutch, and Polish styles for bodices and sleeves, as well as Spanish.Arnold, Janet: Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd, W S Maney and Son Ltd, Leeds 1988. Italian doublet and hose decorated with applied trim and parallel cuts contrast with a severe black jerkin, 1560. Linen ruffs grew from a narrow frill at neck and wrists to a broad \\"cartwheel\\" style that required a wire support by the 1580s. Ruffs were worn throughout Europe, by men and women of all classes, and were made of rectangular lengths of linen as long as 19 yards. Later ruffs were made of delicate reticella, a cutwork lace that evolved into the needlelaces of the 17th century.Montupet, Janine, and Ghislaine Schoeller: Lace: The Elegant Web,  Elizabethan Style  Since Elizabeth I, Queen of England, was the ruler, women's fashion became one of the most important aspects of this period. As the Queen was always required to have a pure image, and although women's fashion became increasingly seductive, the idea of the perfect Elizabethan women was never forgotten. The Elizabethan era had its own customs and social rules that were reflected in their fashion. Style would depend usually of social status and Elizabethans were bound to obey The Elizabethan Sumptuary Laws, which oversaw the style and materials worn. Elizabethan sumptuary laws were used to control behaviour and to ensure that a specific social structure was maintained. These rules were well known by all the English people and penalties for violating these sumptuary laws included harsh fines. Most of the time they ended in the loss of property, title and even life. Regarding fabrics and materials for the clothes construction, only royalty was permitted to wear ermine. Other nobles (lesser ones) were allowed only to wear foxes and otters. Clothes worn during this era were mostly inspired by geometric shapes, probably derived from the high interest in science and mathematics from that era. \\"Padding and quilting together with the use of whalebone or buckram for stiffening purposes were used to gain geometric effect with emphasis on giving the illusion of a small waist\\". The upper classes, too, were restricted. Certain materials such as cloth of gold could only be worn by the Queen, her mother, children, aunts, sisters, along with Duchesses, Marchionesses, and Countesses. Whereas, Viscountesses, or Baronesses, for instance, were not allowed to use this material. Not only fabrics were restricted on the Elizabethan era, but also colours, depending on social status. Purple was only allowed to be worn by the queen and her direct family members. Depending on social status, the colour could be used in any clothing or would be limited to mantles, doublets, jerkins, or other specific items. Lower classes were only allowed to use brown, beige, yellow, orange, green, grey and blue in wool, linen and sheepskin, while usual fabrics for upper crusts were silk or velvet. Fabrics and trims The general trend towards abundant surface ornamentation in the Elizabethan Era was expressed in clothing, especially amongst the aristocracy in England. Shirts and chemises were embroidered with blackwork and edged in lace. Heavy cut velvets and brocades were further ornamented with applied bobbin lace, gold and silver embroidery, and jewels.Arnold, Janet: Patterns of Fashion: the cut and construction of clothes for men and women 1560‚Äì1620, Macmillan 1985. Revised edition 1986. () Toward the end of the period, polychrome (multicoloured) silk embroidery became highly desirable and fashionable for the public representation of aristocratic wealth.Digby, George Wingfield: Elizabethan Embroidery, Thomas Yoseloff The origins of the trend for sombre colours are elusive, but are generally attributed to the growing influence of Spain and possibly the importation of Spanish merino wools. The Low Countries, German states, Scandinavia, England, France, and Italy all absorbed the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid-1520s. Fine textiles could be dyed \\"in the grain\\" (with the expensive kermes), alone or as an over-dye with woad, to produce a wide range colours from blacks and greys through browns, murreys, purples, and sanguines.Munro, John H. \\"Medieval Woollens: Textiles, Technology, and Organisation\\". In Jenkins (2003), pp. 214‚Äì215.Boucher, Fran√ßois: 20,000 Years of Fashion, pp. 219 and 244 Inexpensive reds, oranges and pinks were dyed with madder and blues with woad, while a variety of common plants produced yellow dyes, although most were prone to fading. By the end of the period, there was a sharp distinction between the sober fashions favoured by Protestants in England and the Netherlands, which still showed heavy Spanish influence, and the light, revealing fashions of the French and Italian courts. This distinction would carry over well into the seventeenth century. Women's fashion Spanish fashion: Elizabeth of Valois, Queen of Spain, wears a black gown with floor-length sleeves lined in white, with the cone-shaped skirts created by the Spanish farthingale, 1565. Elizabeth I wears padded shoulder rolls and an embroidered partlet and sleeves. Her low-necked chemise is just visible above the arched bodice, 1572. Women's outer clothing generally consisted of a loose or fitted gown worn over a kirtle or petticoat (or both). An alternative to the gown was a short jacket or a doublet cut with a high neckline. The narrow-shouldered, wide-cuffed \\"trumpet\\" sleeves characteristic of the 1540s and 1550s in France and England disappeared in the 1560s, in favor of French and Spanish styles with narrower sleeves. Overall, the silhouette was narrow through the 1560s and gradually widened, with emphasis as the shoulder and hip. The slashing technique, seen in Italian dress in the 1560s, evolved into single or double rows of loops at the shoulder with contrasting linings. By the 1580s these had been adapted in England as padded and jeweled shoulder rolls.Ashelford, Jane: The Visual History of Costume: The Sixteenth Century, 1983 edition (), 1994 reprint ()Tortora, Phyllis: A survey of historic costume: A history of Western dress, New York: Fairchild Publications, 1994, , pages 164‚Äì165. Gown, kirtle, and petticoat The common upper garment was a gown, called in Spanish ropa, in French robe, and in English either gown or frock. Gowns were made in a variety of styles: Loose or fitted (called in England a French gown); with short half sleeves or long sleeves; and floor length (a round gowns) or with a trailing train (clothing). The gown was worn over a kirtle or petticoat (or both, for warmth). Prior to 1545, the kirtle consisted of a fitted one-piece garment. After that date, either kirtles or petticoats might have attached bodices or bodies that fastened with lacing or hooks and eyes and most had sleeves that were pinned or laced in place. The parts of the kirtle or petticoat that showed beneath the gown were usually made of richer fabrics, especially the front panel forepart of the skirts. The bodices of French, Spanish, and English styles were stiffened into a cone or flattened, triangular shape ending in a V at the front of the woman's waist. Italian fashion uniquely featured a broad U-shape rather than a V. Spanish women also wore boned, heavy corsets known as \\"Spanish bodies\\" that compressed the torso into a smaller but equally geometric cone.Kemper, Rachel H: \\"Costume\\", 1992, pp. 82 Bodices could be high-necked or have a broad, low, square neckline, often with a slight arch at the front early in the period. They fastened with hooks in front or were laced at the side-back seam. High-necked bodices styled like men's doublets might fasten with hooks or buttons. Italian and German fashion retained the front- laced bodice of the previous period, with the ties laced in parallel rows. Underwear Elizabeth Vernon at her dressing table wears an embroidered linen jacket over her rose-pink corset, 1590s. During this period, women's underwear consisted of a washable linen chemise or smock. This was the only article of clothing that was worn by every woman, regardless of class. Wealthy women's smocks were embroidered and trimmed with narrow lace. Smocks were made of rectangular lengths of linen; in northern Europe the smock skimmed the body and was widened with triangular gores, while in Mediterranean countries smocks were cut fuller in the body and sleeves. High-necked smocks were worn under high-necked fashions, to protect the expensive outer garments from body oils and dirt. There is pictorial evidence that Venetian courtesans wore linen or silk drawers, but no evidence that drawers were worn in England. Stockings or hose were generally made of woven wool sewn to shape and held in place with ribbon garters. The true corset, called a vasquine in Spanish, arose in the first half of the 16th century in Spain. The fashion spread from there to Italy, and then to France and (eventually) England, where it was called a pair of bodies, being made in two parts which laced back and front. The corset was restricted to aristocratic fashion, and was a fitted bodice stiffened with reeds called bents, wood, or whalebone. Skirts were held in the proper shape by a farthingale or hoop skirt. In Spain, the cone-shaped Spanish farthingale remained in fashion into the early 17th century. It was only briefly fashionable in France, where a padded roll or French farthingale (called in England a bum roll) held the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. In England, the Spanish farthingale was worn through the 1570s, and was gradually replaced by the French farthingale. By the 1590s, skirts were pinned to wide wheel farthingales to achieve a drum shape.Mikhaila (2006), p. 21. Partlet A low neckline might be filled with an infill (called in English a partlet). Partlets worn over the smock but under the kirtle and gown were typically made of lawn (a fine linen). Partlets were also worn over the kirtle and gown. The colours of \\"over-parlets\\" varied, but white and black were the most common. The partlet might be made of the same material as the kirtle and richly decorated with lace detailing to complement it. Embroidered partlet and sleeve sets were frequently given to Elizabeth as New Year's gifts. Outerwear Women wore sturdy overskirts called safeguards over their dresses for riding or travel on dirty roads. Hooded cloaks were worn overall in bad weather. One description mentions strings being attached to the stirrup or foot to hold the skirts in place when riding. Mantles were also popular and described as modern day bench warmers: a square blanket or rug that is attached to the shoulder, worn around the body, or on the knees for extra warmth. Besides keeping warm, Elizabethans cloaks were useful for any type of weather; the Cassock, commonly known as the Dutch cloak, was another kind of cloak. Its name implies some military ideals and has been used since the beginning of the 16th century and therefore has many forms. The cloak is identified by its flaring out at the shoulders and the intricacy of decoration. The cloak was worn to the ankle, waist or fork. It also had specific measurements of 3/4 cut. The longer lengths were more popular for travel and came with many variations. These include: taller collars than normal, upturned collar or no collar at all and sleeves. The French cloak was quite the opposite of the Dutch and was worn anywhere from the knees to the ankle. It was typically worn over the left shoulder and included a cape that came to the elbow. It was a highly decorated cloak. The Spanish cloak or cape was well known to be stiff, have a very decorated hood and was worn to the hip or waist. The over-gown for women was very plain and worn loosely to the floor or ankle length. The Juppe had a relation to the safeguard and they would usually be worn together. The Juppe replaced the Dutch Cloak and was most likely a loose form of the doublet. Accessories The fashion for wearing or carrying the pelt of a sable or marten spread from continental Europe into England in this period; costume historians call these accessories zibellini or \\"flea furs\\". The most expensive zibellini had faces and paws of goldsmith's work with jewelled eyes. Queen Elizabeth received one as a New Years gift in 1584.Sherrill, Tawny: \\"Fleas, Furs, and Fashions: Zibellini as Luxury Accessories of the Renaissance\\", in Robin Netherton and Gale R. Owen-Crocker, editors, Medieval Clothing and Textiles, Volume 2, pp. 121‚Äì150 Gloves of perfumed leather featured embroidered cuffs. Folding fans appeared late in the period, replacing flat fans of ostrich feathers. Jewelry was also popular among those that could afford it. Necklaces were beaded gold or silver chains and worn in concentric circles reaching as far down as the waist. Ruffs also had a jewelry attachment such as glass beads, embroidery, gems, brooches or flowers. Belts were a surprising necessity: used either for fashion or more practical purposes. Lower classes wore them almost as tool belts with the upper classes using them as another place to add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, had a significant impact on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of every color to brighten up an outfit with the gold thread and tassels hanging off of it. While travelling, noblewomen would wear oval masks of black velvet called visards to protect their faces from the sun. Curled hair, twisted and pinned up Catherine de' Medici in a widow's black hood and veil, after 1559. Hairstyles and headgear Married and grown women covered their hair, as they had in previous periods.Tortora (1994), p. 167 Early in the period, hair was parted in the center and fluffed over the temples. Later, front hair was curled and puffed high over the forehead. Wigs and false hairpieces were used to extend the hair. In a typical hairstyle of the period, front hair is curled and back hair is worn long, twisted and wound with ribbons and then coiled and pinned up. A close-fitting linen cap called a coif or biggins was worn, alone or under other hats or hoods, especially in the Netherlands and England. Many embroidered and bobbin-lace-trimmed English coifs survive from this period. The French hood was worn throughout the period in both France and England. Another fashionable headdress was a caul, or cap, of net-work lined in silk attached to a band, which covered the pinned up hair. This style of headdress had also been seen in Germany in the first half of the century.K√∂hler, History of Costume Widows in mourning wore black hoods with sheer black veils.  Makeup  The ideal standard of beauty for women in the Elizabethan era was to have light or naturally red hair, a pale complexion, and red cheeks and lips, drawing on the style of Queen Elizabeth. The goal was to look very \\"English,\\" since the main enemy of England was Spain, and in Spain darker hair was dominant. To further lighten their complexion, women worn white make-up on their faces. This make-up, called Ceruse, was made up of white lead and vinegar. While this makeup was effective, the white lead made it poisonous. Women in this time often contracted lead poisoning, resulting in death before the age of 50. Other ingredients used as make-up were sulfur, alum, and tin ash. In addition to using make-up to achieve a pale complexion, women in this era were bled to take the color out of their faces. Cochineal, madder, and vermilion were used as dyes to achieve the bright red effects on the cheeks and lips. Kohl was used to darken the eyelashes and enhance the size and appearance of the eyes.

Men's fashion Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester in the narrow fashions of the 1560s: Ruff, doublet, slashed leather jerkin, and paned trunk hose with codpiece. The Earl of Lincoln wears a stiffened, gathered hat with a jeweled band. He wears the livery collar of the Order of the Garter c. 1575. King John III of Sweden wears an embroidered cape with a collar over his doublet c. 1580. Overview Men's fashionable clothing consisted of a linen shirt with collar or ruff and matching wrist ruffs, which were laundered with starch to be kept stiff and bright. Over the shirt men wore a doublet with long sleeves sewn or laced in place. Doublets were stiff, heavy garments, and were often reinforced with boning. Optionally, a jerkin, usually sleeveless and often made of leather, was worn over the doublet. During this time the doublet and jerkin became increasingly more colorful and highly decorated. Waistlines dipped V-shape in front, and were padded to hold their shape. Around 1570, this padding was exaggerated into a peascod belly.Tortora (1994), p. 157. Hose, in variety of styles, were worn with a codpiece early in the period. Trunk hose or round hose were short padded hose. Very short trunk hose were worn over cannions, fitted hose that ended above the knee. Trunk hose could be paned or pansied, with strips of fabric (panes) over a full inner layer or lining. Slops or galligaskins were loose hose reaching just below the knee. Slops could also be pansied.Tortora (1994), pp. 158160. Pluderhosen were a Northern European form of pansied slops with a very full inner layer pulled out between the panes and hanging below the knee.Arnold, Patterns of Fashion...1560‚Äì1620, pp. 16‚Äì18. Venetians were semi-fitted hose reaching just below the knee. Men wore stockings or netherstocks and flat shoes with rounded toes, with slashes early in the period and ties over the instep later. Boots were worn for riding. Outerwear Short cloaks or capes, usually hip-length, often with sleeves, or a military jacket like a mandilion, were fashionable. Long cloaks were worn in cold and wet weather. Gowns were increasingly old-fashioned, and were worn by older men for warmth indoors and out. In this period robes began their transition from general garments to traditional clothing of specific occupations, such as scholars (see Academic dress). Hairstyles and headgear Hair was generally worn short, brushed back from the forehead. Longer styles were popular in the 1580s. In the 1590s, young men of fashion wore a lovelock, a long section of hair hanging over one shoulder. Through the 1570s, a soft fabric hat with a gathered crown was worn. These derived from the flat hat of the previous period, and over time the hat was stiffened and the crown became taller and far from flat. Later, a conical felt hat with a rounded crown called a capotain or copotain became fashionable. These became very tall toward the end of century. Hats were decorated with a jewel or feather, and were worn indoors and out. Close-fitting caps covering the ears and tied under the chin called coifs continued to be worn by children and older men under their hats or alone indoors; men's coifs were usually black. A conical cap of linen with a turned up brim called a nightcap was worn informally indoors; these were often embroidered. Beards Although beards were worn by many men prior to the mid-16th century, it was at this time when grooming and styling facial hair gained social significance. These styles would change very frequently, from pointed whiskers to round trims, throughout these few decades. The easiest way men were able to maintain the style of their beards was to apply starch onto their groomed faces. The most popular styles of beards at this time include: *The Cadiz Beard or Cads Beard, which was named after the C√°diz Expedition in 1596. It resembles a large and discussed growth upon the chin. *The Goat Beard resembles a goatee. It is also very similar to the 'Pick-a-devant and the Barbula style of beards. *The Peak was, at the time, a common name for the beard, but it referred specifically to a mustache finely groomed to a pointed tip. *The Pencil Beard is a small portion of the beard easing to a point around the centre of the chin. *The Stiletto Beard is shaped similarly to the dagger in which it obtained its name. *The Round Beard, just as its name suggests, is trimmed to add emphasis to the roundness of the male cheekbones. Another common name for this style was the Bush Beard. *The Spade Beard derives from the design of a spade which belongs in a deck of playing cards. The beard is broad on the higher part of the cheeks which then curves at each side to meet at the tip of the chin. This style was thought to give a martial appearance and was favoured by soldiers. *The Marquisetto; a very sleek trim of the beard in which is cuts close to the chin. *The Swallow's Tail Beard is unique in a sense that it entails the groomer to take the hairs from the centre of the chin and separate the hairs toward opposite directions. This is very common variation of the forked beard, although it is greater in length and it is more noticeably spread apart. Accessories A baldrick or \\"corse\\" was a belt commonly worn diagonally across the chest or around the waist for holding items such swords, daggers, bugles, and horns. Gloves were often used as a social mediator to recognize the wealthy. Beginning in the second half of the 16th century, many men had trimmed tips off of the fingers of gloves in order for the admirer to see the jewels that were being hidden by the glove. Late in the period, fashionable young men wore a plain gold ring, a jewelled earring, or a strand of black silk through one pierced ear.

Shoes were fastened with ribbons, laces or simply slipped on. Shoes and boots became narrower, followed the contours of the foot, and covered more of the foot, in some cases up to the ankle, than they had previously. As in the first half of the century, shoes were made from soft leather, velvet, or silk. In Spain, Italy, and Germany the slashing of shoes also persisted into the latter half of the century. In France however, slashing slowly went out of fashion and coloring the soles of footwear red began. Aside from slashing, shoes in this period could be adorned with all sorts of cord, quilting, and frills. Thick-soled pattens were worn over delicate indoor shoes to protect them from the muck of the streets. A variant on the patten popular in Venice was the chopine ‚Äì a platform-soled mule that raised the wearer sometimes as high as two feet off the ground. Children's fashion Toddler boys wore gowns or skirts and doublets until they were breeched.

History  1903 Clinton High School was built on the current location of Clinton Elementary School. 1916‚Äì17 The first basketball teams were formed at Clinton High School (Men's & Women's). 1923‚Äì24 The first football team was organized at Clinton High School. 1927 A new high school building, which consolidated CHS with several county schools, was opened at the current location of Clinton Middle School. 1954 Clinton High School first accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). 1956 See Integration below. 1958 On Sunday, October 5, the school was blown apart by three massive explosions. 1958‚Äì60 CHS students were transported to Oak Ridge to continue classes while the school was rebuilt. 1963 Plans were presented to consolidate several elementary schools, create 2 junior high schools, and construct a new Clinton Senior High School for grades 10-12. 1968‚Äì69 Clinton Senior High School was completed. 1977 Vocational programs were offered to CSHS students as the Anderson County Center of Occupational Development was opened. 1989 With the new addition of a library, science labs, a cafeteria, and several new classrooms, the 9th grade was moved to CSHS which again became Clinton High School. (Clinton Junior High School and Norwood Junior High School became middle schools.) Integration black students who integrated Clinton High School in 1956 stand outside the former Green McAdoo School in Clinton. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, federal judge Robert Taylor ordered Clinton High School to desegregate with \\"all deliberate speed\\" in the fall of 1956. The integration of Clinton High School was forced to be first among Tennessee public schools. Anti-integration campaigners from inside and outside Clinton protested the decision to integrate the high school (Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Vol LVI). They were inspired by New Jersey white supremacist John Kasper and Asa Carter both of whom spoke publicly in Clinton on September 1, 1956\\"Integration Troubles\\". New York Times, September 2, 1956 against the decision to integrate the high school (Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Vol LVI). After violence was narrowly averted on the lawn of the Anderson County Courthouse on September 1, National Guard troops were called into the city for two months to keep order. The protests resulted in a jury trial for criminal contempt, of which seven of ten defendants were convicted. The twelve black students who attended Clinton High School that fall became known as the \\"Clinton 12\\". On the morning of each school day they walked together down Broad Street from Foley Hill to Clinton High. On the morning of December 4, 1956, Rev. Paul Turner, the white minister of the First Baptist Church, was severely beaten after escorting the twelve students to school. The twelve students were Jo Ann Boyce (n√©e Allen), Bobby Cain, Theresser Caswell, Minnie Ann Jones (n√©e Dickey), Gail Ann Upton (n√©e Epps), Ronald Hayden, William Latham, Alvah J. Lambert (n√©e McSwain), Maurice Soles, Robert Thacker, Regina Smith (n√©e Turner), and Alfred Williams. On February 10, 2006, Williams, Cain, from Foley Hill to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1956 integration. A bronze statue of the \\"Clinton Twelve\\" is now displayed outside a newly remodeled front entrance to the former Green McAdoo School, where the twelve students had attended elementary school. In February 2016, Disney Channel and sister network Disney XD aired a short for Black History Month. In the short, Disney star Cameron Boyce, the grandson of Jo Ann Boyce, one of the Clinton 12 students, talked about the school. The short also featured his grandmother, Jo Ann Boyce. Early in the morning of October 5, 1958, the Clinton High School building was severely damaged by a series of dynamite explosions. An estimated 75 to 100 sticks of dynamite had been placed in three locations in the building. No one was injured, but school officials estimated damages at $300,000. Clinton was once again the focus of attention over a crime that was universally assumed to be related to the school's desegregation. While the school was rebuilt, Clinton High School students were bused to Oak Ridge where the school operated in the recently vacated building that had housed Linden Elementary School. Clinton High School reopened in its own building in 1960. The documentary The Clinton 12 is a historical review of these events, and was aired widely on PBS in 2008 and 2009. The members of the Clinton 12 were inducted into the Clinton High School Wall of Fame in 2005 (Bobby Cain), 2007 (Gail Ann Epps Upton) and 2010.

The Union of Utrecht was founded by some Jansenists, and expanded with an influx of discontented Roman Catholics following their disappointment with the First Vatican Council (1869-1870). The church is a national Swiss church and recognised (as are the Evangelical Reformed and the Roman Catholic churches) in 11 cantons by the government. Since 1874, the University of Bern has had its own Christian Catholic theological faculty, which is now one part (as the Christian Catholic section) of the Faculty of Theology. The strongest concentration of Christian Catholics lies in the cantons of Solothurn, Aargau, Zurich and Geneva. In 1841 the Z√ºrich Catholic community planned to build a church to commemorate the 1270s Augustinian abbey church. As the whole community was expelled from the Catholic church, the Augustinerkirche at the M√ºnzplatz became its present parish church.

Cluain Tarbh (Irish for Meadow of Bulls) is the Irish Celtic metal band Mael M√≥rdha's debut studio album. It was released in September 2005. The album name, along with the band name, can be written as the cover suggests, using Traditional Irish typography. The name would then be, \\"Cluain Tar·∏É.\\" The album contains eight tracks, the shortest being An T√∫s at 0:56 long, and the longest being I Am the Wench's Bane at 10:15 long. The album is a collection of popular and newly written material spanning several years in the band's history. The cover art depicts the Battle of Clontarf or Cath Chluain Tarbh and this is the primary theme of the album's art and title track. The man on the left is a native Irish Gael, presumably fighting on the side of Brian B√≥ruma mac Cenn√©tig, High King of Ireland. The man on the right appears to be a Viking, fighting on the side of the King of Leinster, Mael M√≥rdha. Both men are engaged in one-on-one combat against one another. The album contains lyrics in both English and Irish.

It fades in (and out) and is what sounds like a war tune with pipes. This is possibly mimicking what could be the lead-up the Battle of Clontarf, used as a metaphor for the entire album. Winds of One Thousand Winters This song is the beginning of Mael M√≥rdha's signature Ceol Breatha Gaelach on the album. This is one of the sample tracks which can be heard on their website. As explained by the band: A complex mix of orchestration, layered guitars and drums, this tune expresses the misery felt by the ignorance expressed towards our past and the hope of a time when a king will rise to unite the clanns and revive our dying culture. The music is more textured than Cluain Tarbh as the theme deals with more subtle, deeper feelings. Composed: 2003 The Serpent and the Black Lake This song is stated by the band to be about the \\"Lure of Love\\". Composed: 1997 Cluain Tarbh The title track. This song tells the story of the Battle of Clontarf and can be considered the centrepiece of the album. From the band's website: This is about the lead up and aftermath of that most famous of battles fought in the Meadow of Bulls (Cluain Tarbh - Clontarf) on Good Friday 1014 between the then high king of √âire, Brian Boru and the king of Leinster, Mael M√≥rdha. The pace is fast and furious (for Mael M√≥rdha I mean) with pounding guitars and drums, whistle and bellowing vocals. Composed: 2003 I Am the Wench's Bane This is the longest song on the album. It is said to be \\"on the relationship between the Wench and Her Bane\\". Composed: 2001 The Man All Hate to Love From the band's website: If Cluain Tarbh is fast then this song is misery incarnate. Slow with lots of backing vocals, orchestration and miserable guitars. The title pretty much explains the theme of this little ditty. If you ever feel down listening to this song will make you realise that nothing could be as terrible as what is expressed here. Composed: 2003 Pauper of Souls This song is stated to be about \\"the merits of belief over non-belief\\". Composed: 2001 Realms of Insanity This song is apparently \\"open to interpretation\\".

Sunward's founders were pioneers in bringing the cohousing model to Michigan. Children playing at Sunward Cohousing Demographics The community is made up of 40 households including single individuals, couples, single parents, young families with children, empty nesters, and unrelated adults, ranging in age from infants to octogenarians. Sunward's members, around 65 adults and 25 children, have a variety of cultures, races, religious and spiritual preferences, sexual orientations, and educational and occupational backgrounds. Being an intergenerational village is an important design goal of the community. Members are known as Sunwardians. History Sunward has its origins in 1993 when Susan Cameron, Donna White and other founders began to discuss how to bring cohousing to Ann Arbor, inspired by successful efforts outside of Michigan. In January 1994, Nick Meima and other key players invited Kathryn McCamant, the architect who popularized the cohousing model in the U.S., to Ann Arbor to conduct a cohousing workshop. Inspired by her workshop, a group began meeting to establish criteria for site selection. The Sunward site was discovered in July 1995 on the edge of Ann Arbor in Scio Township. An initial purchase offer was refused because the landowners did not like the cooperative living ideas espoused by the group. In December 1995 a new offer was made and accepted. The early members became developers by forming a limited liability corporation called Ann Arbor Alpha. An architectural firm, Sunstructures Architects, was selected in June 1996. Kathryn McCamant and her partner Charles Durrett conducted two workshops to help members design the site plan and Common House. The land sale closed in November 1996 and the group then began searching for a builder. The core membership group reached 22 households in December 1996. A final site plan was approved in January 1997, and the group grew to 28 households. A builder, Phoenix Contractors, Inc., was selected in February 1997. By May 1997, 36 households were committed, and unit pricing and selections were made. Construction began May 22, 1997. The community was fully subscribed with 40 households by August 1997. By April 1998, the first homes were certified for occupancy, and community members began to move in. Construction was completed in November 1998, a date the community annually celebrates as its anniversary. The success of Sunward prompted the creation of two more independent cohousing communities in the area, Great Oak and Touchstone. Sunward Cohousing panorama illustrating greenspace preservation, tightly clustered housing, and parking on periphery, 2003. Land Sunward is situated on 20 acres (eight hectares) of land with mature oak and hickory woods contains paths, a nature study area, hidden hammocks, and rolling hills, and it forms a large, common \\"backyard\\" to the north of the tightly clustered homes. This area is used for relaxation, recreation, and retreat. Two ponds, part of a tributary system of Honey Creek, with a footbridge and an earthen dam between them, lie to the south of the homes. A small area known as Drainasia is located on the larger pond. It is a parliamentary republic with a population of 4. They are used for ice skating. They are home to waterfowl, including great blue herons. Several acres of prairie have been tended as a native prairie restoration project. A playfield hosts kid-league soccer matches and other recreational activities. The built and paved area of about five acres (two hectares) in the middle of the site was formerly a backfilled gravel pit. Sunward's founders chose to build tightly clustered homes on this land, conserving green and open space, and leaving the woods and natural features mostly intact. Built environment Sunward's architecture was designed to encourage interactions and strengthen the connections that are the lifeblood of the community. The structures, in addition to the Common House, include 40 individually owned housing units in a range of sizes and layouts spread across nine buildings, several garages individually owned by some households, a large barn built in the woods during the 1910s, and assorted sheds. The design attempts to balance community life and personal privacy. The community layout and homes were designed with the concept of a privacy gradient, where privacy increases as one goes toward the back of the house. For example, sitting on one's front porch is an invitation to socialize, while sitting on the back porch does not. Kitchen windows are in the front of every house. As a pedestrian community, Sunward restricts motor vehicles to the eastern periphery of its land, allowing members to visit and children to play in safety on its paths. Shared handcarts for moving material are kept at locations around the campus. Sunward's legal structure states that homes are privately owned inside, up to the paint on the interior walls, while the community owns the rest of the structure and everything outside the home.Social and musical gathering on the piazza Community life=The Common House The Common House is the heart of Sunward community life, where members cook, eat, play, hang out, celebrate, meet, host events, and work together. It is an extension of their individual homes, and it allows residents to live in smaller private homes than they otherwise might need. The Common House includes a large kitchen, a dining room, a living room, children‚Äôs play spaces, a game room, a teen room, a meeting room, professional offices, an exercise room, guest rooms, a video theater, a laundry room, and a large workshop. U.S. mailboxes and internal mail \\"cubbies\\" are located in the Common House, providing Sunwardians opportunities to interact. Outside the Common House are the centers of summer community life: wooden decks and a brick piazza. The common laundry room is available to all Sunwardians. A team of members cleans the Common House. Shared meals Shared Common House meals are a defining aspect of the community. They provide an opportunity to keep in touch with the neighbors, deepen relationships, and work together while making the meal and cleaning up afterwards. Dinners take place 3-4 times a week. Each month every member does roughly two shifts as assistant cook or cleanup crew, or one shift as head chef. The head chef determines the menu and overall cost of the dinner. A vegetarian option is typically available. In addition to the dinner program, a variety of spontaneous breakfasts, potlucks, and cookouts occur. Governance The Sunward community is managed by its members, who collectively hold decision-making authority. Community decisions are made by consensus. Community Meetings take place monthly in the Common House. A quorum of at least 21 households must be present to make decisions. The Sunward Book of Agreements is the official collection of all standing agreements that the community has made. Although the entire community retains the authority to make major decisions, much of the day-to-day business is delegated to standing committees and ad hoc work groups. These fall into five main areas: leadership, community life, Common House operations, buildings and infrastructure, and land management. Members work together to raise a shed, 2001 Work Most of the work needed to run Sunward is done by the members. Maintenance work is broken into small monthly job allocations on a task schedule. These tasks are distributed to all members. Examples include plowing snow, facilitating meetings, tending trees, managing finances, mopping floors, etc. Children Members tend to be watchful and keep an eye on the children's safety. Children can safely run, bike, and skate in the pedestrian campus. They can use the outdoor play areas, as well as the kids-, teen-, and game-rooms inside the Common House. Children are encouraged but not required to participate in the work of the community.

Son of general Bahram Gushnasp and hailing from the noble House of Mihran, Bahram began his career as the governor of Ray, and was promoted to the army chief (spahbed) of the northwestern portions of the empire after capturing the Byzantine stronghold of Dara, fighting in the war of 572‚Äì591. After a massive Hephthalite-Turkic invasion of the eastern Sasanian domains in 588, he was appointed as the spahbed in Khorasan, beginning a campaign that decisively ended with Iranian victory. Bahram earned an elevated position in Iran due to his noble descent, character, skills, and accomplishments. The Sasanian king (shah) Hormizd IV () was already distrustful of Bahram and stripped the increasingly popular general of his commands. Bahram began a rebellion aiming to reestablish the \\"more rightful\\" Arsacid Empire, identifying himself with the promised savior of the Zoroastrian faith. Before he had reached the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon, Hormizd was assassinated in support of his son, Khosrow II, by another anti- Hormizd faction led by the two Ispahbudhan brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih. As Bahram captured Ctesiphon, Khosrow II fled to the Byzantine Empire, with the assistance of which he launched a campaign against Bahram, who was defeated with his outnumbered forces, but managed to flee to the Western Turkic Khaganate where he was well received. He was assassinated shortly thereafter at the instigation of Khosrow II, who was then the shah. Bahram Chobin's legacy survived even after Arab conquest of Iran among Iranian nationalists, as well as in the Persian literature.  Name  His theophoric name \\"Bahram\\" is the New Persian form of the Middle Persian WarahrƒÅn (also spelled WahrƒÅm), which is derived from the Old Iranian V·πõŒ∏ragna. The Avestan equivalent was Verethragna, the name of the god of victory, whilst the Parthian version was *WarŒ∏agn. Bahram's surname, Chobin (\\"Wooden Shaft\\", \\"Javelin-like\\"), was a nickname given to him due to his tall and slender appearance. His appearance was also emphasized by the Persian poet Ferdowsi, who in his Shahnameh (\\"The Book of Kings\\"), described Bahram as a towering and dark-complexioned warrior with black curly hair. Background Bahram was a member of the House of Mihran, one of the seven Great Houses of Iran. The family was of Parthian origin, and was centered in Ray, south of Tehran, the capital of present-day Iran. Bahram's father was Bahram Gushnasp, a military officer who had fought the Byzantines and campaigned in Yemen during the reign of Khosrow I (). His grandfather Gurgin Milad had served as the marzban (general of a frontier province, \\"margrave\\") of Armenia from 572 to 574. Bahram Chobin had three siblings whom were named: Gordiya, Gorduya and Mardansina. Rise Bahram Chobin fighting Bagha Qaghan. Bahram Chobin originally started his career as marzban of Ray, but in 572 he commanded a cavalry force and took part in the siege and capture of the key Byzantine stronghold of Dara and was promoted to army chief (spahbed) of the \\"North\\" (Adurbadagan and Greater Media). After being promoted he fought a long, indecisive campaign in 572‚Äì591 against the Byzantines in northern Mesopotamia. In 588, the Turkic Khagan Bagha Qaghan (known as Sabeh/Saba in Persian sources), together with his Hephthalite subjects, invaded the Sasanian territories south of the Oxus, where they attacked and routed the Sasanian soldiers stationed in Balkh, and then proceeded to conquer the city along with Talaqan, Badghis, and Herat. In a council of war, Bahram was chosen to lead an army against them and was given the governorship of Khorasan. Bahram's army supposedly consisted of 12,000 hand-picked horsemen. His army ambushed a large army of Turks and Hephthalites in April 588, at the battle of Hyrcanian rock, and again in 589, re-conquering Balkh, where Bahram captured the Turkic treasury and the golden throne of the Khagan. He then proceeded to cross the Oxus river and won a decisive victory over Turks, personally killing Bagha Qaghan with an arrowshot. He managed to reach as far as Baykand, near Bukhara, and also contain an attack by the son of the deceased Khagan, Birmudha, whom Bahram had captured and sent to the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. Birmudha was well received there by the Sasanian king (shah) Hormizd IV, who forty days later had him sent back to Bahram with the order that the Turkic prince should get sent back to Transoxiana. The Sasanians now held suzerainty over the Sogdian cities of Chach and Samarkand, where Hormizd minted coins. Coin of the Sasanian king (shah) Hormizd IV (). After Bahram's great victory against the Turks he was sent to Caucasus to repel an invasion of nomads, possibly the Khazars, where he was victorious. He was later made commander of the Sasanian forces against the Byzantines once again, and successfully defeated a Byzantine force in Georgia. However, he afterwards suffered a minor defeat by a Byzantine army on the banks of the Aras. Hormizd, who was jealous of Bahram, used this defeat as an excuse to dismiss him from his office, and had him humiliated. According to another source, Bahram was the subject of jealousy after his victory against the Turks. Hormizd's minister Azen Gushnasp, who was reportedly jealous of Bahram, accused him of having kept the best part of the booty for himself and only sending a small part to Hormizd. According to other sources, however, it was Birmudha or the courtiers that raised Hormizd's suspicion. Regardless, Hormizd could not tolerate the rising fame of Bahram, and thus had him disgraced and removed from the Sasanian office for supposedly having kept some of the booty for himself. Furthermore, Hormizd also sent him a chain and a spindle to show that he considered him as a lowly slave \\"as ungrateful as a woman\\". Enraged, Bahram, who was still in the east, rebelled against Hormizd. The version of Bahram rebelling after his defeat against the Byzantines was supported by N√∂ldeke in 1879. However, a source found ten years later confirmed Bahram's rebellion took in fact place while he was still in the east.  Rebellion  Bahram Chobin fighting Sasanian loyalists near Ctesiphon. Bahram, infuriated by Hormizd's actions, responded by rebelling, and due to his noble status and great military knowledge, was joined by his soldiers and many others. He then appointed a new governor for Khorasan, and afterwards set for Ctesiphon. This marked the first time in Sasanian history that a Parthian dynast challenged the legitimacy of the Sasanian family by rebelling. Azen Gushnasp was sent to suppress to the rebellion, but was murdered in Hamadan by one of his own men, Zadespras. Another force under Sarames the Elder was also sent to stop Bahram, who defeated him and had him trampled to death by elephants. Meanwhile, Hormizd tried to come to terms with his brothers-in-law Vistahm and Vinduyih, \\"who equally hated Hormizd\\". Hormizd shortly had Vinduyih imprisoned, while Vistahm managed to flee from the court. After a short period of time, a palace coup under the two brothers occurred in Ctesiphon, which resulted in the blinding of Hormizd and the accession of the latter's oldest son Khosrow II (who was their nephew through his mother's side). The two brothers shortly had Hormizd killed. Nevertheless, Bahram continued his march to Ctesiphon, now with the pretext of claiming to avenge Hormizd. Khosrow then took a carrot and stick attitude, and wrote a message to Bahram, stressing his rightful claim to the Sasanian kingship: \\"Khosrow, kings of kings, ruler over the ruling, lord of the peoples, prince of peace, salvation of men, among gods the good and eternally living man, among men the most esteemed god, the highly illustrious, the victor, the one who rises with the sun and who lends the night his eyesight, the one famed through his ancestors, the king who hates, the benefactor who engaged the Sasanians and saved the Iranians their kingship‚Äîto Bahram, the general of the Iranians, our friend.... We have also taken over the royal throne in a lawful manner and have upset no Iranian customs.... We have so firmly decided not to take off the diadem that we even expected to rule over other worlds, if this were possible.... If you wish your welfare, think about what is to be done.\\" Bahram, however, ignored his warning‚Äîa few days later, he reached the Nahrawan Canal near Ctesiphon, where he fought Khosrow's men, who were heavily outnumbered, but managed to hold Bahram's men back in several clashes. However, Khosrow's men eventually began losing their morale, and were in the end defeated by Bahram's forces. Khosrow, together with his two uncles, his wives, and a retinue of 30 nobles, thereafter fled to Byzantine territory, while Ctesiphon fell to Bahram. Bahram declared himself king of kings in the summer of 590, asserting that the first Sasanian king Ardashir I () had usurped the throne of the Arsacids, and that he now was restoring their rule. Reign Coin of Bahram Chobin, Susa mint. Bahram tried to support his cause with the Zoroastrian apocalyptic belief that by the end of Zoroaster's millennium, chaos and destructive wars with the Hephthalites/Huns and the Romans occurs and then a savior would appear. Indeed, the Sasanians had misidentified Zoroaster's era with that of the Seleucids (312 BC), which put Bahram's life almost at the end of Zoroaster's millennium, he was therefore hailed by many as the promised savior Kay Bahram Varjavand. Bahram was to re- establish the Arsacid Empire and commenced a new millennium of dynastic rule. He started minting coins, where he is on the front imitated as an exalted figure, bearded and wearing a crenellation-shaped crown with two crescents of the moon, whilst the reverse shows the traditional fire altar flanked by two attendants. Regardless, many nobles and priests still chose to side with the inexperienced and less dominant Khosrow II. In order to get the attention of the Byzantine emperor Maurice (r. 582‚Äì602), Khosrow II went to Syria, and sent a message to the Sasanian occupied city of Martyropolis to stop their resistance against the Byzantines, but with no avail. He then sent a message to Maurice, and requested his help to regain the Sasanian throne, which the Byzantine emperor agreed with; in return, the Byzantines would re-gain sovereignty over the cities of Amida, Carrhae, Dara and Martyropolis. Furthermore, Iran was required to stop intervening in the affairs of Iberia and Armenia, effectively ceding control of Lazistan to the Byzantines. Illustration of the forces of Bahram Chobin and Khosrow II fighting. In 591, Khosrow moved to Constantia and prepared to invade Bahram's territories in Mesopotamia, while Vistahm and Vinduyih were raising an army in Adurbadagan under the observation of the Byzantine commander John Mystacon, who was also raising an army in Armenia. After some time, Khosrow, along with the Byzantine commander of the south, Comentiolus, invaded Mesopotamia. During this invasion, Nisibis and Martyropolis quickly defected to them, and Bahram's commander Zatsparham was defeated and killed. One of Bahram's other commanders, Bryzacius, was captured in Mosil and had his nose and ears cut off, and was thereafter sent to Khosrow, where he was killed. Khosrow II and the Byzantine general Narses then penetrated deeper into Bahram's territory, seizing Dara and then Mardin in February, where Khosrow was re-proclaimed king. Shortly after this, Khosrow sent one of his Iranian supporters, Mahbodh, to capture Ctesiphon, which he managed to accomplish. 280px At the same time a force of 8,000 Iranians under Vistahm and Vinduyih and 12,000 Armenians under Mushegh II Mamikonian invaded Adurbadagan. Bahram tried to disrupt the force by writing a letter to Mushegh II, the letter said: \\"As for you Armenians who demonstrate an unseasonable loyalty, did not the house of Sasan destroy your land and sovereignty? Why otherwise did your fathers rebel and extricate themselves from their service, fighting up until today for your country?\\" Bahram in his letter promised that the Armenians would become partners of the new Iranian empire ruled by a Parthian dynastic family if he accepted his proposal to betray Khosrow II. Mushegh, however, rejected the offer.  Flight and death  Bahram was then defeated at the Battle of Blarathon, forcing him to flee with 4,000 men eastwards. He marched towards Nishapur, where he defeated a pursuing army as well as an army led by a Karenid nobleman at Qumis. Constantly troubled, he finally arrived in FerganaGumilev L.N. Bahram Chubin, pp. 229 - 230 where he was received honorably by the Khagan of the Turks, who was most likely Birmudha‚Äìthe same Turkic prince that Bahram had defeated and captured a few years earlier during his wars against the Turks. Bahram entered his service, and was appointed as a commander in the army, achieving further military accomplishments there. Bahram became a highly popular figure after saving the Khagan from a conspiracy instigated by the latters brother Byghu (conceivably an incorrect translation of yabghu). Khosrow II, however, could not feel safe as long as Bahram lived, and succeeded in having him assassinated. The assassination was reportedly achieved through distribution of presents and bribes between the members of the Turkic royal family, notably the queen. What remained of Bahram's supporters went back to northern Iran and joined the rebellion of Vistahm (590/1‚Äì596 or 594/5‚Äì600).  Fate of family  After Bahram's death, his sister Gordiya travelled to Khorasan, where she married Vistahm, who during that time was also rebelling against Khosrow II. Bahram had three sons: Shapur, Mihran Bahram-i Chobin and Noshrad. Shapur continued to oppose the Sasanians and later joined the Rebellion of Vistahm. After the end of the rebellion, Shapur was executed. Mihran is mentioned in 633 as a general in the Sasanian forces that fought against the Arabs at the Battle of Ayn al-Tamr during the Arab invasion of Iran. His son Siyavakhsh ruled Ray, and killed Vinduyih's son Farrukh Hormizd in retribution for the family's role in Bahram's downfall and death. Bahram's last son, Noshrad, was the ancestor of the Samanids, who ruled the eastern Iranian lands of Transoxiana and Khorasan during most of their existence, stressing their ancestry from Bahram.  Legacy  Bahram's life is composed in the Pahlavi romance BahrƒÅm Ch≈çbƒ´n NƒÅma (\\"Book of Bahram Chobin\\"), which was later translated by Jabalah bin SƒÅlim, and found its way‚Äîmixed with a pro-Khosrow II account‚Äîinto the works of Dinawari, Ferdowsi, and Bal'ami. There are many fables attributed to Bahram VI, as is the norm for many heroes in Persian literature. The chapters in Volume VIII of Ferdowsi's 11th-century Shahnamehonline at http://persian.packhum.org/persian/ on the reigns of \\"Hormizd, Son of Khosrow I,\\" and \\"Khosrow Parviz,\\" both of which are almost as much about Bahram Chobin as about Hormizd or his son. In his catalogue Kitab al-Fihrist, Ibn al-Nadim has credited Bahram Chobin with a manual of archery. Long after his death in the 8th century, Sunpadh claimed that Abu Muslim had not died but he is with \\"al-Mahdi\\" (the Savior) in a \\"Brazen Hold\\" (that is, the residence of Bahram in Turkistan), and will return. This shows the persisting popularity of Bahram Chobin among Iranian nationalists. Following the collapse of the Sasanian Empire, the Samanid dynasty formed of descendants of Bahram Chobin, became one of the first independent Iranian dynasties., pages 77-78.

Pomeroy was born in Topeka and attended Washburn University, where he received a Bachelor's degree in political science, as well as a teaching certification. He subsequently taught government and social studies at Topeka High School, where he has been dubbed \\"P-Roy\\" by his students and athletes. He is also the head tennis coach for the Trojans, as well as the head coach of the school's bowling team, which, as of the 2014-2015 school year, is only in its tenth year of existence. He and his wife Deborah have two sons.

He became known worldwide in the 1970s after his first novel, A School for Fools, had been published in translation by Ardis Publishers (Ann Arbor, Michigan) in the US, and later reissued by Four Walls Eight Windows. Sokolov is one of the most important authors of 20th-century Russian literature. He is well acclaimed for his unorthodox use of language, playing with rhythms, sounds and associations. The author himself coined the term \\"proeziia\\" for his work‚Äîin between prose and poetry (English close form of the term can sound as \\"proetry\\"). Biography Sokolov is a Canadian citizen and has lived the larger part of his life so far in the United States and Canada. During the Second World War, his father, Major Vsevolod Sokolov, worked as a military attach√© at the Soviet embassy in Canada. In 1946 Major Sokolov (agent \\"Davey\\") was deported from Canada in relation to spying activity. After returning to the Soviet Union in 1946 and growing up there, Sokolov did not fit into the Soviet system. In 1965 he was discarded from a military university, probably because he had tried to flee the country. After that he studied journalism at Moscow State University from 1966 to 1971. Shortly after his first daughter was born in 1974 his first marriage ended. Sokolov made several attempts to flee from Soviet Union. He was caught while crossing the Iranian border, and only his father's connections helped him to avoid long imprisonment.–°—É–º–µ—Ä–µ—á–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ –°–∞—à–∏ –°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞ ¬´–ù–ì ‚Äî Ex libris¬ª, 15 —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2005 –≥. Nezavisimaya Gazeta He met his second wife, the Austrian- born Johanna Steindl while she was teaching German at the University in Moscow. She smuggled the text of his first novel into the West. Only after she started a hunger strike in the Stephansdom in Vienna, Austria, in 1975, was Sokolov allowed to leave the Soviet Union. Sokolov left Vienna in late 1976 for the United States after his first novel had been published. In early 1977, Johanna Steindl gave birth to Sokolov's son, who has become a journalist. He also had a second daughter named Maria Goldfarb, born in New York in 1986, who has become an artist. Sasha Sokolov later married again several times and is now married to the US rower Marlene Royle. His second novel, \\"Between Dog and Wolf,\\" builds even more on the particularities of the Russian language and was deemed untranslatable for many years. Thus, it has become a much lesser success than \\"A School for Fools\\", which has been translated into many languages. However, in late 2016, Between Dog and Wolf was translated into English by Alexander Boguslawski, a longtime friend of Mr. Sokolov, and published by Columbia University Press. Sokolov's 1985 novel, Palisandriia, was translated as Astrophobia and published by Grove Press in the US in 1989. The complete manuscript of his fourth book is said to have been lost when the Greek house it had been written in burnt down. Sokolov, who leads a rather reclusive life, says that he keeps writing, but doesn't want to be published any more. Major works * 1976 –®–∫–æ–ª–∞ –¥–ª—è –¥—É—Ä–∞–∫–æ–≤/A School for Fools. Ann Arbor.

In radiative transfer, it describes the absorption and scattering of radiation in a medium, such as a plasma, dielectric, shielding material, glass, etc. An opaque object is neither transparent (allowing all light to pass through) nor translucent (allowing some light to pass through). When light strikes an interface between two substances, in general some may be reflected, some absorbed, some scattered, and the rest transmitted (also see refraction). Reflection can be diffuse, for example light reflecting off a white wall, or specular, for example light reflecting off a mirror. An opaque substance transmits no light, and therefore reflects, scatters, or absorbs all of it. Both mirrors and carbon black are opaque. Opacity depends on the frequency of the light being considered. For instance, some kinds of glass, while transparent in the visual range, are largely opaque to ultraviolet light. More extreme frequency-dependence is visible in the absorption lines of cold gases. Opacity can be quantified in many ways; for example, see the article mathematical descriptions of opacity. Different processes can lead to opacity including absorption, reflection, and scattering. Radiopacity Radiopacity is preferentially used to describe opacity of X-rays. In modern medicine, radiodense substances are those that will not allow X-rays or similar radiation to pass. Radiographic imaging has been revolutionized by radiodense contrast media, which can be passed through the bloodstream, the gastrointestinal tract, or into the cerebral spinal fluid and utilized to highlight CT scan or X-ray images. Radiopacity is one of the key considerations in the design of various devices such as guidewires or stents that are used during radiological intervention. The radiopacity of a given endovascular device is important since it allows the device to be tracked during the interventional procedure. Quantitative definition The words \\"opacity\\" and \\"opaque\\" are often used as colloquial terms for objects or media with the properties described above. However, there is also a specific, quantitative definition of \\"opacity\\", used in astronomy, plasma physics, and other fields, given here. In this use, \\"opacity\\" is another term for the mass attenuation coefficient (or, depending on context, mass absorption coefficient, the difference is described here) \\\\kappa_ u at a particular frequency u of electromagnetic radiation. More specifically, if a beam of light with frequency u travels through a medium with opacity \\\\kappa_ u and mass density \\\\rho, both constant, then the intensity will be reduced with distance x according to the formula :I(x) = I_0 e^{-\\\\kappa_ u \\\\rho x} where * x is the distance the light has traveled through the medium * I(x) is the intensity of light remaining at distance x * I_0 is the initial intensity of light, at x = 0 For a given medium at a given frequency, the opacity has a numerical value that may range between 0 and infinity, with units of length2/mass. Opacity in air pollution work refers to the percentage of light blocked instead of the attenuation coefficient (aka extinction coefficient) and varies from 0% light blocked to 100% light blocked: Opacity = 100\\\\% \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{I(x)}{I_0} \\\\right) Planck and Rosseland opacities It is customary to define the average opacity, calculated using a certain weighting scheme. Planck opacity (also known as Planck-Mean-Absorption- CoefficientModest, Radiative Heat Transfer, ) uses the normalized Planck black body radiation energy density distribution, B_{ u}(T), as the weighting function, and averages \\\\kappa_ u directly: :\\\\kappa_{Pl}={\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\kappa_ u B_ u(T) d u \\\\over \\\\int_0^\\\\infty B_ u(T) d u }=\\\\Big( { \\\\pi \\\\over \\\\sigma T^4}\\\\Big) \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\kappa_ u B_ u(T) d u , where \\\\sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Rosseland opacity (after Svein Rosseland), on the other hand, uses a temperature derivative of the Planck distribution, u( u, T)=\\\\partial B_ u(T)/\\\\partial T, as the weighting function, and averages \\\\kappa_ u^{-1}, :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\kappa} = \\\\frac{\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} \\\\kappa_{ u}^{-1} u( u, T) d u }{\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} u( u,T) d u}. The photon mean free path is \\\\lambda_ u = (\\\\kappa_ u \\\\rho)^{-1}. The Rosseland opacity is derived in the diffusion approximation to the radiative transport equation. It is valid whenever the radiation field is isotropic over distances comparable to or less than a radiation mean free path, such as in local thermal equilibrium. In practice, the mean opacity for Thomson electron scattering is: :\\\\kappa_{\\\\rm es} = 0.20(1+X) {\\\\rm\\\\, cm}^2{\\\\rm \\\\,g}^{-1} where X is the hydrogen mass fraction. For nonrelativistic thermal bremsstrahlung, or free-free transitions, assuming solar metallicity, it is: :\\\\kappa_{\\\\rm ff}(\\\\rho, T) = 0.64 \\\\times 10^{23} (\\\\rho[ {\\\\rm g}~ {\\\\rm\\\\, cm}^{-3}])(T[{\\\\rm K}])^{-7/2} {\\\\rm\\\\, cm}^2 {\\\\rm\\\\, g}^{-1}.Stuart L. Shapiro and Saul A. Teukolsky, \\"Black Holes, White Dwarfs, and Neutron Stars\\" 1983, . The Rosseland mean attenuation coefficient is: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\kappa} = \\\\frac{\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} (\\\\kappa_{ u, {\\\\rm es}} + \\\\kappa_{ u, {\\\\rm ff}})^{-1} u( u, T) d u }{\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} u( u,T) d u}.George B.

Inspired by the idea of new constitutions arising there, the Roman populace threw off the yoke of tyranny and established a republic. The army was now facing threats from all of Europe and could only respond through change. This article covers the military establishment of the Roman Republic. For previous changes in the Roman army, see military establishment of the Roman kingdom. The historian Polybius gives us a clear picture of the republican army at what is arguably its height in 160 BC. Serving in the army was part of Roman civic duty. To serve in the armies of Rome, one had to purchase one's own equipment, and soldiers were sorted into different classes according to wealth. Velites made up the lower class soldiers; it was this class which made up the majority of the heavy infantry legions characteristic to Rome. The Equites, or Equestrians, were the higher class citizens so named because they could afford to maintain at least one horse; this class made up the Roman Citizen Cavalry, which, through its evolution, transformed into one of the prizes of the late Republic, only to disappear by the time of the Empire. Pre-Marian military In the late republic, the army became an instrument for successful international warfare, due to the reforms of one of Rome's greatest generals, Gaius Marius, a man admired and imitated by Julius Caesar. His changes were so critical to the success of Roman legions that the army is characterized in history as \\"pre- Marian\\" and \\"post-Marian\\" or just \\"Marian\\". The draft The highest officers of the military were the two consuls for that year, who were also the leaders of the senate at Rome. Each of them ordinarily commanded an army group of two legions: they also had responsibility for raising these troops. In militaristic Rome, the highest civilian officers were also the military chiefs of staff and the commanding generals in battle. They answered only to the Roman Senate. Raising the legions was an annual affair. The term of service was one year, although many candidates no doubt were picked year after year. The magistrates decided who in the tribes were eligible for selection. The word we translate as \\"magistrate\\" was the title of a tribal official, a tribunus (\\"of the tribes\\"). Here a basic division of the military and civilian branches applied, as well as the subjection of the military to the civilian. The working organizations of the tribe were called comitia (committees). They elected tribunes of plebs, \\"tribunes of the people\\", as well as 24 tribune militaries -- 6 per legion -- who were careerists with at least 5 or 6 years' service experience. A career would include both military and civilian offices. The 6 military tribunes were to be the senior staff of the legion. On election day, the presiding tribune sent the men of the tribe to appear before the military tribunes in groups of four. The four senior staffs of the future legions observed a priority of selection, which rotated. Each staff would take its pick, man by man until each had selected 4200 men, the complements of four legions. The selection of 16,800 men must have taken several days. If the circumstances of the state required it, the complement could be expanded to include more men, or the consuls could draft as many as four legions each. Additional forces could be drafted under ad hoc commanders called proconsules, who served \\"in place of consuls.\\" In the later republic, the relatively small number of legions commanded by the consuls (2-4) resulted in their power being overshadowed by the proconsuls, the provincial governors. Provincial governors often would command more loyalty from their troops than their consular counterparts did, and governors were able to raise vast numbers of troops. While provincial armies technically were supposed to stay within the provinces over which their governors had jurisdiction, by the middle of the 1st century BC this rule was ignored. By the end of the Republic, the various commanders participating in Rome's civil wars had raised the number of legions throughout the provinces to more than fifty, many under the command of a single man. The necessity of raising legions quickly, to offset battle losses, resulted in an abbreviation of the recruitment process. The government appointed two boards, of three military tribunes each, empowered to enter any region in the Roman jurisdiction for the purpose of enlisting men. These tribunes were not elected. The experience requirement was dropped in the case of aristocratic appointees. Some were as young as 18, although this age was considered acceptable for a young aristocrat on his way up the cursus honorum, or ladder of offices. The appointed tribunes conducted an ad hoc draft, or dialects, to recruit men. They tended to select the youngest and most capable-looking. It was similar to later naval press gangs, except that Roman citizens were entitled to some process, no matter how abbreviated. If they had to, the appointed tribunes drafted slaves, as they did after the Battle of Cannae. Soldiers who had served out their time and had obtained their discharge (mission), but had voluntarily re-enlisted, were called evocati. The Standard Legion A standard Republican legion before the reforms of Gaius Marius (‚Äúthe early Republic‚Äù) contained about 4500 men divided into the velites, the principes, and the hastati -- of 1200 men each -- also the triarii, of 600 men, and the equities, of 300 men. The first three types stood forward in battle; the triarii stood back. The velites and the equites were used mainly for various kinds of support. The class system of Servius Tullius already had organized society to support the military. He practically had created a \\"store\\" in which officers could \\"shop\\" for the resources they needed. Officers were elected by the civilian centuries, usually from the classic, or from the patricii if the latter were not included in the classic (there is some question about how this worked). There were available 80 centuries of wealthy classic, 40 of young men ages 17 to 45, and 40 of men 45 and older. These citizens could afford whatever arms and armor the officers thought they needed. The classic could go into any branch of the legion, but generally, veterans were preferred for the triarii, and young men for the velites. The rest was filled out from the young 40 centuries. The older 40 were kept for emergencies, which occurred frequently. These older men were roughly equivalent to the United States Army Reserve. If the arms requirement was less severe, or the expensive troops were in short supply, the recruiters selected from Classes 2 through 4, which again offered either older or younger men. Class 5 were centuries of specialists, such as carpenters. The Romans preferred not to use Class 6, but if the need was very great they were known to recruit even from slaves and the poor, who would have to be equipped with the state. The full equipage of arms and armor were the helmet with colored crest and face protectors, breastplates or chain mail (if a soldier could afford it), greaves, the parma (a round shield), the scutum (an oblong wrap- around of hiding on a wood frame, edged with metal, with the insignia of the legion painted on it), the pilum (the hasta veligers, a light javelin of about 3 feet with a 9-inch metal head), and a short sword they borrowed from Spanish tribes, the gladius. The gladius was both pointed for thrusting and edged for slashing. These arms could be combined in various ways, except that one battle-line had to be armed in the same way. Most typical was a line of principes armed with pole and gladii and defended by the scuti. The hastati could be armed the same way, or with the hasta and parma. The velites bore the hasta veligers and depended on running to get them away after a throw, which is why only the young were chosen for that job. The basic unit of the army was the company-sized century of 60 men commanded by a centurion. He had under him two junior officers, the options, each of whom had a standard-bearer, or vexillarius. Presumably, he used the two officers to form two squads. In addition, a squad of 20 elites was attached to the century, probably instructed ad hoc by the centurion. Two centuries made up a manipulandum of 120 men. Each line of battle contained 10 maniples, 1200 men, except that the triarii numbered only 600. The legion of 4200 infantry created in this way was supported by 300 equities, or cavalry, organized in 10 Turmae (squadrons) of 30 horse each, under a master of horse (magister equisetum), who took orders from the legion commander. Cavalry was used for scouting, skirmishing and various sorts of clean-up -- they also constituted another reserve that could be thrown into the battle. The Republic was ignorant of armies on horseback, which, coming off the steppes of Central Asia in blitzkrieg operations, were to trouble the later empire. The Legion in battle Servius Tullius, who most like originally was an Etruscan soldier of fortune, identified the disadvantages of an army recruited from landowners: such an army depended heavily on a large farmer-class of citizens to provide troops. So Tullius pressed for reforms that granted veterans land. Although he was assassinated he did establish the precedent of granting land to veterans. The army at first was not overly successful, partly because it faced superior generals, and partly because of its inexperience. Roman commanders gave up trying to defeat Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, by direct combat as he ravaged Italy. The most successful Roman general at that time, Quintus Vabius Maximus Verrucosus, surnamed Cunctator (‚Äúthe delayer‚Äù), camped at a distance and watched the doings of the Carthaginians, while his troops harassed the Carthaginian army on its fringes. Later, though, the army came into the hands of a family of careerists and professional soldiers, the Cornelii, a gens of the most ancient stock, patrician in the best sense of the word. They were the first real successors to Servius. After much trial and error, suffering personal losses, they produced one of the best and most influential generals Rome ever had, Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus. He built the Servian army into a victorious fighting machine. Let the Carthaginians ravage Italy, Scipio declared -- he took the war to Carthage, landing in North Africa with a republican army. The strategy succeeded: Hannibal was recalled at once -- he came home immediately, with a disrupted army, and he was beaten by Scipio at the Battle of Zama, in 202 BC. Using the tactics developed by Scipio -- now entitled Africanus -- plus good generalship, the army, at last, lived up to the potential imparted to it by King Servius. Roman army tactics worked as follows. The general first picked his ground. The Roman military now understood fairly well the importance of taking the initiative and picking its own ground, with some infamous exceptions. If the terrain was not right, the army remained within its fortified camp (which was virtually unassailable) until the enemy moved on, and then followed, waiting for an opportunity to engage. The ideal terrain was a gently sloping hill with a stream at the bottom. The enemy would have to ford the stream and move up the slope. The film, Spartacus, recreates this scenario. The legion was drawn up in three lines of battle, with the thermae and the velites placed as the situation required. The hastati in front and the principles behind were stationed in a line of maniples like chess pieces, 10 per line, separated from each other. The two centuries of a maniple fought side-by-side. The line of principes was offset so as to cover the gaps in the hastati, and the triarii, somewhat more thinly-spread, covered the principes. Roman soldiers fought in long thin lines. Such open formations allowed the Romans, often outnumbered, to outflank an enemy using a deep formation. The last thing they wanted was to be crushed together and cut down without being able to use their weapons, as they had been so many times before, and as so many armies who never studied Roman warfare were to be later. For the Romans, every man by regulation was allowed one square yard in which to fight, and square yards were separated by gaps of three feet. Now came the moment of battle... The thermae and the bands of velites (skirmishers) made forays opportunistically, trying to disrupt the ranks of the enemy or prevent them from crossing the stream if there was one. While they were doing this, the rest of the legion advanced. At a signal, the skirmishers retired through or around Roman ranks -- there probably were trumpet calls, but we know little about them. Picking up speed, the first and second ranks launched spears, the second rank over the heads of the first using light lance with launchers, the first rank at the last moment with pale, or javelins. On impact, the heavy iron points drove through shields and armor both, pinning men together and disrupting the line. The hastati then drew gladii and closed. So great was the impact, we hear from Caesar, that sometimes the men would jump up on the enemy shields to cut downward. What happened next depended on the success of the hastati. If they were victorious, they were joined by the principles, who merged into their line to fill the gaps and make up the losses. The triarii moved to the flanks to envelop the enemy. If the hastati were not victorious, they merged backward into the principles. The third line remained in reserve unless the other two failed, in which case the front two merged into the third. As Roman Legions were composed primarily of heavy infantry, they displayed the advantages and drawbacks of classical heavy infantry. It is notable that three of the biggest defeats (Battle of Carrhae, Battle of Teutoburg Forest, Battle of Ctesiphon) all came at the hands of light infantry or light cavalry forces. Marian reforms=Problems in the military By the end of the 2nd century BC, the Republican army was experiencing a severe manpower shortage. Soldiers also were having to serve for longer periods, and fight wars further away from their homes. For more information see Marian reforms Marius takes a hand The Gracchi had attempted to resolve the former problem by redistributing public land to the lower classes, thereby increasing the number of men eligible for military service. But they were assassinated before they could achieve this social reform. Rome instead followed the opposite but logical path of making any able-bodied citizen eligible to enlist. The popular Gaius Marius, at the end of the 2nd century, used his popularity to reorganize the Republican army. He took liberties with the letter of the law, to which few objected, and which later were ratified. First, he recruited men from the lower classes who did not meet the official property requirement. Then he reorganized the legions into the cohort system, doing away with the manipular system. The new legions were made up of 10 cohorts, each with 6 centuries of 80 men. The first cohort carried the new legionary standard, a silver or gold eagle called the aquila. This cohort contained only 5 centuries, but each century had double the number of men in the normal centuries. Altogether, each legion contained approximately 4,800 men. Professional army The Marian reforms had great political fallout. Although the officer corps still was composed largely of Roman aristocrats, the rank-and-file troops all were lower-class men -- serving in the legions became less every citizen's traditional civic duty to Rome, and more a means of rising in society. This trend was accelerated by Rome's wars of conquest, which resulted in huge influxes of slaves. Freemen with or without land could not compete with free labor. Signing up with a legion allowed the possibility of loot and land enfranchisement. The reforms also meant that legions were now more-or-less permanent formations, not just temporary armies deployed according to need (the Latin word 'legion' is actually their word for 'levy'). As enduring units, they were able to become more effective fighting forces; more importantly, they could form lasting loyalties to their commanders, rather than keeping loyalties to Rome. The 1-year consular system began to break down, and generals served for longer durations. This, in turn, meant that troops were more loyal to their commanders, which served as a catalyst for the oppressive and corrupt rule that the Roman military played in the later years under the Emperors. Evaluation On the one hand, the reforms of Marius created a professional army for extended service abroad. On the other, it increased the stature of the generals and encouraged competition between them, which is what made the civil wars possible, and it is why scholars often cite the Marian Reforms as the beginning of the end for the Roman Republic. The subsequent emperors ruthlessly eliminated powerful men and potential successors.

Prevalence The oldest parish in Germany is on the North Frisian island of Nordstrand; its origins go back to the year 1654. It was established by Dutch Ultrajectine Catholics from the Archdiocese of Utrecht employed to build dykes. Old Catholic parishes are most concentrated in North Rhine-Westphalia and in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The parishes in southern Baden are very close to the parishes of the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, with whom they share their heritage from the reform-friendly Roman Catholic Diocese of Constance, which was dissolved in 1821. In Bavaria, Old Catholic parishes are particularly concentrated in areas where German refugees from Bohemia and Moravia settled after World War II. In Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, and Hesse, Old Catholics are relatively evenly distributed. In the traditionally Protestant areas of northern and eastern Germany, by contrast, parish boundaries are far larger, reflecting the diaspora situation there. The Old Catholic bishop has his episcopal see in Bonn, which is also the location of the diocesan seminary at the University of Bonn, which has a professor‚Äôs chair of Old Catholic theology. Since 20 March 2012, Matthias Ring has been bishop. There is only one diocese, which covers the entire country.

The community was still part of the Northwest Territories when the incident occurred. Canada, at 4:10 a.m. on April 29, 1903. Around of limestone rock slid down Turtle Mountain. Witnesses reported that within 100 seconds the rock reached up the opposing hills, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster. The railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened. The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass in the Province of Alberta and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination. It has been designated a Provincial Historic Site of Alberta and is home to an interpretive centre that receives over 100,000 visitors annually. Background Frank, Alberta prior to the slide The town of Frank was founded in the southwestern corner of the District of Alberta, a subdivision of the Northwest Territories in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of Turtle Mountain in the Crowsnest Pass, where coal had been discovered one year earlier. It was named after Henry Frank who, along with Samuel Gebo, owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support. The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event. By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600, and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels. Turtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank. It consists of an older limestone layer folded over on top of softer materials such as shale and sandstone. Erosion had left the mountain with a steep overhang of its limestone layer. It has long been unstable; the Blackfoot and Kutenai peoples called it \\"the mountain that moves\\" and refused to camp in its vicinity. In the weeks leading up to the disaster, miners occasionally felt rumblings from within the mountain, while the pressure created by the shifting rock sometimes caused the timbers supporting the mine shafts to crack and splinter. Rockslide alt=Side view of a mountain scarred by a large debris field down its side. A field of rock lies at its base. In the early morning hours of April 29, 1903, a freight train pulled out of the mine and was slowly making its way towards the townsite when the crew heard a deafening rumble behind them. The engineer immediately set the throttle to full speed ahead and sped his train to safety across the bridge over the Crowsnest River. At 4:10 am, 30 million cubic metres of limestone rock with a mass of 110 million tonnes (121 million US tons) broke off the peak of Turtle Mountain. The section that broke was wide, high and deep. Witnesses to the disaster claimed it took about 100 seconds for the slide to reach up the opposing hills, indicating the mass of rock travelled at a speed of about . The sound was heard as far away as Cochrane, over north of Frank. Initial reports on the disaster indicated that Frank had been \\"nearly wiped out\\" by the mountain's collapse. It was thought the rockslide was triggered by an earthquake, volcanic eruption or explosion within the mine. The majority of the town survived, but the slide buried buildings on the eastern outskirts of Frank. Seven cottages were destroyed, as were several businesses, the cemetery, a stretch of road and railroad tracks, and all of the mine's buildings. Approximately 100 people lived in the path of destruction, located between the CPR tracks and the river. The death toll is uncertain; estimates range between 70 and 90. It is the deadliest landslide in Canadian history and was the largest until the Hope Slide in 1965. It is possible that the toll may have been higher, since as many as 50 transients had been camped at the base of the mountain while looking for work. Some residents believed that they had left Frank shortly before the slide, though there is no way to be certain. Most of the victims remain entombed beneath the rocks; only 12 bodies were recovered in the immediate aftermath. The skeletons of six additional victims were unearthed in 1924 by crews building a new road through the slide. Initial news reports stated that between 50 and 60 men were within the mountain and had been buried with no hope of survival. In reality, there were 20 miners working the night shift at the time of the disaster. Three had been outside the mine and were killed by the slide. The remaining 17 were underground. They discovered that the entrance was blocked and water from the river, which had been dammed by the slide, was coming in via a secondary tunnel. They unsuccessfully tried to dig their way through the blocked entrance before one miner suggested he knew of a seam of coal that reached the surface. Working a narrow tunnel in pairs and threes, they dug through the coal for hours as the air around them became increasingly toxic. Only three men still had enough energy to continue digging when they broke through to the surface late in the afternoon. The opening was too dangerous to escape from due to falling rocks from above. Encouraged by their success, the miners cut a new shaft that broke through under an outcropping of rock that protected them from falling debris. Thirteen hours after they were buried, all 17 men emerged from the mountain. The miners found that the row of cottages that served as their homes had been devastated and some of their families killed, seemingly at random. One found his family alive and safe in a makeshift hospital, but another emerged to discover his wife and four children had died. Fifteen-year- old Lillian Clark, working a late shift that night in the town's boarding house, had been given permission to stay overnight for the first time. She was the only member of her family to survive. Her father was working outside the mine when the slide hit, while her mother and six siblings were buried in their home. All 12 men living at the CPR work camp were killed, but 128 more who were scheduled to move into the camp the day before the slide had not arrived‚Äîthe train that was supposed to take them there from Morrissey, British Columbia, failed to pick them up. The Spokane Flyer, a passenger train heading west from Lethbridge, was saved by CPR brakeman Sid Choquette, one of two men who rushed across the rock-strewn ground to warn the train that the track had been buried under the slide. Through falling rocks and a dust cloud that impaired his visibility, Choquette ran for to warn the oncoming locomotive of the danger. The CPR gave him a letter of commendation and a $25 cheque (approximately $750 in 2019) in recognition of his heroism. Aftermath Early on April 30 a special train from Fort Macleod arrived with police officers and doctors. Premier Frederick Haultain arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain. Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide. Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated, and the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further. They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse. As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned. The North-West Mounted Police, reinforced by officers who arrived from Cranbrook, Macleod and Calgary, kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of looting occurred during the evacuation. Clearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance. Approximately of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line. The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks. Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30. To their amazement, they discovered that Charlie the horse, one of three who worked in the mine, had survived for over a month underground. The mule had subsisted by eating the bark off the timber supports and by drinking from pools of water. The mule died when his rescuers overfed him on oats and brandy. The town's population not only recovered but grew; the 1906 census of the Canadian Prairies listed the population at 1,178. A new study commissioned by the Dominion government determined that the cracks in the mountain continued to grow and that the risk of another slide remained. Consequently, parts of Frank closest to the mountain were dismantled or relocated to safer areas. Causes Several factors led to the Frank Slide. A study conducted by the GSC immediately following the slide concluded that the primary cause was the mountain's unstable anticline formation; a layer of limestone rested on top of softer materials that, after years of erosion, resulted in a top-heavy, steep cliff. Cracks laced the eastern face of the mountain while underground fissures allowed water to flow into the mountain's core. Local Indigenous peoples of the area, the Blackfoot and Ktunaxa, had oral traditions referring to the peak as \\"the mountain that moves\\". Miners noticed the mountain had become increasingly unstable in the months preceding the slide; they felt small tremors and the superintendent reported a \\"general squeeze\\" in the mountain at depths between and . They found that coal broke from its seam; it was said to have practically mined itself. alt=A metallic cylinder sits atop a square platform raised by two bolts. A prism connected to cables monitors the mountain for movement. An unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, was also a factor. Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports. Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures. GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide. The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below . Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain. Though the GSC concluded that mining activities contributed to the slide, the facility's owners disagreed. Their engineers claimed that the mine bore no responsibility. Later studies suggested that the mountain had been at a point of \\"equilibrium\\"; even a small deformation such as that caused by the mine's existence would have helped trigger a slide. The mine was quickly re-opened, even though rock continued to tumble down the mountain. Coal production at Frank peaked in 1910, but the mine was permanently closed in 1917 after it became unprofitable. The slide created two new peaks on the mountain; the south peak stands high and the north peak . Geologists believe that another slide is inevitable, though not imminent. The south peak is considered the most likely to fall; it would likely create a slide about one-sixth the size of the 1903 slide. The mountain, continuously monitored for changes in stability, has been studied on numerous occasions. The Alberta Geological Survey operates a state-of-the-art monitoring system used by researchers around the world. Over 80 monitoring stations have been placed on the face of the mountain to provide an early warning system for area residents in case of another slide. Geologists have debated about what caused the slide debris to travel the distance it did. The \\"air cushion\\" theory, an early hypothesis, postulated that a layer of air was trapped between the mass of rock and the mountain, which caused the rock to move a greater distance than would otherwise be expected. \\"Acoustic fluidization\\" is another theory, which suggests that large masses of material create seismic energy that reduces friction and causes the debris to flow down the mountain as though it is a fluid. Geologists created the term \\"debris avalanche\\" to describe the Frank Slide. Legends Numerous legends and misconceptions were spawned in the aftermath of the slide. The entire town of Frank was claimed to have been buried, though much of the town itself was unscathed. The belief that a branch of the Union Bank of Canada had been buried with as much as $500,000 persisted for many years. The bank‚Äîuntouched by the slide‚Äîremained in the same location until it was demolished in 1911, after which the buried treasure legend arose. Crews building a new road through the pass in 1924 operated under police guard as it was believed they could unearth the supposedly buried bank. Several people, telling amazing stories to those who would listen, passed themselves off as the \\"sole survivor\\" in the years following the slide. The most common such tale is that of an infant girl said to have been the only survivor of the slide. Her real name unknown, the girl was called \\"Frankie Slide\\". Several stories were told of her miraculous escape: she was found in a bale of hay, lying on rocks, under the collapsed roof of her house or in the arms of her dead mother. The legend was based primarily on the story of Marion Leitch, who was thrown from her home into a pile of hay when the slide enveloped her home. Her sisters also survived; they were found unharmed under a collapsed ceiling joist. Her parents and four brothers died. Influencing the story was the survival of two-year-old Gladys Ennis, who was found outside her home in the mud. The last survivor of the slide, she died in 1995. In total, 23 people in the path of the slide survived, in addition to the 17 miners who escaped from the tunnels under Turtle Mountain. A ballad by Ed McCurdy featuring the story of Frankie Slide was popular in parts of Canada in the 1950s. The slide has formed the basis of other songs, including \\"How the Mountain Came Down\\" by Stompin' Tom Connors , and more recently, \\"Frank, AB\\" by The Rural Alberta Advantage. The Frank Slide has been the subject of several books, both historical and fictional. Legacy Curious sightseers flocked to the site of the slide within the day of the disaster. It has remained a popular tourist destination, in part due to its proximity to the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3). The province built a roadside turnout in 1941 to accommodate the traffic. Town boosters unsuccessfully sought to have the site designated as a National Historic Site in 1958. It was later designated a Provincial Historic Site of Alberta. The provincial government designated the slide area a restricted development zone in 1976, which prevents alteration of the site. In 1978, a memorial plaque was erected. The Frank Slide Interpretive Centre, within sight of the mountain, was opened in 1985. A museum and tourist stop document the Frank Slide and the region's coal mining history. The site receives over 100,000 tourist visits annually. Though Frank recovered from the slide and achieved a peak population of 1,000 shortly thereafter, the closure of the mine resulted in a longstanding decline in population. Frank ceased to be an independent community in 1979 when it was amalgamated into the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass along with the neighbouring communities of Blairmore, Coleman, Hillcrest and Bellevue. Frank is now home to about 200 residents.

The first step of architectural education is the Diploma of Studies in Architecture, a three-year non- professional degree. This degree does not allow registration as an architect, awardees must pursue a Master of Architecture in order to obtain vocational qualification. India In India, the Bachelor of Architecture lasts for five years. Specialised institutes founded by the government of India, for excellence in the field of architecture and planning are SPAs (Schools of Planning and Architecture). They are Institutes of National Importance through an act in the Parliament, on the lines of IITs, NITs and IIMs. Currently, there are three such SPAs, with the MHRD (Ministry of Human Resource Development) mulling over setting up more such institutes. * School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi * School of Planning and Architecture, Bhopal * School of Planning and Architecture, Vijayawada * School of Architecture & Planning, Lnct University , Bhopal Some other institutes offering courses in architecture include the following: *Hindustan School of Architecture, Chennai *Noble Architecture College, Junagadh (Gujarat) * Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Madhya Pradesh * Christ University school of architecture, Bangalore * East West School of Architecture, Bangalore *School of Planning and Architecture, Centre for Design Excellence, Jaipur * State University of Performing And Visual Arts, Rohtak * National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh * National Institute of Technology Trichy, Tamil Nadu * VIT‚Äôs PVP College of Architecture, * BMS College of Architecture Bangalore * BMS School of Architecture, Bangalore *Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore * Sir JJ College of Architecture, Mumbai * Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Maharashtra * Vivekananda Global University, Jaipur * Centre for Design Excellence, Jaipur * Aayojan School of Architecture, Jaipur * Malviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur, Rajasthan * National Institute of Technology Raipur, Chhattisgarh * Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi * Apeejay School of Architecture and Planning * Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi * Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Patna Campus * Integral University, Lucknow * Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology University, Ahmedabad * Chandigarh College of Architecture, Chandigarh * IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal * IIT Roorkee, Uttarakhand * Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Howrah * Jadavpur University, Kolkata * Faculty of Architecture, Sarvajanik College of Engineering and Technology, Surat * Manipal University * NIT Calicut, Calicut * Surya School of Architecture, Punjab Technical University * Faculty of Architecture, Sri Sri University * GITAM School of Architecture, GITAM University * BGS School of Architecture and Planning, Bangalore BGSSAP *Prime college of architecture and planning, Nagapattinam *Rvs Kvk School of architecture , Trichy (Tamilnadu) *Tamilnadu school of architecture, Coimbatore (Tamilnadu) *School of Planning and Architecture, Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University, Hyderabad Turkey Architectural education is offered in various universities as a four-year program.

AUS architecture program becomes first outside North America to receive prestigious NAAB accreditation Other universities where UAE students Enroll are: * School of Planning and Architecture, Centre for Design Excellence United Kingdom Architectural education differs slightly in the United Kingdom. A five-year course used to exist in a similar fashion to the United States, but the 1960s saw the introduction of the sandwich course and a split of the B.Arch. into a 3-year BA (Hons.) degree (or in some cases BSc) followed by a year working in practice, after which a 2-year MA, PG-DipArch, M.Arch. or B.Arch. is completed. A further year of work completes the student's education upon the passing of Part III final examinations (See below). Registration as an architect is then permissible by the Architects Registration Board. Many UK universities offer postgraduate programs by coursework and research in architecture and related fields such as landscape architecture, planning, and urban design. The RIBA three-part examinations In effect, for most students to become an architect in the United Kingdom they must pass or be exempted from parts I,II and III of the RIBA's examinations. Completion of the three-year BA or BSc gives an exemption from Part I. Completion of the two-year DipArch, M.Arch. or B.Arch. gives exemption from Part II and the final two years of supervised practical training, with supplemental examinations and assignments, makes up the requirements for Part III. An alternative route to qualification exists by sitting the exams directly - currently this administered by Oxford Brookes University on behalf of the RIBA.

For students who want to study outside of the UK, the RIBA recognized courses offer the advantage of internationally recognized degrees, and other benefits, such as the possibility of RIBA membership. United States The Bachelor of Architecture is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) as a professional degree, allowing the recipient to qualify for the Architect Registration Examination (ARE). NAAB- accredited B.Arch. programs must include at least 150 semester credit hours, or the quarter-hour equivalent, of which at least 45 semester hours, or the quarter-hour equivalent are in general studies. There are also universities that offer a four-year degree such as a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies or a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (B.S.Arch) or a Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies (B.A.Arch). These are non-accredited, pre- professional degrees, and so these students must enroll in a Master of Architecture (M.Arch) program to be professionally licensed. However, enrolling in a pre-professional program often gets a student into a shorter M.Arch program. Any architecturally-related curriculum may eventually make licensure possible, depending upon the laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which the licence is required. The course of study of the Bachelor of Architecture includes studio courses on design and aesthetic theory, as well as practical courses on structures, building mechanical systems, electrical systems, plumbing and construction. Student work is often in the form of drawings and renderings, either through computer-aided design or drafting by hand. Students also build physical models and create presentation boards for drawings and graphics. In nearly all architecture schools in the United States, student life and work revolves around a studio class. Other classes in the architecture curriculum are designed to support the concepts emphasized in studio. One particularly rigorous aspect of studio classes is the \\"critique\\" or \\"review.\\" Students \\"pin-up\\" their models and presentation drawings for instructors (and students) who offer constructive criticism. Colleges and universities in the United States where either an NAAB accredited Bachelor of Architecture or Master of Architecture degree can be obtained are listed below.

The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane (including one unnamed hurricane) of the 1968 season, Gladys formed on October 13 in the western Caribbean from a broad disturbance related to a tropical wave. The storm moved north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane before striking Cuba on October 16\\\\. Gladys later reached peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) just before making landfall near Homosassa on the western coast of Florida on October 19\\\\. The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward, passing just east of Cape Hatteras on October 20\\\\. The next day, Gladys became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front over Nova Scotia. In Cuba, the threat of the hurricane prompted widespread evacuations. Gladys caused flash flooding and heavily damaged the tobacco crop. Damage in the country was estimated at $12 million (1968 USD), and there were six deaths. While passing west of the Florida Keys, the hurricane produced strong winds that briefly cut communications to the Dry Tortugas, but damage was minor. Near where Gladys made landfall, winds gusted to 100 mph (160 km/h) and tides reached above normal. There was heavy beach erosion and flooding along the coast, while the winds knocked down trees and caused power outages. Across the state, damage was estimated at $6.7 million (1968 USD), and three people were indirectly killed. Heavy rainfall in South Carolina caused minor river flooding. When paralleling just off the coast of North Carolina, Gladys was responsible for breaking the state's worst drought since 1932, and proved more beneficial than the minor storm damage there. Later, Gladys killed two people in Atlantic Canada and caused coastal damage in Prince Edward Island. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Gladys were from a tropical wave - a trough embedded in the trade winds - that moved across the Lesser Antilles on October 6\\\\. For the next few days, the wave moved across the Caribbean Sea without any development. As the wave interacted with the intertropical convergence zone, a large area of convection persisted across the region, spawning a series of low pressure areas. One became a tropical depression near Swan Island offshore Honduras on October 11, and two days later another tropical depression formed near San Andr√©s island in the extreme southwestern Caribbean. The latter system, which would eventually become Gladys, moved slowly north-northwestward. An anticyclone in the region caused wind shear to decrease, allowing for gradual development. On October 15, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed winds of ; on that basis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gladys. After becoming a tropical storm, Gladys intensified into a hurricane near the Isle of Youth on October 16. Shortly thereafter it crossed the narrow but mountainous region of western Cuba. By the time the hurricane reached the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, a deep trough was moving eastward through the United States toward a weak anticyclone off the east coast. Gladys turned more to the north, passing just west of the Dry Tortugas, before resuming its north-northwest trajectory, possibly due to a mid-level low near Alabama. Around that time, the eye was reorganizing offshore southwestern Florida, and the hurricane failed to intensify significantly due to the eastern portion of the circulation being over the state. Early on October 19, Gladys made landfall near Homosassa after turning to the northeast, with peak winds estimated at 85 mph (130 km/h). It accelerated across the state due to the approaching trough, emerging into the Atlantic near St. Augustine. Paralleling the southeastern coast of the United States, Gladys passed just east of Cape Hatteras on October 20, although by that time the strongest winds remained along the eastern periphery. The approaching trough caused Gladys to gradually lose tropical characteristics, and on October 21 Gladys became extratropical just south of Nova Scotia. A few hours later, the former hurricane was absorbed by the cold front. Hurricane Gladys was active during the Apollo 7 spaceflight mission, and astronauts aboard took several pictures of the hurricane. Later, researchers were able to compare the photographs to airforce reconnaissance data, radar, and local weather networks, the first such hurricane to be observed with such varied data. Preparations In advance of the storm, Cuban officials forced about 36,000 residents to evacuate from low- lying areas, along with 35,000 livestock. All flights were canceled in and out of Havana during the storm's passage. Many classes were canceled in the region, and workers took steps to minimize damage to the tobacco crop. Shortly after Gladys became a tropical storm, the NHC issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys and later a hurricane watch for the southwest Florida coast from the Florida Keys to Clearwater. After Gladys entered the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys to Cedar Key, with a watch to St. Marks. Later, hurricane warnings were issued from Charleston, South Carolina to Hatteras, North Carolina. Before Gladys made landfall in Florida, all schools in Pinellas County were closed, and officials evacuated 60 jet fighters from MacDill Air Force Base to Mississippi. , which was visiting St. Petersburg, rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico. The American Red Cross opened shelters across western Florida for people to stay in during the storm, and about 40,000 people evacuated their homes during the storm's passage. Then-governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. ordered 100 Florida guardsmen to assist with storm work. Shelters were set up in North Carolina, although few people evacuated. Impact Rainfall from Hurricane Gladys in the United States Before its first landfall in Cuba, Gladys produced wind gusts of at Nueva Gerona on the Isle of Youth. Rainfall on the island was estimated at . On the Cuban mainland, a station in Havana reported gale-force winds for several hours. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, causing flash flooding that damaged factories and crops; the tobacco crop sustained heavy losses to the extent that the Monthly Weather Review described it as \\"virtually wiped out\\". In Havana, floodwaters from the storm wrecked houses and other buildings, while in San Antonio de los Ba√±os, residents required rescue from their flooded houses. After the storm, Cuban officials advised residents in Havana to boil their water to prevent the spread of disease, after water lines were damaged. At least 36,000 people were left homeless as a result of the storm. Throughout Cuba, Gladys caused $12 million in damage and six deaths. While Gladys was still moving northward offshore Florida, it produced winds of on the Dry Tortugas, with gusts to . Rainfall on the Dry Tortugas reached over . Communications were briefly cut to the island during the storm. Along the Florida Keys, the only other report of a hurricane-force wind gust was on Plantation Key. Tides in the Florida Keys were about above normal, and damage was minor in the region. Farther north in Florida, hurricane-force winds were limited to a small area from Clearwater to Bayport, with peak gusts of . Winds in eastern Florida were not as strong. Gladys produced moderate rainfall across the state, peaking at at Cape Canaveral. Rainfall was generally less than , which limited flooding. The hurricane produced high tides near where it made landfall, reaching above normal; this caused heavy beach erosion and coastal flooding. The town of Sunset Beach was almost entirely under water during the high storm tides. Elsewhere, the high waves wrecked boat houses, and portions of the seawall were washed out in Tierra Verde. Gladys also spawned two tornadoes in the state, one each in Boca Raton and Palatka. The one in Boca Raton damaged a warehouse, while a waterspout in Whitfield Estates damaged three homes. According to locals, several other tornadoes touched down in Volusia and Putnam counties, based on the falling of trees and visible twisting trail of damage Across Florida, Gladys downed many trees and power lines, and the NHC office briefly lost power for two hours. Gladys affected about 85% of the citrus crop to some degree, although crop damage was fairly minimal, with about 10% lost in Pinellas and west Pasco counties. There was widespread property damage due to the strong winds, particularly to mobile homes. Strong winds in Pinellas County knocked over trailers and damaged billboards. In Ocala, most roads were blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Wind damage was minor in northeastern Florida, despite a wind gust of in Jacksonville. Two people died in the state due to storm-induced heart attacks, and another person died after driving into a flooded ditch. Damage in the state totaled $6.7 million, mostly to private property, and due to the damage, portions of the state were later declared a federal disaster area. The Small Business Administration authorized low-interest loans to homes and businesses damaged during the storm. Outside of Florida, Gladys produced rainfall through Delaware, with a maximum of in Marion, South Carolina. In the state, the rains caused minor river flooding and left minor damage to the cotton crop, while high tides eroded beaches. In North Carolina, wind gusts peaked at at Cape Lookout, while sustained winds reached at Nags Head before the anemometer blew away. The strongest winds were only along the immediate coastline due to the hurricane passing offshore. Gladys produced above-normal tides of . The storm knocked two houses off their foundations and severely damaged a business and a mobile home. Rainfall in the state helped end break the worst drought since 1932, and the minimal storm damage was offset by the beneficial precipitation. In southeastern Virginia, the fringes of the storm produced wind gusts of and light rainfall in Norfolk. Farther inland, rains from Gladys caused the Roanoke River to rise near Roanoke, just below flood stage. Tides were about above normal in the state, low enough to prevent major coastal flooding. Later, the extratropical remnants of Gladys produced beneficial rainfall of over Atlantic Canada, peaking at 5.03 in (128 mm) in New Brunswick. In the province, the former hurricane also produced 1.38 in (35 mm) of snow in Upsalquitch. Precipitation from the storm spread as far west as Quebec and as far northeast as Newfoundland, causing flooding in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Wind gusts in the latter province peaked at 65 mph (105 km/h) in Sydney. Along Cape Breton Island, the remnants of Gladys killed one person and injured four. In Prince Edward Island, wind gusts reached 85 mph (137 km/h) in Charlottetown, strong enough to knock over a tree and kill a man driving in Alberton. The storm washed out a portion of a bridge near Alberton and part of a wharf in Miminegash, and damaged 35 boats. Ferry service was disrupted between the Canadian Maritime provinces.

He was the 29th Lieutenant Governor of Montana, having served from January 2005 to January 2013. Bohlinger ran for lieutenant governor as a Republican on a bipartisan ticket headed by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Brian Schweitzer. Schweitzer and Bohlinger were elected governor and lieutenant governor in the 2004 election and both were reelected in the 2008 election. Due to term limits, they were unable to run in the 2012 election. He began his political career as a member of the Republican Party before switching to the Democratic Party in 2013. Early life, education, and military and business career Bohlinger was born in Bozeman, Montana in 1936 to John and Aileen Bohlinger. In 1941, the family moved to Billings, Montana where his parents operated a women's apparel store, Aileen's. While enrolled at Billings Senior High School, Bohlinger enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He went on to the University of Montana where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and earned a Bachelor of Arts in business. The Marine Corps called him to service after his sophomore year and he completed his university career after completing his service with the Marine Corps. Bohlinger spent the next 33 years as a small businessman working in the family clothing business. Political career Bohlinger served three terms in the Montana House of Representatives and was then twice elected to the Montana State Senate. He resigned his Senate seat as he assumed the office of lieutenant governor. On the 2004 Democratic gubernatorial ticket, Bohlinger, a Republican, joined with Democratic candidate Brian Schweitzer. There was no precedent in Montana for a gubernatorial ticket where the candidates belonged to different parties. The ticket prevailed, and Bohlinger was inaugurated as lieutenant governor of Montana, on January 3, 2005. The Schweitzer-Bohlinger team was re-elected to a second term, on November 4, 2008. 2014 U.S. Senate election On November 5, 2013, Bohlinger announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in 2014 for Montana's Class II U.S. Senate seat, to succeed the retiring Max Baucus. The Democratic nomination was won by US Senator John Walsh who had been appointed to fill the seat when Baucus resigned. Walsh dropped out of the race on August 7, following allegations of plagiarism. Personal He was the husband of Bette Cobetto, who died of cancer on January 9, 2006. Bohlinger married Karen Seiler in Helena on January 12, 2008. They have since divorced.

He was a chaplain to Queen Victoria, a Canon of Windsor, and tutor to the future King George V and his brother Prince Albert Victor. Life history Dalton was born in Margate, Kent, the son of Reverend John Neale Dalton and Elisa Maria Allies. He attended Blackheath Proprietary School before matriculating to Clare College, Cambridge, in 1858. Dalton was an extremely able student and achieved his BA (1st class) in 1863, and his MA in 1866; also winning the Schofield Prize during his studies in 1864. Dalton was appointed curate to Canon George Prothero in the parish of Whippingham on the Isle of Wight in 1869. The church was attended by the royal family when staying at their summer home, Osborne, on the island. Queen Victoria came to know Dalton, and chose him to become tutor to her grandsons, the royal princes George Frederick and his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence. Dalton had been second choice as tutor, after Edward Carpenter, another clergyman who had been a student at Cambridge University at the same time as Dalton and who remained a lifelong friend. Carpenter was a campaigner for socialist reform and homosexual liberation: Dalton later wrote to him \\"yet still I can't help thinking that our outlook on life and its problems is not so wholly dissimilar as one might imagine it would be\\" Aronson p.48-50Pimlot p.71 The royal children were then 6 and 7, and Victoria considered her son, the then Prince of Wales Albert Edward, had been neglecting their education. Dalton moved to Windsor castle and continued as their tutor through the next fourteen years.Gordon p.216 The younger prince, George, proved the more able and willing to learn. His brother and presumed eventual heir to the throne, Albert Victor, called \\"Eddy\\" by the family, was considered backward, lazy and obtuse. It was considered that although George was expected to follow a career in the navy, it would be unwise to separate him from his brother as he was considered a good influence upon him. Accordingly, both boys joined the cadet training ship HMS Britannia in September 1877. Dalton accompanied the boys, sharing a cabin with them while continuing to act as their guardian, and acted as chaplain to the ship. Despite Dalton's presence, the princes (Eddy nicknamed 'Herring' and George 'Sprat') were bullied by other cadets keen to have a go at accessible royalty. One cadet, Hugh Thomas was approved of by Dalton and began a friendship with the princes which continued for some years. In 1879 training on Britannia came to end. It was again proposed that Eddy should attend a public school, but Dalton recommended the brothers should remain together. Instead it was arranged that both princes and Dalton should sail on with a crew carefully selected to be a good influence on the boys. The captain, Lord Charles Scott, was a son of the Duke of Buccleuch, while his nephew the future 7th Duke was part of the crew. Other crew were also chosen for their royal connections, as in the case of Hugh Evan-Thomas (surname now officially changed by his father) who was posted to the same watch as the princes. Dalton saw it as his responsibility, despite royal instructions that the princes should be treated 'just like other ordinary midshipmen', to restrict their contact with other members of the crew, shifting away anyone who became too friendly.Gordon p. 221-222 The tour ended in August 1882, when Dalton and his charges returned with the ship to England. He took with him numerous mementoes of the tour, including the sailor who had been assigned as his servant during the voyage, who continued to work for him ashore for the next 50 years. He also obtained an introduction to Evan-Thomas' sister Catherine, who shortly afterwards agreed to marry him despite being considerably younger.Gordon p.224 Prince George returned to the navy, but Eddy remained a low achiever and continued a further year intensive tutoring with Dalton in preparation for attending the University of Cambridge. Dalton married Catherine Evan-Thomas on 16 January 1886. A. C. Benson, whom he had met when Benson became friendly with Eddy at university, was his best man. Benson wrote in his diary \\"Dalton showed me much fatherly kindness\\".Newsome, Excursions p.24, cited in Aranson p.71 Dalton described the homosexual Benson as \\"an object of adoration\\".Newsome, Edge of Paradise p.230, cited in Aronson p.71 Their first son Edward Hugh John Neale Dalton, later to enter politics and become Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton, was born at home in Neath, Glamorgan, August 1887. Hugh Evan-Thomas and Prince Edward were his godparents. Their second child, Alexandra Mary, was born in 1891, but in accord with Dalton's wish to have had a second son who he could have named after Prince George, was nicknamed 'Georgie'.Gordon p.227, 228 In 1892 Prince George briefly assumed command of during her commissioning and trials. Dalton was invited on board as George's guest. Dalton became Curate of Sandringham and a Canon of St. George's Chapel, Windsor. He was also Chaplain-in-ordinary and Deputy Clerk of the Closet to Queen Victoria and then Edward VII, Chaplain to Prince George as Duke of York and Prince of Wales. He was invested as a Companion, Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1881 and Knight Commander, Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1911. In 1920 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws (LLD) by the University of Leeds. Publications Dalton was an antiquarian and liturgical scholar.

The tower was constructed through the endeavours of Sir William Hillary, who had been instrumental in several rescues of sailors stranded on the rock, and which culminated in the heroic rescue of the crew of the Saint George Steam Packet Company steamer RMS St George, when it foundered on the rock in the early hours of November 20, 1830. Sir William personally contributed a high proportion of the costs and secured a substantial number of public contributions for funding the structure.Manx Sun, Saturday, October 21, 1893; Page: 8Isle of Man Times, Saturday, February 13, 1932; Page: 4 Origins The treacherous St Mary's Isle was a notorious hazard to shipping. The rock had been in the ownership of the Quane family for many years and in 1832 Captain John Quane, Attorney General of the Isle of Man, presented the rock to Sir William Hillary in his capacity as President of the Isle of Man District of what was then referred to as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, which subsequently became the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.Journal of The Manx Museum, Monday, June 01, 1942; Page: 18 The cost of the construction of the tower amounted to ¬£254 12 shillings. There were 63 subscribers whose total donations amounted to ¬£181 6 shillings, which left a balance of ¬£73 6 shillings due to the builder and architect. This sum was therefore met by Sir William, despite him and his family having already contributed ¬£8. Among the subscribers to the building of the tower were the Commissioners of the Isle of Man Harbours (¬£75), the Foxdale and Laxey mines (¬£2 each), the Mona Packet Company (¬£5), John Quane (¬£5), the Tobin family (¬£12). The average subscription was ¬£1 and came from many of the well known Manx families. One particular donation was from Thomas Tobin who donated a St George's Ensign which had cost him ¬£5. This was the first flag to be flown from the tower on Thursday August 15, 1833.Mona's Herald, Saturday, August 17, 1833; Page: 3 A list of benefactors towards the construction of the Tower of Refuge, and a statement concerning the ceremonial laying of the first stone, April 1832. Design and construction Designed by renowned local architect John Welch, of the company Hansom & Welch, the first stone was laid by Sir William on April 23, 1832, in the presence of Archdeacon Benjamin Philpot, Members of the House of Keys and numerous other prominent residents of Douglas. The structure is castellated in the style of the 13th century, having hanging parapets and corbels similar to those at Peel Castle and Castle Rushen. The tower originally housed a bell for the summoning of help and in addition the tower was stocked with provisions such as bread and fresh water for any shipwrecked persons. A further idea was to have a small boat accommodated within the structure, but this was not continued with. Despite the construction of the tower the waters of Douglas Bay remained perilous, particularly during periods of easterly storms. Ironically in the latter weeks of 1832 two vessels foundered in Douglas Bay (although not on the Conister Rock), and were lost with all hands. Tower of Refuge illuminated green in order to raise awareness of Mitochondrial Disease Centenary celebrations A celebration of the construction of the Tower of Refuge was held on May 9, 1932. The celebrations included a visit to the Isle of Man by Sir Godfrey Baring, the then Chairman of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution who was a guest of the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Claude Hill. The celebrations also featured the Douglas Lifeboat and Rocket Brigade and culminated with an evening at the Gaiety Theatre. Isle of Man Steam Packet Company vessel RMS Mona aground on the Conister Rock. Note the whitewashed seaward side of the tower, supposed to make it more visible to shipping. Additional historical information It has been suggested that the name Tower of Refuge comes from an 1833 poem by William Wordsworth. Whilst Wordsworth did write a poem concerning the structure during a visit to Douglas in 1833, the name Tower of Refuge had been synonymous with the structure since its conception.Manks Advertiser, Tuesday, April 10, 1832; Page: 3Manks Advertiser, Tuesday, April 24, 1832; Page: 7Manks Advertiser, Tuesday, September 25, 1832; Page: 3 For many years rowing boats would be available for hire on Douglas Promenade during the summer tourist season for the pleasure of visitors, and the tower was (providing the tide was not ebbing) the main destination, with refreshments available on the tower during the summer. Despite the construction of the tower, the Conister Rock has continued to be a potential hazard to shipping using the Port of Douglas. In 1867 the schooner Thomas Parker was driven onto the rock in a storm. Another incident occurred on 2 July 1930, when the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company vessel RMS Mona ran ashore on the Conister Rock. At the time the seaward side of the tower was coated in whitewash, and in view of the accident the outer face of the Victoria Pier was also painted white in order to make it more distinctive. The Conister Rock has always been accessible from Douglas shore during periods of low water on spring tides, although the walk to the tower could be somewhat perilous. During work undertaken on the tower in the early 2000s, a makeshift causway was constructed to enable plant machinery to access the rock. This has improved access to the Tower of Refuge and has led to a series of community walks to the tower, organised by Douglas Town Center Management to raise money for the RNLI.http://www.douglas.gov.im/index.php/news/council- news/item/2025-date-set-for-2018-tower-of-refuge-walk#.W5o1es5Kipo Today the Tower of Refuge and St Mary's Isle remains in the custodianship of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. * Other landmark buildings in the Isle of Man designed by Welch include King William's College and the Smelt Monument.

He was surgeon to both King Edward VII and King George V.  Early life  Fripp was the son of the artist Alfred Downing Fripp and Eliza Bannister Roe. His father's first wife, Anne Dalton Allies, was a cousin of John Neale Dalton, tutor to Prince Albert Victor and Prince George and godfather to Fripp. Anne died in 1850 after giving birth to Fripp's half-sister, Annie. Fripp had another sister, Jeanie (Edith Jane), and a brother, Rex (Reginald). Annie married Edward Penny, who became physician to Marlborough College. Rex, a pupil of the school, died aged eighteen - in 1895; their parents died in the same bronchial epidemic. Jeanie had gained a 'Senior Optime' in Mathematics at Girton in 1886 and soon after married William Hale- White, son of Mark Rutherford. Hale-White, a physician, and Fripp, a surgeon, were to work at Guy's Hospital together for over thirty years.  Royal Patronage  In 1883, on a visit to Cambridge to visit his sister, Fripp called on his godfather, John Neale Dalton, at Trinity, where the Canon was acting as 'chaperone' to Prince Albert Victor to whom Fripp was introduced. A year later he spent a few days at Cambridge in Prince \\"Eddy's\\" company. Six years passed in medical studies, sporting activities and theatre-going, when he accepted a two-week job as a locum tenens for Dr. Jalland, M. D., and an old Guy's man - in York. As Prince Eddy was stationed in the area and had to be attended to, they met up again. The Prince insisted that he accompany him to Deeside where Fripp became an accepted, if unofficial, doctor-in-residence to the Prince and other members of the Royal Family. Fripp was sent with Eddy on a Royal Tour to South Wales - with only the Prince's equerry, George Holford, in attendance. At the age of twenty-four, and still with exams to pass, he had the seal of Royal approval. When his \\"hope of hopes\\",Alfred Fripp by Cecil Roberts Prince Albert Victor, died in the 'flu' epidemic of 1892, he thought his Royal days were over; but four years later Edward, Prince of Wales, made him his Surgeon-in-Ordinary. With Holford's help and his own persistence, he persuaded Edward to preside over the Guy's Hospital Fund, ensuring the financial security of the Hospital - before he had been given a post there. However, after this Cooper Perry and Cosmo Bonsor persuaded the Board to create an Assistant Surgeon post for him. This, and his private practice in his brother-in-law's house in Harley Street, established him as a doctor, teacher and surgeon. A year later, just before his marriage, he set up as a consultant in his own home, 19 Portland Place. For the next thirty years aristocrats, plutocrats and famous stage personalities were frequent visitors - most as patients and friends.  Marriage  On 8 June 1898, Alfred Fripp married Margaret Scott Haywood (1880-1965), daughter of Thomas Haywood of 'Woodhatch', Reigate. His godfather officiated and George Holford was best man. The Fripps were to have five children: Alfred Thomas Fripp, FRCS (1899-1995); Betty Agnes Fripp (1904-1975); Margaret Cicely Fripp (1908-1972); Venetia Sybil Fripp (1911-1993); Reginald Charles Fripp (1915-1982).  Marconi  Mr. & Mrs. Fripp were halfway through their honeymoon - bicycling in Dorset and France - when they had to rush back to London so that Fripp could attend the Prince of Wales. He had damaged his knee in a fall at Waddesdon Manor and required Fripp to accompany him to Cowes Regatta. The Fripps were found a cottage near Osborne House where they befriended Marconi who was demonstrating his new telegraph machine to Queen Victoria. Along with the Prince of Wales and Sir James Reid, Fripp was one of the first people to send an official message using Marconi's invention.  Boer War  When, in late-1899, it was obvious that the Boer War was not going to be \\"over by Christmas\\", the yeomanry of the shires were asked to enlist in order to augment the regular Army - who were being killed more by an enteric epidemic than by Boer snipers. Georgiana (n√©e Churchill) Curzon decided to raise money to set up Imperial Yeomanry Hospitals, the first and biggest being at Deelfontein. Knowing Fripp socially - at places like Warwick Castle, where he was often a guest of Daisy and her husband - she and her Committee (mainly composed of Society ladies) selected the 34-yr-old Fripp to turn an empty bit of the Karoo, chosen by Lord Roberts, into an Army hospital for 500 yeomanry patients. With generous funding from the I.Y.H. Committee and the acquiescence of the military commander, Lieut.-Colonel Sloggett, Fripp transformed the idea of how to run a base hospital: despite being scoffed for doing it, he took over five times as many nurses than the R.A.M.C provided for a similar number of patients; he took more orderlies and assistants (including his wife who, leaving their son with her mother, travelled with him - and was later rewarded with a Royal Red Cross medal for keeping the men supplied with cigarettes and other such 'comforts'); and he took a physician, Dr. Washbourn, a dental expert, Newland-Pedley - both from Guy's - and an X-ray specialist, Hall- Edwards from Birmingham: three such specialists had never been taken to war before. He even took a masseuse who, he claimed, was more useful than he and his three experts put together. Having said all this, in his answers to questions put to him by members of the Royal Enquiry into the War in South Africa, he claimed that the modern steam sterilising unit he had had shipped from England saved more lives than medical expertise - and was more necessary than the most up-to-date medical implements. The success of this hospital was such a contrast to the R.A.M.C. hospitals - where men were dying in squalor - that when the M.P., Burdett-Coutts, reported the facts to Parliament and The Times, there was public outrage. However, Fripp had already returned with ideas of his own for the reform of the Army Medical Service. He sought out Balfour, who sent Fripp to speak to the newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Brodrick, and between them they chose a Committee, headed by Brodrick, to work out the details of Reform along Fripp's lines. One of their choices was Lieut. Colonel Keogh whom Brodrick appointed as Chairman of the working Committee; others were Dr. Cooper Perry of Guy's and Sir Frederick Treves. King Edward made sure his Government put the Committee's recommendations into practice before the end of his reign, but knighted Fripp for his part in instigating the reforms much earlier - on 18 July 1903; at 37, the youngest doctor to receive this title. At the outbreak of the Great War, Sloggett was in charge of the R.A.M.C. but, when the task immediately proved to be too much for one man, Keogh was brought out of retirement to share the duties. Fripp's practical solutions to problems at Deelfontein and his detailed plans for the R.A.M.C.'s reform were put into practice by the two Army Medical Officers who knew most about them. Years later, Brodrick wrote, \\"(I was) chief guest to a dinner given to celebrate the splendid service of the corps in the Great War. I felt that their most deserving guests would have been King Edward and Sir Alfred Fripp.\\".Records & Reactions: Midleton - John Murray (1939) p.167 At the time, Fripp's part in the success of the I.Y.H was deliberately left out of Lady Howe's 3-Volume Report because he had infuriated the Lady by suggesting to the Commission of Enquiry that some of the statistics in her 1st Volume were 'cooked'. He was never to receive full acknowledgement for this life- saving work.  1914 - 1918  At the beginning of the War, Fripp was employed by the War Office at Rosyth as Consulting Surgeon to the Navy. Later he described what he had seen.Experiences of a Civilian Among the Naval Medical Service in War by Sir Alfred D. Fripp, K.C.V.O., C.B., M.S., F.R.C.S. After one year, the Government decided that employing civilian experts was an unnecessary expense, so Fripp returned to voluntary surgical and advisory work in London hospitals set up by his wealthy friends in their palatial houses. For example, he helped George Holford to turn his Dorchester House in Park Lane into a hospital for officers, and then worked there. A few months before the War ended, Fripp became embroiled in the Pemberton Billing affair. Billing published an article saying that the dancing of Maud Allan as Salome was part of a plot to enable Germany to blackmail all those (47,000, according to Billing) Establishment and Society people who enjoyed watching lesbian dancing from a homosexual's play - or other such deviant pleasures. She sued him for libel in May, 1918, and a bizarre court case ensued during which - among other things - Billing implied that Margot Asquith, who employed a German governess and was a devotee of Allan's provocative act, was a danger to the security of the State. Fripp, for patriotic or personal reasons, agreed to attest that he knew of people at Court who might be a danger to security - but, in the event, Judge Darling refused to allow Fripp to answer any of the questions put to him. Billing won his case, and then the War ended - but not before Fripp had invited Lord Rhondda and Dr. Perry to his house to discuss the setting-up of a Ministry of Health. Lord Rhondda's death a few months later meant that this meeting lost its significance.  Charity  As a friend and doctor to so many rich and famous people, Fripp was always able to raise money, not only for Guy's Hospital - for whom he raised ¬£20,000 from his patients in 1925 and ¬£50,000 from Lord Dulverton in 1926 - but also for children's charities. His principal charity was the Invalid Children's Aid Association. He founded the Hackney branch of the I.C.A.A. in 1906 and immediately raised ¬£10,000 for it, and was indefatigable in his oversight of the Branch.  Ye Ancient Order of Froth Blowers  At the time of his retirement from Guy's Hospital in 1925, Fripp was a famous personage in London and environs: when he died in 1930, he was a household name throughout the Empire. In 1924, he performed life- prolonging abdominal surgery on a patient called Bert Temple. Bert formed Ye Ancient Order of Froth BlowersThe Zestful Gollopers by David L. Woodhead & Ian Brown in order to raise ¬£100 - in life-membership fees (5/-) and fines at meetings. This took a year. Then, in 1926, the Sporting Times advertised it and it took off. In four years Fripp, who was 'No. 1' to Bert's 'No.0', attended over two hundred A.O.F.B. functions and received in excess of ¬£100,000 from the 688,000 Froth Blowers who had joined by 1930. In 1927, he helped to establish the West Wickham Home of Recovery for Children with Heart Disease, and the A.O.F.B. endowed 17 of its 50 beds at a cost of ¬£8,500. It endowed at least 30 other 'cots' in other parts of the country. At the same time, in the grounds of the West Wickham Home, a still extant Girl Guide hut, called Heartsease, was built specifically for East End children. Over 600 needy causes were helped by the Order, despite being the target - Fripp, in particular - of the Temperance Movement's obloquy.  Last Years  Sir George Holford died in 1926 and the only non-family member he left money to was his friend of thirty-six years, Sir Alfred Fripp. As this was the considerable sum of ¬£5,000, Fripp had a house designed for him in Lulworth, Dorset, by Sir Edwin Lutyens and named it 'Weston' after Holford's country house, Westonbirt. Fripp was made a Governor of Guy's Hospital in appreciation of everything he had done for it, so was busy in retirement attending meetings of the Hospital and the A.O.F.B. In early 1930 he contracted nephritis and died on 25 February. He was buried in Lulworth churchyard. On 4 March a Memorial Service was held in St. Martins-in-the-Fields.  Legacy  Fripp left money to Durham University for an annual lecture on \\"Happiness and Success\\", the first - in 1932 - being given by Stanley Baldwin and another by Baden-Powell. Major Beith launched the Sir Alfred Fripp Memorial Fund a month after Fripp's death - devoted to the development, building and upkeep of Children's Department of Guy's Hospital and the Sir Alfred Fripp Memorial Fellowship in Child Psychology. Lady Fripp and her daughters continued his work, particularly in the area of girls' and boys' Scouting. He wrote a book with a colleague - \\"Human Anatomy For Art Students\\" - illustrated by his cousin, Henry Charles Innes Fripp (1867-1963).

During the Meiji period, Japanese bayonet fighting techniques were consolidated into a system named jukenjutsu, and taught at the Toyama military academy in Tokyo.

He is the head football coach at Texas Christian University and the winningest coach in Horned Frogs' history. Patterson has led the TCU Horned Frogs to six conference championships--one Conference USA title in 2002; four Mountain West Conference titles in 2005, 2009, 2010 and 2011; and one Big 12 Conference title in 2014--and nine bowl game victories--including victories in the 2011 Rose Bowl and 2014 Peach Bowl. His 2010 squad finished the season undefeated at 13‚Äì0 after a 21‚Äì19 Rose Bowl victory over the Wisconsin Badgers on New Year's Day 2011, and ranked second in the final tallying of both major polls. He is currently the second longest tenured coach with one FBS program, only behind Kirk Ferentz of the University of Iowa. Early life, playing career, education, and family Patterson grew up in Rozel, Kansas and played football at Dodge City Community College and at Kansas State University. Patterson is married to Kelsey Patterson (n√©e Hayes). He has three sons: Josh, Cade and Blake and two grandsons, Knox and Jet. He received his bachelor's degree in physical education in 1983 from Kansas State University, where he became a member of the Acacia fraternity. While coaching at Tennessee Tech, he earned a master's degree in educational administration in 1984. Outside of coaching, Patterson plays guitar and performs at charity events around the Dallas-Fort Worth area during the off season. Coaching career=Early years Patterson began his coaching career in 1982 at Kansas State University as an assistant to head coach Jim Dickey. After subsequently serving a number of years as an assistant coach at a number of different schools, Patterson was hired by Dennis Franchione as the defensive coordinator at the University of New Mexico in 1996. He had previously served as a linebackers coach at Tennessee Tech (1983-1984) where Franchione was the offensive coordinator and in the same capacity on Franchione's Pittsburg State University staff in 1988, as well as playing on the 1980 Kansas State Wildcats football team when Franchione was an assistant on the coaching staff. He followed Franchione to Texas Christian University (TCU) in 1998, serving as the defensive coordinator there, as well. Patterson was a 2000 finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top college football assistant coach. He was named head coach at TCU prior to the Mobile Alabama Bowl in December 2000 after Franchione left to become the head coach at the University of Alabama. Patterson remains friends with former Minnesota head coach Jerry Kill from their time as coaches on Franchione's Pittsburg State staff.http://www.footballscoop.com/news/3062-jerry-kill-kills-it-at-presser- with-enthusiasm-charisma-humorand-vision Kill served as the best man during Patterson's wedding to wife Kelsey in 2004. Head coach at TCU Patterson won his 110th game at TCU with a 56-0 rout of Grambling, passing Dutch Meyer as the winningest coach in program history. His teams have won 10 games or more in a season eleven times. Only three times have they failed to reach a bowl, in 2004, 2013, and 2019. Patterson's Frogs have earned a spot in the year-end top 25 ten times, counting his partial season as head coach in 2000. In 2005, Patterson led the Frogs to the Mountain West Conference championship in their first season as a member. Over the course of the 2005 and 2006 seasons, the Frogs won four consecutive games against Big 12 Conference opponents, with three of the victories coming on the road. He tandem jumped with the Army Golden Knights prior to the 2005 TCU vs. Army football game, crossing skydiving off his bucket list. Patterson was named the 2005 Mountain West Conference Coach of the Year. In January 2007, Patterson turned down a head coaching offer from the University of Minnesota worth over $2 million per year. Patterson led the 2009 Horned Frogs to a perfect 12‚Äì0 regular season record, a Mountain West Conference championship, a #4 final BCS ranking, and an invitation to the 2010 Fiesta Bowl‚Äîtheir first major bowl appearance in 51 years. They ultimately fell by a score of 17‚Äì10 to undefeated #6 Boise State. The 2009 Horned Frogs became the second \\"BCS Buster\\" from the Mountain West Conference (and the fourth, overall). For much of the season, they were a serious threat to \\"crash\\" the 2010 BCS National Championship Game. However, any chance of the Horned Frogs playing for the national championship ended on the final day of the season, when Cincinnati defeated Pitt on an epic fourth- quarter rally. This assured that two teams from Automatic Qualifying conferences would finish the regular season undefeated (whoever won the 2009 SEC Championship Game would have also finished undefeated). Patterson was named the 2009 AP Coach of the Year, becoming the first head coach of a BCS non-AQ conference team to win the award. He won a total of seven national \\"Coach of the Year\\" awards in 2009 in addition to being named the Mountain West Conference Coach of the Year for the second time (his third conference \\"Coach of the Year\\" award, overall). The following year, Patterson led the 2010 Horned Frogs to a second consecutive undefeated regular season and a #3 final BCS ranking. TCU received the first Rose Bowl invitation offered to a team from a non-AQ conference during the BCS era. The Horned Frogs won the 2011 Rose Bowl, 21‚Äì19, over Wisconsin to cap off only the second undefeated and untied season in school history. When TCU entered the Big 12 Conference in 2012, Patterson was faced with 7-6 2012 and 4-8 2013 seasons, but turned it around and led the Horned Frogs to their first Big 12 title in 2014, going 11-1, finishing in the top 5 of polls, with impressive wins over #4 Oklahoma, Minnesota, #7 Kansas State and scoring 82 points behind a 31-point third quarter against Texas Tech. The 2014 TCU Horned Frogs football team shared a conference title with Baylor and were ranked #6 by the inaugural College Football Playoff selection committee. Patterson once again won several national \\"Coach of the Year\\" honors for turning the team around after the disastrous 2013 season. He was also named the Big 12 Chuck Neinas Coach of the Year. Patterson now has four conference coach of the year awards, from three different conferences, all earned while coaching the same program. In August 2016, TCU announced Patterson's contract had been extended through 2022, with an annual base salary of $4.75 million. The Frogs went 6-7 (4-5) in 2016 losing 31-23 to Georgia in the Liberty Bowl. In 2017, TCU opened with a 63-0 drubbing of Jackson State. They dismantled Arkansas 28-7 in Week 2. In Week 3, the #20 Frogs beat SMU in the Iron Skillet Rivalry 56-36. In week 4, the #16 Frogs upset #6 Oklahoma State 44-31 behind a 31 carry 160 yard 3 TD performance from HB Darius Anderson. Next, the #9 Frogs won 31-24 over #23 West Virginia in a game in which QB Kenny Hill had a passing, rushing, and receiving TD. #6 TCU then won 26-6 over Kansas State and moved up to #4 with a 6-0 (3-0) start. They shutout Kansas 43-0 to be 7-0 (4-0) and leading the Big 12. However, in Week 8 they lost 14-7 to #25 Iowa State dropping to #8. They beat Texas the next week 24-7 moving up to #6, but they lost 38-20 to #5 Oklahoma. TCU bounced back by beating Texas Tech 27-3 in which Kenny Hill didn't play. In Week 13, the #12 Frogs beat Baylor 45-22 to finish 10-2 (7-2). They made the inaugural Big XII Title Game as #11 but lost 41-17 to #3 Oklahoma. They dropped to #13 and were selected to the Alamo Bowl against #15 Stanford. TCU beat Stanford 39-37 to win the Alamo Bowl.

He held his first exhibition in 1842, his initial works featuring Irish and Welsh peasants in landscape settings. In 1844 he became an associate of the Old Watercolour Society, progressing to full membership in 1846, and ultimately becoming its secretary from 1870 onward. Following the death of his first wife in 1850, he spent a decade in Italy, where he became friends with Frederick Leighton and Edward Poynter. On his return in 1859 he married Eliza Banister Roe and he continued to paint British subjects, with a particular interest in Dorset scenery around Lulworth. Many of Eliza's younger siblings were models for his paintings including \\"the FIsher Boy\\". He died, aged 72, in London.

Its followers were known as Ukapists (—É–∫–∞–ø—ñ—Å—Ç–∏, ukapisty), from the initials UKP. USDLP independents The UKP was an offshoot party of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party (SD's) created in January 1920 by former members of the Social-Democrats who prior to that were organized as the group of the independent Social-Democrats, USDLP independents. It opposed Russian domination within the future envisaged Socialist order as well as Russian domination of Republics formed within the territory of the former Russian empire. It condemned the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine (CP(b)U), criticizing it in its newspaper, Chervonyy Prapor for being subject to the Russian Bolshevik party in Moscow. Communists The initial membership of several hundred was made up of Ukrainian Social-Democrat Sovereigntists, former left-Ukrainian SRs Borotbists, and \\"federalists\\" from the CP(b)U, like Yuriy Lapchynsky. The Ukapists stood for a Soviet Ukraine with its own communist party separate from the Bolsheviks (renamed in March 1918 Russian Communist Party). In 1923 a faction within the UKP sponsored by the secret police (CHEKA) requested unification with the CPU. On August 27, 1920, then again in 1924, the UKP sent the Comintern a letter requesting recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian SSR and the right of Ukrainians to have their own party in the Comintern. The Comintern, de facto run by the Russian Bolsheviks, answered that the Ukrainian republic as a sovereign state within the USSR was already represented and that therefore UKP should dissolve and unite with CP(b)U. Recent research has shown that on the eve of their dissolution their influence was rising in Kyiv and Katerynoslav provinces. At its IV congress the UKP formally abolished itself. Some members joined the Bolshevik CP(b)U, including its leader Andryi Richytsky in order to have some influence on Ukrainian politics. Former Ukapists were purged in 1931‚Äì34, and then executed or exiled to Siberia.

Dante is best known as the real life lead singer of the fictional cartoon band The Archies; he was also the voice of The Cuff Links and co-produced Barry Manilow's first nine albums. Career He was born in Staten Island, New York, United States. The Archies single ‚ÄúSugar, Sugar,‚Äù written and composed by producer Jeff Barry with Andy Kim, was the number-one selling record of 1969 in the United States. Four years earlier, Dante had been a member of the parody group The Detergents, who recorded a novelty song called \\"Leader of the Laundromat.\\" Concurrent with his work on the Archies project, Dante was also employed as a session singer and performed many television and commercial jingles. In 1969 Dante recorded an album under the group name of The Cuff Links ‚Äì a collaboration with Detergents songwriter-producers Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss. He provided both lead and background vocals through overdubbing, as he did with most of the male Archies vocals. For three weeks in October 1969, Dante had two hits in the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot 100: both the Cuff Links' \\"Tracy\\" and, on its way down from number one, the Archies' \\"Sugar, Sugar\\", though neither single's label credited the anonymous studio singer. Dante's extensive vocal range includes falsetto, as used in \\"Jingle Jangle\\", the Archies' Top Ten follow-up to \\"Sugar, Sugar\\". Dante's first album release under his own name, which he recorded on Don Kirshner's label, was Ron Dante Brings You Up in 1970. In 1972, also under the supervision of Kirshner, Dante became lead vocalist for another cartoon group, The Chan Clan. He provided lead vocals for a number of songs on the 1972 album, Spiderman : From Beyond the Grave, A Rockcomic credited to The Webspinners. Ron Dante appeared on a 1975 CBS TV pilot show called Hip Patches. He is interviewed by a group of young musicians in a band named Silvermoon who were meant to be the stars of the show. On that show, he is introduced as the voice of \\"all five Archies\\" and explains to the audience what it takes to be a successful band. In 1979, he recorded a disco album under the name Dante's Inferno for the Infinity Records label, and in 1981 his second solo album Street Angel was released. Also in 1979, Dante performed the theme to the NBC television series $weepstake$: \\"Don't Be Afraid To Dream,\\" whose lyrics were written by Norman Gimbel with music composed by Charles Fox. From 1973 to 1981, Dante was the record producer for singer Barry Manilow, and often sang backup on Manilow's recordings, including his 1974 No. 1 single \\"Mandy.\\" Dante continued to record sporadically during those years; in 1975, with Manilow as the producer, Dante released a dance version of \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" under his own name. In 1978, Dante produced the Tony Award-winning musical revue, Ain't Misbehavin', on Broadway. During this period, Dante, who was a Manhattan neighbor of George Plimpton, was invited to serve as the publisher of the Paris Review, and whose publisher he served from 1978 to 1985. As of late July 2016, Dante remained active as a singer, producer, and concert performer. An album, Favorites, was released in 1999, and another CD, Saturday Night Blast, was issued in 2004. The extended play California Weekend CD was released in 2006. Dante's more recent high-profile appearance was with the CBS Orchestra on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 28, 2010. In mid-2018, Dante joined the Happy Together tour, filling in for The Turtles' Howard Kaylan who was sidelined due to health issues.

The new work may complete the older work (as with the numerous continuations of Jane Austen's unfinished novel Sanditon), or may try to serve as a sequel or prequel to the older work (such as Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett, an authorized continuation of Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind). This phenomenon differs from those authors who, because they share a common culture, use characters or themes from a common cultural stock. History The development of European classical literature out of the common stock of oral tradition proved conducive to reworkings, revisions, and satires. Numerous writers of Greece's golden age revived and reworked stories of the Trojan War and Greek mythology, although they were not strictly continuators as, for the most part, they did not invent or even extrapolate much from the received stories, choosing to alter the tone and treatment rather than the stories. Latin literature, on the other hand, may be regarded as systematic continuators of Greek models. The pinnacle of Augustan literature, the Aeneid, is essentially a continuation of the Iliad: not only in that it follows a minor character from his imagined origins in Troy to his founding of Rome, but in that it continues a historical ethos. This move, by connecting the Roman empire both culturally and pseudo- historically to the Homeric myth, is commonly viewed as a move by Virgil to legitimize the Roman empire. For instance, the epic opens with a summary of the progress of Aeneas and his progeny (in John Dryden's translation): :Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate, :And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate, :Expel'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore. :Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore, :And in the doubtful war, before he won :The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town; :His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine, :And settled sure succession in his line, :From whence the race of Alban fathers come, :And the long glories of majestic Rome. W. A. Camps expresses this common analysis of Virgil when he writes, \\"There is more than one reminder in the poem that its hero Aeneas is ancestor of Octavian through the supposed descent of the Julii [i.e., Octavian's family] through Aeneas' son Julius.\\" Like their medieval predecessors, Renaissance authors drew inspiration from earlier writers. More significantly, the spread of printing, slow increase in literacy, and the development of capitalism conspired to shape a modern concept of text and authorship. In this context, one sees \\"continuators\\" in the modern sense: authors either inspired or hired to complete or continue a predecessor's concept. This habit was most noticeable in the most commercialized spheres of literature. Elizabethan drama, for example, is full of examples. As an instance of completion, Francis Godolphin Waldron completed ', a late unfinished play by Ben Jonson. As an instance of sequel-writing, John Fletcher's The Tamer Tamed continues and lampoons Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Controversial literature was amenable to such continuations, as evidenced most especially by the Martin Marprelate affair; Philip Sidney's Arcadia was continued by Anna Weamys. Notes #Camps, W.A.

He attended the San Francisco Art Institute. He became known during the 1980s, and was represented by pioneer gallerists Colin de Land (b. 1955‚Äì2003) and Pat Hearn (b. 1955 - d. 2000) in New York City. He exhibited throughout Europe, represented by the minimalist art dealer and collector Rolf Ricke, in Cologne, and by the conceptual, Galerie Susanna Kulli, in St. Gallen, among others. Thom Merrick is known for creating formally challenging works in different media with a keen awareness of art history. Making a name for himself early in his career, he created works, paintings, sculptures and installations, reacting to the immediate environment with industrial materials and simplified forms or whatever material was at-hand. From the late 1980s to the late 1990s he created his works on-site, in situ to the exhibition hall. These works aim to break down the boundary of artistic identity, production and requisite classifications.

She was the lead vessel of her class and was operated by two German navies, the Reichsmarine and the Kriegsmarine. She had two sister ships, and . K√∂nigsberg was built by the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven; she was laid down in April 1926, launched in March 1927, and commissioned into the Reichsmarine in April 1929. She was armed with a main battery of nine 15 cm SK C/25 guns in three triple turrets and had a top speed of . K√∂nigsberg served as a training ship for naval cadets throughout the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she laid defensive minefields in the North Sea and then participated in Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasion of Norway in April 1940. While attacking Bergen, she was badly damaged by Norwegian coastal artillery, and sunk by British bombers the following day in the harbor. The wreck was eventually raised in 1942 and broken up for scrap the following year. Characteristics K√∂nigsberg in port; note the offset arrangement of the rear gun turrets K√∂nigsberg was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . She displaced at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four steam turbines and a pair of 10-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines. Steam for the turbines was provided by six Marine-type double-ended oil-fired boilers. The ship's propulsion system provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . K√∂nigsberg had a crew of 21 officers and 493 enlisted men.Gr√∂ner, pp. 119-120 The ship was armed with nine 15 cm SK C/25 guns mounted in three triple gun turrets. One was located forward, and two were placed in a superfiring pair aft. The rear gun turrets were offset to increase their arc of fire. They were supplied with 1,080 rounds of ammunition, for 120 shells per gun. The ship was also equipped with two 8.8 cm SK L/45 anti- aircraft guns in single mounts; they had 400 rounds of ammunition each. K√∂nigsberg also carried four triple torpedo tube mounts located amidships; they were supplied with twenty-four torpedoes. She was also capable of carrying 120 naval mines.Gr√∂ner, p. 120 The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick amidships and an armored belt that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides.Gr√∂ner, p. 119 Service history K√∂nigsberg on her visit to Britain in 1934; she is flying the British White Ensign and firing a salute K√∂nigsberg was ordered as \\"Cruiser B\\" and given the temporary name Ersatz Thetis, since she was intended to replace the old cruiser . She was laid down at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven on 12 April 1926 and launched on 26 March 1927. She was commissioned into the Reichsmarine on 17 April 1929.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 230 After her commissioning, the ship was assigned as the flagship of the reconnaissance force for the German fleet. She thereafter conducted a series of training cruises for naval cadets and made numerous goodwill visits throughout the Mediterranean Sea.Williamson, p. 14 In 1931, the ship's first major modification took place; her foremast was shortened and her rear superstructure was slightly lengthened. Otto von Schrader commanded the ship from September 1931 to September 1934. Hubert Schmundt relieved him and served as the ship's captain for the following year. In 1934, a pair of anti-aircraft guns in individual mounts were installed on her aft superstructure just forward of her main battery turrets. That same year, she and the cruiser Leipzig made the first goodwill visit to the United Kingdom since the end of World War I sixteen years earlier.Williamson, p. 15 In 1935, the ship had an aircraft catapult installed, along with a crane to handle floatplanes. The following year, the single 8.8 cm guns were replaced with a new triaxially stabilized twin-mount; two other twin mounts were added on the rear superstructure. Fire control directors for the anti-aircraft guns were also installed. After emerging from this refit, K√∂nigsberg was employed as a gunnery training ship. During the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, the ship participated in non-intervention patrols, during which she forced Republicans to surrender a German freighter they had seized.Williamson, p. 16 After returning to Germany, K√∂nigsberg resumed her gunnery training duties, and also served as a testbed for radar prototypes. She was scheduled to be transferred to the U-boat School, where she would be used as a target ship for U-boat crews. This duty was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. One day before the German invasion of Poland, on 31 August, K√∂nigsberg spotted the Polish destroyers and in the Baltic.Rohwer, p. 1 At the start of hostilities, she and several other German cruisers laid a defensive minefield in the North Sea. She then went into the Baltic Sea for training maneuvers. Kurt-Caesar Hoffmann served as the ship's captain from June to September 1939. In late 1939, a degaussing coil was installed on the ship's hull. K√∂nigsberg returned to active duty in March 1940, when she was assigned to the invasion force for the attack on Norway. Operation Weser√ºbung K√∂nigsberg circa 1936 The invasion of Norway took place in early April 1940. K√∂nigsberg was assigned to Gruppe 3, and was tasked with transporting 600 troops from the Wehrmacht's 69th Infantry Division from Wilhelmshaven to Bergen, Norway. Gruppe 3 also included her sister ship , the artillery training ship , and the torpedo boats Wolf and Leopard.Smith, p. 198 The Germans left Wilhelmshaven on 8 April, and had reached their target the following day, where K√∂nigsberg transferred part of the landing party to several smaller vessels. She then made a high-speed run into the port in an attempt to land the remainder of the infantry in the town directly. A coastal battery at the Kvarven Fort took the ship under fire, and scored three hits, all forward. The hits caused severe flooding and fires in her boiler rooms that cut the ship's power. Adrift, and unable to maneuver, K√∂nigsberg had to drop anchor, while she and K√∂ln, Luftwaffe bombers, and the infantry neutralized the Norwegian guns.Williamson, pp. 16-17 K√∂nigsberg required major repairs before she would be able to return to Germany, so she was temporarily moored in the harbor with her broadside facing the harbor entrance. This would allow her to bring all of her main battery guns to bear against any British naval attack. The rest of Gruppe 3 returned to Germany. On the evening of 9 April, she was attacked by British bombers, but to no effect. The following morning, the British launched another air raid on the ship.Williamson, p. 17 The raid consisted of sixteen Blackburn Skua dive bombers of the British Fleet Air Arm (seven of 800 Naval Air Squadron and nine of 803 Naval Air Squadron), launched from RNAS Hatston, Orkney. K√∂nigsbergs thin deck armor rendered her quite vulnerable to dive bomber attack. The Skuas attacked in three groups: the nine of 803 NAS, six of 800 NAS, and one aircraft of 800 NAS which lost contact during the outward flight but found K√∂nigsberg independently. The dive bombers attacked at 7:20, catching the ship's crew off guard. Half of the dive bombers had completed their dives before the crew realized they were under attack. Only one large anti-aircraft gun was reported as being manned with shells being fired once every five seconds from the aft of the ship with lighter anti-air weapons firing from the shore and adjacent ships firing even later in the attack.Smith, p. 203 K√∂nigsberg under attack at Bergen K√∂nigsberg was hit by at least five bombsSmith, pp. 199-203, which caused serious damage to the ship. One penetrated her thin deck armor, went through the ship, and exploded in the water, causing significant structural damage. Another hit destroyed the auxiliary boiler room. Two more bombs exploded in the water next to the ship; the concussion from the blasts tore large holes in the hull. She took on a heavy list almost immediately, and the captain ordered the crew to abandon the ship. It took slightly less than three hours from the start of the attack for the ship to completely capsize and sink, which gave the crew enough time to evacuate many of the dead and wounded. They also had time to remove a significant amount of ammunition and equipment from the stricken cruiser. Only eighteen men were killed in the attack. The wreck was raised on 17 July 1942, and slowly broken up for scrap thereafter.Williamson, p. 18 By 1943, the wreck had been completely dismantled in situ.

Percote is mentioned a few times in Greek mythology, where it plays a very minor role each time. It was said to be the home of a notable seer named Merops, also its ruler. Merops was the father of Arisbe (the first wife of King Priam, and subsequently wife of King Hyrtacus), Cleite (wife of King Cyzicus), and two sons named Amphius and Adrastus who fought during the Trojan War. As an ally of Troy, Percote sent a contingent to help King Priam during the Trojan War - though this contingent was led not by Merops's sons, but by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, according to Homer's Iliad, one native from Percote was wounded in the Trojan War by Antilochus, two natives from Percote were killed in the Trojan War by Diomedes and Ullysses.Bibliotheca classica: or, A classical dictionary, by John Dymock and Thomas Dymock, 1833. The Meropidae (Amphius and Adrastus) instead lead a contingent from nearby Adrastea. A nephew of Priam, named Melanippus, son of Hicetaon, herded cattle (oxen) at Percote, according to Homer. It is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including Herodotus, Arrian,Arrian, Anab. 1.13. Pliny the Elder, Apollonius of Rhodes,1.932., Stephanus of Byzantium, and in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax. According to Phanias of Eresus, Artaxerxes I of Persia had given to Themistocles the city of Percote with bedding for his house.Themistocles, Part II , by Plutarch (see: Percale) It was a member of the Delian League.Athenian Tribute Lists Percote was no longer in existence during the time of Strabo, and in his Geography he mentions that the exact location of Percote on the Hellespont shore is unknown. Strabo also claims that Percote was originally called Percope, and that it was part of the Troad. The inhabitants of Percote (and neighboring places like Arisbe and Adrastea) were apparently neither Trojan or Dardanian, and the origins of the Meropidae and Hyrtacidae are unclear. Its site is located east of Umurbey, Asiatic Turkey.

They are able to sustain continuous flight by exploiting the lift produced by slopes and thermals, controlled remotely from the ground with a transmitter. They can be constructed from a variety of materials, including wood, plastic, polymer foams, and composites, and can vary in wing loading from very light to relatively heavy, depending on their intended use. International radio-controlled glider competitions are regulated by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) although many countries have their own national classes. Launching methods=Hand launch Hand- launching an UMX Radian Hand launching is the simplest way to get a model glider into the air. Depending on craft design and the conditions at launch‚Äîthe pilot or an assistant need only to gently 'throw' it into the wind, at an angle deemed best suited, usually between horizontal and 45 degrees of zenith. In this manner a successful launch is possible with very little effort. This method is usually utilised when slope soaring, where with a little experience, it is possible to simply hold the craft above the head at the correct angle and let go. Towline launch In this method another person runs along the ground pulling a line with the glider attached to the end, while the pilot steers it. It can be performed on any flat piece of terrain, as the glider is given sufficient altitude during the launch. A variation of this method uses a pulley with the line staked to the ground and the line passing around it before going to the glider. The tow man runs with the pulley (still running away from the pilot) which doubles his effective speed. A variation of this is used in F3J competition when two tow men run with the pulley to generate much faster launches (although the models have to be sufficiently strong to handle the loads placed upon them by this method) which allows the model to use the energy to \\"zoom\\" (the model is pointed downwards briefly to convert the stored energy in the stretched monofilament line into airspeed, and once the airspeed exceeds the towline speed the line is released, before being rotated into a nose high attitude and the speed being converted back into additional height). Bungee/Hi-start launch This launch is a variant of the towline launch performed alone. The running person is replaced by a combined length of elastic cord or rubber tubing and line which is attached to the ground upwind of the pilot, often using a 'corkscrew' dog stake. Variations in rubber diameter, model weight and headwind determine the launch height.Hughes 1975, p. 181. 'Piggyback' launch A second, powered radio-controlled aircraft lifts the model glider into the air, attached to a special cradle which is, in turn, mounted to either the top or the bottom of the carrier aircraft. Although this method is spectacular, it requires an experienced pilot to steer the carrier aircraft as the addition of the glider can significantly affect the handling of their model. Special care must be also taken by the pilots of both models to avoid a collision after the release of the glider. Discus launch This method of launching can be performed only on a special type of glider - a Discus Launch Glider (DLG). To launch the model into the air, the pilot holds the model by the tip of a wing, spins 360¬∞, rotating the model around their body and then releases hold of the model allowing it to launch at high speed and climb to height. Although DLGs are a fairly new type of model glider, they are gaining popularity due to their ease of launching and efficient flight characteristics. DLG models are used in the F3K contest class, as defined by the FAI. Aerotow launch As full-size aerotowing using a radio-controlled tug, often used for launching larger scale gliders.Hughes 1975, p. 193. Winch launch As full-size winch launching but using a small electric motor (usually based on a car starter motor) and a reverse pulley staked to the ground upwind. The launch speed is controlled by the pilot using a foot pedal.Hughes 1975, p. 257. A parachute is used (pulled shut by the launch tension) to assist in preventing the winch spool overrunning when the model is released. Variations have included multiple batteries and motors but regulations were put in place in the late 1980s by the FAI to limit the winch power used in FAI class competitions. Forms of flight=Slope soaring Slope soaring refers to unpowered aircraft sustaining flight on the lift produced by wind blowing up the face of a steep slope on hills, mountains, and cliffs.Stringwell 1997, p. 17. See the Ridge Lift page for more information on the lift mechanism of \\"frontside\\" flying. Dynamic soaring, utilizing the leeward or \\"backside\\" of a hill, has recently become very popular. =DisciplinesF3F Another form of slope R/C glider racing is called F3F. F3F is one of many competition categories for model and full scale aircraft that are defined by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI). In F3F racing, the pilot is timed on the course for 10 legs of for a total distance of . All pilots fly a timed run for each round. The fastest pilot receives 1,000 points for the round and all others are given a percentage which is determined by the ratio of their time to the fast time for the round. At the end of the competition, the pilot with the most points wins.Hughes 1975, p. 105. Combat Combat is usually flown with expanded polypropylene (EPP) foam models due to their impact resistance. Each pilot tries to knock the other's aircraft physically out of the air. A \\"kill\\" is scored only when the opponents aircraft hits the ground. If a hit occurs and each aircraft recovers and remains airborne, the hits generally do not count. Often this activity includes extreme maneuvers and aerobatics. This particular class of slope glider is extremely popular, as novices can learn to fly with a model that is practically indestructible. There is also a wide appeal in owning an inexpensive glider that is also a stand-off scale model, particularly of favorite World War II fighters, e.g. the Spitfire/Seafire, P-51 Mustang and P-47 Thunderbolt. Ridge racing Ridge racing (or pylon racing where markers are present) is essentially using the slope lift to race along the \\"lift zone\\"‚Äîgenerally parallel to the slope. This can be MoM (man-on-man) racing, in which 2 to 4 gliders compete against each other on the same course. Scoring is similar to match racing in the sport of sailing - the first pilot to complete the course receives one point, the second two points and so on. At the end of the competition, the pilot with the fewest points wins. PSS PSS, or Power Scale Soaring, is all about building and flying scale model gliders of full-sized jet-, rocket- or piston-powered aircraft. World War II prop planes such as the P-51, Supermarine Spitfire and Me 109 are common subjects for PSS planes, however PSS aircraft produced to date have ranged from the early biplanes through to modern jet fighters and even commercial airliners. The challenge with Power Scale Soaring is to build a model as close to scale as possible whilst at the same time ensuring the model has good flying characteristics. Model EPP jet fighter slope soarers have become extremely popular, usually either 1950s and some 1960s designs e.g. the MiG-15, the P-80 Shooting Star, and the F-86 Sabre, and the Northrop F-5 and F-20. More ambitious modellers are experimenting with more recent jet fighters such as the F-16, F-15, MiG-29 and Su-27. Dynamic soaring Dynamic soaring is a relatively new style of flying model gliders whereby the windshear just downwind of certain slopes can be used to create high speeds. It involves gaining altitude, then soaring into a patch of dead air, then back to the lift to gain speed. Slope Aerobatics Slope aerobatics involves flying aerobatic figures and sequences on the slope with gliders that have been optimized for aerobatic flight. These gliders typically using airfoils that allow identical upright and inverted performance, as well as unique fuselage shapes that permit some amount of sustained knife edge flight. Most gliders feature three axes of control (aileron, elevator, and rudder), and often use flaperons to extend the capabilities of the airfoils for maximum aerobatic performance. Some of the most advanced slope aerobatics gliders feature all-moving elevators and rudders capable of 180* rotation, allowing them to perform \\"flips\\" around the pitch or yaw axis, respectively. Airframes are constructed of any material, with wood, fiberglass and/or carbon fiber being preferred for gliders intended for precision aerobatics, and EPP (expanded polypropylene) being popular for low altitude aerobatics where interactions with the ground - like wingtip and/or inverted fin drags, or touch-and-goes off of obstacles - are commonly performed and desired. Thermal soaring Thermal soaring uses columns of warm, rising air called thermals to provide lift for a glider. Thermal soaring gliders are normally launched with a bungee cord catapult, a winch or towed by a powered model aircraft. A discus launch glider (DLG) is simply launched into the air with a spinning motion much like a discus throw. Thermal soaring is often combined with slope soaring. Thermals from elsewhere can drift in over the hill to combine with the hill lift or they can be formed by the hill itself, if the slope is angled to the sun causing the slope to heat up faster than in the surrounding areas. The resulting warm air will then flow upwards pulling in air from the valley below, causing a wind up the slope. The lift is thus a combination of ridge lift and thermal. This has produced a new term, \\"slermal\\", to describe the mixture of both slope lift and thermal activity coming up the hill face. =F3J= F3J is one of many competition categories for model and full scale aircraft that are defined by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI). F3J is a man on man thermal soaring competition undertaken on a flat field site (ideally 1‚Äì2 miles from workable slope lift). Models are launched by a monofilament tow line, pulled by two towers who run with the line or a pulley. The method is similar to winch launching without any electrical equipment required. A group typically of from 6 to 10 pilots try to fly for as long as possible within a 10-minute period of time (known as a slot). Within the slot time they have to launch the glider, fly for as long as possible and land as close as they can to a predetermined spot, without overflying the end of the slot time. If the nose of the model comes to rest on the centre of the landing spot then 100 landing points are scored. Landing points are reduced by 1 point every 20 cm from the center of the landing circle. A combination of the flying time (as a percentage of the longest flight within the slot) and precision landing makes up scoring. A maximum of 1000 points is awarded to the winner of each group. Overflying the slot time results in a penalty and the withdrawal of any landing points bonus. The models have evolved into predominantly all composite gliders of 3.4‚Äì4 m wingspan with full span flaps and ailerons, sufficiently strong to take a two- man tow in a wind of up to 20 mph. Advances in composite construction have reduced the flying weights of these models to less than 2 kg. Ballast weight is added to increase the flying speed during windy weather. The individual winner of the competition is determined by a fly-off in which the top 10‚àí12 competitors fly after the preliminary rounds. The fly-off task is 15 minutes, making the soaring task more difficult. Typical winning scores at a World Championships are 14:58 minutes of flight times and 98-100 landing points. The top places are separated by the smallest margins, often less than 5 points separate the winner from 5th place. =F3B= F3B is the original sailplane competition category defined by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI). Originally called \\"Thermal Soaring\\" it is now called \\"Multitask Soaring.\\" F3B is a flat field, thermal soaring category where the glider is launched with the help of an electric winch. There are three tasks to perform. Thermal duration, where the goal is to keep flying for 10 minutes and land on the spot; distance, flying the maximum number of laps in four minutes; and speed, flying the minimum time to cover four laps of each. The three tasks have to be flown with the same plane, changing only weight between tasks. Duration is flown at the minimum weight, typically around 2 kg. Speed is flown up to the maximum of 5 kg but typically around 3‚Äì4 kg depending on the wind and lift. Distance can be flown at a wide variety of weights, depending on the thermal conditions available, with heavier weights to fly faster and lighter ones to fly slower. F3B models are called multitask gliders, similar to F3F slope gliders with a lighter composite layup. The design of the F3B model is especially challenging because of the wide range of operating conditions. It must be flown very slowly to achieve the duration time and create high lift to maximize launch altitude off the winch. At the same time it must have very low drag to fly at high speed during the distance and speed tasks. The launch and turning loads require very strong airframes, composite construction has been in use since the first world championship in 1977. Models are typically constructed from carbon fiber, utilizing more exotic high modulus carbon in the wing spars. The empty weight of the airframes have come down substantially since the early 1990s when competitive aircraft weighed 3 kg empty. Many top designs are commercially available from manufacturers such as TUDM, Baudis Model and Samba Model in Europe. =F3K= F3K is the competition category for discus launched models where the competition is divided in different tasks and combined tasks in a way that the pilot may launch several times within a task, for example adding consecutive flying times as long as the time of the last flight is longer than the previous one. F3K models are among the lightest radio controlled gliders. Typical flying weights are less than 9 ounces, with full trailing edge and tail controls. Construction is typically very light weight carbon fiber, fiberglass and kevlar. Advances in composites and micro radio equipment have enabled these gliders to increase performance dramatically over their historical javelin style hand launched siblings. Weight is kept to a minimum in all parts of the model. Common practices include removing the plastic cases from the radio receivers, using the smallest batteries practical, and flying the models without any paint. Modern aerodynamic design practices have also been applied to reduce the drag and improve the handling characteristics of these gliders. Design tools such as Xfoil, created by Prof Mark Drela at MIT, have been applied to the design of these aircraft, creating much better understanding of low speed aerodynamics and inspiring new design practices, such as thin airfoils. In some cases, the minimum thickness of the wing is limited only by the thickness of the servos that must fit within that wing to control the flaps. Types Two foam wings Flying wings The flying wing design is particularly popular for slope combat in which pilots try to knock other gliders out of the air. A \\"kill\\" is only scored when one plane is grounded and the other flies away, regardless of which plane initiated the hit. Expanded polypropylene foam (EPP) foam has become very popular in the construction of these gliders, primarily due to their damage resistance and low cost. The most common wing span is 4 feet (1.22 meters). Well-built gliders will typically survive head-on collisions with combined speeds exceeding 50 mph (80 km/h) with little to no damage to either plane. Scale gliders Scale gliders are models of full-size gliders. Scale gliders are generally larger models (2 m wingspan or greater) and made from composite materials. Scale Gliders are sometimes modified slightly to obtain the best flying characteristics, such as less drag and more aerobatic potential. This is achieved by changing the size of the control surfaces or the wing airfoil. Some scale gliders are very close in appearance to their full scale counterparts, and this makes them a beautiful sight at any flying field. A model often \\"scaled\\" because of its clean looks and great aerobatic potential is the MDM-1 Fox. The ASW series (mostly ASW-26 and ASW-28) are also popular scale gliders. Powered gliders UMX Radian on a rock formation at Bald Head Cliff Powered gliders use electric motors, internal combustion engines or even jet engines to provide propulsion for a glider to get in the air. The power systems are normally only used for short periods to launch thermal soarers, motor runs of 30 seconds are typical with timer or height limiting onboard electronics cutting power automatically during competitions.Hughes 1975, p. 189. Electric gliders use propellers which fold inwards when the power source is cut off during flight. This provides the glider with lower air resistance and reduces overall drag which would be present if the propeller was to remain in its open or natural state. Competition classes NoteClasses from Stringwell 1997, appendix 1 International International radio-controlled glider competitions are regulated by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI). The classes are: * F3B :Multi-task soaring, model limitations defined by FAI rules.

Until the 1960s the village could be reached only by train, but that changed when Highway 99 was built through Whistler (then named Alta Lake) and Pemberton.  Pemberton  Pemberton, British Columbia, Canada, is a small village located in the Coast Mountains, 100 miles (159 km) north of Vancouver. Pemberton has a population of approximately 2,574 people. Until the early 1960s, when Highway 99 was built, Pemberton was accessible only by train and the population was under 200 people. The local economy is also dependent on logging and tourism. Mt. Currie rises to the south, at 8,500 ft (2,591 m), and can be seen throughout the Pemberton Valley. Climate The climate of Pemberton is very warm and dry in the summer and mild and wet in the winter. Pemberton is an ecologically complex and diverse zone which is referred to as the Coast-Interior Transition zone. Moving from west to east in the direction of the prevailing winds and taking into consideration the elevation changes; it follows that there is a windward, wetter zone and a leeward drier zone and an even drier zone on the leeward side of the Lillooet Ranges and the Pacific Ranges north of the rail line. High summer temperatures and the pronounced water deficits during the growing season are the norm. History=Those who were here first The Pemberton Valley lies in the traditional territory of Lil'wat Nation who have lived on these lands for thousands of years. Potatoes have been grown in the Pemberton Valley since the earliest days.Decker et al, pp. 19‚Äì20. Joe Joseph says that the land he inherited from his grandmother grew the first potatoes in the valley and that before the Gold Rush, when she was six, his grandmother had traveled to the coast with relatives and there visited a Mount Currie woman who had moved away from the valley and was then living somewhere in the Lower Mainland, perhaps around Fort Langley. When Joe's grandmother and her relatives were leaving to return to the Mt. Currie homes, the woman they had visited gave them a pail of ‚Äúskinny, long, lady finger‚Äù potatoes, and said to plant them all that year, but to save the whole crop the first year and plant that crop with coming of the second spring. Then, she said, the Mount Currie people could eat some of the potatoes they would dig the next fall. The returning visitors followed directions because the cultivation of domestic potatoes fitted well into the gardening practices of native women who dug them with forked sticks, and early miners making their way north to the Fraser River gold fields stared in astonishment at the potato fields of Joe's ancestors. Early European exploration In 1827, the Hudson's Bay Company's men first penetrated the valleys of the Birkenhead and Lillooet Rivers. Frances Ermantinger arrived then by way of Seton Lake and Anderson Lake, and James Murray Yale came three years later, having made the trip north from Fort Langley. In all likelihood both men were searching for a safe route for fur brigades from Kamloops and Fort Langley, for a route to bypass the lower Fraser River canyons. In 1846, Alexander Caulfield Anderson travelled through this country with the same purpose: to decide if company horses could make their way from the Fraser to present day Mount Currie and on, by way of Lillooet and Harrison Lakes, to Fort Langley. By then, as of the Oregon Treaty, the lower Columbia River, the main link with the Interior, was American, and for that reason Governor Simpson considered a new route \\"most highly important.\\" The men travelled on foot and by canoe from Kamloops to the south end of the lake named for the leader (Anderson Lake). Seton Lake was named for an officer named Alexander Seton, a relative of A.C. Anderson. Seton served as lieutenant colonel on and which sank off the coast of Africa (famous for being the first time \\"women and children first\\" was heard). The exploration party continued by what Anderson described as a \\"very good trail,\\" and camped overnight at the Birkenhead River. The next day, following the Birkenhead River, they reached Mount Currie area by late afternoon. The route was never used by the company, which chose to build the Brigade Trail from Hope via passes over the Coastal Range / Cascade Mountains to the east of the Fraser Canyon to reach Fort Kamloops. The gold rush era In 1858 the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush began and some 30,000 miners began the trek through traditional Lil'wat and upper St'at'imc territory to the goldfields at Lillooet, then known as Cayoosh Flat. Many miners who reached the goldfields in the summer of 1858 intended to stay the winter and this created an urgent problem for Governor Douglas of Vancouver Island. The miners needed food and that food had to be transported to regions above the lower canyons of the Fraser, where there were no roads. Because he knew that twelve years earlier A.C. Anderson had traveled from Lillooet by a chain of lakes to Fort Langley, Governor James Douglas asked for a survey a route linking all lakes between the north end of Harrison Lake and the Fraser River. The total length of trail would be just over sixty-eight miles, the total length of all lakes nearly fifty-six miles. Five hundred miners eager to reach the gold-bearing Fraser River bars volunteered to build the trail, and were charged $5 each for the privilege of doing so, in the form of a deposit to be refunded in exchange for goods upon completion. They established Port Douglas and constructed a trail called Douglas Portage to the north end of Lillooet Lake and called it Port Pemberton. This was the first public works project in the newly formed Crown Colony of British Columbia and is also known as the Harrison-Lillooet Trail, the Lillooet Trail, the Lakes Route, or the Douglas Trail. Early settlement Pemberton was named for Joseph Despard Pemberton, a surveyor for the Hudson's Bay Company and Surveyor-General for the Colony of Vancouver Island in the 1850s. Joseph Pemberton had laid out Victoria's townsite, and supervised the construction of British Columbia's first legislature building, \\"the Birdcages\\". Joseph Pemberton never visited the place that bears his name. The little port developed to serve the Gold Rush and nearby farming settlement grew as mining traffic increased. Then very quickly, when traffic shifted to a route better than the one between Harrison Lake and Lillooet, most of the few settlers then in the area moved on. One of the assets of the area would become widely known ‚Äì the richness of the land ‚Äì and small waves of settlement would continue until a new Pemberton would replace the first Port Pemberton.Decker et al, pp. 49‚Äì51. Anderson, Alexandar Caulfield. ‚ÄúHistory of the Northwest Coast.‚Äù Victoria B.C., 1878, pp 48-56. Before the last of the farmers moved away national and provincial demands for new routes brought more strangers to the area seeking access. As early as 1891 men incorporated a company to build a railway from the coast to Pemberton and beyond, but not until 1914 did a train run into the valley. The new settlers in the late 1800s included John Currie, who was listed as a permanent resident in 1885. John emigrated from Scotland to Quebec with his family at the age of seventeen and soon ran away from home and struck off for the California gold fields. He returned to Pemberton to pre-empt land with his partner McDonald. John settled in Pemberton with his native wife, Seraphine Joseph of Mt. Currie, and they ran Pemberton's first post office, serving a handful of settlers. Andrew Joseph was one of the first mail carriers, who in all weather brought mail in from Lillooet. In 1873, Marcus Smith, the leader of the first railway survey party in this area, supervised a survey that brought him, Anderson and Seton Lakes to Lillooet, following the route the Pacific Great Eastern Railway would take forty years later and which was used for the construction of the Lillooet Cattle Trail to the mouth of the Seymour River in North Vancouver. Completed in 1878, the cattle trail was the largest infrastructure project by the new province and ended in disaster for the only herd of cattle driven over it. This route became known, after rebuilding by John Currie and his native crew, as the Pemberton Trail and was the only route to the coast. In 1901 Carl A. Hartzell wrote to the Daily Province stating that 20,000 acres of Pemberton land were out of reach of flood and than an acre in the driest sections could produce 1500 lbs of grain or 12 tons potatoes. Charles Barbour, lamented in the same newspaper, that the government's lack of foresight in failing to build a road from the coast to Pemberton prevented annual production of $1,000,000 worth of agricultural products. Pemberton land was cheaper than Fraser Valley land, selling at $18 an acre versus $45 an acre.Decker et al, pp. 83‚Äì92 Declaration of the Lillooet Tribe The Declaration of the Lillooet Tribe is an important document in the history of First Nations and the governments of the Dominion of Canada and the Province of British Columbia. Signed in Spences Bridge on May 10, 1911 by a committee of 16 chiefs of the St'at'imc, taken down by anthropologist James Teit, it is an assertion of sovereignty over traditional territories as well as a protest against recent alienations of land by white settlers at Seton Portage due to railway construction. The declaration states, ‚Äúwe have always lived in our country; at no time have we ever deserted it, or left it to others‚Äù. The coming of the railway In the early years of railway construction, the railway men planned to build their railway to haul out the timber up the Squamish Valley, but their charter provided for construction from the Squamish River right through to Lillooet on the Fraser, about 120 miles distant. By the end of 1907 ten miles of the line had been surveyed; by the end of 1909, sixty miles to Pemberton was completed. By 1911, the railway was becoming a reality and land values rose to $100 an acre. The railway company planned two townsites; Pemberton, and Newport (quickly renamed Squamish) but in 1912 the company ran out of funding. The Pacific Great Eastern Railway Company soon picked up the pieces and by 1912 advertisements suggested that one crop might pay for the \\"ideal little farms\\" created by the subdivision of the former John Currie property at Agerton. Readers were assured that \\"the day the railway arrives land will sell for $500 to $1000 per acre\\". The first train from Squamish reached Pemberton on October 29, 1914. The Pemberton Station platform was a structure of \\"rough planks on a sea of roots\\" but the general roughness was of little concern to settlers boarding the first passenger train south.Decker et al, pp. 115‚Äì120 Finally a link to the coast and access to Vancouver markets made permanent settlement possible. Very soon after railway completion many families arrived to settle and more came after WW1. Despite the richness of the agricultural land permanent settlement remained a challenge due to spring and fall flood events and many new settlers lost everything, choosing to pick up and seek their fortunes elsewhere. Flood control In 1947 the Pemberton Dyking District was formed to manage drainage and flood control in the Pemberton Valley. The organization initiated the dyking and straightening of the Lillooet River and its tributaries, Ryan and Miller Creeks; and the lowering of Lillooet Lake via a tri-partite agreement with federal and provincial governments. The program was administered via the Post-War Rehabilitation Council and the drainage project was carried out under the Prairie Farmer's Rehabilitation Act. The new land made available by the drainage project brought a rush of new settlers in the late 1940‚Äì1950s. New modern services also encouraged the purchase of old run down farms and the new government land. CommunicationsTelephone, Internet and Fibre  Pemberton is serviced by TELUS and Shaw Communications for local telephone service as well as broadband Internet and digital TV services. Telus received a Federal grant one year prior to the 2010 Whistler Vancouver Winter Olympics to bring fibre to much of the area and as of late 2019 fibre is available in Pemberton. Telus provides its ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù services via fibre while Shaw still provides its ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù services via coax cable. Shaw services have historically relied on a few leased fibre connections from TELUS, but Provincial funding has allowed Shaw to expand its fibre network from Whistler to Mt. Currie. Rogers, TELUS and Bell Mobility offer cellular service in the region as well. Because of concerns of the poor quality, and in some places complete lack of communication services, the local Pemberton Chamber of Commerce, the Village of Pemberton, SLRD Squamish Lillooet Regional District, Lil‚Äôwat First Nation, MLA Jordan Sturdy, and MP Pamela Goldsmith Jones were instrumental in getting grants to improve local Internet and fibre access. Base Wireless, with a provincial $133,000 grant from Connecting BC program, was bringing high-speed wireless Internet and fibre to Poole Creek, north of the village, in 2017. High-speed Internet to the Pemberton Industrial Park and surrounding areas of Lil‚Äôwat Band's old town site of Mount Currie. April 2017, through a new connectivity project by Base Technology Ltd. the Province of BC, & the Federal Digital 150 Connecting Canadians program. The western half of the Pemberton Meadows has neither copper wire telephony nor cellular coverage. In 2012 Base Wireless brought service down the Meadows to Geese Road. Base Wireless in 2014 set up a temporary communications for the dual Innergex Micro-Hydro Projects, that ran until summer 2017. It began with a plug and play Telus optical fibre connection in the Pemberton Gateway Village Suites Hotel Building then from the roof over a series of low power antenna relays. Though the original set-up was decommissioned, a parallel system also run by Base Wireless provides broadband Internet access to all the farms that wish to subscribe, in the Western Pemberton Valley. The farmers can now make and receive phone calls for the first time by connecting their cellphones via WiFi to Facetime, Skype, or Facebook Messenger. Electricity and a road to the south In 1951 electricity came to Pemberton, from the Bridge River Power Project at Seton in the north and through to the U.S. in the south. The hydro tower access road followed the old Pemberton Trail and became a rudimentary access route to the south for service vehicles and the adventurous. The Pemberton Board of Trade first began lobbying efforts for a road to the south as early as 1933. It wasn't until the development of Whistler as a ski resort in tandem with the Garibaldi Development Association bid for the 1966 Olympics, that the impetus was provided to the Highways Department to extend and improve the narrow gravel road north from Whistler to Pemberton in 1964. In 1969 the road was blacktopped and Pemberton became the northern terminus of the longest north south highway in North America, extending from the Baja in Mexico, through the U.S. via route 1. The road to Vancouver finally put an end to the Pemberton Co-op: produce could be shipped direct, and sacks, feed and fertilizer and other farm needs could be delivered to the farmer's gate from suppliers.Decker et al, pp. 211‚Äì231 Logging The early steamers that moved gold rush traffic in 1858 were constructed on site with local materials and the Owl Creek hatchery project in 1911 was the first commercial sawmill in the area. Logging occurred with early Pioneer settlement as part of initial land clearing activities and the Perkins mill assisted many new settlers with materials for their homesteads. The arrival of the railway provided opportunities for small tie mill and pole yard operations along the railway from 1900 to 1960. The arrival of Fleetwood Logging Company in 1950 signaled the arrival of large scale logging in Pemberton. Fleetwood set up a camp on the upper end of Lillooet Lake and logged using A-frame logging methods. By 1972, 100 logging trucks a day headed south from the timber leases in the upper Lillooet River region through to Squamish in the south. In 1973, the BC Forest Service built a new office In Pemberton and many provincial forest service sites and parks were established in the area during this time. The office closed and moved to Squamish in the 1990s. Recent events In 1984, Pemberton suffered a severe flood event and many residents had to be evacuated. In the fall of 2003 another flood event occurred, washing out highway 99 at Rutherford Creek; cutting Pemberton off from the coast. In 2009, a prolonged drought followed by thunderstorms led to the Camelback Mountain and Copperdome Mountain wildfires in the upper Pemberton Valley and several farms had to be evacuated. On August 6, 2010, the Pemberton Valley was on evacuation alert due to a nearby landslide from Mount Meager, despite articles to the contrary Pemberton was not actually evacuated. The order was rescinded as the avalanche debris damming the Lillooet River cleared itself safely.\\"Over 1,500 evacuated after B.C. landslide\\". The Globe and Mail, August 7, 2010. Appearance The village's look is slightly rustic and has the appearance of the set of an Old West movie. It has been used as a movie set and for numerous car commercials. As to the newer structures, it may appear that this is deliberate, for tourism image-making via new design bylaws; but there are practical reasons beyond a nod to the legacy of the area's roots as part of the Lillooet Country and its ranching and mining culture. The Market & Drugstore buildings re-vitalized the village core. Their covered walkways encourage people to walk about town when shopping in all weather and all seasons and protect them from the hazards of falling snow. There is a quaint covered wooden footbridge (bicycles and horses too) over the Arn Canal. Later, more recent developments at the beginning of town like Portage Station, Winchester and the Pemberton Gateway Village Suites Building (with nostalgic Red Clock Tower) were all required to build covered porches that shade the summer sun but let the winter sun right in. New modernized traditional style structures include the aforementioned, Pemberton Valley Lodge, and the new post and beam Pemberton Barn that houses the Friday Farmers Market (June to Canadian Thanksgiving). The modern Public Library and Pemberton Community Centre have a covered walkround on three sides. Agriculture Haybales in a sunny field See Pemberton Meadows Crops: seed-potatoes Pemberton is an important agricultural community famous for producing seed potatoes, and diversifying into market gardening including potatoes for eating and potatoes for making Vodka, cranberries, food products and food/farm events. The main seed potato producers are located along the Pemberton Meadows Road, many of whom have been there for generations. Agri-tourism is a growing trend and popularized by Slow Food Cycle Sunday down Pemberton Meadows. 2014 was the 10th anniversary of the event. Organic farming is also a growth area, initiated by Across The Creek Organics, and the Helmer Farm followed soon after by many small CSA/Farmers market farms. The Pemberton Farmers Institute is a body representing local agricultural affairs. Pemberton is vital to the local food security of the Sea To Sky corridor, North America and the world at large. In its seed potato growing capacity Pemberton is important continent- wide and the breeding work is important worldwide to global food security. Whether somebody eats a baked potato at home or in a fast food restaurant as fries, the chances are high it was grown from a seed potato grown from a Pemberton-grown seed potato first. A recent development is the planting of hops for making beer. The Pemberton Valley is growing the first Canadian patented and trademarked hop by the Canadian Food & Inspection Agency: Sasquatch. Hops Connect has built a small plant, in the Pemberton Industrial Park, to pelletize hops for the brewing industry. Another recent development, also at the Pemberton Industrial Park, is a legal licensed medical marijuana grow operation, by Whistler Medical Marijuana Corporation, with plans to expand to recreational product too, when marijuana is fully legalized in 2018. Transport=Air The Pemberton Regional Airport (CYPS) has over 400 landings a year with most of the volume occurring in August. Users are typically fire and rescue vehicles, commercial activity companies, gliders (till 2013), local aircraft and helicopter companies. The Pemberton Airport accepts fixed-wing, rotorcraft vehicles and helicopters, and could land small jets. A Ski plane that flies to local backcountry Lodges is based at the airport since winter 2013‚Äì2014. There's an automated weather station, but there are no lights, towers or navigational assistance. Runway is not always plowed in winter. Limited Jet fuel A service is now available from Blackcomb Aviation 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. Canadian and a few US military pilots practiced landings for Kandahar, Afghanistan, with approaches and touch-and-go landings. Seaplanes and helicopters also land at both nearby Whistler's Green Lake and Whistler's Heliport, 40 minutes south. Bus-air combinations are available via Whistler, Vancouver YVR, Abbotsford, Bellingham and Seattle. Bus As Pemberton is a bedroom community of Whistler, it is also tied into the Whistler transit system. Local bus transit service is provided by BC Transit or the WAVE service out of Whistler. The Pemberton Valley Transit System / WAVE runs a commuter bus between Pemberton and Whistler. There are 4 trips daily, with 2 in the morning and 2 in the late afternoon/early evening. Bus terminus pick-up/drop-off in Pemberton between AG Grocery and Old Pemberton Hotel. Bus service to Vancouver & Vancouver Airport from nearby Whistler is provided by a range of operators including YVR Skylynx. Pemberton Taxi service runs a Valley Commuter Service, with a mini- bus than can be chartered also, to the nearby First Nations (Native / \\"Indian\\") town of Mount Currie that meets up with the Whistler buses. Rail A two car passenger-train provides railbus service besides daily round-trip service between Seton Portage and Lillooet, stopping also in Shalalth, limited service farther south to the Ponderosa Ranch (near D'Arcy) and may be chartered to run past the Ponderosa Ranch to D'Arcy, which is forty-five minutes north of Pemberton at the head of Anderson Lake. Note: there are often minor delays by mountain goats and/or bighorn sheep. They scatter for the CN's freight-trains but show no fear of the two-car self- propelled passenger train. Foot, bike, and horse trails Nairn Falls, Green River, Nairn Falls Provincial Park The Pemberton Valley Trail Association has built 30 miles of free trails for cross-country skiing, biking, walking, or horseback riding. The latest trail connects One Mile Lake to Nairn Falls, a 1-hour hike in summer each way but can be used year-round with skis or snowshoes in winter. This trail was completed in 2012 and is part of the TransCanada Trail Network, Sea to Sky and Cariboo Trail Section. There are real hitching posts all round town to tie up your horses. There are almost 200 km / 124 miles of free trails in the Pemberton Valley System. A water proof map printed on \\"Plastic Paper\\" is published by The Pemberton Valley Trail Association and can be purchased at Bike Co. in Pemberton ‚Äì funds raised go to the trails association. Education The School District 48 Sea to Sky operates two public schools in the village: Signal Hill Elementary and Pemberton Secondary School. The Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie- Britannique operates the Francophone primary school in the village out of modular portable units behind the Pemberton Elementary School: Signal Hill Elementary, so that both schools can share play fields, playground & gymnasium: √©cole de la Vall√©e-de-Pemberton.\\"Carte des √©coles.\\" Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britanique.

Pemberton Festival On July 25‚Äì27, 2008, Pemberton hosted the Pemberton Festival, produced by Live Nation, which had a musical lineup of 66 acts including Nine Inch Nails, Coldplay, Jay-Z, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, The Tragically Hip, Death Cab for Cutie, Vampire Weekend, Metric, and Interpol. The festival was the first to be held in the valley since the Stein Voices for the Wilderness Festivals of 1989‚Äì90, held in nearby Mount Currie, which drew over 35,000 people, the largest number of people in the valley since the gold rush. Its roster of artists included Gordon Lightfoot, Bruce Cockburn, and Spirit of the West. Pemberton Music Festival Pemberton Music Festival was re-organized in 2014 by New Orleans-based company, HUKA Entertainment. The event took place July 16‚Äì20, 2014, and brought in over 30,000 attendees over the span of five days.http://pembertonmusicfestival.com/news/pemberton-music- festival-concludes The festival featured multiple stages of live entertainment, with different genres including rock, indie rock, hip hop, electronic, heavy metal, and comedy. Buses and shuttles were used to bring people from surrounding communities to prevent the first Pemberton Festivals traffic issues. Approximately 20,000 attended in 2014. The 2nd revived Pemberton Music Festival July 16‚Äì19, 2015, included the artists Missy Elliott, Weezer and Jane's Addiction, with an estimated attendance of 115,000. In 2016 the daily crowd was estimated at 45,000, with an overall attendance of close to 180,000. The 2017 Music Festival was officially cancelled and declared bankruptcy on May 18, 2017.

He was born in 1821 in Dublin, Ireland and died in 1893 in Oak Bay, British Columbia. Joseph Pemberton laid out Victoria's town site, southern Vancouver Island and townsites along the Fraser River. He married Teresa Jane Grautoff and they are the parents of Canadian painter Sophie Pemberton. The town of Pemberton was named after him. Career After some study and teaching experience in engineering and surveying in his native Ireland and employment in the booming railway industry there, Pemberton took employment with the Hudson's Bay Company as the surveyor and engineer of the Colony which, at the time, was the main settlement area of present British Columbia. He arrived at Fort Victoria June 25, 1851. During the first three-year term of his contract, he laid out the land survey of the Victoria district including the urban and rural areas. His role included development of the settlement by setting sales policy for the lands in addition to survey layout. After completing his work for the Victoria district, he surveyed the coastline of Vancouver Island between Victoria and Nanaimo. Additional duties included supervision of road and bridge construction. He designed the first school and the church in the colony. In 1857 as Surveyor-General for the Colony of Vancouver Island, Pemberton successfully explored from Cowichan Bay to Nitinat returning by boat down the coast from the Alberni Inlet.Elms, p 21-22 In 1858 and 1859, he laid out the town sites of Fort Yale, Fort Hope, Port Douglas and Derby (Fort Langley) (the proposed capital for the newly created Colony of British Columbia) as the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858 caused the arrival of settlers in what became the Colony of British Columbia. In 1859 he left the HBC and was appointed Surveyor General of the Colony of Vancouver Island, a post he held until October 1864. He supervised the development of agricultural land from Salt Spring Island to Comox. He framed the pre-emption law of 1860 which permitted settlers to occupy unsurveyed land up to . This law was a departure from the policy he had earlier been required to follow. Pemberton, who owned the Gonzales estate, a large farm near Victoria, came to be regarded as part of the HBC‚Äôs landowning √©lite, and was dubbed one of the \\"family- company compact\\" by reformer Amor De Cosmos. He had been involved in politics from his arrival at the Colony. He was a member of the legislative assembly of the colony from its first election August 4, 1856, until December 1859. He was a member of the legislative council and the executive council of Vancouver Island from 1864 for Victoria District. He retired from politics in 1868. From his retirement he carried on his farm and worked as a justice of the peace. In 1887 he and his son Frederick Bernard Pemberton formed J.D. Pemberton and Son, Surveyors, Civil Engineers and Financial Agents, a business which formed the root of a continuing real estate company in Victoria and an investment company in Vancouver. He also imported and bred horses. Pemberton is interred in Ross Bay Cemetery in the neighbourhood of Fairfield, in Victoria, British Columbia.

She was operated by two German navies, the Reichsmarine and the Kriegsmarine. She had two sister ships, and . Karlsruhe was built by the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel; she was laid down in July 1926, launched in August 1927, and commissioned into the Reichsmarine in November 1929. She was armed with a main battery of nine 15 cm SK C/25 guns in three triple turrets and had a top speed of . Like her sisters, Karlsruhe served as a training cruiser for naval cadets throughout the 1930s. During the Spanish Civil War, she joined the non- intervention patrols off the Spanish coast. She was in the process of being modernized at the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, and was therefore not ready for action until April 1940, when she participated in Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasion of Norway. She landed troops at Kristiansand, and while returning to Germany, she was attacked by the British submarine ; two torpedoes hit the ship and caused significant damage. Unable to return to port, Karlsruhe was scuttled by one of the escorting torpedo boats. She was found in the Norwegian trench, 20 km (11 nm) southeast of Kristiansand in June 2020 at a depth of 490 m (1,610 ft). Characteristics Overhead photo of Karlsruhe showing the offset arrangement of the rear main guns Karlsruhe was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . She displaced at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four steam turbines and a pair of 10-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines. Steam for the turbines was provided by six Marine-type double-ended oil-fired boilers. The ship's propulsion system provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . Karlsruhe had a crew of 21 officers and 493 enlisted men.Gr√∂ner, pp. 119-120 The ship was armed with nine 15 cm SK C/25 guns mounted in three triple gun turrets. One was located forward, and two were placed in a superfiring pair aft. The rear gun turrets were offset to increase their arc of fire. They were supplied with 1,080 rounds of ammunition, for 120 shells per gun. The ship was also equipped with two 8.8 cm SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns in single mounts; they had 400 rounds of ammunition each. Karlsruhe also carried four triple torpedo tube mounts located amidships; they were supplied with twenty-four torpedoes. She was also capable of carrying 120 naval mines.Gr√∂ner, p. 120 The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick amidships and an armored belt that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides.Gr√∂ner, p. 119 Service history Karlsruhe circa 1930 The new cruiser was ordered as \\"Cruiser C\\" and given the temporary name Ersatz Medusa as a replacement for the old cruiser . Construction of Karlsruhe began on 27 July 1926 with her keel laying at the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel. She was launched on 20 August 1927 and was commissioned into the Reichsmarine on 6 November 1929.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 230 Karlsruhe completed sea trials in the Baltic Sea after entering service, after which she was assigned to training ship duty. In May 1930, she departed on her first overseas training cruise, to Africa and South America. After returning to Germany, she was modernized late in the year; her foremast was shortened, and her rear superstructure was slightly enlarged. Over the next five years, she embarked on four more world cruises for naval cadets, traveling as far as Japan. Between each cruise, she conducted exercises with the rest of the fleet in German waters. G√ºnther L√ºtjens served as the ship's commander from September 1934 to September 1935.Williamson, pp. 18-19 In 1935, she had more modifications made, including the installation of a pole mast aft of the funnels, along with an aircraft catapult amidships with a crane to handle floatplanes.Williamson, p. 18 On her last training cruise in 1936, Karlsruhe was badly damaged by a tropical storm in the Pacific Ocean.Williamson, p. 19 Structural weaknesses in her mostly- welded hull plating caused significant damage, and the cruiser was forced to put into San Diego in April for repairs. There, her hull was repaired and strengthened, which increased her displacement and beam slightly. She returned to Germany in June 1936, and immediately went into drydock for more permanent repairs and a major overhaul. During this period in dockyard hands, she had her two single-mount 8.8 cm anti-aircraft guns replaced with three twin- mounts. Fire control directors were also installed for these guns. After emerging from this refit, she conducted sea trials and then joined the non- intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War, though she only remained off Spain for a few months. World War II After returning to Germany, she resumed training duties in the Baltic. She was withdrawn from service in May 1938 for a major modernization. The funnels were modified with raked caps and searchlight platforms on their sides. The ship's 8.8 cm guns were replaced with more powerful 10.5 cm guns. Work lasted until November 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. She spent the next several months on trials and training maneuvers. On 4 January, Karlsruhe and the minelayer Schiff 23 were sent to intercept the Swedish steamer Konung Oscar, which was transporting Polish refugees from Riga to Sweden. Karlsruhe caught the Swedish vessel, declared it a prize, and sent it and the 41 Poles aboard to Memel.Rohwer, p. 13 She was not ready for combat operations by the start of Operation Weser√ºbung, so she was used as a troop transport for the attack on Kristiansand. The attack force also included an E-boat tender, four large torpedo boats, and several E-boats. Karlsruhe in San Diego in 1934 The invasion force left Bremerhaven early on 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they arrived, a heavy fog obscured the city, making the passage of the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they had to wait until the following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odder√∏ya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted for about two hours before heavy fog again covered the port, forcing both sides to cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed their soldiers.Williamson, p. 20 Karlsruhe then left Kristiansand with three of the torpedo boats as escorts. The British submarine was positioned outside the fjord, and when her crew spotted the German ships, she fired a spread of torpedoes. Karlsruhe zig-zagged to evade the torpedoes, but two still hit the ship; one struck her bow and the other hit amidships. They blasted large holes in the hull and allowed thousands of tons of water to flood the ship. The flooding disabled her engines and electricity generators, which cut off power to the pumps that were trying to keep pace with the progressively worsening flooding. With the pumps shut off, there was no hope to save Karlsruhe, and so her commander, Friedrich Rieve, issued the order to abandon her two hours after the attack. The torpedo boat took off her crew and fired two more torpedoes into the ship to ensure that she sank.Williamson, p. 21 Rieve and his executive officer were both severely criticized for failing to take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking. The report concluded that since the ship was still afloat after two hours, and two torpedoes were required to sink her, it might have been possible to take her under tow back to Kristiansand or another port. In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit a return to a safe harbor.  The wreck  Processed survey data showing the wreck of the Karlsruhe Karlsruhe sank in deep water, and the exact position of the wreck remained unknown for more than 80 years. A sonar survey in April 2017 located the wreck but did not identify it. The vessel lies upright on the sea floor, 15 meters from the submerged power line between Denmark and Norway, operated by Statnett, the company that conducted the survey. Karlsruhes bow is no longer attached to the vessel. The wreck is some off the Norwegian coast, at a depth of about . Stattnet sent a later expedition with the survey vessel Olympic Taurus to conduct an investigation of the wreck using remotely operated underwater vehicles. The company confirmed in September 2020 that it was Karlsruhe.

The theater and the productions are managed by The Public Theater and tickets are distributed free of charge on the day of the performance. Originally branded as the New York Shakespeare Festival (NYSF) under the direction of Joseph Papp, the institution was renamed in 2002 as part of a larger reorganization by the Public Theater.https://www.academia.edu/492441/Shakespeare_and_Central_Park_Shakespeare_Under_and_With_the_Stars History The festival was originally conceived by director-producer Joseph Papp in 1954. Papp began with a series of Shakespeare workshops, then moved on to free productions on the Lower East Side. Eventually, the plays moved to a lawn in front of Turtle Pond in Central Park. In 1959, parks commissioner Robert Moses demanded that Papp and his company charge a fee for the performances to cover the cost of \\"grass erosion.\\" A court battle ensued. Papp continued to fight Moses, winning his enduring respect and the quote \\"well, let's build the bastard a theater.\\" Following this, Moses requested funds from the city for the construction of an amphitheater in the park. In 1961, the Delacorte Theater was built. The first performance held in the theater in 1962 was Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, starring George C. Scott and James Earl Jones. Description=Location and allure The Delacorte Theater is an open-air amphitheater located on the southwest corner of the Great Lawn in Central Park, closest to the entrance at 81st Street and Central Park West. It was built in 1961 and named for George T. Delacorte, Jr., who donated money for its creation. Belvedere Castle and Turtle Pond provide a backdrop for the shows at the Delacorte. As shows at the Delacorte begin in the early evening, shows usually start in daylight; as the play rolls on, the sun sets and the audience is drawn into the illuminated action on the stage. Since 1962 the Public has had the privilege of its exclusive use. Ticket distribution Awaiting tickets Tickets to Shakespeare in the Park are free and tickets for a given performance are distributed the same day by various methods: *Central Park distribution ‚Äì Up to two tickets per person are distributed outside the Delacorte Theater. The line for tickets forms when the park opens at 6 a.m. and grows until tickets are distributed at noon. A separate line is available for senior citizens 65 and older with valid I.D. The ADA Accessible line is intended for patrons with disabilities and can be joined by checking in with staff at the box office the morning of a performance who will provide, as availability dictates, tickets in locations suited to various individual needs. *Downtown Lottery - A limited number of vouchers for that evening's performance are distributed through an in-person lottery at the Public Theater. Lottery entries are accepted between 11 am and 12 pm and winners are drawn while supplies last. *Borough distribution ‚Äì A limited number of vouchers for specific performances are distributed at locations throughout New York City's five boroughs on certain days during the run of a production. Each person in line is allowed two vouchers and each voucher is good for one ticket for that evening's performance. Vouchers must be exchanged for tickets at the Delacorte Theater box office that same day from 5:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Tickets cannot be exchanged in the event the performance is rained-out which is a possibility. A performance will never be cancelled before the scheduled start time and may continue in the rain if it is deemed safe by the production staff. Late seating is at the discretion of management and may not be granted until 30‚Äì40 minutes into the show.http://publictheater.org/Programs-- Events/Shakespeare-in-the-Park/Free-Ticket-Distribution-in-the-Park/ *TodayTix ‚Äì In 2015, the Public introduced its partnership with the app TodayTix.http://www.todaytix.com/us/nyc/lottery/shakespeare-in-the-park/ App users can log on and apply for the virtual lottery for that day's show. Winners are notified between 12 pm and 2:30 pm. Shakespeare in the Park also offers specific performances throughout the summer for patrons with hearing and/or vision loss including Sign Language interpreted performances, audio- described performances, and open-captioned performances. Productions Each summer since the Delacorte's opening has seen between one and three works produced, with two works being standard since 1973. The plays of Shakespeare account for about four-fifths of the works produced, and, except for 1977 and 1980, each summer's line-up has included at least one work by Shakespeare (or, in the case of 1970, one work adapted from Shakespeare). Non-Shakespeare productions have included plays such as Anton Chekhov's The Seagull and Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt and musicals such as On the Town, Into the Woods, Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, and Disney's Hercules, the latter three having made their world debuts at the Delacorte. The 2017 production of Julius Caesar, directed by the Public's artistic director, Oskar Eustis, stoked controversy by creating significant visual and behavioral similarities between the production's Caesar and recently inaugurated President Trump. Despite the fact that the play is widely viewed as a cautionary tale against political violence,Frank Pallotta, Trump-like 'Julius Caesar' isn't the first time the play has killed a contemporary politician, CNN (June 12, 2017). right-wing activists objected to what they characterized as the murder of a stand-in for President Trump and interrupted two performances. Bank of America and Delta withdrew their sponsorship of the production; Bank of America resumed its sponsorship of Shakespeare in the Park by the following season, and JetBlue replaced Delta. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season was cancelled; a budget shortfall of 20 million dollars was predicted. Funding The Public Theater is heavily reliant on private donors. In 2005, the theater company was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by then Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Popularity and acclaim Many plays from the summer festival have gone on to Broadway, including Wilford Leach's staging of The Mystery of Edwin Drood from the 1984‚Äì1985 season and The Tempest from the 1995‚Äì1996 season. The festival has also attracted many well-known actors, such as Meryl Streep, Morgan Freeman, Martin Sheen, and Al Pacino ‚Äì the latter two of whom appeared as Brutus and Marc Antony in a toga- clad historical production of Julius Caesar, directed by Stuart Vaughan in 1987, in the first of the NYSF's Shakespeare Marathon. Since its inception, the festival has become popular with both New York natives and visitors to the city, and while the Delacorte Theater has 1,872 seats, prospective theatergoers can expect to sit in line for hours before the early afternoon ticket distribution. Approximately 80,000 people attend Shakespeare in the Park every year., nyc24.org; accessed February 14, 2014. Sponsorship of other theatres Over the years, the New York Shakespeare Festival supported other theatre companies throughout New York, helping to foster the growth of Off-Broadway, as well as specific theatre programs and projects. Among these companies that benefited from NYSF during critical periods of their development was the Theatre for a New Audience. The Theatre for a New Audience developed a number of productions sponsored by the NYSF, including A Midsummer Nights Dream, presented at the Anspacher Theatre, and through this sponsorship, the company was able to grow and expand its outreach to new audiences. Another such company was the Riverside Shakespeare Company. The Festival, under Papp's leadership, sponsored several Riverside Shakespeare Company productions at a critical stage in its development, beginning with Riverside's New York premiere production of Brecht's Edward II in 1982 at The Shakespeare Center on the Upper West Side (dedicated by Joseph Papp in 1982), followed by Equity parks tours of free Shakespeare throughout the five boroughs of New York City, much as the NYSF had done for years before. Riverside Shakespeare Company summer parks tour of Free Shakespeare sponsored by the NYSF began with A Comedy of Errors in 1982, followed by The Merry Wives of Windsor, featuring Anna Deavere Smith in her New York stage debut as Mistress Quickly, Romeo and Juliet, and The Taming of the Shrew. During the NYSF period of support, the Riverside Shakespeare Company expanded greatly, offering for the first time The Shakespeare Project in 1983, and serving a wide range of audiences in the five boroughs.

One of them serves as an important route through the suburbs west of Oklahoma City, while the other connects US-259 to the Arkansas state line west of Cove, Arkansas. SH-4 has no lettered spur routes. The two SH-4s were never connected. The Central Oklahoma highway was established in 1941 and gradually extended to its present extent between then and 2003. The Eastern Oklahoma highway was originally numbered SH-21, and was renumbered to SH-4 in 1963. Route description=Central Oklahoma The northern end of SH-4 in Piedmont. The western Highway 4 is long. It begins at the western terminus of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike Spur south of Bridge Creek, Oklahoma, and immediately curves due north. It is a two-lane road until it reaches SH-37, where it expands to four lanes. Seven miles (11.2 km) later, it joins with SH-152 in the town of Mustang. One mile (1.66 km) later, SH-4 continues northward along Mustang Road toward Interstate 40 and Yukon. After crossing I-40, SH-4 becomes a two-lane road once again until entering Yukon, at which point it becomes a four-lane road again. It meets SH-66, once Route 66, in Yukon. Seven miles (11.2 km) later, it meets the Northwest Expressway (SH-3). It lasts for just three miles (4.8 km) longer until ending at Edmond Road in Piedmont. Just after crossing SH-3, there is a standard distance sign listing Piedmont and \\"END OF ROUTE\\", giving the distance to the terminus of SH-4. This is a relative rarity on Oklahoma highways. Eastern Oklahoma The eastern Highway 4 is long. It begins at US-259 and goes generally east-west, passing through the unincorporated communities of Smithville and Watson. After crossing the Arkansas state line, it becomes Highway 4. History=Central Oklahoma The western SH-4 was assigned in 1941 to a previously unnumbered roadway between U.S. Highway 66 in Yukon and Piedmont. A continuation of SH-4 east to North May Avenue in Oklahoma City along Ranchwood Boulevard and NW 10th Street had been designated as a farm-to-market road four years earlier. In 1954, SH-4 was extended eastward along the farm-to-market road to a terminus at State Highway 3 and State Highway 74 (May Avenue) southwest of downtown Oklahoma City. SH-4 remained unchanged until 1979 when it was truncated to its former southern terminus at US-66 in Yukon. The route was then extended to Mustang in 1982, following Ranchwood Boulevard and Mustang Road south to a new terminus at State Highway 152. Construction on a southward extension of SH-4 to State Highway 37 near Tuttle began in 2001 and was completed a year later, as was a new segment between SH-37 and the H.E. Bailey Turnpike (Interstate 44). SH-4 was originally signed only as far south as SH-37; the designation was extended south to I-44 in early 2003. Eastern Oklahoma What is now the eastern SH-4 became part of State Highway 21 in 1927 when SH-21 was rerouted north of Bethel to follow modern U.S. Highway 259 and SH-4 to the Arkansas state line. The SH-21 designation was removed in 1963 and replaced with SH-4 from Smithville east to the state line near Watson. Only minor realignments, such as the straightening of the roadway near Smithville and the replacement of a historic truss bridge by a modern span have occurred since.

The term Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (treachery or conspiracy of the Blue Books) was coined by the author Robert Jones Derfel in response to the Reports' publication. The public inquiry was carried out as a result of pressure from William Williams, Radical MP for Coventry, who was himself a Welshman by birth and was concerned about the state of education in Wales. The enquiry was carried out by three English commissioners, Ralph Lingen, 1st Baron Lingen, Jellynger C. Symons and H. R. Vaughan Johnson. The commissioners visited every part of Wales during 1846, collecting evidence and statistics. However, they spoke no Welsh and relied on information from witnesses, many of them Anglican clergymen at a time when Wales was a stronghold of nonconformism. The work was completed in 1847 and printed in November of that year in three large blue-covered volumes (\\"blue books\\" being a widely used term for all kinds of parliamentary reports). The report was detailed. It concluded that schools in Wales were extremely inadequate, often with teachers speaking only English and using only English textbooks in areas where the children spoke only Welsh, and that Welsh- speakers had to rely on the Nonconformist Sunday Schools to acquire literacy. But it also concluded that the Welsh were ignorant, lazy and immoral, and that among the causes of this were the use of the Welsh language and nonconformity. This resulted in a furious reaction in Wales, led by the bard Robert Jones Derfel. Derfel's book-length response, Brad y llyfrau gleision, was published in 1854 by I. Clarke in Ruthin; it had no immediate political consequences, but was instrumental in the birth of the modern Welsh self-government movement. A measure of the anger aroused by the report in Wales is the subtitle Brad y Llyfrau Gleision. It is a reference to the infamous \\"Treachery of the Long Knives\\" when, according to Nennius and Geoffrey of Monmouth, the Saxons began their campaign of conquest against the native Britons. The commissioners often simply reported verbatim the prejudiced opinions of landowners and local Anglican clergy. The more bilious editorial attacks on Welsh culture mostly emanated from Commissioner Lingen. The Books remain an invaluable, although slanted, source of information on mid-19th century Welsh society. Saunders Lewis, in Tynged yr iaith, maintained that the Blue Books were for Welsh history \\"the most important nineteenth-century historical documents we possess\\".Jones, Alun R., Thomas, Gwyn, Presenting Saunders Lewis, UoW Press, 2nd ed 1983, , p 130 Such a judgement also reflects the fact that the publication of the reports, and the controversy that followed, was the catalyst for a much greater level of nonconformist involvement in the politics of Wales than hitherto. Critics such as the Reverend Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd), Rev William Rees (Gwilym Hiraethog), Henry Richard, the Rev Thomas Price and Sir Thomas Phillips gained wide publicity for their trenchant criticisms of the reports. Over time these criticisms evolved into an organised political action, which culminated at the General Election of 1868. Although much discussion of the Blue Books has centered on the essentialist criticism of the Welsh as a people, in his book Pam na fu Cymru (2015: published in English in 2017 as Why Wales Never Was), Simon Brooks argued that the Blue Books were a fundamentally liberal project in that the authors were sincerely concerned with the material wellbeing of the Welsh, as individuals. The argument that the Blue Books put forward, suggests Brooks, was that embracing the English language would allow the Welsh to achieve their potential and take full part in British civic society. Digital scans of the Blue Books are available at the National Library of Wales.

Constructed under MARADs supervision, she was completed on 20 April 1966, at 303 feet (92 meters) in length the largest vessel constructed for research purposes to date. Her stark white paint, large radome aft of the funnels, and heavy crane on the aft deck gave her a distinctive appearance. She had chemistry, wet and dry oceanographic, meteorological, gravimetric, and photographic laboratories. She also had several precision oceanographic winches. Operational career USC&GS; Oceanographer (OSS 01) was commissioned as an \\"ocean survey ship\\" (OSS) with the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., on 13 July 1966 under the command of Captain Arthur L. Wardwell, USESSA. With her home port at Seattle, Washington, she was the second Coast and Geodetic Survey ship of the name, and served as flagship of the Survey's fleet. When the Coast and Geodetic Survey and other United States Government agencies combined to form NOAA on 3 October 1970, she became the research ship NOAAS Oceanographer (R 101), the first NOAA ship to bear the name, as well as flagship of the NOAA fleet. NOAAS Oceanographer during her historic visit to the People's Republic of China in 1980. During her 30 years of service, Oceanographer sailed over in every major ocean. In 1967 she departed Jacksonville on 31 March on a \\"world science and ambassadorial cruise\\" which took her from the United States East Coast to the United States West Coast via the North Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean, making many good-will stops along the way before concluding the voyage by arriving at Seattle on 11 December.Invitation to attend departure of USC&GS; Ship OCEANOGRAPHER on its around the world science and ambassadorial cruise of 1967.

In 1969 she completed the circumnavigation of the globe she began in March 1967 when she returned to the U.S. East Coast. Other highlights of Oceanographers career included participation in the first large-scale, coordinated international sea-air interaction survey, known as the BOMEX Study, in 1969, and environmental base-line studies on deep-ocean mining (DOMES). In 1980, Oceanographer became the first U.S. Government vessel allowed into a port of the People's Republic of China. Oceanographer was placed in reserve in July 1981. She underwent a major refit in which she received an Alden weatherfax, a Sperry Mark 37 gyro, a Raytheon X-band Pathfinder radar, Inmarsat, an MX1102 Global Positioning System, a new salinometer, a Shipboard Environmental Acquisition System with expendable bathythermograph gear, a new meteorological station, and a Doppler current profiling system, and returned to service with this new equipment on 8 April 1986. Placed in reserve in 1989, she later returned to service again. Final disposition Oceanographer and NOAA Ships Discoverer (R 102) and Malcolm Baldridge (R 103), ex-Researcher, were replaced by NOAAS Ronald H. Brown (R 104) under the NOAA Fleet Modernization Program in the 1990s. After being decommissioned in 1996, Oceanographer was sold to the Kirkland Yacht Club Marina of Kirkland Washington, to act as a breakwater and was renamed M/V Protector. Protector was tied up at the marina from 1997 to 2005. In August 2005, Protector was renamed M/V Sahara and towed to a Seattle, Washington, shipyard to be refitted as a luxury cruise ship. In 2010, Lia Hawkins died while working on the conversion. Courts awarded $3.45 million to Hawkins's estate. The ship's owner, G Shipping Ltd., a Malta-based company controlled by Italian race-car driver and hotelier Emanuele Garosci appears to have had the ship claimed by the courts in lieu of payment. As of 2016, the conversion project had been canceled and the ship was for sale for US$1,200,000. Sometime in 2015, the vessel departed Ballard under tow and was brought to a port on the Pacific Coast of Mexico where it had continued to be listed for sale for many years although by 2019, listings had disappeared indicating that the scrapping of the ship was underway.

Waukon Decorah (‚Äì1868), also known as WakƒÖhaga (Wau-kon-haw- kaw) or \\"Snake-Skin\\", was a prominent Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) warrior and orator during the Winnebago War of 1827 and the Black Hawk War of 1832. Although not a hereditary chief, he emerged as a diplomatic leader in Ho-Chunk relations with the United States. Family and early life Waukon Decorah came from a prominent Ho-Chunk family in what is now the U.S. state of Wisconsin. He was the son of Buzzard Decorah, who was in turn the son of a French trader named Sabrevoir De Carrie and a Ho-Chunk woman named Glory of the Morning. Waukon Decorah's brother was known as Big Canoe or One-Eyed Decorah (c. 1772‚Äì1864).Decorah family, Dictionary of Wisconsin History, Wisconsin Historical Society. Accessed December 20, 2010. Early historical accounts sometimes confused the brothers with each other, or with their uncle Spoon Decorah (c. 1730‚Äìc.1816) or with their cousin Old Decorah (c. 1746‚Äì1836) and Old Decorah's sons Little Decorah (1797‚Äì1887) and Spoon Decorah (c. 1805‚Äì1889). Some early histories state that Waukon Decorah was also known by the nickname \\"Washington Decorah\\", because he had visited Washington, D.C. in the 1820s. However, in June 1832, Indian agent Joseph M. Street wrote in a letter that he had met with Waukon Decorah and his brothers One-Eyed Decorah and Washington Decorah, implying that Washington and Waukon were two different men. According to historian Ellen M. Whitney, it is not clear which member of the Decorah family was called \\"Washington\\".Whitney, editor's note, 239. Waukon Decorah and One-Eyed Decorah had an older brother named Mau-wah-re-gah, who became an outcast after killing their father in a drunken brawl.P.B. Lawson, \\"The Winnebago Tribe\\", 141. The Wisconsin Archeologist, Volume 6, 1907. Black Hawk War In 1829, Waukon Decorah's daughter, who had married a Dakota man, was killed in Iowa by Sauk and Meskwaki raiders, part of ongoing hostilities between the Dakotas and the Sauks and Meskwakis.Hall, 109. Decorah wanted to mount a retaliatory raid against the Sauks and Meskwakis, but he was discouraged from doing this by United States officials, who were trying to negotiate an end to the hostilities.Hall, 109, 117. When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832, Decorah eagerly joined the American war against Black Hawk's band of Sauks and Meskwakis, hoping to finally avenge his daughter's death.Hall, 148. Although some Ho-Chunks were sympathetic to Black Hawk's efforts to resist American expansion, Decorah was able to recruit warriors from his followers on the Wisconsin River, and was joined by One-Eyed Decorah and his followers from Prairie la Crosse.Hall, 123, 162. After the war, on November 5, 1834, Meskwaki raiders killed ten women and children from Decorah's family, including his wife. Decorah believed that the attack was meant as retaliation for his role in the Black Hawk War.Hall, 235. Later life and legacy In 1837, Decorah was part of a Ho-Chunk delegation that went to Washington, D.C. to seek redress for American encroachment on their land. Even though the delegates had been U.S. allies during the Black Hawk War, they were pressured to sign a removal treaty ceding all Ho-Chunk land west of the Mississippi River to the United States.Hall, 259‚Äì60. Decorah signed this treaty as \\"Wa-kaun-ha-kah (Snake Skin)\\". The delegates thought that the treaty gave the Ho-Chunks eight years to leave Wisconsin, which would leave them time to negotiate a new treaty, but the wording on the document gave the tribe eight months to vacate Wisconsin and resettle on reservations in Iowa and Minnesota. Ho-Chunks who refused to leave were rounded up by General Henry Atkinson and escorted west, though many later returned.Robert E. Bieder, Native American communities in Wisconsin, 1600‚Äì1960: a study of tradition and change (Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 1995), 132. Decorah's family moved across the Mississippi River into the \\"Neutral Ground\\" of northeast Iowa. Later he moved to Long Prairie, Minnesota, and by 1855 he was living in Blue Earth County, Minnesota. Some older histories state that Decorah died in Minnesota at the Blue Earth Indian Agency, but he evidently returned to Wisconsin in the last years of his life. In 1868, the Mauston Star of Mauston, Wisconsin, reported that he died on July 18 while living next to the Lemonweir River near Mauston.The Wisconsin Historical Society has a 1932 reprint of an 1868 obituary from the Mauston Star online. The 1932 reprint misdates the year of death as 1869. Two Iowa cities, Decorah and Waukon, are often said to be named for him, although Waukon is also said to be named for his son Chief John Waukon. There are other place names, such as Dekorra, Wisconsin, and Decoria Township, Blue Earth County, Minnesota, that are named for his relatives.Virgil J. Vogel, Indian names on Wisconsin's map (University of Wisconsin Press, 1991), 60‚Äì61. In 1859, citizens of Decorah, Iowa, exhumed the remains said to be of \\"Chief Decorah\\", believed to be the man for whom the city was named, to make way for the city's expansion. The body was re-interred on the grounds of the county courthouse.W. E. Alexander, History of Winneshiek and Alamakee Counties (Sioux City, Iowa: Western Publishing, 1882), 142‚Äì43. However, as was rumored at the time, Waukon Decorah was still living in 1859; it is unclear who was actually buried there.Charles Philip Hexom, Indian History of Winneshiek County, Decorah, Iowa, 1913. Unpaginated. The remains of the unknown Native American were exhumed again in 1876 during court house renovations; some of the relics buried with the body were stolen before the remains were re-interred.Alexander, History of Winneshiek County, 244.

By the time of the series, the Star Rangers Corps has been reorganized into a token peacekeeping force while the corporations maintain their own security divisions, such as the Sol 9 Shogunate's Tigers of Heaven. As such, all Star Rangers ships and weaponry are outdated, making it difficult for Sabre crew to perform its duties. The ship patrols Sectors Four through Nine of the Orion Spur. The crew consists of: * Commander Jon Blake *Aristo the reptilian medic * Ahrikeem, master of combat from the Vholon Empire * Radac, the ship's synthetic human engineer *Maya Lucas, an embittered pilot who has little use for men. They report to Commodore Nyota M'membe. The story arc of the four-issue series dealt with the Rangers uncovering a conspiracy between two corporations and the criminal empire of Lord Rogue on the Freeworld of Amicus, and finding themselves branded criminals by their own organization. The character Death Hawk appeared as a back-up feature by writer Ellis and penciler Adam Hughes in issues #2-3. Plans were made for a second Star Rangers series and a crossover with Death Hawk, but Adventure Publications dissolved in the interim.

By adopting Nordpolitik, South Korea abolished the doctrine of the enemy of my enemy is my friend and understood that the indirect approach was a more plausible way to engage with North Korea. The policy improved the South's economy while leaving the North more isolated and was a dramatic and historic turning point of South Korea‚Äôs diplomatic goals. The policy was named after the West German policy of Ostpolitik (\\"Eastern Policy\\") towards the then communist East Germany, although the Ostpolitik was aimed directly at a normalization of the relationship between two German states. The successor of the Nordpolitik was the Sunshine Policy, which bore more tangible similarities with the German Ostpolitik. Overview President Roh Tae-woo recruited Kim Chong-Whi as his special assistant on foreign affairs for the implementation of the Nordpolitik policies. In July 1988, Roh gave the first high-profile public address on Nordpolitiks revealing a six-point program.Oberdorfer, Don, and Robert Carlin. The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History. Basic Books, 2013. Its goal was not only for a greater diversification of South Korea‚Äôs trading partners but also for ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula.Chung, Tae Dong. \\"KOREA'S NORDPOLITIK: ACHIEVEMENTS & PROSPECTS.\\" Asian Perspective (1991): 149-178. This included promotion of trade, exchanges of visits at all levels, humanitarian contacts between the two Koreas and Seoul's discontinuation of opposing nonmilitary trade between North Korea and its allies. The Olympics was not mentioned at this speech but it was later revealed that Nordpolitiks was designed to smooth the way for the participation of communist countries at the Seoul 1988 Olympics. While preparing for the Olympics, it was difficult for South Korea to deal with North Korea‚Äôs appeal for co-sponsorship at the games, and for South Korea later to dissolve the possible boycott from the socialist bloc as proposed by Pyongyang. However, by adopting Nordpolitik policy, Chinese and Soviet teams participated and Seoul successfully hosted the 1988 Olympics.Lee, Ming. \\"SEOUL'S SEARCHING FOR\\" NORDPOLITIK\\": EVOLUTION AND PERSPECTIVE.\\" Asian Perspective 13.2 (1989): 141-178. In 1990, President Roh made a press conference immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall, addressing that the cold war ice had begun to crack.Monthly Choson Roh also repeated saying that the ultimate objective of the Nordpolitik policies was not to isolate North Korea but to induce the North to open up and to reduce military tensions.

GBU-27 laser- guided bombs. In engineering, hardware architecture refers to the identification of a system's physical components and their interrelationships. This description, often called a hardware design model, allows hardware designers to understand how their components fit into a system architecture and provides to software component designers important information needed for software development and integration. Clear definition of a hardware architecture allows the various traditional engineering disciplines (e.g., electrical and mechanical engineering) to work more effectively together to develop and manufacture new machines, devices and components. Hardware is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the (electronic computer) hardware from the software that runs on it. But hardware, within the automation and software engineering disciplines, need not simply be a computer of some sort. A modern automobile runs vastly more software than the Apollo spacecraft. Also, modern aircraft cannot function without running tens of millions of computer instructions embedded and distributed throughout the aircraft and resident in both standard computer hardware and in specialized hardward components such as IC wired logic gates, analog and hybrid devices, and other digital components. The need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications, including computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, surgical instrumentation, satellites, and submarines. Hardware architecture is the representation of an engineered (or to be engineered) electronic or electromechanical hardware system, and the process and discipline for effectively implementing the design(s) for such a system. It is generally part of a larger integrated system encompassing information, software, and device prototyping. It is a representation because it is used to convey information about the related elements comprising a hardware system, the relationships among those elements, and the rules governing those relationships. Electric multi-turn actuator with controls. It is a process because a sequence of steps is prescribed to produce or change the architecture, and/or a design from that architecture, of a hardware system within a set of constraints. It is a discipline because a body of knowledge is used to inform practitioners as to the most effective way to design the system within a set of constraints. A hardware architecture is primarily concerned with the internal electrical (and, more rarely, the mechanical) interfaces among the system's components or subsystems, and the interface between the system and its external environment, especially the devices operated by or the electronic displays viewed by a user. (This latter, special interface, is known as the computer human interface, AKA human computer interface, or HCI; formerly called the man-machine interface.) Integrated circuit (IC) designers are driving current technologies into innovative approaches for new products. Hence, multiple layers of active devices are being proposed as single chip, opening up opportunities for disruptive microelectronic, optoelectronic, and new microelectromechanical hardware implementation. Background A hardware architecture example, which is integrated as a handheld medical device for diabetes monitoring. U-Boat layout, with detailed equipment hardware specification and functionality. Prior to the advent of digital computers, the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the terms system and hardware as they are still commonly used today. However, with the arrival of digital computers on the scene and the development of software engineering as a separate discipline, it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered hardware artifacts, software artifacts, and the combined artifacts. A programmable hardware artifact, or machine, that lacks its computer program is impotent; even as a software artifact, or program, is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable (hardware) machine. However, a hardware machine and its programming can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks. Within the computer and software engineering disciplines (and, often, other engineering disciplines, such as communications), then, the terms hardware, software, and system came to distinguish between the hardware that runs a computer program, the software, and the hardware device complete with its program. The hardware engineer or architect deals (more or less) exclusively with the hardware device; the software engineer or architect deals (more or less) exclusively with the program; and the systems engineer or systems architect is responsible for seeing that the programming is capable of properly running within the hardware device, and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment, especially the user, and performing its intended function. A hardware architecture, then, is an abstract representation of an electronic or an electromechanical device capable of running a fixed or changeable program. A hardware architecture generally includes some form of analog, digital, or hybrid electronic computer, along with electronic and mechanical sensors and actuators. Hardware design may be viewed as a 'partitioning scheme,' or algorithm, which considers all of the system's present and foreseeable requirements and arranges the necessary hardware components into a workable set of cleanly bounded subsystems with no more parts than are required. That is, it is a partitioning scheme that is exclusive, inclusive, and exhaustive. A major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the hardware subsystems so that there is a minimum of electrical connections and electronic communications needed among them. In both software and hardware, a good subsystem tends to be seen as a meaningful \\"object.\\" Moreover, a clear allocation of user requirements to the architecture (hardware and software) provides an effective basis for validation tests of the user's requirements in the as-built system.

It lies next to the green belt, and prior to development was a working farm. Development of the area began in 1922 when East Craigs Farm was purchased by the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA) as a centre for agricultural research. However, much of the land was made available to housing developers from the 1930s onwards. It neighbours West Craigs (which is much less developed), Maybury, Drumbrae and Corstorphine.  History  \\"Craigs\\" is an old Broad Scots word for rocks, derived from Celtic, and it is named in contradistinction to nearby \\"West Craigs\\". Corstorphine Hill was formerly known as \\"Corstorphine Craigs\\". The oldest building in East Craigs is East Craigs House (), built in 1768 with a semi-octagonal stairwell added c.1800. It once formed part of the now- demolished SASA complex, and has recently been restored as part of the new residential development there. New developments of small family-sized houses and low-rise flats were built in the 1970s and 1980s. In the neighbouring estate of Craigmount which is part of Corstorphine and was developed before the Second World War, there are numerous bungalows and spacious family houses. Craigmount High School is situated between East Craigs, Corstorphine and Drumbrae and serves the East Craigs area. It was built in 1970 to alleviate pressure on surrounding secondary schools. A new building opened at the beginning of the 2003 academic year, built on the old playing fields of the original school. East Craigs Primary School was built in 1979 to accommodate an influx of families moving into newly built housing nearby. The nearest Roman Catholic schools are Fox Covert R.C. Primary School and St.Augustine's High School. The Bughtlin Burn flows through the area. The names of many roads and developments in East Craigs reflect the area's farming past, e.g. Hayfield, Mearenside, Burnbrae. Bughtlin Green and Bughtlin Loan were two of the earliest developments in East Craigs, built by local builder (and ex-Hibs owner) Tom Hart. Almond Green, which was also built by Hart in 1974, was actually split into two areas, with a small grass and play area joining them. Almond Square (built at the same time) is adjacent. Maybury Telephone Exchange was also positioned opposite the entrance to Almond Green and served the area with 031-339 numbers, then later with 0131-317 and 339. Safeway opened what was then, the largest of their stores in Scotland, in 1981 at Bughtlin Market. There were a small row of shops around Safeway : John Menzies (the newsagent), Jane Montgomery (hairdresser), a chemist and a video hire shop. East Craigs Medical Centre serves as a doctor's surgery to much of East Craigs, Corstorphine, Clermiston, Drumbrae and the Gyle area, and is situated next to East Craigs Church Centre. When Morrisons bought over Safeway in 2004, the store soon became a Morrisons; however, due to competition regulation, Morrisons were forced to sell the store to Somerfield as Morrisons has also acquired a Safeway in the nearby Gyle Shopping Centre. With a Tesco Extra a couple of miles away from East Craigs, Somerfield were forced to shut up shop, and the store and surrounding row (originally leased by Safeway) were later demolished for housing and a new small complex of shops including a Co- operative, Lloyds Pharmacy and a takeaway. The Mid Yoken pub was included as part of the original development, as a provision for the community. The name commemorates the spot nearby, which was the site of an old steading which has long since gone. The steading was the middle meeting place of the local ploughmen, and also where horses would be yoked to the plough. The name mid- yoken, probably means ‚ÄúThe middle place to yoke the horses‚Äù. However the Scots dictionary \\"Yokin vbl. n.\\". Dictionary of the Scots Language. 2004. Scottish Language Dictionaries Ltd. Accessed 26 Nov 2019 also states that a Mid yokin is \\"a break in the middle of a yokin\\". Here, Yokin means \\"period during which a horse is in harness at one stretch\\" The area is served by the Lothian Buses 31, which uses the turning circle outside the Mid Yoken Pub as its terminus. Until the early 2000s, East Craigs was also served by the now-defunct 82 route.which is also near east craigs primary school ReferencesSee also *Craigievar Estate  External links  *East Craigs Primary School website.

CJ *CJ-2A (1945‚Äì1949) ::The first Civilian Jeep put into production by Willys, marketed as the \\"Universal Jeep\\". 212,402 units were produced. *CJ-3A (1949‚Äì1953) ::A refined CJ-2A, the CJ-3A featured a redesigned one-piece windshield with air vents below the glass. 131,843 units were produced. Derived from it was the first post-war military jeep: the M38. *CJ-3B (1953‚Äì1968) ::Essentially a CJ-3A fitted with a taller hood (the CJ-3B is also known as the \\"high-hood\\" Jeep) to accommodate the Willys Hurricane engine. 155,494 were built over its 15-year lifespan. Most later ones were M606 military jeeps shipped to South America. *CJ-5 (1955‚Äì1983) ::Introduced in late 1954 as a 1955 model, the CJ-5 was a civilian version of the M38A1 military Jeep used in the Korean War. The most noticeable addition was the new rounded hood, designed specifically to accommodate the Hurricane engine. 603,303 were built over nearly 30 years, making it the longest-lived and most popular \\"Universal\\". *CJ-5A \\"Tuxedo Park\\" (1964‚Äì1967) ::The Tuxedo Park had been an option package on the CJ-5 from 1961 to 1963, and by 1964 it was given its own model designation code. It featured more standard equipment (from 1965 onward standard equipment included the Dauntless V6 engine and bucket seats), but the Tuxedo Park never garnered a large customer base due to the higher base price. Only 7,394 CJ-5As were produced. *CJ-6 (1955‚Äì1975) ::Mechanically, the CJ-6 was nothing more than a CJ-5 with a 20 in. longer wheelbase. This addressed the most common customer complaint: lack of rear seat room. Despite ceding to consumer demand sales were modest, with only 50,172 units manufactured over 20 years. *CJ-6A \\"Tuxedo Park\\" (1964‚Äì1967) ::Similar to the CJ-5A, the CJ-6A was a \\"Tuxedo Park\\" version of the CJ-6. Like the CJ-5A it was not popular, with only 459 units produced, making it the rarest CJ. *CJ-7 (1976‚Äì1986) ::The CJ-7 was introduced in 1976 as a longer alternative to the CJ-5, as a compromise between the CJ-5 and CJ-6's wheelbase length. 379,299 were built. This was the first model to lack the \\"Universal Jeep\\" designation. *CJ-8 \\"Scrambler\\" (1981‚Äì1985) ::Once again consumers complained of too little room in the CJ-7. Like the CJ-6 before it, the Scrambler was an extended version of a smaller CJ, in this case the more modern CJ-7. *CJ-10 (1981‚Äì1985) ::The Jeep CJ-10 was a CJ-bodied pickup truck based on a heavily modified Jeep J10 pickup truck. Produced from 1981 to 1985, it was sold and designed for export markets; Australia in particular. *CJ-10A (1984‚Äì1986) ::The Jeep CJ-10A was a CJ-10-based flightline aircraft tug. Produced in Mexico from 1984 to 1986. Willys Wagon and Willys Pickup The Willys Wagon (1946‚Äì1965) and Willys Pickup (1947‚Äì1965) were full-size trucks featuring a wagon and pickup bodystyle respectively. VJ *Willys Jeepster (1948‚Äì1950) ::The Willys Jeepster was a roadster designed to appeal to consumers who would not otherwise purchase a utilitarian CJ. Most of its parts were shared with the Jeep Wagon and Jeep Pickup. Unfortunately it proved to be unpopular, with its production life cut to only three years. DJ *DJ-3A (1955‚Äì1964) ::The first of the Dispatcher Jeeps, the DJ-3A was essentially a two wheel drive version of the CJ-3A, designed for lighter-duty work not requiring four wheel drive. *DJ-5 \\"Dispatcher 100\\" (1965‚Äì1967) ::Like the DJ-3A, the DJ-5 was a two wheel drive version of the CJ-5. *DJ-5A (1968‚Äì1970) ::The DJ-5A was an offshoot of the DJ-5 featuring a specialized hardtop body and right hand drive steering, designed for use as a mail truck. It was also powered by a 153 in¬≥ Chevrolet four-cylinder engine. *DJ-5B (1970‚Äì1972) ::Nearly identical to the DJ-5A, the DJ-5B was differentiated by its powertrain: a 232 in¬≥ AMC six-cylinder engine. *DJ-5C (1973‚Äì1974) ::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B. *DJ-5D (1975‚Äì1976) ::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B. *DJ-5E \\"Electruck\\" (1976) ::A special electric version of the Dispatcher featuring an electric motor and battery pack in place of the original internal combustion engine. *DJ-5F (1977‚Äì1978) ::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B. The DJ-5F was also available with the AMC 258 engine. *DJ-5G (1979) ::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B. The DJ-5G was powered by a 2.0 L Volkswagen/Audi four-cylinder engine. *DJ-5L (1982) ::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B. The DJ-5L was powered by the Pontiac 2.5 L \\"Iron Duke\\" engine. FC *FC-150 (1956‚Äì1965) ::The Forward Control trucks were essentially CJ-5s with a pickup bed and a flat-faced cab mounted on top of the engine. The FC-150 was mechanically nearly identical to the CJ-5. *FC-170 (1957‚Äì1965) ::The FC-150 was joined by a longer FC-170 model, equipped with the Willys Super Hurricane engine. FJ The FJ (1961‚Äì1965) was a DJ-3A fitted with a van body with a redesigned steering and seating arrangement similar to the Forward Control trucks. The Fleetvan Jeeps were designed specifically for moving cargo. The FJ-3 (easily distinguishable by horizontal grille slots) was offered specifically as a postal truck, while a longer FJ-3A was offered for other fleet purposes. SJ *Wagoneer (1963‚Äì1983) ::The Wagoneer was designed to replace the Jeep Wagon, which had been produced relatively unchanged since 1946. It was leaps and bounds more sophisticated than its predecessor and competitors, offering modern amenities and car-like attributes such as an independent front suspension and a SOHC engine. *J-series (1963‚Äì1988) ::The Wagoneer's SJ chassis was also designed for a pickup truck bed, replacing the Willys Jeep Pickup. Originally named Gladiator, the truck underwent several name changes. Originally the Gladiator models were distinguished by a three-digit model code signifying wheelbase and gross vehicle weight rating. For 1965 the model codes were changed to four digits. The Gladiator name was dropped for 1972. In 1974, the model codes were changed for the final time to a two-digit code signifying GVWR. The sporty Honcho package was a popular option on half-ton J-10s. *Super Wagoneer (1966‚Äì1969) ::The Super Wagoneer was a special luxury version of the Wagoneer, featuring amenities such as air conditioning, an automatic transmission and a V8 engine as standard equipment. All of this was years prior to the existence of the Range Rover, considered by many to be the \\"original luxury SUV\\". *Cherokee (1974‚Äì1983) ::The Cherokee was added to the Jeep lineup as a sporty two-door model in 1974. A four-door body was later added in 1977. *Grand Wagoneer (1984‚Äì1991) ::The Wagoneer and Cherokee were replaced for 1984 by the smaller XJ Cherokee and Wagoneer. The SJ continued on as the Grand Wagoneer, the most opulent Jeep in the range. C101 *Jeepster Commando (1966‚Äì1971) ::The Jeepster Commando was introduced in 1966 to appeal to consumers seeking a less utilitarian vehicle than the CJ. Based heavily upon the CJ-5, the Jeepster Commando was available in many body styles, including a convertible and pickup. C104 *Commando (1972‚Äì1973) ::The C101 Jeepster Commando was redesigned in 1972 by AMC in order to accommodate AMC engines under its hood. The result was the new C104 Commando (Jeepster having been dropped from the name). The new front fascia, reminiscent of the Ford Bronco, was very unpopular, and Commando was dropped after its second year. XJ *Cherokee (1984‚Äì2001) ::The most ambitious Jeep ever undertaken, the XJ (said to mean eXperimental Jeep, although the veracity of this is not well substantiated) was revolutionary in design: it was the first SUV to use a bespoke unibody chassis for more car-like performance and design attributes. The \\"UniFrame\\" chassis made the XJ light and maneuverable, while the QuadraLink front suspension gave it excellent off-road ability. The XJ Cherokee increased Jeep sales to levels never seen before, and proved to be the single most popular Jeep of all time, with over 2.8 million units sold. *Wagoneer Limited (1984‚Äì1990) ::The Wagoneer was offered alongside the Cherokee as a more luxurious model. Exterior changes were the only discernible differences, with a different grille and optional (plastic) wood panelling. Not to be confused with Grand Wagoneer SJ model. MJ *Comanche (1986‚Äì1992) ::The Comanche was offered as a pickup version of the Cherokee. It is unique in that it is one of few unibody pickup trucks ever produced. YJ *Wrangler (1987‚Äì1995) (No Wrangler produced in 1996 as they revamped the design for the new TJ's in 1997) ::The Wrangler, distinguished by its square headlamps, replaced the long-lived CJ. This model carried wider track axles and a stronger frame. It had more creature comforts and later on, had the benefit of the more efficient, fuel injected engines. The last model year of the YJ included galvanized bodies and larger U-joints. ZJ *Grand Cherokee (1993‚Äì1998) ::Originally designed as the XJ's replacement, the ZJ was instead moved upmarket as the Grand Cherokee. *Grand Wagoneer (1993) ::A top-of-the-line Grand Cherokee featuring more standard equipment, such as a 5.2L Magnum V8. It was dropped after one year. TJ *Wrangler (1997‚Äì2006) ::The YJ's replacement, the TJ, has been the most bold evolution of the \\"Universal\\" yet, with coil springs at all four wheels (it also returned to the circular headlights of the CJ). Halfway through the 2004 model year a long-wheelbase version of the TJ was released as the Wrangler Unlimited. The Wrangler Unlimited is unofficially referred to as the LJ to differentiate between the standard- and long-wheelbase models. LJ *Wrangler (2004-2006) ::Unlimited Sport Edition: Came standard with 4.0 L and the Dana 44 rear limited slip axle with 3.73 gear ratio and the command-Trac NV231 transfer case. The LJ has all the sport options but with a 10 inch (250 mm) longer wheelbase aka the LWB or LJ model. The LJ Unlimited has 2 more inches of rear seat legroom and 13 inches more cargo storage. The LJ also came with 3500 lbs towing capacity compared to the 2000 lbs towing capacity of the TJ. WJ *Grand Cherokee (1999‚Äì2004) ::An evolution of the ZJ. Its 4.7 L Powertech V8 signalled a return to SOHC engines: it was the first in a new Jeep since the Kaiser Tornado engine was dropped from the lineup in 1965. KJ *Liberty (2002‚Äì2007) ::The first new Jeep to feature an independent suspension since the 1963 Wagoneer, the Liberty (as it is known in North America; it goes by the name Cherokee in all other markets) replaced the XJ Cherokee in 2002. The Liberty comes with a 3.7 liter V6 engine, but was also available in the US in 2005‚Äì2006 with a 2.8L 4cylinder common rail diesel (CRD) engine. WK *Grand Cherokee (2005‚Äì2010) ::Using the WJ and KJ as a springboard, the most recent WK Grand Cherokee has a greater blend of car-like ride and handling with traditional offroad capability. Grand Cherokee has been completely redone for 2011. XK *Commander (2006‚Äì2010) ::With an exterior design reminiscent of the XJ, the Commander was the first seven-passenger Jeep, pushing the brand into market waters never before trodden. The Commander was discontinued due to the fact that the 2011 Dodge Durango is going to be Chrysler's 7 passenger SUV offering. It is rumored that the Commander may still be built overseas for certain markets. JK *Wrangler (2007‚Äìearly 2018) ::The new JK Wrangler includes a 3-piece hardtop roof. 2007‚Äì2011 used Chrysler's 3.8 L V6 engine. For 2012+, the Wrangler uses Chrysler's 3.6L Pentastar V6. JKU *4 Door Wrangler (2007‚Äì2018) Designation of the 4 door body style JK Wrangler. :: :: MK *Compass/Patriot (2007‚Äì2017) ::The product of a Chrysler to bring 4x4 and fuel economy into the crossover market. MP *Compass (2017‚Äìpresent) ::A completely redesigned compact crossover developed by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. KK *Liberty (2008‚Äì2012) ::3.7 liters V6 210hp, some engines can run on E-85 fuel. Replaced the KJ. WK2 *Grand Cherokee (2011‚Äìpresent) ::3.6 Liter Pentastar V6, 5.7 Liter Hemi V8, 3.0 Liter EcoDiesel V6. 4x2 or 4x4 options. RWD platform. Replaced the WK. KL *Cherokee (2014‚Äìpresent) ::The new KL is the return of the Cherokee designation in a compact-wide body featuring a distinctive new front end and sporting a 2.4L Tigershark Inline 4, a 2.0L Hurricane turbo 4, or a 3.2L Pentastar V-6 mated with a 9-speed 948TE automatic transmission. The trailrated edition of the KL is referred to as the Cherokee Trailhawk. BU *Renegade (2015‚Äìpresent) ::The BU is Jeeps new 4x4 capable compact SUV based on the Fiat small-wide platform. Sporting a 2.4L Tigershark Inline 4-cylinder engine mated with a 9-speed automatic transmission or a 1.4L Turbo mated with a 6 speed manual. The TrailRated edition of the BU is referred to as the Renegade Trailhawk.  JL  ‚Ä¢ Wrangler (2018‚Äìpresent) The JL utilized many of the same features as the JK, however modifications were done to incorporate an All Wheel Drive feature (full-time 4WD) and front axle disconnects for improved fuel mileage.

He umpired 16 Test matches between 1951 and 1959. His first match was between Australia and the West Indies at Adelaide on 22 to 25 December 1951 (the first Test to include play on Christmas Day), won by the West Indies after dismissing Australia for 82 in the first innings. McInnes' partner in this match was Ron Wright. McInnes' first international match was the England against South Australia match in January 1951. He no-balled Doug Wright three balls in succession for overstepping, and this courageous act may have led to his first Test appointment the following year. His last match ‚Äì also at Adelaide and with Ron Wright as his partner - was between Australia and England on 30 January to 5 February 1959. This was won by Australia by 10 wickets largely due to 170 by Colin McDonald and 9 wickets to Richie Benaud. McDonald pulled a thigh muscle and had resumed batting with a runner, when a Run out appeal was made at the bowler‚Äôs end. McInnes had moved to the same side as the runner to view the action, and after giving McDonald out to the appeal, had to reverse his decision, as the runner was behind him and out of his view. In the 1979 Australia Day Honours McInnes was awarded an Order of Australia medal (OAM) for his umpiring services. According to his Wisden obituary he \\"won a solid reputation for his judgement, impartiality and bearing, but became mired in controversy on the 1958-59 tour [of Australia by England] when he was blamed by the English press after some bad decisions and for not stamping out throwing and dragging among the Australian fast bowlers\\". (Presumably Wisden had bowlers Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke in mind with this comment.) Johnnie Moyes in 1959 thought \\"McInnes, in my opinion, ranks with Hele and Crockett as the finest Australia has produced ‚Ä¶ McInnes adopted the English idea of never rushing into a decision and perhaps that is why he makes so few mistakes\\". McInnes stood six feet four and a half inches tall, and played Australian rules football for North Adelaide and cricket for Prospect before enlisting in the AIF in 1940. He served as a captain in the Middle East and in New Guinea. He worked in the state public service. See also *Australian Test Cricket Umpires *List of test umpires References * Moyes, A.

During World War II, Wrigley was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club. Wrigley decided to found the league as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players. Wrigley had scouts all over the United States, Canada and even Cuba signing girls for tryouts. About 500 girls attended the call. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final tryouts at Wrigley Field in Chicago, where 60 were chosen to become the first women to ever play professional baseball. The league started in 1943 with four teams: the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. Each team was made up of fifteen girls. Bennett survived the final cut and was assigned to Kenosha. In her first season, Bennett divided her playing time between Kenosha and South Bend, recording ten consecutive losses to set a league mark.

Halsbury's Statutes of England. Butterworth. 1930. Volume 6. Page 539.Sir Carleton Kemp Allen. Law in the Making. Clarendon Press. 1964. Page 473. was an Act of the Parliament of England. It was enacted by Edward VI of England to supersede his previous Act of 1549. It was one of the last steps taken by the 'boy king' and his councillors to make England a more Protestant country before his death the following year. It replaced the Book of Common Prayer authorised by the Act of Uniformity 1549 with a revised and more clearly Protestant version, the 1552 Book of Common Prayer. Cranmer, the principal author of both the 1549 and 1552 versions of the liturgy maintained that there was no theological difference between the two. Anyone who attended or administered a service where this liturgy was not used faced six months imprisonment for a first offence, one year for a second offence, and life for a third. This Act was repealed by Mary in 1553.  Liturgical changes effected The Edwardine reformation represented a combination of moderate reformed theology with relatively traditional structures of the ministry and church government which were justified at the time by an appeal to the Early Church before Romish errors had corrupted it. Transubstantiation had already been dropped implicitly by the elimination from the 1549 rite of both the elevation of the host and the \\"shewing of the Sacrament to the people\\" during the prayer of consecration.. However, late in 1552 after the new prayer book had passed through Parliament, John Knox launched a strong attack on the requirement to kneel to receive communion. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer persuaded the Privy Council to retain the practice, and the Council approved a declaration in its defence which is commonly known as the \\"Black Rubric\\", which was pasted into the earliest printed editions on a slip of paper. The details of the liturgical changes and history are discussed at length in the article on the Book of Common Prayer  Mary I's reforms and Elizabeth I's restorations  After Edward VI's death, his sister Mary I proceeded to bring the English clergy back under the auspices of the Catholic Church. She repealed all her brother's religious laws and imprisoned the country's leading Protestant clerics. In addition, she had her mother's marriage to Henry VIII declared valid. Later on, her husband Philip II of Spain persuaded Parliament to repeal all of Henry VIII's religious laws, thereby returning England to the control of the Church in Rome. When Mary I died in 1558 and her sister Elizabeth came to the throne, Catholic clergy sought to block her wish to make reforms that would turn the Church in England back in the direction of Protestantism. Elizabeth was fortunate in that many of the bishoprics of the country were vacant, which meant that the remaining bishops could not outvote the lay members of the House of Lords who supported reform. A new Act of Uniformity was passed in 1559; Mary I's heresy laws were also repealed, in order to make punishments for violating the Act less severe. The Church of England then started to use the 1552 Book of Common Prayer with a few more traditional modifications (notably the omission of the \\"Black Rubric)\\". For more details of the further history of this Act see Act of Uniformity 1549. Repeal Section 1 of the Religious Disabilities Act 1846 (9 & 10 Vict c 59) repealed: *So much of Act of Uniformity 1551 as enacted \\"that from and after Feast of All Saints next coming all and every Person and Persons inhabiting within this Realm, or any other of the King's Majesty's Dominions, shall diligently and faithfully, having no lawful or reasonable Excuse to be absent, endeavour themselves to resort to their Parish Church or Chapel accustomed, or, upon reasonable Let thereof, to some usual Place where Common Prayer and such Service of God shall be used in such Time of Let, upon every Sunday, and other Days ordained and used to be kept as holy Days, and then and there to abide orderly and soberly during the Time of Common Prayer, Preachings, or other Service of God there to be used and ministered, upon Pain of Punishment by the Censures of the Church\\", so far as the same affected persons dissenting from the worship or doctrines of the United Church of England and Ireland, and usually attending place of worship other than the Established Church. (This repeal was subject to a proviso that no pecuniary penalty was to be imposed upon any person by reason of his so absenting himself as aforesaid.) *So much of the Act of Uniformity 1551 as enacted \\"that if any Manner of Person or Persons inhabiting and being within this Realme, or any other the King's Majesty's Dominions, shall, after the said Feast of All Saints, willingly and wittingly hear and be present at any other Manner or Form of Common Prayer, of Administration of the Sacraments, of making of Ministers in the Churches, or of any other Rites contained in the Book annexed to this Act than is mentioned and set forth in the said Book, or that is contrary to the Form of sundry Provisions and Exceptions contained in the aforesaid former Statute, and shall be thereof convicted according to the Laws of this Realm, before the Justices of Assize, the Justices of Oyer and Determiner, Justices of Peace in their Sessions, or any of them, by the Verdict of Twelve Men, or by his or their own Confession, or otherwise, shall, for the First Offence suffer Imprisonment for Six Months, without Bail or Mainprize, and for the Second offence, being likewise convicted as is above-said, Imprisonment for One whole Year, and for the Third Offence, in the like Manner, Imprisonment during his or their Lives\\". *So much of the Act of Uniformity 1551 as enacted \\"that for the more Knowledge to be given hereof, and better Observation of this Law, all and singular Curates shall, upon one Sunday every Quarter of the Year, during One whole Year next following the foresaid Feast of All Saints next coming, read this present Act in the Church at the Time of the most Assembly, and likewise once in every Year following, at the same Time declaring unto the People, by the Authority of the Scripture, how the Mercy and Goodness of God hath in all Ages been shown to his People in their Necessities and Extremities, by means of hearty and faithful Prayers made to Almighty God, especially where People be gathered together with One Faith and Mind to offer up their Hearts by Prayer as the best Sacrifices that Christian Men can yield\\". *So much of any Act or Acts of the Parliament of Ireland as may have extended to Ireland the provisions of the Act of Uniformity 1551, so far as the same was thereby repealed. The marginal note to section 1 of the Religious Disabilities Act 1846 said that the effect of this was to repeal sections 1 to 4 and 6 of the Act of Uniformity 1551. The whole Act, so far as it extended to Northern Ireland, was repealed by section 1(1) of, and Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1950.

The show aired from January 3 to September 30, 1977, and was produced in New York City. During most of its run, it had originally videotaped at NBC's headquarters in Rockefeller Center, but some weeks of episodes were recorded at Studio 50 at CBS, also known as the Ed Sullivan Theater. Shoot for the Stars was the last NBC game show to originate from New York City. Geoff Edwards hosted the show, with Bob Clayton as announcer. Celebrity players included Peter Bonerz, Pat Carroll, Peggy Cass, Bill Cullen, Mike Farrell, Barbara Feldon, Anita Gillette, Vicki Lawrence, Anne Meara, Rita Moreno, Tony Randall, Lynn Redgrave, Nipsey Russell, Soupy Sales, Debralee Scott and William Shatner. The theme song, performed by Bob Cobert, would later be reused on Double Talk. Game play Two teams competed, each consisting of a civilian player and a celebrity. The game board consisted of 24 numbered boxes. Hidden behind these numbers were money values ranging from $100 to $300, one $500 value, one \\"Double Your Score\\" card, four stars, and an \\"Instant Car\\" card. Both teams began with $100 and took turns playing, starting with the challengers. During each turn, the team in control chose a box, whose contents were revealed, and then tried to decipher an awkward phrase. For example, the phrase \\"Infant mug / Ozzie or Harriet\\" would lead to \\"Baby Face Nelson.\\" The two halves of the phrase were separated by a line; the player could answer only the first part, and the celebrity could answer only the second. A correct answer rewarded the team as follows: * Money amount: Added to the team's total. * Double Your Score: Immediately doubled the team's total. * Star: The team decided how much of their total they wanted to wager on the phrase, up to and including all of it. A correct answer added the value of the wager, while a miss deducted it. * Instant Car: Awarded the player a new car. An incorrect response carried no penalty, except when a star was in play. The first team to accumulate $1,500 or more won the game. If the challengers reached this goal first, the champions were not given a chance to catch up, unlike shows such as The Joker's Wild that guaranteed an equal number of turns. The winning player received exactly $1,500, forfeiting any portion of the team's score above that total, while the losing player received parting gifts and kept any money or bonus prizes won in previous games. Bonus round The winning team hit a plunger to stop a randomizer on a number between five and nine (originally between four and eight), which determined the number of correct answers needed in 60 seconds to win the round. One team member was shown a two-word phrase and had to get their partner to guess it by describing each word separately. If the team gave the required number of answers before time ran out, the player won a cash jackpot that began at $1,000 and increased by $500 after every unsuccessful attempt. Any player who made five attempts at the bonus round received a new car and retired from the show. Broadcast history NBC first slotted Shoot at 11:30 AM (10:30 Central), replacing the Allen Ludden-hosted Stumpers. It faced Happy Days reruns on ABC and Love of Life on CBS until April 25, when ABC placed Family Feud in that slot. On June 13, NBC moved Shoot to 12:00 Noon (11:00 AM, Central), where the series promptly sank against CBS' hit soap opera The Young and the Restless, but also faced two short run ABC shows Second Chance and The Better Sex.

Gulberg Town was formed in 2001 as part of The Local Government Ordinance 2001, and was subdivided into 11 union councils. The town system was disbanded in 2011, and Gulberg Town was re-organized as part of Karachi Central District in 2015.  Location  Gulberg Town was bordered by the Lyari River and Gulshan Town to the east and the Gujjar Nala stream and North Nazimabad Town to the west. Also neighbouring Gulberg were New Karachi and Gadap to the north and Liaquatabad to the south.  History  The federal government introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \\"third tier of government\\" (administrative divisions) and replaced it with the fourth tier (districts). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former Karachi Division in 2001, and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Gulberg Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation system was reintroduced. In 2015, Gulberg Town was re-organized as part of Karachi Central district.  Education and academia  Apart from the socio-economic diversification, this town had the distinction of being one of the most literate middle/upper middle class parts of the city along with North Nazimabad Town.

Biography He was born at Boscoreale, near Torre Annunziata and Pompei, outside Naples in Italy, in 1948. He undertook the usual seminary studies and was ordained a Catholic priest for the Diocese of Nola on 24 June 1972, having studied at the Roman ecclesiastical universities as a pupil of the Almo Collegio Capranica, an ancient Roman seminary named after Cardinal Domenico Capranica. About the same time, having left the Capranica, Sorrentino obtained a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and at substantially the same time a doctorate in Political Science from the University of Rome La Sapienza. He followed for a number of years the normal course of appointments in his home diocese as curate and then parish priest, but after a relatively short time was appointed to diocesan responsibilities for catechetics. He was also involved in the establishment of a library centred on the figure of the church father, Paulinus of Nola. Sorrentino also became a teacher in the Institute of Religious Science at Nola and in the theological faculty at Naples. In 1992 he obtained a position in the Secretariat of State in Rome.

High-speed photography is the science of taking pictures of very fast phenomena. In 1948, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) defined high-speed photography as any set of photographs captured by a camera capable of 69 frames per second or greater, and of at least three consecutive frames . High-speed photography can be considered to be the opposite of time-lapse photography. In common usage, high-speed photography may refer to either or both of the following meanings. The first is that the photograph itself may be taken in a way as to appear to freeze the motion, especially to reduce motion blur. The second is that a series of photographs may be taken at a high sampling frequency or frame rate. The first requires a sensor with good sensitivity and either a very good shuttering system or a very fast strobe light. The second requires some means of capturing successive frames, either with a mechanical device or by moving data off electronic sensors very quickly. Other considerations for high-speed photographers are record length, reciprocity breakdown, and spatial resolution.  Early applications and development  Nuclear explosion photographed by rapatronic camera less than 1 millisecond after detonation. The fireball is about 20 meters in diameter. The spikes at the bottom of the fireball are due to what is known as the rope trick effect. The first practical application of high-speed photography was Eadweard Muybridge's 1878 investigation into whether horses' feet were actually all off the ground at once during a gallop. The first photograph of a supersonic flying bullet was taken by the Austrian physicist Peter Salcher in Rijeka in 1886, a technique that was later used by Ernst Mach in his studies of supersonic motion.Peter Salcher und Ernst Mach, Schlierenfotografie von √úberschall-Projektilen, W. Gerhard Pohl, Universit√§t Wien, PLUS LUCIS 2/2002 ‚Äì 1/2003 ISSN 1606-3015 (in German) German weapons scientists applied the techniques in 1916,The Quarterly of Film, Radio and Television vol 6 no 3, Spring 1952 p235 https://www.jstor.org/pss/1209846 and The Japanese Institute of Aeronautical Research manufactured a camera capable of recording 60,000 frames per second in 1931. Bell Telephone Laboratories was one of the first customers for a camera developed by Eastman Kodak in the early 1930s.Kodak High-Speed Camera Type III, September 1944, , Eastman Kodak Co.. Retrieved 2 November 2009. Bell used the system, which ran 16 mm film at 1000 frame/s and had a load capacity, to study relay bounce. When Kodak declined to develop a higher-speed version, Bell Labs developed it themselves, calling it the Fastax. The Fastax was capable of 5,000 frame/s. Bell eventually sold the camera design to Western Electric, who in turn sold it to the Wollensak Optical Company. Wollensak further improved the design to achieve 10,000 frame/s. Redlake Laboratories introduced another 16 mm rotating prism camera, the Hycam, in the early 1960s.Pendley, Gil (July 2003). Claude Cavailler, Graham P. Haddleton, Manfred Hugenschmidt. ed. \\"High-Speed Imaging Technology; Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow\\". Proceedings of SPIE 4948: 110‚Äì113. Photo-Sonics developed several models of rotating prism camera capable of running 35 mm and 70 mm film in the 1960s. Visible Solutions introduced the Photec IV 16 mm camera in the 1980s. In 1940, a patent was filed by Cearcy D. Miller for the rotating mirror camera, theoretically capable of one million frames per second. The first practical application of this idea was during the Manhattan Project, when Berlin Brixner, the photographic technician on the project, built the first known fully functional rotating mirror camera. This camera was used to photograph early prototypes of the first nuclear bomb, and resolved a key technical issue about the shape and speed of the implosion, that had been the source of an active dispute between the explosives engineers and the physics theoreticians. The D. B. Milliken company developed an intermittent, pin- registered, 16 mm camera for speeds of 400 frame/s in 1957. Mitchell, Redlake Laboratories, and Photo-Sonics eventually followed in the 1960s with a variety of 16, 35, and 70 mm intermittent cameras.  Stroboscopy and laser applications  Harold Edgerton is generally credited with pioneering the use of the stroboscope to freeze fast motion.HAROLD E. \\"DOC\\" EDGERTON (1903‚Äì1990): High-speed stroboscopic photography, . Retrieved 22 August 2009. He eventually helped found EG&G;, which used some of Edgerton's methods to capture the physics of explosions required to detonate nuclear weapons. One such device was the EG&G; Microflash 549, which is an air-gap flash. Also see the photograph of an explosion using a Rapatronic camera. A photo of a Smith & Wesson firing, taken with an air-gap flash. The photo was taken in a darkened room, with camera's shutter open and the flash was triggered by the sound of the shot using a microphone. Advancing the idea of the stroboscope, researchers began using lasers to stop high-speed motion. Recent advances include the use of High Harmonic Generation to capture images of molecular dynamics down to the scale of the attosecond (10‚àí18 s).Molecules at the movies, .

A droplet is caught with a strobe after rebounding upward. The exhaust-fan in this photograph was rotating at its full-speed when the photo was taken. A high-speed camera is defined as having the capability of capturing video at a rate in excess of 250 frames per second.Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers: High-Speed Photography, Preface p.5, Mar 1949 There are many different types of high-speed film cameras, but they can mostly all be grouped into five different categories: * Intermittent motion cameras, which are a speed-up version of the standard motion picture camera using a sewing machine type mechanism to advance the film intermittently to a fixed exposure point behind the objective lens, * Rotating prism cameras, which run film continuously past an exposure point and use a rotating prism between the objective lens and the film to impart motion to the image which matches the film motion, thereby canceling it out, * Rotating mirror cameras, which relay the image through a rotating mirror to an arc of film, and can work in continuous access or synchronous access depending on the design.The Wisconsin Engineer Vol 63 No 2 Nov 1958 pp 22 ‚Äì 25 Photographing High Speed Motion, George Lassanske, * Image dissection cameras, which can use a rotating mirror system, and * Raster cameras, which record a \\"chopped up\\" version of an image. Intermittent motion cameras are capable of hundreds of frames per second, rotating prism cameras are capable of thousands to millions of frames per second, rotating mirror cameras are capable of millions of frames per second, raster cameras can achieve millions of frames per second, and image dissection cameras are capable of billions of frames per second. As film and mechanical transports improved, the high-speed film camera became available for scientific research. Kodak eventually shifted its film from acetate base to Estar (Kodak's name for a Mylar-equivalent plastic), which enhanced the strength and allowed it to be pulled faster. The Estar was also more stable than acetate allowing more accurate measurement, and it was not as prone to fire. Each film type is available in many load sizes. These may be cut down and placed in magazines for easier loading. A magazine is typically the longest available for the 35 mm and 70 mm cameras. A magazine is typical for 16 mm cameras, though magazines are available. Typically rotary prism cameras use 100 ft (30m) film loads. The images on 35 mm high-speed film are typically more rectangular with the long side between the sprocket holes instead of parallel to the edges as in standard photography. 16 mm and 70 mm images are typically more square rather than rectangular. A list of ANSI formats and sizes is available.ANSI/SMPTE 139‚Äì1996. SMPTE STANDARD for Motion- Picture Film (35mm) ‚Äì Perforated KS. Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. White Plains, NY.ANSI/SMPTE 102-1997. SMPTE STANDARD for Motion- Picture Film (35 mm) ‚Äì Perforated CS-1870. Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. White Plains, NY. Most cameras use pulsed timing marks along the edge of the film (either inside or outside of the film perforations) produced by sparks or later by LEDs. These allow accurate measurement of the film speed and in the case of streak or smear images, velocity measurement of the subject. These pulses are usually cycled at 10, 100, 1000 Hz depending on the speed setting of the camera.  Intermittent pin register  Just as with a standard motion picture camera, the intermittent register pin camera actually stops the film in the film gate while the photograph is being taken. In high-speed photography, this requires some modifications to the mechanism for achieving this intermittent motion at such high speeds. In all cases, a loop is formed before and after the gate to create and then take up the slack. Pulldown claws, which enter the film through perforations, pulling it into place and then retracting out of the perforations and out of the film gate, are multiplied to grab the film through multiple perforations in the film, thereby reducing the stress that any individual perforation is subjected to. Register pins, which secure the film through perforations in final position while it is being exposed, after the pulldown claws are retracted are also multiplied, and often made from exotic materials. In some cases, vacuum suction is used to keep the film, especially 35 mm and 70 mm film, flat so that the images are in focus across the entire frame. * 16 mm pin register: D. B. Milliken Locam, capable of 500 frame/s; the design was eventually sold to Redlake. Photo-Sonics built a 16 mm pin-registered camera that was capable of 1000 frame/s, but they eventually removed it from the market. * 35 mm pin register: Early cameras included the Mitchell 35 mm. Photo-Sonics won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement for the 4ER in 1988. (accessed 21 Aug 2009) The 4E is capable of 360 frame/s. * 70 mm pin register: Cameras include a model made by Hulcher, and Photo-Sonics 10A and 10R cameras, capable of 125 frame/s.  Rotary prism  The rotary prism camera allowed higher frame rates without placing as much stress on the film or transport mechanism. The film moves continuously past a rotating prism which is synchronized to the main film sprocket such that the speed of the film and the speed of the prism are always running at the same proportional speed. The prism is located between the objective lens and the film, such that the revolution of the prism \\"paints\\" a frame onto the film for each face of the prism. Prisms are typically cubic, or four sided, for full frame exposure. Since exposure occurs as the prism rotates, images near the top or bottom of the frame, where the prism is substantially off axis, suffer from significant aberration. A shutter can improve the results by gating the exposure more tightly around the point where the prism faces are nearly parallel. * 16 mm rotary prism ‚Äì Redlake Hycam cameras are capable of 11,000 frame/s with a full frame prism (4 facets), 22,000 frame/s with a half-frame kit, and 44,000 frame/s with a quarter-frame kit. Visible Solutions also makes the Photec IV. For a more rugged solution, Weinberger made the Stalex 1B, which frames at up to 3000full frames per second, and had the ability to be mounted on board for car crash testing. Fastax cameras can achieve up to 18,000 frames per second with an 8-sided prism. * 35 mm rotary prism ‚Äì Photo-Sonics 4C cameras are capable of 2,500 frame/s with a full frame prism (4 facets), 4,000 frame/s with a half- frame kit, and 8,000 frame/s with a quarter-frame kit. * 70 mm rotary prism ‚Äì Photo-Sonics 10B cameras are capable of 360 frame/s with a full frame prism (4 facets), and 720 frame/s with a half-frame kit.  Rotating mirror  Rotating mirror cameras can be divided into two sub-categories; pure rotating mirror cameras and rotating drum, or Dynafax cameras. In pure rotating mirror cameras, film is held stationary in an arc centered about a rotating mirror. The basic construction of a rotating mirror camera consists of four parts; a main objective lens, a field lens, image compensation lenses, and a rotating mirror to sequentially expose frames. A image of the object under study is formed in the region of a rotating mirror with flat faces (a trihedral mirror is commonly used because it has a relatively high bursting speed, but designs with eight or more faces have been used). A field lens optically conjugates the pupil of the main objective lens in the region of a bank of compensation lenses, and the final compensation lenses optically conjugate the mirror to the surface of a photodetector. For each frame formed on the film, one compensation lens is required, but some designs have used a series of flat mirrors. As such, these cameras typically do not record more than one hundred frames, but frame counts up to 2000 have been recorded. This means they record for only a very short time ‚Äì typically less than a millisecond. Therefore, they require specialized timing and illumination equipment. Rotating mirror cameras are capable of up to 25 million frames per second, with typical speed in the millions of fps. The rotating drum camera works by holding a strip of film in a loop on the inside track of a rotating drum. This drum is then spun up to the speed corresponding to a desired framing rate. The image is still relayed to an internal rotating mirror centered at the arc of the drum. The mirror is multi-faceted, typically having six to eight faces. Only one secondary lens is required, as the exposure always occurs at the same point. The series of frames is formed as the film travels across this point. Discrete frames are formed as each successive face of the mirror passes through the optical axis. Rotating drum cameras are capable of speed from the tens of thousands to millions of frames per second, but since the maximum peripheral linear speed of the drum is practically around 500m/s, increasing the frame rate requires decreasing the frame height and/or increasing the number of frames exposed from the rotating mirror. In both types of rotating mirror cameras, double exposure can occur if the system is not controlled properly. In a pure rotating mirror camera, this happens if the mirror makes a second pass across the optics while light is still entering the camera. In a rotating drum camera, it happens if the drum makes more than one revolution while light is entering the camera. Many cameras use ultra high speed shutters such as those employing explosives to shatter a block of glass, rendering it opaque. Alternatively, high speed flashes with a controlled duration can be used. In modern ccd imaging systems, the sensors can be shuttered within microseconds, obviating the need for an external shutter. Rotating mirror camera technology has more recently been applied to electronic imaging, where instead of film, an array of single shot CCD or CMOS cameras is arrayed around the rotating mirror. This adaptation enables all of the advantages of electronic imaging in combination with the speed and resolution of the rotating mirror approach. Speeds up to 25 million frames per second are achievable, with typical speeds in the millions of fps. Commercial availability of both types of rotating mirror cameras began in the 1950s with Beckman & Whitley, and Cordin Company. Beckman & Whitley sold both rotating mirror and rotating drum cameras, and coined the \\"Dynafax\\" term. In the mid-1960s, Cordin Company bought Beckman & Whitley and has been the sole source of rotating mirror cameras since. An offshoot of Cordin Company, Millisecond Cinematography, provided drum camera technology to the commercial cinematography market. Image dissection Most image dissection camera designs involve thousands of fiber optic fibers bundled together that are then separated into a line that is recorded with traditional streak camera means (rotating drum, rotating mirror, etc). The resolution is limited to the number of fibers, and commonly only a few thousand fibers can be practically used. Raster cameras Raster cameras, which are often referred to as image dissection cameras in literature, involve the principle that only a small fraction of an image needs to be recorded to produce a discernible image. This principle is used most commonly in lenticular printing where many images are placed on the same material and an array of cylindrical lenses (or slits) only allows one part of the image to be viewed at a time. Most raster cameras operate using a black grid with very thin lines etched into it, with hundreds or thousands of transparent lines in between much thicker opaque areas. If each slit is 1/10 the width as each opaque area, when the raster is moved, 10 images can be recorded in the distance between two slits. This principle allows extremely high time resolution by sacrificing some spatial resolution (most cameras only have around 60,000 pixels, about 250x250 pixel resolution), with recorded rates of up to 1.5 billion frames per second. Raster techniques have been applied to streak cameras made from image converters for much higher speeds. The raster image is often moved through a rotating mirror system, but the raster itself can also be moved across a sheet of film. These cameras can be very difficult to synchronize, as they often have limited recording times (under 200 frames) and frames are easily overwritten. The raster can be made with lenticular sheets, a grid of opaque slits, arrays of tapered (Selfoc) fiber optics, etc. Streak photography Streak photography (closely related to strip photography) uses a streak camera to combine a series of essentially one- dimensional images into a two-dimensional image. The terms \\"streak photography\\" and \\"strip photography\\" are often interchanged, though some authors draw a distinction. By removing the prism from a rotary prism camera and using a very narrow slit in place of the shutter, it is possible to take images whose exposure is essentially one dimension of spatial information recorded continuously over time. Streak records are therefore a space vs. time graphical record. The image that results allows for very precise measurement of velocities. It is also possible to capture streak records using rotating mirror technology at much faster speeds. Digital line sensors can be used for this effect as well, as can some two-dimensional sensors with a slit mask. For the development of explosives the image of a line of sample was projected onto an arc of film via a rotating mirror. The advance of flame appeared as an oblique image on the film, from which the velocity of detonation was measured.Applied Chemistry: a textbook for engineers and technologists, Hyman D. Gesser p274 https://books.google.com/books?id=TXanxVprOPMC&pg;=PA274&lpg;=PA274&dq;#v=onepage&q;=&f;=false Motion compensation photography (also known as ballistic synchro photography or smear photography when used to image high-speed projectiles) is a form of streak photography. When the motion of the film is opposite to that of the subject with an inverting (positive) lens, and synchronized appropriately, the images show events as a function of time. Objects remaining motionless show up as streaks. This is the technique used for finish line photographs. At no time is it possible to take a still photograph that duplicates the results of a finish line photograph taken with this method. A still is a photograph in time, a streak/smear photograph is a photograph of time. When used to image high-speed projectiles the use of a slit (as in streak photography) produce very short exposure times ensuring higher image resolution. The use for high- speed projectiles means that one still image is normally produced on one roll of cine film. From this image information such as yaw or pitch can be determined. Because of its measurement of time variations in velocity will also be shown by lateral distortions of the image. By combining this technique with a diffracted wavefront of light, as by a knife-edge, it is possible to take photographs of phase perturbations within a homogeneous medium. For example, it is possible to capture shockwaves of bullets and other high-speed objects. See, for example, shadowgraph and schlieren photography. In December 2011, a research group at MIT reported a combined implementation of the laser (stroboscopic) and streak camera applications to capture images of a repetitive event that can be reassembled to create a trillion-frame-per-second video. This rate of image acquisition, which enables the capture of images of moving photons, is possible by the use of the streak camera to collect each field of view rapidly in narrow single streak images. Illuminating a scene with a laser that emits pulses of light every 13 nanoseconds, synchronized to the streak camera with repeated sampling and positioning, researchers have demonstrated collection of one-dimensional data which can be computationally compiled into a two-dimensional video. Although this approach is limited by time resolution to repeatable events, stationary applications such as medical ultrasound or industrial material analysis are possibilities.  Video  Rupture of water filled balloon captured at 480 frame/s High-speed photographs can be examined individually to follow the progress of an activity, or they can be displayed rapidly in sequence as a moving film with slowed-down motion. Early video cameras using tubes (such as the Vidicon) suffered from severe \\"ghosting\\" due to the fact that the latent image on the target remained even after the subject had moved. Furthermore, as the system scanned the target, the motion of the scanning relative to the subject resulted in artifacts that compromised the image. The target in Vidicon type camera tubes can be made of various photoconductive chemicals such as antimony sulfide (Sb2S3), lead(II) oxide (), and others with various image \\"stick\\" properties. The Farnsworth Image Dissector did not suffer from image \\"stick\\" of the type Vidicons exhibit, and so related special image converter tubes might be used to capture short frame sequences at very high speed. The mechanical shutter, invented by Pat Keller, et al., at China Lake in 1979 (), helped freeze the action and eliminate ghosting. This was a mechanical shutter similar to the one used in high-speed film cameras‚Äîa disk with a wedge removed. The opening was synchronized to the frame rate, and the size of the opening was proportional to the integration or shutter time. By making the opening very small, the motion could be stopped. Despite the resulting improvements in image quality, these systems were still limited to 60 frame/s. Other Image Converter tube based systems emerged in the 1950s which incorporated a modified GenI image intensifier with additional deflector plates which allowed a photon image to be converted to a photoelectron beam. The image, while in this photoelectron state, could be shuttered on and off as short as a few nanoseconds, and deflected to different areas of the large 70 and 90 mm diameter phosphor screens to produce sequences of up to 20+ frames. In the early 1970s these camera attained speeds up to 600 million frame/s, with 1 ns exposure times, with more than 20 frames per event. As they were analog devices there were no digital limitations on data rates and pixel transfer rates. However, image resolution was quite limited, due to the inherent repulsion of electrons and the grain of the phosphor screen, as well as the small size of each individual image. Resolutions of 10 lp/mm were typical. Also, the images were inherently monochrome, as wavelength information is lost in the photon-electron-photon conversion process. There was also a fairly steep trade-off between resolution and number of images. All images needed to fall on the output phosphor screen. Therefore, a four image sequence would mean each image occupies one fourth of the screen; a nine image sequence has each image occupying one ninth, etc. Images were projected and held on the tube's phosphor screen for several milliseconds, long enough to be optically, and later fiber optically, coupled to film for image capture. Cameras of this design were made by Hadland Photonics Limited and NAC. It was difficult to change the exposure time without changing the frame rate with earlier designs, but later models added additional \\"shuttering\\" plates to allow exposure time and framing rate to be altered independently. The limiting factor of these systems is the time an image can be swept to the next position. In addition to framing tubes, these tubes could also be configured with one or two sets of deflector plates in one axis. As light was converted to photoelectrons, these photoelectrons could be swept across the phosphor screen at incredible sweep speeds limited only by the sweep electronics, to generate the first electronic streak cameras. With no moving parts, sweep speeds of up to 10 picoseconds per mm could be attained, thus giving technical time resolution of several picoseconds. As early as the 1973‚Äì74 there were commercial streak cameras capable of 3 picosecond time resolution derived from the need to evaluate the ultra short laser pulses which were being developed at that time. Electronic streak cameras are still used today with time resolution as short as sub picoseconds, and are the only true way to measure short optical events in the picosecond time scale.  CCD  The introduction of the CCD revolutionized high-speed photography in the 1980s. The staring array configuration of the sensor eliminated the scanning artifacts. Precise control of the integration time replaced the use of the mechanical shutter. However, the CCD architecture limited the rate at which images could be read off the sensor. Most of these systems still ran at NTSC rates (approximately 60 frame/s), but some, especially those built by the Kodak Spin Physics group, ran faster and recorded onto specially constructed video tape cassettes. The Kodak MASD group developed the first HyG (rugged) high-speed digital color camera called the RO that replaced 16-mm crash sled film cameras. Many new innovations and recording methods were introduced in the RO and further enhancements were introduced in the HG2000, a camera that could run at 1000 frame/s with a 512 x 384 pixel sensor for 2 seconds. Kodak MASD group also introduced an ultra high-speed CCD camera called the HS4540 that was designed and manufactured by Photron in 1991 that recorded 4,500 frame/s at 256 x 256. The HS4540 was used extensively by companies manufacturing automotive air bags to do lot testing which required the fast record speed to image a 30 ms deployment. Roper Industries purchased this division from Kodak in November 1999 and it was merged with Redlake (which was also purchased by Roper Industries). Redlake has since been purchased by IDT, which is today a market leader in the high speed camera market, and continues to serve the automotive crash test market. Gated intensified CCD In the early 1990s very fast cameras based on micro-channel plate (MCP) image intensifiers were developed. The MCP intensifier is similar technology used for night vision applications. They are based on a similar photon-electron-photon conversion as the above-described image converter tubes, but incorporate a micro-channel plate. This plate is given a high-voltage charge such that electrons coming from the input photocathode to the holes create a cascading effect, thereby amplifying the image signal. These electrons fall on an output phosphor, creating the emission of photons that compose the resulting image. The devices can be switched on and off at the picosecond time scale. The output of the MCP is coupled to a CCD, usually by means of a fused fiber-optic taper, creating an electronic camera with very high sensitivity and capable of very short exposure times, though also one that is inherently monochrome due to wavelength information being lost in the photon-electron-photon conversion. The pioneering work in this area was done by Paul Hoess while at PCO Imaging in Germany. A sequence of images at these very fast speeds can be obtained by multiplexing MCP-CCD cameras behind an optical beam splitter and switching the MCP devices using an electronic sequencer control. These systems typically use eight to sixteen MCP-CCD imagers, yielding a frame sequence at speeds up to 100 billion fps. Some systems were built with interline CCDs, which enables two images per channel, or a 32 frame sequence, though not at the highest speeds (because of the minimum time of the interline transfer). These types of cameras were built by Hadland Photonics and then DRS Hadland till 2010. Specialized Imaging in the UK also manufactures these cameras, which achieve rates at up to a billion frames per second. However, the minimum exposure time is 3 nanoseconds which limits the effective framing rate to several hundred million frames per second. In 2003, Stanford Computer Optics introduced the multi-framing camera, XXRapidFrame. It allows Image sequences of up to 8 images with a shutter time down to 200 picoseconds at a frame rate of several billion frames per second.XXRapidFrame camera was nominated for the Photonic Prism Awards 2014  IS-CCD  Another approach for capturing images at extremely high speeds is with an ISIS (In Situ storage CCD chip, such as in the Shimadzu HPV-1 and HPV-2 cameras. In a typical interline transfer CCD chip, each pixel has a single register. Charge from an individual pixel can be quickly transferred into its register in the microsecond time scale. These charges are then be read out of the chip and stored in a serial \\"read\\" process that takes more time than the transfer to the register. The Shimadzu camera is based on a chip where each pixel has 103 registers. Charge from the pixel can then be transferred into these registers such that the image sequence is stored \\"on chip\\" and then read out well after the event of interest is over. Frame rates as high as a billion fps are possible, with current cameras (Kirana and HPV) achieving up to 10 million fps. ISIS cameras have the obvious advantage over rotating mirror cameras that only one photodetector is needed and the frame count can be much higher. Complex synchronization circuitry necessary for synchronous rotating mirror cameras are also not necessary with ISIS. A main issue with in situ storage chips is ghosting of frames and low spatial resolution, but modern devices such as the Kirana from Specialized Imaging have partially solved the issue. The main use of this type of imaging system is one where the event takes place between 50 ¬µs and 2 ms, such as applications with Split-Hopkinson pressure bar, stress analysis, light-gas gun, target impact studies and DIC (Digital Image Correlation). ISIS sensors have achieved rates of more than 3.5 terapixels per second, hundreds of times better than the state of the art high speed readout cameras.  Rotating mirror CCD  Rotating mirror film camera technology has been adapted to take advantage of CCD imaging by putting an array of CCD cameras around a rotating mirror in place of film. The operating principles are substantially similar to those of rotating mirror film cameras, in that the image is relayed from an objective lens to a rotating mirror, and then back to each CCD camera, which are all essentially operating as a single shot cameras. Framing rate is determined by the speed of the mirror, not the read-out rate of the imaging chip, as in single chip CCD and CMOS systems. This means these cameras must necessarily work in a burst mode, as they only can capture as many frames as there are CCD devices (typically 50‚Äì100). They are also much more elaborate (and therefore costly) systems than single chip high-speed cameras. These systems do, however, achieve the maximum combination of speed and resolution, as they have no trade-off between speed and resolution. Typical speeds are in the millions of frames per second, and typical resolutions are 2 to 8 megapixels per image. These types of cameras were introduced by the Beckman Whitley company and later purchased and made by Cordin Company.  CMOS  Casio EX-F1 camera. The introduction of CMOS sensor technology again revolutionized high-speed photography in the 1990s and serves as a classic example of a disruptive technology. Based on the same materials as computer memory, the CMOS process was cheaper to build than CCD and easier to integrate with on-chip memory and processing functions. They also offer much greater flexibility in defining sub-arrays as active. This enables high-speed CMOS cameras to have broad flexibility in trading off speed and resolution. Current high-speed CMOS cameras offer full resolution framing rates in the thousands of fps with resolutions in the low megapixels. But these same cameras can be easily configured to capture images in the millions of fps, though with significantly reduced resolution. The image quality and quantum efficiency of CCD devices is still marginally superior to CMOS. The first patent of an Active Pixel Sensor (APS), submitted by JPL's Eric Fossum, led to the spin-off of Photobit, which was eventually bought by Micron Technology. However, Photobit's first interest was in the standard video market; the first high- speed CMOS system was NAC Image Technology's HSV 1000, first produced in 1990. Vision Research Phantom, Photron, NAC, Mikrotron, IDT, and other High-speed camera uses CMOS imaging sensors (CIS) in their cameras. Vision Research Phantom's first CMOS sensor, used in the Phantom 4, was designed at the Belgian Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC). These systems quickly made inroads into the 16 mm high-speed film camera market despite resolution and record times (the Phantom 4 was a 1024 x 1024 pixel, or 1 megapixel, with a run capacity of 4 s at full frame and 1000 frame/s). IMEC in 2000 spun the research group off as FillFactory which became the dominant player in the design of streaming high speed image sensors. FillFactory was in 2004 purchased by Cypress Semiconductor and in sold again to ON Semiconductor, while key staff went on to create CMOSIS in 2007 and Caeleste in 2006. Photobit eventually introduced a 500 frame/s 1.3 megapixel sensor, a true camera-on-chip device found in many low-end high-speed systems. Subsequently, several camera manufacturers compete in the high-speed digital video market, including iX-Cameras, AOS Technologies, Fastec Imaging, Mega Speed Corp, NAC, Olympus, Photron, Mikrotron, Redlake, Vision Research, Slow Motion Camera Company and IDT, with sensors developed by Photobit, Cypress, CMOSIS, and in- house designers. In addition to those science and engineering types of cameras, an entire industry has been built up around industrial machine vision systems and requirements. The major application has been for high-speed manufacturing. A system typically consists of a camera, a frame grabber, a processor, and communications and recording systems to document or control the manufacturing process.  Infrared  High-speed infrared photography has become possible with the introduction of the Amber Radiance, and later the Indigo Phoenix. Amber was purchased by Raytheon, the Amber design team left and formed Indigo, and Indigo is now owned by FLIR Systems. Telops, Xenics, Santa Barbara Focal Plane, CEDIP, and Electrophysics have also introduced high-speed infrared systems.

English Reformations Clarendon Press (1993) p. 173 It was the logical successor of the Edwardian Injunctions of 1547 and the Sacrament Act of the same year which had taken piecemeal steps towards the official introduction of Protestant doctrine and practice into England and Wales.Documents of the English Reformation, Gerald Bray (ed)Cambridge, James Clark & C¬∫(1994), pp 247ff It established the 1549 edition of the Book of Common Prayer as the sole legal form of worship in England. Before 1549, the churches of England used various different versions of the Latin-language Missal.Concerning the Service of the Church (par. 5) in the Book of Common Prayer 1662 Nature of the Book of Common Prayer The Book of Common Prayer was far from just an English-language translation of the Latin liturgical books; it was largely a new creation, mainly the work of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, which in its text and its ceremonial directions reflected various reforming doctrinal influences (notably the breviary of Cardinal Qui√±onez and the Consultation of Hermann von Wied).Bp E.C.S Gibson in the introduction of The First and Second Prayer Books of Edward VI, London J.M. Dent & Sons (1964), pp vi.ff The first Act (2 & 3 Edw 6 c 1) was called An Act for Uniformity of Service and Administration of the Sacraments throughout the Realm.

England claimed many territories as its own with the phrase ‚Äúor other of the king‚Äôs dominions‚Äù. And that there was plenty of time for England‚Äôs territories to become accustomed to these new laws giving them approximately one year to use The Book of Common Prayer to unify the country behind a single common practice of Faith. Then follow penalties against those of the clergy that should substitute any other form of service, or shall not use The Book of Common Prayer, or who shall preach or speak against it: > lest any obstinate person who willingly would disturb so godly order and > quiet in his realm should not go unpunished, that it may also be ordained > and enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any manner of parson, vicar, > or other whatsoever minister, that ought or should sing or say common prayer > mentioned in the said book, or minister the sacraments, shall after the said > feast of Pentecost next coming refuse to use the said common prayers, or to > minister the sacraments in such cathedral or parish church or other places > as he should use or minister the same, in such order and form as they be > mentioned and set forth in the said book or shall use, wilfully and > obstinately standing in the same, any other rite, ceremony, order, form, or > manner of Mass openly or privily, or Matins, Evensong, administration of the > sacraments, or other open prayer that is mentioned and set forth in the said > book; or shall preach, declare, or speak anything in the derogation or > depraving of the said book, or anything therein contained, or of any part > thereof; and shall be thereof lawfully convicted according to the laws of > this realm, by verdict of twelve men, or by his own confession, or by the > notorious evidence of the fact, shall lose and forfeit to the king's > highness, his heirs and successors, for his first offence, the profit of > such one of his spiritual benefices or promotions as it shall please the > king's highness to assign or appoint, coming and arising in one whole year > next after his conviction: and also that the same person so convicted shall > for the same offence suffer imprisonment by the space of six months, without > bail or mainprize.

Nothing in this Act enforced attendance at public worship, but the provisions of the Act apply to every kind of public worship or ‚Äúopen prayer‚Äù, as it was called, which might take place. The Act itself defines ‚Äúopen prayer‚Äù as ‚Äúthat prayer which is for others to come unto or near, either in common churches or private chapels or oratories, commonly called the service of the Church.‚Äù The Act of Uniformity 1549 was the first Act of its kind and was used to make religious worship across England and its territories consistent (i.e. uniform) at a time when the different branches of Christianity were pulling people in opposite directions, causing riots and crimes, particularly the Prayer Book Rebellion. The Book of Common Prayer defined a middle ground for Christian faith within England; the Act of Uniformity 1549 mandated that all English subjects move to that middle ground, so that they could put aside their differences. Preparation of the Act The Act of Uniformity 1549 had been prepared by a committee chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer. When this Bill was debated in the House of Lords in January 1549 it was very controversial. Of the eighteen bishops present at the final vote, ten voted in favour and eight against. Hostility to this Act and to the new prayer book led to rioting in some areas of the country, and a major uprising in Cornwall and the South West of England. They were resisted by Catholics on one side and radical reformers such as John Hooper on the other. Yet, Edward VI stated in his Act: > that it may be ordained and enacted by his majesty, with the assent of the > Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority > of the same, that all and singular person and persons that have offended > concerning the premises, other than such person and persons as now be and > remain in ward in the Tower of London, or in the Fleet, may be pardoned > thereof; These words assured that it was not an Ex post facto law. Only those already convicted would remain prosecuted. Later History of the Act This Act was superseded in part by the Act of Uniformity 1552 which introduced the more Protestant prayer book of 1552 and imposed penalties for unjustified absence from Sunday worship; repealed by Mary I, sess. 2, c. 2; and revived in a modified form by Elizabeth in the Act of Uniformity 1559. At the restoration of the monarchy with Charles II the Act of Uniformity 1662 continued the major principles of 1549 in a rather different context and this later Act was reaffirmed in 1706 as a prelude to the Act of Union which united England and Scotland under one parliament. However, most of the Act of 1662 was repealed as part of the process of the removal of religious discrimination in the 19th century and the revision of statute law in the 20th.Documents of the English Reformation, Gerald Bray (ed)Cambridge, James Clark & C¬∫(1994), pp 547ff Repeal The words of commencement, wherever occurring, were repealed by section 1 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1948.

Bearnarth batted and threw right- handed and was listed as tall and . Personal Bearnarth was born in a Manhattan hospital but lived his childhood in Brooklyn and later on Staten Island. He went to St. Peter's High School on Staten Island and played varsity basketball and baseball. He then attended St. John's University, and graduated with a degree in English literature. He died as result of a massive heart attack at the age of 58 on New Year's Eve 1999, the day before the new millennium, at his home in Florida. Playing career In a five-season career, Bearnarth posted a 13‚Äì21 record with a 4.13 ERA and eight saves in 173 games pitched. He allowed 350 hits and 135 bases on balls in 322 innings pitched, with 124 strikeouts. Bearnarth was signed by the New York Mets in 1962 and went directly to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. A year later wearing #31, he started his big league career for the 1963 Mets, a team coming off an historic 40‚Äì120 record in its inaugural season as an expansion team. Despite his 3‚Äì8 record in his rookie year, Bearnarth maintained a 3.46 ERA in a career-high 126 innings pitched. During the next three seasons, he divided his playing time between the Mets and Triple-A Buffalo and Jacksonville. From 1967 to 1970 Bearnarth pitched in Triple-A with the Jacksonville Suns (1967‚Äì68) and Tidewater Tides. In 1971 he was signed as a free agent by the Milwaukee Brewers and wore #29, retiring at the end of the season. He was able to obtain the required pension time as an active player (five years then). Then, following his playing career, he became a pitching coach. Bearnarth became pitching coach for the Montreal Expos in 1976 wearing #48 and between 1985 and 1991 wearing #36. Under his guidance, the team's ERA never was higher than 3.92 (in 1986), including the best ERA in franchise history, at 3.08 (1988). Two years later, his staff led the National League with a 3.37 ERA (1990). He was a minor league pitching instructor in the Montreal farm system between those terms. In 1993 Bearnarth became the first pitching coach in Colorado Rockies history wearing #36, continuing in that post until 1995. After that, he scouted during four seasons for the Detroit Tigers (1996‚Äì99).

DDE is particularly dangerous because it is fat-soluble like other organochlorines; thus, it is rarely excreted from the body, and concentrations tend to increase throughout life. The major exception is the excretion of DDE in breast milk, which transfers a substantial portion of the mother's DDE burden to the young animal or child. Along with accumulation over an organism's lifetime, this stability leads to bioaccumulation in the environment, which amplifies DDE‚Äôs negative effects. Synthesis DDE is created by dehydrohalogenation of DDT. The loss of HCl results in a double bond on the central (previously quaternary) carbon atoms. Degradation of DDT to form DDE by an elimination of HCl Toxicity DDE has been shown to be toxic to rats at 79.6 mg/kg.NIST DDE MSDS DDE and its parent, DDT, are reproductive toxicants for certain birds species, and major reasons for the decline of the bald eagle, brown pelican\\"Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 12-Month Petition Finding and Proposed Rule To Remove the Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) From the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife; Proposed Rule,\\" Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, February 20, 2008. peregrine falcon, and osprey. These compounds cause egg shell thinning in susceptible species, which leads to the birds‚Äô crushing their eggs instead of incubating them, due to the latter‚Äôs lack of resistance. Birds of prey, waterfowl, and song birds are more susceptible to eggshell thinning than chickens and related species, and DDE appears to be more potent than DDT.ATSDR - Toxicological Profile: DDT, DDE, DDD A research shows that an elevated blood levels of DDEs (also of other toxic molecule from nonstick cookware, and fire retardants) have been tied to an increased risk for celiac disease in young people.https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-celiac-disease-linked-common- chemical.html Mechanism The biological mechanism for the thinning is not entirely known, but it is believed that p,p'-DDE impairs the shell gland's ability to excrete calcium carbonate onto the developing egg.Recovery Plan for the California Condor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, April 1996, page 23 Multiple mechanisms may be at work, or different mechanisms may operate in different species.

It was released on April 19, 2000 as the second single from the album in Japan. It was written and composed by Utada, whilst production and arrangement was handled by Utada and American duo Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. The single also included the two B-side tracks, \\"Hayatochiri\\" and \\"Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words)\\", with the former song appearing on the parent album. Musically, \\"Wait & See (Risk)\\" is an R&B; song, influenced by dance-pop and rock. Upon its release, the track garnered positive reviews from music critics. Many critics highlighted the track as one of Utada's best singles, and commended the production and composition. It was also successful in Japan, peaking at number one on both the Oricon Singles Chart and Tokyo Broadcasting System's (TBS) Count Down TV singles chart. It was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for physical shipments of one million units, and is amongst one of the best selling singles in Japan. An accompanying music video was shot by Wataru Takeishi; it features Utada driving through Shibuya, Tokyo on a futuristic hover cycle, with intercut scenes of her dancing. It was performed on some of her concert tours, including the Bohemian Summer (2000) and Utada United tours (2006). Background and composition \\"Wait & See (Risk)\\" was written and composed by Utada, whilst production and arrangement was handled by Utada and American duo Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. It was the second time Utada worked with Jam and Lewis, and not with her father Teruzane Utada and Miyake Akira. The song included live instrumentation by Xavier Smith (drum machine) and Dave Barry (bass and acoustic guitar), whilst Jam and Lewis incorporated synthesizers and keyboards. The song was recorded and mixed by Steve Hodge, Indoh Mitsuhiro, and Ugajin Masaaki in 2000 at Flyte Tyme Studios, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and mixed at Flyte Tyme, Edina, Minnesota. It premiered on April 19, 2000 as the second single from Utada's third studio and second Japanese language album, Distance (2001) in Japan. Since then, the song has been remastered and re-released twice; the first on April 1, 2004, and the second time on December 9, 2014 for Utada's first greatest hits album Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 (2003). The single also included the two B-side tracks; \\"Hayatochiri\\" and \\"Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words)\\". The original version of \\"Hayatochiri\\" appears on the single, whilst a remixed version by Utada appeared on Distance. \\"Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words)\\" is a cover version that was originally written and performed by Bart Howard and Kaye Ballard in 1954; a second cover version sung by Utada appeared eight years later on her single \\"Kiss & Cry\\"/\\"Beautiful World\\". The maxi CD of the single contains all three new recordings, plus a remix by Baton Girl and instrumental version of \\"Wait & See (Risk)\\". The cover artwork of the single featured four images of Utada in front of a brown backdrop, two of which are transparent. The DVD single was released on June 30, 2000, which included new artwork of Utada in the speed bike, and the music video and the behind the scenes video. Musically, \\"Wait & See\\" is an R&B; song, influenced by rock and dance-pop. Kano, editor in chief for Rockin'On Japan magazine noted elements of R&B; music through the song's composition. When a staff editor from CD Journal reviewed Utada's first greatest hits album, Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 (2004), he labeled the composition as \\"urban\\" and \\"speedy\\". Critical reception Upon its release, \\"Wait & See (Risk)\\" received positive reviews from most music critics. Nagasawa Tomonori from Barks.com selected the song as one of the album's best tracks. Editor-in-chief for Rockin'On Japan magazine Kano commended the \\"excellent\\" composition of the song, and the \\"innovative\\" production by Jam and Lewis. AllMusic's Ian Martin praised Jam and Lewis' involvement, saying that \\"providing a stark contrast to the cheap, tinny sound that characterized much Japanese pop of the previous decade, with \\"Wait & See\\" and \\"Addicted to You\\" both featuring the production talents of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis.\\" A staff reviewer from Yahoo! GeoCities was positive in their review, whom highlighted the single as one of the best tracks on the album. A staff review from CD Journal discussed Utada's compilation Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1, and said although the vocal delivery \\"floats\\" and is \\"basic\\", it molded into one of Utada's \\"masterpieces\\". At the 15th Japan Gold Disc Awards, Utada won the Song of the Year award for \\"Wait & See (Risk)\\"; she had also won two same awards that year for her singles \\"For You\\" and \\"Time Limit\\". In December 2015, in honor of Utada's comeback into the music business, Japanese website Goo.ne.jp hosted a poll for fans to rank their favourite songs by Utada out of 25 positions; the poll was held in only twenty-four hours, and thousands submitted their votes. As a result, \\"Wait & See (Risk)\\" was ranked at number 10 with 40 votes in total. Commercial response Commercially, \\"Wait & See (Risk)\\" was a success in Japan. It became her third single to debut at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, with over 804,570 units sold in its first week. Its first week sales made it the 13th highest on Oricon Database, her second single behind \\"Addicted to You\\" with 1.067 million first week units, and the only female artist to occupy the top twenty with three entries.

Music video An accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes off her goggles, and stares at the moon, while close-ups of the clones' faces are seen singing to the track. The second chorus has the clones singing in different parts of the warehouse, with scenes of Utada driving through the subways in Shibuya. By the bridge section, the clones disappear and the original Utada is singing in the warehouse. She is then driving through tunnels at night, and stops at the warehouse she started from. She turns it off during the final scene of the video, puts the tarp back on, and walks outside of the warehouse. The music video and the \\"behind the scenes\\" video was included on her Single Clip Collection Vol. 2 (2000). Live performances and promotion The single has been performed on majority of Utada's concert tours. Its first performance was during her Bohemian Summer Tour in 2000, which was included on the live release on December 9, 2000. It was then included on Utada's exclusive MTV Unplugged concert, serving as the opening number. It was included on the live DVD, released on November 28, 2001. She later performed it in 2004, during her Bokuhan concert tour. It appeared on the live DVD, which was released on July 28, 2004. It was included on Utada's debut English concert tour named Utada United, which was later included on the live DVD, released on December 20, 2006. Since the track's release, it has appeared on three compilation releases: Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 (2003), it's 2014 remastered version, and a special bundle of the compilation and the vol. 2 collection on a USB.

Variants such as GSM (\\"Gender and Sexual Minorities\\"), GSSM (\\"Gender, Sexual and Sexuality Minorities\\") GSRM (\\"Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities\\"), and GSD (\\"Gender and Sexual Diversity\\")Organisation proposes replacing the 'limiting' term LGBT with 'more inclusive' GSD, February 25, 2013 have been considered in academia, but it is SGM (\\"Sexual and Gender Minority\\") that has gained the most advancement since 2014. In 2015 the NIH announced the formation of the Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office and numerous professional and academic institutions have adopted this term. Sexual and gender minority is an umbrella term that encompasses populations included in the acronym \\"LGBTI\\" (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex), and those whose sexual orientation or gender identity varies. It includes those who may not self-identify as LGBTI (e.g., queer, questioning, two-spirit, asexual, men who have sex with men, gender variant), or those who have a specific medical condition affecting reproductive development (e.g., individuals with differences or disorders of sex development, who sometimes identify as intersex).https://www.edi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/EDI_Public_files/sgm- strategic-plan.pdf  Origins  The term sexual minority was coined most likely in the late 1960s under the influence of Lars Ullerstam's ground breaking book \\"The Erotic Minorities: A Swedish View\\" which came strongly in favor of tolerance and empathy to uncommon varieties of sexuality, such as paedophilia and \\"sex criminals\\". The term was used as analogous to ethnic minority. Scientists such as Ritch Savin-Williams support using the term in order to accurately describe adolescent youths who may not identify as any common culturally-defined sexual identity label (lesbian, gay, bisexual, et cetera) but who still have attractions towards those of the same anatomical sex as themselves.Savin-Williams, Ritch C. \\"A critique of research on sexual- minority youths.\\" Journal of adolescence 24.1 (2001): 5-13.  Associated health and social issues =Stress Social issues may lead to possible health and psychological issues, especially in youth. It has been found that sexual minorities face increased stress due to stigmas. This stigma-related stress creates elevated coping regulation and social and cognitive processes leading to risk for psychopathology. Risky behavior The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published their 2015 study of large cohorts of ninth to twelfth grade students across the US. One hundred health behaviors were shown to put LGB students at risk for health consequences. Sexual minority students engage in more risky behaviors when compared with nonsexual minority students. Some students \\"...had no sexual contact [and] were excluded from analyses on sexual behaviors [including] female students who had sexual contact with only females [and] were excluded from analyses on condom use and birth control use...\\" Also excluded were \\"...male students who had sexual contact with only males [and] were excluded from analyses on birth control use.‚Äù One small study showed that LGBT adolescents were victimized more often, had higher rates of psychopathology, left home more frequently, used highly addictive substances more frequently, and were more likely to have more multiple sex partners than heterosexual adolescents. Development Based on studies of adolescents, it is concluded that sexual minorities are similar to heterosexual adolescents in developmental needs and concerns. However, research has suggested that sexual minority youth (more specifically LGBT youth) are more susceptible to psychological and health issues than heterosexual youth. Epidemiology Sexual minorities tend to use alternative and complementary medicine alternative methods of addressing their health needs more often than heterosexuals. Sexual minority women have a higher incidence of asthma, obesity, arthritis and cardiovascular disease than other groups. Adolescent sexual minorities report a higher incidence of the following when compared to heterosexual students: *feelings of not being safe travelling to and from school or in school. *not going to school because they did not feel safe. *forced to do sexual things they did not want to do by someone they were dating or going out with one or more times during the 12 months (touching, kissing, or physically forced to have sexual intercourse) *had sexual intercourse. *first had sex before age 13. *had sex with at least four other people. *not using birth control. *had experienced sexual violence. When compared to the general population, sexual minorities have a higher risk for self-injury. The treatment of aging sexual minorities seems to be influenced more by ageism. Support for aging sexual minorities appears to be common. Discrimination When gay, lesbian, and bisexual adults reported being discriminated against, forty-two percent credited it to their sexual orientation. This discrimination was positively associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators of psychiatric morbidity.[16-years old]  In the media  Sexual minorities are generally portrayed in the mass media as being ignored, trivialized, or condemned. The term symbolic annihilation accounts for their lack of characterization due to not fitting into the white, heterosexual, vanilla type lifestyle. It has been suggested that online media has developed into a space in which sexual minorities may use ‚Äúsocial artillery‚Äù. This description centers on how social networking and connections to oppose instances of homophobia. Still, some individuals have made their way into the media through television and music. TV shows such as The Ellen DeGeneres Show and ABC‚Äôs Modern Family star individuals who are open about their non-heterosexual lifestyles. In music, people like Sam Smith and Sia have created songs that express their emotions and sexuality with a number of followers. While sexual minorities do have a place in the media, it is often critiqued that they are still limited in their representations. In shows, if a character is gay, they are often a very shallow character that is only present for comic relief or as a plot twist. Compared to a heteronormative counterpart, the sexual minority is often a mere side-kick. However, since the integration of actors, musicians, and characters of sexual minorities, the idea of non-normativity has become more normalized in society. Cultural issues Current and past research has been \\"skewed toward SM men‚Äîand is disproportionately focused on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\\" Between 1989 and 2011, numerous grants for research were sponsored and funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) but funded research for sexual minorities and health made up 0.1% of all funded studies. Most research has been directed toward gay and bisexual men. Women sexual minority studies accounted for only 13.5%. Sexual minorities in South Africa have sexual-orientation-related health inequities when compared to other countries. One of the highest prevalences of sexual violence directed toward women of a sexual minority occurs in South Africa. Women of color who are living in low income urban areas are notably targeted. The perpetrators of sexual violence believe they are \\"correcting the women,\\" and their actions will cure them of their homosexuality.  Controversy  Some LGBT people object to using the term sexual minorities and prefer the term LGBT. Reasons for these objections may vary. For example, some LGBT people feel that the term sexual minority reminds them about discrimination and about being a minority. They want to be not a distinct minority but an integral and respectable part of the society. Some other LGBT people dislike the term for being too inclusive, including swingers, polyamorists, BDSM people and other perceived \\"sexual strangers\\". These LGBT people want to make a larger distance between these sexual practices and bisexuality/homosexuality/transgender. Some transgender and transsexual people dislike the term sexual minority for yet another reason. They argue that the phenomenon of transsexuality or transgender has nothing to do with sex, sexual practices or sexual orientation, but it relates to the gender, gender dysphoria and gender-variant behavior or feelings. Thus, they feel it is incorrect to classify them as \\"sexual minority\\", when, in fact, they are gender-variant minority. Some conservative groups oppose the use of the term sexual minority for completely different reasons. They think or feel that the term inherently implies some degree of legalisation or protection for those engaged in such sexual practices, much like ethnic minorities are protected from being discriminated or persecuted in modern democratic countries. Some people dislike the term because it includes minority, when the fact is that not all these categories are really about minorities but actually about minorised groups. Others referred to as \\"sexual minorities\\" include fetishists and practitioners in of BDSM (bondage, dominance, and submission), and sadism and masochism. The term may also include asexuals and people who may be strictly heterosexual and whose choice of actual sex acts may be vanilla, but whose choice of partner or partners is atypical, such as swingers (although this is debated),Rust, Paula C. \\"The politics of sexual identity: Sexual attraction and behavior among lesbian and bisexual women.\\" Social Problems 39, no. 4 (1992) p.8 \\"Sexual minorities are not merely people who engage in \\"deviant\\" sexual behavior -- for example, fetishists of various types -- or even those that adopt \\"deviant\\" (sexual) identities (e.g. \\"swingers\\").\\" polyamoristsNichols, Margaret, and M. I. C. H. A. E. L. Shernoff. \\"Therapy with sexual minorities.\\" Principles and practice of sex therapy 4 (2000): 353-367. or people in other nonmonogamous relationships, people who strongly prefer adolescent sex partners, and those who have partners significantly older or younger than themselves (age disparity in sexual relationships). or people who engage in mixed race relationships. Usually, the term sexual minority is applied only to groups who practice consensual sex: for example, it would be unusual to refer to rapists as a sexual minority, but the term would generally include someone whose sexuality gave a major, fetishized role to consensual playing out of a rape fantasy. Also, someone who very occasionally incorporates of consensual kink or same-sex activity into a largely vanilla, heterosexual sex life would not usually be described as a sexual minority.

He is best known for his invention of the electrostatic precipitator, one of the first inventions designed to eliminate air pollution‚Äîand for establishing the Research Corporation for Science Advancement, a foundation that has funded scientific research since 1912. Biography He was born on January 10, 1877 in Oakland, California to Henry Cottrell and Cynthia Durfee. Both prominent families going back to the settlement of America. Cottrell's immense curiosity gained him notice early in life. One acquaintance said, ‚ÄúHe read textbooks like novels.‚Äù He finished high school at age 16, entered the University of California, Berkeley, and graduated in 3 years. After graduation, he taught chemistry at Oakland High School, saving money (his annual salary was $1,200) until he could afford to continue his formal education. A notation in his diary, dated January 15, 1900, reads: ‚ÄúWeek for lunch and yard duty at school.‚Äù At the time, it was common for American scientists to conduct their graduate studies abroad. To that end, Cottrell left for Europe in July 1900 on the German steamer Waesland, and made land in England where he visited the ‚ÄúCavendish labs‚Ä¶Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, House of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and the Crystal Palace‚Äù in London; and ‚Äúthe Bodleian Library, Sheldonian Theatre and the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology‚Äù in Oxford. Then he went to Paris where he visited the Exposition Universelle, the 1900 world's fair designed to celebrate the achievements of the past century and to accelerate development into the next. There, Cottrell saw the new Eiffel Tower (‚Äú[went] to summit‚Äù), and visited ‚ÄúOld Paris.‚Äù His diary entry on August 11 notes: ‚Äúgot up at 5 a.m. on account of bed bugs. Shook out and packed up things and made arrangements‚Ä¶ to change room.‚Äù From Paris, Cottrell traveled to Berlin where he began his studies at University of Berlin with Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, receiving an advanced degree in 1901. The following year, van‚Äôt Hoff was awarded the first-ever Nobel Prize in chemistry ‚Äúin recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions.‚Äù Cottrell then moved to Leipzig University where he studied with Wilhelm Ostwald, undertaking a theoretical study of the effect of the counterflow of an electrolyte on the migration of ions through a diaphragm in an electrolytic cell. A month after his arrival in Leipzig, Cottrell wrote to his future wife, Jessie Fulton, ‚ÄúMy old-time enthusiasm, which during my Berlin stay may sometimes have waned a little, is coming back in full force and I find I have about twice to four times as many schemes to try as there is possibly time for. The change is mainly due, I think, to my being turned loose once more on my own work and being thrown in contact with a large number of men with diverse ideas.‚Äù For his work with Ostwald, Cottrell earned a Ph.D. in 1902. Ostwald received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1909. Cottrell struggled with learning new languages. In France, his efforts to speak French were often met with blank stares. Although his German became good enough to study with German scientists, and to write his dissertation, he was far from fluent. Inspired no doubt by Ostwald (who studied Esperanto, and backed another constructed language, Ido, by donating the proceeds of his Nobel Prize for its support), Cottrell became interested in the movement to establish a universal language for speakers of different linguistic backgrounds. In 1924, he was one of the founders of the International Auxiliary Language Association. Degrees in hand, Cottrell returned to California and began teaching at University of California, Berkeley. On New Year's Day 1904, he married Jessie Mae Fulton, a former high-school classmate he had met in botany class. Jessie was shy and frail, a sharp contrast to Cottrell's bounding enthusiasm and unending energy. When he proposed, Cottrell declared his love, with the proviso, ‚Äúbut my work comes first.‚Äù After two difficult pregnancies and the loss of two children, they settled into a quiet, solitary life. They enjoyed reading aloud to one another, travel, and attending lectures and theatre performances. In 1917 Cottrell was initiated into the Sigma chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma at the University of California at Berkeley. Career Shortly after returning to Berkeley, Cottrell began consulting for the DuPont Company at its explosives- and acids-producing facility near Pinole, California, 20 miles north of the University. DuPont wanted to address the problem of precipitating the acid mists which form when sulfur trioxide is bubbled through water or dilute sulfuric acid. Using an electrical method similar to one envisioned by Sir Oliver Lodge in England, Cottrell began experimenting with electrostatic precipitation as a means of collecting sulfuric acid mists. The result of Cottrell's work was the electrostatic precipitator, a device which could collect fly ash, dust and fumes, acid mists and fogs that spewed from turn-of- the century plants, and which became a primary means for controlling industrial air pollution. Cottrell made it work by developing a reliable high- voltage power supply and electrodes that permitted electrical energy to leak across a gas-filled chamber from many small points. In 1906, electric current was applied to a small laboratory device emitting sulfuric acid mist, and the concept became a reality. The first patent, No. 895,729, was issued on August 11, 1908. The electrostatic precipitator remains a principal technology for pollutant removal from industrial waste flows to this day. Cottrell was not a businessman, but he recognized the business potential of his invention and decided to use it to fund scientific research through the creation of Research Corporation. In the time before science was routinely funded by government and private sources, Cottrell, at the age of 34, resolved that science would be the principal beneficiary of his invention. Those associated with him in developing electrostatic precipitation agreed with this highly unusual suggestion, and Cottrell made several attempts to donate the patent to organizations that might market the precipitator, using the proceeds to finance scientific research. After the University of California and the Smithsonian Institution declined his offer, Cottrell worked with then- Secretary of the Smithsonian Charles Doolittle Walcott, to form Research Corporation, a foundation devoted to philanthropy in science. The original board of directors‚Äîacademics, scientists, lawyers and bankers‚Äîinvested a total of $10,100 to fund the fledgling organization, and served without compensation. The board of directors shared Cottrell's goal of acquiring inventions and patents, developing them, making them available to industry under licensing, and applying all profits to support investigations in fundamental scientific research. Within a year, all of the Board's investments had been repaid and the precipitator business was under way. Cottrell is perhaps best known for this act of philanthropy. Cottrell's belief in public service and his love of the environment prompted him to join the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1911. At that time, the Bureau of Mines was the primary U.S. Government agency conducting scientific research on mineral resources. Starting out by establishing an office in San Francisco, Cottrell served the Bureau in several capacities, including that of Director in Washington, D.C. Experimental work on helium production for use in balloons and dirigibles began in 1917 at the U.S. Bureau of Mines, with Cottrell playing a vital role in making helium production financially feasible during World War I. The cost of a cubic foot of helium at that time was $1,700, making it prohibitive for use in World War I. In 1920, Cottrell's search for an inexpensive process for recovering helium from oil well gases resulted in its commercial availability at a cost as low as 1-cent per cubic foot. In 1921, Cottrell left the Bureau of Mines to chair the Chemistry and Chemical Technology Division of the National Research Council. From 1922 to 1930, he was Director of the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During his tenure, the department developed a working catalyst for a Haber-type process. Cottrell was responsible for recommending what to do with the nitrogen plant erected by the government at Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee River during World War I. After the war, production had been converted from explosives to fertilizer manufacturing and Cottrell's recommendation that the government continue to operate it as an experimental facility was ultimately incorporated in the plans for the Tennessee Valley Authority. After resigning his position with the Department of Agriculture in 1930, he remained a consultant to the department for the next decade. As a science consultant, Dr. Cottrell was highly regarded in national and international circles, in industry and the academic community. He traveled widely, was acquainted with scientists in the U.S. and abroad, and was especially well known for his ability to identify and contribute to new ideas. Cottrell declined any role at Research Corporation as an officer or director, but remained active as an adviser for the rest of his life. Many of Research Corporation's early grants were made to scientists who Cottrell had identified as ‚Äúmovers and shakers‚Äù in their fields, among them Ernest O. Lawrence (the cyclotron), Isidor Rabi (nuclear magnetic resonance) and Robert Van de Graaff (the Van de Graaff generator). Another Cottrell ‚Äúbrainchild‚Äù was Research Associates Inc. which was organized January 1, 1935, with 10 employees and offices on the campus of American University in Washington D.C. Funded by ‚Äúgrants‚Äù from Research Corporation, Research Associates represented an effort by Cottrell to create another Research Corporation which would, in time, become self-supporting through returns for its services and products. Among its projects were Brackett headlights, detergents, heat wave roasting of Fullers earth, the Greger fuel cell and Royster stoves and deodorizers. In an obituary he wrote at the time of Cottrell's death in 1948, Vannevar Bush recalled: ‚ÄúThe purpose of [Research Associates] was to conduct scientific and social research and to eliminate as far as possible the time lag between the perfection of scientific ideas and their introduction into the national life. The period of Research Associates‚Äô activity, from 1935 through 1938, was a most stimulating one.‚Äù For many reasons, the organization eventually floundered. In a letter dated September 18, 1951, J.W. Barker, then-president of Research Corporation, discussed: ‚Äú...the main problem at Research Associates, Inc.‚Äìthe complete inability of this brilliant heterogeneous group of prima donnas to stick sufficiently long on any line of investigation to determine either that it would or would not work. It seemed as if the moment any particular experiment was started everyone, including Cottrell particularly, lost all interest in that experiment. Sparks began flying about some other experiment and dropping the older one without any specific determinations, off they would go after the new spark.‚Äù Throughout his life, Cottrell had suffered periods of depression. The failure of Research Associates resulted in a long, difficult depression and marked a decline in Cottrell‚Äôs previously unbounded fervor and enthusiasm. Cottrell‚Äôs longtime interest in nitrogen fixation prompted a collaboration with Farrington Daniels of the University of Wisconsin, beginning in 1939. Daniels and associates were trying to develop a thermal process for nitrogen fixation using a regenerative pebble-bed furnace, which they hoped would be an inexpensive alternative to the Haber ammonia synthesis. Although the project helped rejuvenate Cottrell emotionally, the development of the process was not complete until after Cottrell‚Äôs death. By the time the United States entered World War II, Cottrell was 64 years old. His health was declining and his mind was weary. In 1944, he and Jess bought a house in Palo Alto, California and retired. Jessie Cottrell died in February 1948. On November 16, 1948, Research Corporation‚Äôs founder, Frederick Gardner Cottrell, died while attending a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences held at his alma mater, the University of California at Berkeley. The following obituary subsequently ran in the ‚ÄúMilestones‚Äù section of the November 29, 1948 issue of Time magazine: Died. Dr. Frederick Gardner Cottrell, 71, California-born chemist and inventor (Cottrell Electrical Precipitator); of a heart ailment; in Berkeley, Calif. Dr. Cottrell founded the famed Research Corporation in 1912 as a nonprofit organization for the advancement of science, authorized it to spend the entire $3,500,000 grossed by his invention. Although Cottrell was gone, the Foundation carried on his inspiration. In 2012, Research Corporation for Science Advancement celebrated 100 years of funding early-career teacher- scholars at America's leading colleges and universities. Shortly before his death, Cottrell said, ‚ÄúBet on the youngsters. They are long shots, but some of them pay off.‚Äù His investment has financed thousands of scientific research projects, many of which have changed our world.

He is widely regarded as the greatest monarch of the dynasty, and by the end of his reign was the most powerful ruler in the Middle East. The son of Rukn al-Dawla, Fanna Khusraw was given the title of Adud al- Dawla by the Abbasid caliph in 948 when he was made emir of Fars after the death of his childless uncle Imad al-Dawla, after which Rukn al-Dawla became the senior emir of the Buyids. In 974 Adud al-Dawla was sent by his father to save his cousin Izz al-Dawla from a rebellion. After defeating the rebel forces, he claimed the emirate of Iraq for himself, and forced his cousin to abdicate. His father, however, became angered by this decision and restored Izz al-Dawla. After the death of Adud al-Dawla's father, his cousin rebelled against him, but was defeated. Adud al-Dawla became afterwards the sole ruler of the Buyid dynasty and assumed the ancient Iranian title of Shahanshah (\\"King of Kings\\"). When Adud al-Dawla became emir of Iraq, the capital city, Baghdad, was suffering from violence and instability owing to sectarian conflict. In order to bring peace and stability to the city, he ordered the banning of public demonstrations and polemics. At the same time, he patronized a number of Shia scholars such as al-Mufid, and sponsored the renovation of a number of important Shia shrines. In addition, 'Adud al-Dawla is credited with sponsoring and patronizing other scientific projects during his time. An observatory was built by his orders in Isfahan where Azophi worked. Al- Muqaddasi also reports that he ordered the construction of a great dam between Shiraz and Estakhr in 960. The dam irrigated some 300 villages in Fars province and became known as Band-e Amir (Dam of the emir). Among his other major constructions was the digging of the Haffar channel, that joined the Karun river to the Shatt al-Arab river (the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates). The port of Khorramshahr was built on the Haffar, at its junction with the Shatt al-Arab. Early life Fanna Khusraw was born in Isfahan on September 24, 936, he was the son of Rukn al-Dawla, who was the brother of Imad al-Dawla and Mu'izz al-Dawla. According to Ibn Isfandiyar, Fanna Khusraw's mother was the daughter of the Daylamite Firuzanid nobleman al-Hasan ibn al-Fairuzan, who was the cousin of the prominent Daylamite military leader Makan ibn Kaki. Reign=Rule in Fars Map of Fars and its surrounding regions in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries In 948, Fanna Khusraw was chosen by his uncle Imad al-Dawla as his successor because he had no heir. Imad al-Dawla died in December 949, and thus Fanna Khusraw became the new ruler of Fars. However, this appointment was not accepted by a group of Daylamite officers, who shortly rebelled against Fanna Khusraw. Rukn al-Dawla quickly left for southern Iran to save his son, and was joined by the vizier of Mu'izz al-Dawla for the same purpose. Together they defeated the rebels and put Fanna Khusraw on the throne in Shiraz. Fanna Khusraw then requested the title of \\"Taj al- Dawla\\" (Crown of the state) from the Abbasid caliph. However, to Mu'izz al- Dawla, the title of \\"Taj\\" (\\"crown\\") implied that Fanna Khusraw was the superior ruler of the Buyid Empire, provoking a reaction from him, and making him decline Fanna Khusraw's request. A more suitable title (\\"Adud al-Dawla\\") (\\"Pillar of the [Abbasid] Dynasty\\") was instead chosen. Adud al-Dawla was only thirteen when he was crowned as the ruler of Fars, and was educated there by his tutor Abu 'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid. After the death of Imad al-Dawla in 949, Adud al-Dawla's father Rukn al-Dawla, who was the most powerful of the Buyid rulers, claimed the title of senior emir, which Mu'izz al-Dawla and Adud al- Dawla recognized. In 955, a Daylamite military officer named Muhammad ibn Makan seized Isfahan from Rukn al-Dawla. Adud al-Dawla then marched towards the city and recaptured it from Muhammad ibn Makan. Another Daylamite military officer named Ruzbahan also shortly rebelled against Mu'izz al-Dawla, while his brother Bullaka rebelled against Adud al-Dawla at Shiraz. Abu 'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid, however, managed to suppress the rebellion. In 966, Adud al-Dawla and Mu'izz al-Dawla made a campaign to impose Buyid rule in Oman. Mu'izz al- Dawla died in 967, and was succeeded by his eldest son Izz al-Dawla as emir of Iraq. The same year, Adud al-Dawla aided the Ziyarid Bisutun in securing the Ziyarid throne from his brother Qabus. Adud al-Dawla and Bisutun then made an alliance, and Bisutun married a daughter of Adud al-Dawla, while he married a daughter of Bisutun. Campaigns in eastern Iran In 967, Adud al-Dawla took advantage of the quarrel between the Ilyasid ruler Muhammad ibn Ilyas and his son in Kerman to annex the province to his domain. Mu'izz al-Dawla had already attempted to conquer the province but was defeated by the Ilyasids. Adud al-Dawla conquered all of Kerman, and appointed his son Shirdil Abu'l-Fawaris as the viceroy of the province, while a Daylamite officer named Kurkir ibn Justan was appointed as the chief captain of the army of Kerman. In the next year, Adud al-Dawla negotiated peace with the Saffarid ruler Khalaf ibn Ahmad, who agreed to recognize Buyid authority. In 969/970, Sulaiman, the son of Muhammad ibn Ilyas, wanted to regain his kingdom of Kerman, and invaded the region. Adud al-Dawla managed to defeat the army of Sulaiman and continued to expand his domains to the strait of Hormuz. During his campaign in southern Iran, many Iranian tribes converted to Islam and pledged allegiance to him. In August/September 971, Adud al-Dawla launched a punitive expedition against the Baloch tribes who had declared independence. Adud al-Dawla defeated them on January 8, 972, and installed loyal landowners to control the region. Afterwards, Adud al-Dawla and his father Rukn al-Dawla signed a peace treaty with the Samanids by paying them 150,000 dinars. In the same year, Adud al- Dawla conquered most of Oman, including its capital, Sohar. Rebellion of Seb√ºk-Tegin and aftermath In 974, Izz al-Dawla was trapped in Wasit by his troops who, under their leader, Seb√ºk-Tegin, had rebelled against him. Adud al-Dawla quickly left Fars to quell the rebellion, where he inflicted a decisive defeat on the rebels on January 30, 975, who under their new leader, Alptakin, fled to Syria. Adud al-Dawla then forced Izz al-Dawla to abdicate in his favor on March 12, 975. Rukn al-Dawla, greatly angered at this action, complained to Adud al-Dawla that the line of Mu'izz al-Dawla could not be removed from power. Adud al-Dawla tried to make amends with his father by offering tribute to him, but Rukn al-Dawla rejected his offer, and then restored Izz al-Dawla as the ruler of Iraq. The consequences of the restoration would later lead to war between Izz al-Dawla and Adud al-Dawla after Rukn al-Dawla's death. In 975 Adud al-Dawla launched an expedition to take Bam and defeated another son of Muhammad ibn Ilyas who sought to reconquer Kerman. Struggle for power in Iraq and war with the Hamdanids Map of Iraq in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries On September 16, 976, Rukn al-Dawla, the last of the first generation Buyids, died. After his death, Izz al-Dawla prepared to take revenge against Adud al-Dawla. He made an alliance with his brother, Fakhr al-Dawla, his father's successor to the territories around Hamadan. He also made an alliance with the Hamdanids of northern Iraq, the Hasanwayhid ruler Hasanwayh, and the ruler of the marshy areas of southern Iraq. However, Mu'ayyad al-Dawla, the third son of Rukn al-Dawla, remained loyal to his eldest brother. Izz al-Dawla then stopped recognizing the rule of his cousin Adud al-Dawla, and stopped mentioning his name during Friday prayers. Adud al-Dawla, greatly outraged by his cousin, marched towards Khuzestan and easily defeated him in Ahvaz on July 1, 977. Izz al-Dawla then asked Adud al-Dawla for permission to retire and settle in Syria. However, on the road to Syria, Izz al-Dawla became convinced by Abu Taghlib, the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul, to go fight again against his cousin. On May 29, 978, Izz al- Dawla, along with Abu Taghlib, invaded the domains of Adud al-Dawla and fought against him near Samarra. Izz al-Dawla was once again defeated, and was captured and executed at the orders of Adud al-Dawla. Adud al-Dawla then marched to Mosul and captured the city, which forced Abu Taghlib to flee to the Byzantine city of Anzitene, where he asked for aid. Adud al-Dawla then spent one year in Mosul to consolidate his power, while his army was completing the conquest of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar. The important Hamdanid city of Mayyafariqin was shortly captured by them, which forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Rahba from where he tried to negotiate peace with Adud al-Dawla. Unlike the rest of the Buyids who had held the region temporarily, Adud al- Dawla had complete control of the region during the rest of his reign. Adud al-Dawla, now the ruler of Iraq, then took control of the territories under the control of the Bedouins and Kurds. He also killed almost all the sons of Hasanwayh, and appointed Badr ibn Hasanwayh, the last surviving son of Hasanwayh, as the ruler of the Hasanwayhid dynasty. It should be understood that during that period the word \\"Kurd\\" meant nomad. He then subdued the Shayban tribe, and fought against Hasan ibn 'Imran, the ruler of Batihah. He was, however, defeated, and made peace with Hasan who agreed to recognize his authority. During the same period, Adud al-Dawla had Izz al-Dawla's former vizier Ibn Baqiyya arrested, blinded, and then trampled to death by elephants. His corpse was thereafter impaled at the head of the bridge in Baghdad, where it would remain until Adud al-Dawla's death. War in northern Iran Map of northern Iran During the same period, Bisutun died, and his kingdom was thrown into civil war; his governor of Tabaristan, Dubaj ibn Bani, supported his son as the new Ziyarid ruler, while Bisutun's brother Qabus claimed the throne for himself. Adud al-Dawla quickly sent an army to aid Qabus against Dubaj. Qabus managed to defeat him and capture the son of Bisutun in Simnan. Adud al-Dawla then made the Abbasid caliph give Qabus the title of Shams al-Ma'ali. In May 979, Adud al-Dawla invaded the territories of his brother Fakhr al-Dawla, who was forced to flee to Qazvin and then to Nishapur, a large part of his troops deserted. Adud al-Dawla then moved to Kerman and later Kermanshah where he set up a governor. In August/September 980, Adud al-Dawla captured Hamadan and occupied the south and east area of the city. Shortly after, in October/November of the same year, Sahib ibn Abbad, the vizier of Adud al- Dawla's younger brother Mu'ayyad al-Dawla, arrived from Ray to negotiate a transfer of power in the city in favor of his master. Adud al-Dawla recognized his younger brother Mu'ayyad because of his loyalty, and gave him the troops of Fakhr al-Dawla and helped him conquer Tabaristan and Gorgan from Qabus, who had betrayed Adud al-Dawla by giving refuge to Fakhr al-Dawla. Mu'ayyad al- Dawla shortly managed to conquer these two provinces. Consolidation of the Empire and peace negotiations with the Byzantines Adud al-Dawla was now the senior ruler of the Buyid Empire, and several rulers such as the Hamdanids, Saffarids, Shahinids, Hasanwayhids and even other lesser rulers who controlled Yemen, including its surrounding regions, acknowledged his authority. Other regions, such as Makran, were also under Buyid control. Adud al-Dawla then returned to Baghdad, where he built and restored several buildings in the city. He also stopped the quarrel between the Daylamites and Turks of the Buyid army. In 980, the Byzantine rebel Bardas Skleros fled to Mayyafariqin. When he arrived, he sent his brother to Baghdad to offer his allegiance to Adud al-Dawla and make an alliance against the Byzantines, which Adud al-Dawla accepted. A Byzantine envoy from Constantinople shortly arrived in Baghdad and tried to persuade Adud al-Dawla to hand over the rebel, but he refused, keeping the rebel and some of his family members in Baghdad for the rest of his reign, thus strengthening his diplomatic position with the Byzantines. In 981, Adud al-Dawla sent Abu Bakr Baqillani to Constantinople to negotiate peace. However, he was most likely sent to spy on the Byzantines and how their military functioned, since Adud al-Dawla was planning to invade Byzantine territory. In 982, Adud al-Dawla sent another envoy to Constantinople, this time, Abu Ishaq ibn Shahram, who, after spending three months in the city, concluded a 10-year peace treaty with them. One year later, a Byzantine envoy arrived back in Baghdad, but Adud al-Dawla was too ill to bring an end to the negotiations. In the end, the 10-year peace treaty was finally completed, and the Byzantines also agreed to mention Adud al-Dawla's name in the Friday prayer in Constantinople. Sahib ibn Abbad is known to have said the following about this event: \\"he [Adud al-Dawla] has done what no kings of the Arabs nor any Chosroes [kings] of the Persians could ‚Äì he has Syria and the two Iraqs, and he is close to the Despot of Byzantium and the Maghribi by his continuous correspondence.\\"  Administration and contributions  Picture of the Qur'an Gate in Shiraz, constructed during the reign of Adud al-Dawla Adud al-Dawla kept his court in Shiraz. He visited Baghdad frequently and kept some of his viziers there, one of them being a Christian named Nasir ibn Harun. Furthermore, he had several Zoroastrian statesmen who served him, such as Abu Sahl Sa'id ibn Fadl al-Majusi, who served as his representative in Baghdad before his conquest of Iraq; Abu'l-Faraj Mansur ibn Sahl al-Majusi, who served as his financial minister; and Bahram ibn Ardashir al-Majusi. Adud al-Dawla seems to have greatly respected their religion. Under him the Buyid kingdom flourished. His policies were liberal so there were no riots during his reign. He embellished Baghdad with numerous public buildings, including the famous al-'Adudi Hospital. It was the largest hospital of that time, and was destroyed during the Mongol conquests. Many prominent figures worked at the hospital, such as 'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi and Ibn Marzuban. Adud al-Dawla also build caravanserai's and dams. Shiraz particularly benefited from this work: there, he built a palace with three hundred and sixty rooms with advanced wind towers for air conditioning. The population of Shiraz had increased so much during his reign that he built a satellite city nearby for his army, named Kard-i FannƒÅ Khusraw (\\"made by Fanna Khusraw\\")--a clear reference to the names that the Sasanians gave their foundations. There were two annual festivals in the city: the first commemorated the day when water pipes reached the city; the second, the anniversary of the city's foundation. Both celebrations were instituted by Adud al-Dawla on the model of the holiday of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year. All these activities greatly expanded the economy of Fars so that the tax income was tripled in the 10th century. His contributions to the enrichment of Fars made it a region of relative stability and prosperity for the culture of Iran during the Seljuq and Mongol invasions.  Family  Adud al-Dawla, in order to maintain peace, established marriage ties with several rulers: his daughter was married to the Abbasid caliph at- Ta'i, while another was married to the Samanids and the Ziyarid ruler Bisutun. Adud al-Dawla himself had several wives, which included the daughter of Bisutun; the daughter of Manadhar, a Justanid king; and the daughter of Siyahgil, a Giilite king. From these wives, Adud al-Dawla had several sons: Abu'l-Husain Ahmad and Abu Tahir Firuzshah, from the daughter of Manadhar; Abu Kalijar Marzuban, from the daughter of Siyahgil; and Shirdil Abu'l-Fawaris, from a Turkic concubine. Adud al-Dawla also had a younger son named Baha' al- Dawla. Abu'l-Husain Ahmad was supported by his mother and his uncle, Fuladh ibn Manadhar, as the heir to the Buyid Empire. However, Abu Kalijar Marzuban, because of his more prominent descent, was appointed as heir to the Buyid Empire by Adud al-Dawla. Ancestry Death and succession  Adud al-Dawla died at Baghdad on March 26, 983, and was buried in Najaf. His son Abu Kalijar Marzuban, who was in Baghdad at the time of his death, first kept his death secret in order to ensure his succession and avoid civil war. When he made the death of his father public, he was given the title of \\"Samsam al-Dawla\\". However, Adud al-Dawla's other son, Shirdil Abu'l-Fawaris, challenged the authority of Samsam al-Dawla, resulting in a civil war.  Legacy  Map of the Buyid Empire at the death of Adud al-Dawla (Yemen not shown) Adud al- Dawla, like the previous Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave legitimacy to his dynasty in the eyes of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture of Iran, and was proud of his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions in the city for him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, which carried the traditional Sasanian inscription, Shahanshah, may his glory increase. The reverse side of the coin said: May Shah Fanna Khusraw live long. However, he still preferred Arabic authors to Persian ones. There is very little evidence of his interest in Persian poetry. He spoke Arabic, wrote in Arabic and was proud to be a student of a famous Arab grammarian. He studied science in Arabic, including astronomy and mathematics. Many books written in Arabic were dedicated to him whether religious or secular. Apparently showing interest in Arabic rather than Persian, Adud al-Dawla followed the mainstream of intellectual life in a provincial town where culture was dominated by Arabic and Persian. Like many of his contemporaries, he does not seem to have felt that his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization conflicted with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.

The original architect of Filetab was Tom Barnard, who developed the program (LITA - LIst and TAbulate) for Morgan Crucible when employed by them as a programmer on an ICL 1902 from 1965‚Äì1968. Its purpose was to produce simple ad hoc reports similar to those created with a plugboard on a punched card tabulator, bypassing the necessity to write an assembly language program in PLAN. It required only a few cards to specify the input and output formats, headings, sequencing and totalling. LITA could not be described as a programming language as it only required run-time parameters indicating field types and locations in records and no compilation. In those days there was no concern by Morgan's regarding ownership or copyright when Barnard left to further develop the software as Filetab.

MIPT also worked in conjunction with RAND, for some of its research and analysis. The institute provides training and professional development dedicated to improving the skills of law enforcement officers. Role and focus MIPT provides training to the 800,000 uniformed officers of US domestic police forces through its training model, Information Collection on Patrol (InCOP).http://nsi.ncirc.gov/resources.aspx InCOP is a series of workshops that enhance departmental intelligence capacity, both in traditional crime and terrorism prevention, by progressively improving the collection skills of the line officer, improving the quality, quantity and timeliness of reporting. InCOP course offerings include InCOP 1 which highlights the importance of the line officers role in the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative. This offering includes the Hypervigilience Process, a way of scanning the patrol environment as well as The 2-Minute Interview technique. In InCOP 2, participants learn the importance of cultivating community contacts. InCOP 3 begins an open facilitated dialogue between officers and crime analysts, while InCOP 4 teaches the evolution and changes of the terrorism threat, the current terrorist threat, terrorist tactics and operations and how to develop warnings and indicators as well as detect them. History MIPT was founded by the survivors and family members of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. It was their intention to establish an institute dedicated to terrorism prevention. The first Board of Directors was appointed in 2000 by then Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating. The institute soon began operations conducting research and funding a wide array of projects, both hard and soft science, developing advanced tools such as explosive detection devices, and new work on the biology of anthrax. In 2004, MIPT conceptualized, developed and launched three knowledge bases: Lessons Learned Information Sharing, the Responder Knowledge Base and the Terrorism Knowledge Base. In 2007, MIPT became a national training center. MIPT‚Äôs training model and content is recognized by both the United States Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security as a part of the National Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative.

The volume, as his first non-fiction book, compiles essays of Baldwin that had previously appeared in such magazines as Harper's Magazine, Partisan Review, and The New Leader. Notes of a Native Son is widely regarded as a classic of the black autobiographical genre. The Modern Library placed it at number 19 on its list of the 100 best 20th-century nonfiction books. Autobiographical notes In spite of his father wanting him to be a preacher, Baldwin says he had always been a writer at heart. He tried to find his path as a black writer; although he was not European, American culture is informed by that culture too‚Äîmoreover he had to grapple with other black writers. Furthermore, Baldwin emphasizes the importance of his desire to be a good man and writer. Part One=\\"Everybody's Protest Novel\\" Baldwin castigates Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin for being too sentimental, and for depicting black slaves as praying to a white God so as to be cleansed and whitened. He proceeds to repudiate Richard Wright's Native Son for portraying Bigger Thomas as an angry black man, viewing this as an example of stigmatizing categorization.  \\"Many Thousands Gone\\"  Baldwin offers a sharp critique of Richard Wright's Native Son, citing its main character, Bigger Thomas, as unrealistic, unsympathetic and stereotypical.  \\"Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough\\"  Baldwin criticises Carmen Jones, a film adaptation of Carmen using an all black cast. Baldwin is unhappy that the characters display no connection to the condition of blacks and sees it as no coincidence that the main characters have lighter complexions. Part Two= \\"The Harlem Ghetto\\"  Baldwin points out that the rent is very expensive in Harlem. Moreover, although there are black politicians, the President is white. On to the black press, Baldwin notes that it emulates the white press, with its scandalous spreads and so forth. However the black Church seems to him to be a unique forum for the spelling out of black injustice. Finally, he ponders on antisemitism amongst blacks and comes to the conclusion that the frustration boils down to Jews being white and more powerful than Negroes.  \\"Journey to Atlanta\\"  Baldwin tells the story that happened to The Melodeers, a group of jazz singers (including two of Baldwin's brothers) employed by the Progressive Party to sing in Southern Churches. However, once in Atlanta, Georgia, they were used for canvassing until they refused to sing at all and were returned to their hometown. They now enjoy success in New York City.  \\"Notes of a Native Son\\"  Baldwin paints a vivid recollection of his time growing up with a paranoid father who was dying of tuberculosis, and his initial experience with Jim Crow style segregation. Prior to his father's death, Baldwin was befriended by a white teacher whom his father disapproved of. Later he worked in New Jersey and was often turned down in segregated places‚ÄîBaldwin recalls a time he hurled a cup half full of water at a waitress in a diner only to realize his actions could have dire consequences. He goes on to say that blacks participating in military service in the South often got abused. Finally, he recounts his father's death which occurred just before his mother gave birth to one of his sisters; his father's funeral was on his 19th birthday, the same day as the Harlem Riot of 1943.  Part Three  * \\"Encounter on the Seine: Black Meets Brown\\": Baldwin compares Black Americans to Blacks in France. Whilst Africans in France have a history and a country to hold on to, Black Americans don't‚Äîtheir history lies in the United States and it is in the making. * \\"A Question of Identity\\": Baldwin explains how American students living in Paris are shocked when they arrive and are eager to return home. * \\"Equal in Paris\\": Baldwin recounts getting arrested in Paris over the Christmas period in 1949, after an acquaintance of his had stolen a bed sheet from a hotel, which he had used. The essay stresses his cultural inability to know how to behave with the police. * \\"Stranger in the Village\\": Baldwin looks back to his time in a village in Switzerland‚Äîhow he was the first black man most of the other villagers had ever seen. He goes on to reflect that blacks from European colonies are still mostly located in Africa, while the United States has been fully informed by blacks.

For Unicode numbers, see Number Forms. A number form from one of Francis Galton's (1888) subjects. Note the convolutions, and how the first 12 digits correspond to a clock face. A number form is a mental map of numbers, which automatically and involuntarily appears whenever someone who experiences number-forms thinks of numbers. Numbers are mapped into distinct spatial locations and the mapping may be different across individuals. Number forms were first documented and named by Sir Francis Galton in his The Visions of Sane Persons . Later research has identified them as a type of synesthesia (; ).  Neural mechanisms  It has been suggested that number-forms are a result of \\"cross-activation\\" between regions of the parietal lobe that are involved in numerical cognition and angular gyrus for spatial cognition (; ). Since the areas that process numerical and spatial representations are close to each other, this may contribute to the increased cross-activation. Compared to non-synesthetes, synesthetes display larger P3b amplitudes for month cues, but similar N1 and P3b responses for arrow (<\\\\- or ->) and word (left or right) cues. ().  Reaction time research  Reaction time studies have shown that number-form synesthetes are faster to say which of two numbers is larger when the numbers are arranged in a manner consistent with their number-form, suggesting that number forms are automatically evoked (; ). This can be thought of as a \\"spatial Stroop\\" task, in which space is not relevant to the task, but which can hinder performance despite its irrelevance. The fact that synesthetes cannot ignore the spatial arrangement of the numbers on the screen demonstrates that numbers are automatically evoking spatial cues. The reaction times for valid cues are smaller than invalid cues (words and arrows), but in synesthetes the response time differences for months are larger than those of non-synesthetes ().  Differences with number line  These number forms can be distinguished from the non-conscious mental number line that we all have by the fact that they are 1) conscious, 2) idiosyncratic (see image) and 3) stable across the lifespan. Although this form of synesthesia has not been as intensively studied as Grapheme ‚Üí color synesthesia, Hubbard and colleagues have argued that similar neural mechanisms might be involved, but acting in different brain regions (). Future studies will need to be conducted to test this hypothesis.

He is currently a Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University. Biography=Early life Shou-Wu Zhang was born in Hexian, Ma'anshan, Anhui, China on October 9, 1962. Zhang grew up in a poor farming household and could not attend school until eighth grade due to the Cultural Revolution. He spent most of his childhood raising ducks in the countryside and self-studying mathematics textbooks that he acquired from sent-down youth in trades for frogs. By the time he entered junior high school at the age of fourteen, he had self-learned calculus and had become interested in number theory after reading about Chen Jingrun's proof of Chen's theorem which made substantial progress on Goldbach's conjecture. Education Zhang was admitted to the Sun Yat-sen University chemistry department in 1980 after scoring poorly on his mathematics entrance examinations but later transferred to the mathematics department after feigning color blindness and received his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1983. He then studied under analytic number theorist Wang Yuan at the Chinese Academy of Sciences where he received his master's degree in 1986. In 1986, Zhang was brought to the United States to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia University by Dorian M. Goldfeld. He then studied under Goldfeld, Herv√© Jacquet, Lucien Szpiro, and Gerd Faltings, and then completed his PhD at Columbia University under Szpiro in 1991. Career Zhang was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study and an assistant professor at Princeton University from 1991 to 1996. In 1996, Zhang moved back to Columbia University where he was a tenured professor until 2013. He has been a professor at Princeton University since 2011. Zhang is on the editorial boards of: Acta Mathematica Sinica, Algebra & Number Theory, Forum of Mathematics, Journal of Differential Geometry, National Science Review, Pure and Applied Mathematics Quarterly, Science in China, and Research in Number Theory. He has previously served on the editorial boards of: Journal of Number Theory, Journal of the American Mathematical Society, Journal of Algebraic Geometry, and International Journal of Number Theory. Research Zhang's doctoral thesis Positive line bundles on Arithmetic Surfaces proved a Nakai‚ÄìMoishezon type theorem in intersection theory using a result from differential geometry already proved in Tian Gang's doctoral thesis. In a series of subsequent papers (, ), he further developed his theory of 'positive line bundles' in Arakelov theory which culminated in a proof (with Emmanuel Ullmo) of the Bogomolov conjecture (). In a series of works in the 2000s (, ), Zhang proved a generalization of the Gross‚ÄìZagier theorem from elliptic curves over rationals to modular abelian varieties of GL(2) type over totally real fields. In particular, the latter result led him to a proof of the rank one Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for modular abelian varieties of GL(2) type over totally real fields through his work relating the N√©ron‚ÄìTate height of Heegner points to special values of L-functions in .. Eventually, established a full generalization of the Gross‚ÄìZagier theorem to all Shimura curves. In arithmetic dynamics, posed conjectures on the Zariski density of non-fibered endomorphisms of quasi-projective varieties and proposed a dynamical analogue of the Manin‚ÄìMumford conjecture. In 2018, proved the averaged Colmez conjecture which was shown to imply the Andr√©‚ÄìOort conjecture for Siegel modular varieties by Jacob Tsimerman. Awards Zhang has received a Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship (1997) and a Morningside Gold Medal of Mathematics (1998). He is also a Clay Foundation Prize Fellow (2003), Guggenheim Foundation Fellow (2009), Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2011), and Fellow of the American Mathematical Society (2016).

The Constitution contains a select number of human rights: * the right to life, liberty and security of person and protection of the law * the right to take part in political activities * freedom from inhuman treatment and forced labour *freedom of conscience, expression, information, assembly and association * freedom of employment and movement * the right to privacy and property During the period of self-government from 1973-75 during which the Constitution was drafted and arrangements for full sovereignty were made it was contemplated that as with most former colonies and trust territories in the British Commonwealth Papua New Guinea would wish to have its own indigenous head of state, and the Constitution specifically refers to the \\"Head of State\\" rather than to the Queen or the Crown. In the event, PNG chose to retain the monarchy and there have been no serious moves to alter that arrangement. In practice, the governor-general, chosen by free vote of sitting members of parliament, functions as a de-facto non-executive president. Criminal proceedings are brought in the name of \\"The State\\" rather than \\"The Queen\\" or \\"R.\\"; the Queen's effigy does not appear on banknotes or coins; apart from a few institutions having royal warrant, such as the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary and the Royal Papua Yacht Club, the formal link with the monarchy is largely invisible, and there is little general awareness of it. \\"Underlying law\\" The Constitution declares the \\"underlying law\\" -- that is, the separate common law of Papua New Guinea -- to consist of the Constitution, \\"customary law\\" derived from the \\"custom\\" of the various peoples of Papua New Guinea, and the common law of England as it stood at the date of Papua New Guinea's independence on 16 September 1975. That is to say, decisions of the High Court of Australia, the Judicial Committee of the Imperial Privy Council, not being part of the common law of England, and indeed of the pre-independence courts of Papua New Guinea itself are not part of Papua New Guinea law; but decisions of the House of Lords, the English Court of Appeal, the English Queen's Bench and other English courts up until Papua New Guinea's independence are. The \\"customary law\\" portion of the \\"underlying law\\" was contemplated by the original framers of the Constitution as deriving from the regional customs of the country in the same way as the common law of England (that law which was \\"common\\" to the whole country) had done prior to 1189, deemed to be \\"time immemorial\\" in English law. In practice the courts have found great difficulty in applying traditional custom in a modern legal system and the development of the customary law according to indigenous Melanesian conceptions of justice and equity has been less thorough than may have been anticipated in 1975. In 2000 the National Parliament enacted the Underlying Law Act 2000Jean Zorn and Jennifer Corin Care; Everything Old is New Again: The Underlying Law Act of Papua New Guinea,, LawAsia Journal [2002] 61-97 which purports to mandate greater attention by the courts to custom and the development of customary law as an important component of the underlying law. Thus far the statute appears not to have effected such a result. Statutes Statute law is very largely adopted from overseas jurisdictions. For example, the Criminal Code is adopted from Queensland; the Rules of Court are those of New South Wales; the Matrimonial Causes Act is the extremely old English statute of 1857 which had been in force in the Australian States before the federal Divorce Act, 1964; the Companies Act ch 146 was substantially the English Companies Act 1948; it was replaced by the Companies Act, 1997, adopted from New Zealand. Courts The judicial system consists of village magistrates courts, which remain the only court remaining the administrative responsibility of the executive branch, district courts in urban centres presided over by stipendiary magistrates, the National Court which is the superior trial court and the Supreme Court which is functionally an appellate division of the National Court: it is not separately constituted, its Chief Justice is also the Chief Justice of the National Court and its bench consists of National Court judges sitting as an ad hoc appellate tribunal. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal: an appeal lay from the pre-independence Supreme Court to the High Court of Australia (but not directly to the Privy Council); this was abolished at independence. The Supreme Court also has jurisdiction under the Constitution to give advisory opinions, called \\"references,\\" on the constitutionality of legislation. In addition to its function as a trial court, the National Court also functions as a court of disputed returns hearing \\"Electoral Petitions\\" by unsuccessful candidates for Parliament; Leadership Tribunals hearing cases of alleged misconduct in office referred by the Ombudsman Commission consist of one National Court judge and two District Court magistrates. The Supreme Court has a special responsibility for developing the \\"underlying law,\\" i.e. the common law of Papua New Guinea, having resort to those rules of local custom in various regions of the country which may be taken to be common to the whole country. The responsibility has been given additional express warrant in the Underlying Law Act, 2000 which purports to mandate greater attention by the courts to custom and the development of customary law as an important component of the underlying law. In practice the courts have found great difficulty in applying the vastly differing custom of the many traditional societies of the country in a modern legal system and the development of the customary law according to indigenous Melanesian conceptions of justice and equity has been less thorough than may have been anticipated in 1975; the Underlying Law Act does not yet appear to have had significant effect. Advocacy follows the conventions of the English common law world and is adversarial rather than inquisitorial; German law was wholly displaced by Anglo-Australian law in the former German New Guinea after 1914 when Australia seized the Territory and there are no traces of it in modern Papua New Guinea. The Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea is The Honourable Sir Gibbs Salika,KBE. Despite attempts to incorporate customary law, the writ of the 'National Courts' is felt less keenly in the more remote villages. Victims of crime can choose to have their cases heard in the national courts but this means transporting all those involved to the nearest town. Additionally, national courts hand down sentences that do not generally compensate the victim directly. Melanesian custom tends to see crime as an offence against the victim and their family and community, more than an offence against the law. The affected family require compensation in the form of money or goods. In remote areas, Village Courts are the primary source of formal justice. The Village Courts grew from colonial systems, and were most recently redefined through the Village Courts Act of 1989. Five types of officials can be appointed through the provincial governments, with senior officer requiring gazetting at the national level through the Village Courts and Land Mediation Secretariat. The Village Court Act establishes the court's jurisdiction, but includes general jurisdiction over any events that would disturb order in the community. In practice, the Village Court's accessibility, especially in remote areas, creates tremendous pressures for actors to exceed their jurisdiction in order to provide some justice to isolated communities that would otherwise be isolated from assistance. In remote regions in which few people have paid employment it might seem that large fines would be unlikely to be paid. The system is usually extremely effective; many people will work in town at some stage in their life and then have savings. Fines are levied against the transgressor and family, who then join together to pay the fine. The victim‚Äôs family generally feel satisfied that they have received restitution when they receive the fine, reducing the risk of subsequent fighting. Having paid the fine, the transgressor‚Äôs family usually make very sure that he behaves and may well make him slowly work to pay them back. The Committee Man is paid a fee for his time, generally by the person bringing the case. In a remote environment with no police to back up and enforce his decision, the Committee Man needs considerable wisdom and diplomacy to make his verdict stick. Good Committee Men are impressive individuals and valuable sources of information about their local communities. The \\"Rooney Affair\\": An early crisis in relations between the executive and judiciary The independence of the judiciary has been a particular problem in developing countries, though it was confirmed early in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea's Constitution purports to adopt the principle of the separation of powers, enunciated in US jurisprudence in an environment where the three branches of government are indeed separate, the executive not being responsible to the legislature. In PNG as in Australia, the principle is in fact somewhat artificially defined simply to mean that the judiciary is independent from executive interference, as established by the English Bill of Rights, 1689; however, the principle does not extend, as was established in Australia during the early years of the Australian federation, to preventing the courts from rendering advisory opinions to the executive; nor are there any implications with respect to the quasi-judicial function of administrative tribunals, also an issue at one time in Australia (see Separation of powers in Australia). The principle was quickly tested in Papua New Guinea. In 1979, four years after Independence, the then-Minister of Justice, Mrs Nahau Rooney, wrote a widely circulated letter critical of what she perceived as a lack of sensitivity by the then entirely expatriate-personnel Supreme Court to a \\"growing national consciousness\\": in particular Mrs Rooney was impatient with the purportedly excessively legalistic approach of the Bench to the indigenising of the laws of Papua New Guinea; she was also critical of a Supreme Court Justice's enjoining of a deportation order by the Executive. The then-Chief Justice, Sir William Prentice, called a special sitting of the full bench to condemn the minister for what the court characterised as interference with judicial independence. Mrs Rooney responded by stating that she had \\"no confidence in the Chief Justice and other Judges....It appears that the foreign judges on the bench are only interested in administration of foreign laws and not the feelings and aspirations of the nation's political leaders.\\" The court then convicted Mrs Rooney of contempt in respect of the initial letter and of scandalising the court in respect of the subsequent comments and sentenced her to eight months in prison. The Prime Minister released her on licence after she had served one day of her sentence and four judges including the Chief Justice promptly resigned, a fifth having previously resigned over a related matter. The vacancies were, after a period of some uncertainty, filled by the first national justices, the new Chief Justice Buri Kidu, Mr Justice Mari Kapi (who eventually succeeded Kidu CJ), and Acting Justice Bernard Narokobi, together with expatriate justices who had had long experience in Papua New Guinea as trial lawyers or magistrates. Three considerable ironies emerged in the long term from the Rooney Affair: (1) The vigorous criticism of the Bench by a member of the executive (or indeed the general public) would certainly not have occasioned so drastic response by the judiciary in other common law jurisdictions such as Canada and the USA which also have a constitutionally-guaranteed right of freedom of expression. (2) Notwithstanding the immediate departure of the old guard of colonial-era expatriate justices and their replacement by national justices, the Supreme Court did not then undertake any radical new departures by way of indigenising Papua New Guinea jurisprudence and indeed has been notably cautious in undertaking judicial law reform by way of implementing social policy. And (3) Since the Rooney Affair members of the Executive have been notably timorous in articulating criticism of the Bench, notwithstanding extensive overseas jurisprudence permitting comment on the courts in countries with similar constitutional arrangements whose constitutions include near-identical guarantees of rights and freedoms to those contained in the Constitution of Papua New Guinea. On the other hand, it must be said that legal commentators in the neighbouring common law countries of Singapore and Malaysia are ‚Äî to the extent that they are aware of events in Papua New Guinea ‚Äî somewhat admiring of the extent to which Papua New Guinea's judiciary has maintained its independence as this is unusual in their political environments. In 2006 the independence of the judiciary was briefly challenged when Sir Arnold Amet, the immediately retired Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea, who was in the process of inaugurating a post-judicial political career, launched a series of articles in the Malaysian-owned newspaper The National in which he politically challenged the deliberations of the court over which he had formerly presided with respect to a capital case which was then sub judice. The newspaper was smartly reminded by the court that such challenge was likely to result in severe sanctions, and Sir Arnold withdrew.

He was born in France to British parents in the years following the defeat of the French at Waterloo. He became known as a great negotiator as the Roman Catholic hierarchy was rebuilt in the United Kingdom. He died of cancer while in Rome to attend the first Vatican Council. Biography=Early Life Born at Ligny-les-Aires, Arras, France, on 25 November 1816, Thomas Grant was the son of Bernard Grant, an Irishman from Acheson's Mill, near Newry. At about the age of fourteen, during an Orange riot, Bernard's family was burnt out of their home and moved to Drogheda, where he learned the trade of a weaver. At the age of eighteen, Bernard enlisted in the 71st Highlanders, became sergeant, and finally purchased a commission. His mother, Ann M'Gowan, was also Irish by birth, but had moved to Glasgow when still a child. She accompanied her husband to France during the Napoleonic wars, where his regiment saw action as part of the 3rd Brigade at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Thomas had an older brother, John, who at the age of five was left in the care of an uncle in London to be educated rather than to follow the regiment which was frequently on the move. Thomas grew up as \\"a child of a regiment\\", which subsequently had postings in Bermuda, and England, Cork, and Malta.\\"Thomas Grant, First Bishop of Southwark\\", The Irish Monthly, Vol. 7 (1879), pp. 89-96 In 1824, the regiment sailed from Hull for Canada. Young Thomas was joined by his older brother, John and a younger brother, William. John died in an accident, and his mother, her health undermined by caring for him and with grief, it was thought that a return to England might bring some improvement, but she died on the voyage home and was buried at sea. Thomas was ten years old. O'Meara, Kathleen (Grace Ramsay). Thomas Grant, First Bishop of Southwark, Smith, Elder & Co., London, 1874 As Thomas had indicated that he wished to become a priest, when the regiment moved from Chester, Thomas remained in the care of the local pastor, Dr. Briggs, later bishop of the Diocese of Beverley, who continued the boy's education. Rome In January 1829 he was sent to St Cuthbert's College, at Ushaw, where he studied until 1836. He was then sent to study philosophy and theology at the English College at Rome, where Nicholas Wiseman was rector. There he developed a particular devotion to Mary, under the title Sedes Sapientiae. He was ordained priest on 28 November 1841, was created doctor of divinity and appointed as secretary to Cardinal Acton, a position in which he acquired a knowledge of canon law, and acquaintance with the method of conducting ecclesiastical affairs at Rome. Grant was fluent in Latin, French, and Italian. In 1843, then Anglican cleric Frederick Faber visited Rome, and Grant served as his tour guide. In October 1844, at the early age of twenty- eight, he became rector of the English College, Rome. In the months leading up to the proclamation of the Roman Republic, the clergy in Rome were obliged to adopt secular garb for safety. In April 1849, with the French landing at Civitavecchia, the Rector sent the students to the cramped summer house at Monte Porzio, while remaining in Rome to protect the College. Pope Pius IX had withdrawn to Gaeta, leaving a number of important documents with Monsignor Grant at the English College. After the departure of the students, Grant hung the Union Jack on the outside of the building to discourage looters. He stayed in contact with the students by letters, disguised as cigars, delivered by courier. The students returned in mid-July. Grant was also made agent for the English bishops. In this capacity he assisted William Bernard Ullathorne, who was then negotiating for the restoration of the English hierarchy. He also translated for Propaganda all English documents relating to the matter, and furnished the materials for the historical preface to the Decree of 1850. Southwark On 4 July 1851, Grant was consecrated bishop of the new Diocese of Southwark. Anti-Catholic elements denounced the establishment of a Catholic hierarchy as \\"papal aggression\\". The bishops were surprised by the level of hostility, as they had explained their intentions to Lord Minto, the father-in-law of Lord John Russell, three years earlier. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 (Statute 10 of George IV, chapter 10) had forbidden the use of the old titles except by the clergy of the established Protestant Church,Report of Select Committee, p. 85 The Catholic Church had refrained from using the ancient titles of the existing Anglican sees, and had created new titles for their bishoprics. In the wake of widespread popular \\"no popery\\" outbursts, Prime Minister Lord John Russell passed the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851 as an anti-Roman Catholic measure.Chadwick, Owen. The Victorian Church (1966) v. 1 pp 292-309 The Act was largely ineffective since while Roman Catholic community unofficially used the territorial titles, the bishops themselves carefully stayed within the letter of the law. No one was ever prosecuted. To the newly appointed hierarchy he was, as Bishop Ullathorne testified, most useful: \\"His acuteness of learning, readiness of resource and knowledge of the forms of ecclesiastical business made him invaluable to our joint counsels at home, whether in synods or in our yearly episcopal meetings; and his obligingness, his untiring spirit of work, and the expedition and accuracy with which he struck off documents in Latin, Italian, or English, naturally brought the greater part of such work on his shoulders.\\" Grant soon won the confidence of Catholics and others. As the Government was shy of transacting business directly with Cardinal Wiseman, many negotiations were carried on by Dr. Grant, who was specially successful in obtaining from the Government the appointment of military and naval chaplains, as well as prison chaplains. He also was successful in obtaining some Sisters of Mercy from Bermondsey to serve in the military hospitals in the Crimea.Paradis, Mary Raphael et al. ‚ÄúThe Sisters of Mercy in the Crimean War: Lessons for Catholic health care.‚Äù The Linacre Quarterly vol. 84,1 (2017): 29-43 Bishop Grant gave great attention to orphanages run by the Sisters of Our Lady of Fidelity in Norwood and North Hyde. The bishop was in Rome in December 1854 for the promulgation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. In 1859, Bishop Grant wrote to Chaplain John Vertue expressing dismay on the subject of a chaplain's uniform then under discussion, lest their priestly role be subordinated to their military rank. He particularly did not wish to see chaplains out on parade.Snape, Michael Francis. The Royal Army Chaplains' Department, 1796-1953: Clergy Under Fire, Boydell Press, 2008, p. 159 In the administration of his diocese he proved equal to the task of organization, which was necessary in an age of rapid expansion, while the remarkable sanctity of his private life led to his being generally regarded as a saint, and caused Pius IX, when he learned of his death, to exclaim \\"Another saint in heaven!\\" The virtues of charity and humility in particular were practised by him in an heroic degree. The last years of his life were spent in great suffering, caused by cancer, and when he set out to attend the First Vatican Council at Rome in 1870, he knew that he would not return. He was appointed member of the Congregation for the Oriental Rites and the Apostolic Missions, but was too ill to take an active part in the proceedings. He died in Rome on 1 June 1870. After death his body was brought back to England for burial.

Early in his life he was a prolific composer of secular chansons, and late in his life he wrote hymns and canticles, under the influence of the Jesuits. He was murdered by Protestants during the French Wars of Religion. Life Details of his life are relatively scanty for an otherwise prominent composer of the period, probably because he never held a salaried position as a musician at an establishment whose records have survived. He was born at Fontanges, in Auvergne, and from about 1560 he lived in Toulouse. Details of his death are not known, but that he was martyred for his Jesuit-inspired songs by Protestants is attested by several writers of the time. According to Michel Coyssard, writing in 1608, he was traveling between Toulouse and one of the farms he managed when he was attacked and killed. Music and influence Bertrand published three large books of chansons between 1576 and 1578, and, two years later, two books of sacred music (a third was published posthumously, in 1582). A total of 83 chansons and one Italian madrigal have survived of his secular music, and one chanson spirituelle, in French, 10 hymns in Latin, 14 canticles, and three Latin motets, of his sacred music . Most of his music is for four unaccompanied voices. He wrote in the preface to his first book of chansons (1576) that he intended to publish five or six books in total, including many pieces which he wrote much earlier in his life; this would seem to indicate that about half of his music has not survived . His first two volumes of chansons are for four voices, and are settings of the Amours of Pierre de Ronsard, poems which describe the stages and incidents in a love affair gone sour. Some of the harmonic language used in the chansons is daring, and approaches the experimental level of Vicentino; Bertrand uses microtones, including quarter- tones, as an expressive device in two of the pieces from the second book (1578). The most extreme example of this is the last seventeen measures of the chanson Je suis tellement amoureux, in which Bertrand completely avoids diatonic writing, using \\"only chromatic and enharmonic, with no mixture of diatonicism except in an interval in the bassecontre and another in the hautecontre, made to express the word 'death'\\" However, in a later edition of the same songs (published posthumously in 1587) his publisher removed the dots used as microtone accidentals; evidently they were either too hard to sing, or the notation was too unfamiliar. In the preface he also mentions that music is best when it appeals to the senses, and avoids mathematical subtleties. Although Bertrand only wrote one Italian madrigal‚Äîactually a villanella‚Äîhe was clearly influenced in his chanson-writing by the Italian concern for text- painting and careful underlining of words and phrases with appropriate and symbolic melodic and harmonic material. He was careful to use contrasting textures and meters, for example switching from duple to triple meter several times during the course of a composition. Bertrand's sacred works, contained in his three publications of Airs spirituels and sonets chrestiens, are closely related stylistically to the contemporary psalm-settings by the Huguenots: they are simple both melodically and harmonically, and usually maintain a homophonic texture throughout. The melodies are mostly from Gregorian chant. Except for the origin of their tunes, they are very similar to some of the psalm settings by the Huguenot composer Claude Goudimel, who had been killed by Catholics in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre a decade earlier.

His work addresses many audiences' misconception that \\"native artists are not allowed to do work that is not about First Nations identity\\", by making poetic artworks that defy categorization.  Biography  Jungen's father was a Swiss immigrant to Canada and met his mother, from the Dane-Zaa nation, in the interior of British Columbia. The two married in the 1960s, and as a result, the government took away his mothers Indian status and treaty rights, which, according to the governments' Indian Act, could only be determined paternally.Belanger, Yale D. (2014). Ways of Knowing An Introduction to Native Studies in Canada. Toronto, ON: Nelson. Born in 1970 Jungen was raised in the remote logging town of Fort St. JohnAugaitis, Daina. \\"Prototypes for New Understanding.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 5. and attended public school where he developed an inclination towards visual art. Sadly, his parents died in a fire and he was subsequently raised by his Aunt. Jungen moved to Vancouver for his post secondary education, and graduated from Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design with a Diploma of Visual Art in 1992.\\"Brian Jungen CV.\\" catrionajeffries.com/wpcontent/uploads/cv/Brian_Jungen_CV.pdf. Following his post secondary education Jungen spent time studying art history at Concordia University in Montreal, before moving to New York in 1993. He befriended artist Nicole Eisenmann in New York before returning to Vancouver.Milroy, Sarah. \\"The Art of the Double Take.\\" Globe and Mail, 4 Nov. 2000. In 1997 Jungen participated in the group show _Buddy Place_ at the OR Gallery in Vancouver. Jungen's contribution were several wall drawings that explored the stereotyped representations of Indigenous peoples and cultures in BC.Watson, Scott. \\"Shapeshifter.\\" Brian Jungen: CAG, Contemporary Art Gallery, 2002, p. 14. The wall drawings tried to understand what \\"people thought native art [was]\\" by soliciting drawings from people on the street and turning them into large-scale wall drawings. In 1999 Jungen had a solo show at the Charles H. Scott Gallery where he showed more wall drawings and his Prototypes for New Understanding (1998-2005). The exhibition caught the attention of the nations art journalists, critics, academics and curators\\", and when the Vancouver Art Gallery purchased several of the sculptures, Jungen's importance and legitimacy was sealed.Watson, Scott. \\"Shapeshifter.\\" Brian Jungen: CAG, Contemporary Art Gallery, 2002, p. 12-13. The Prototypes for New Understanding saw Jungen dismantling Nike Air Jordan sneakers, and reassembling them into forms with a striking resemblance to Northwest coast Indigenous masks. The sculptures poignantly drew a comparison between western material fantasies and the fetishism of the 'other' in settler society.Medina, Cuauhtemoc. \\"High Curios.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 31.

The 30' long sculpture pointed to anthropological methods of display, natural resources, commodification and globalization, among numerous other themes that activated the work.Augaitis, Daina. \\"Prototypes for New Understanding.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 10. The idea of the captive whale was also important to Jungen's thinking as he saw \\"a parallel to the situation of the First Nations individual who is both marginalized and fetishized by mainstream culture\\". In the same way that a natural history museum preserves a whale skeleton, a museum of anthropology preserves Indigenous cultural 'artifacts', both institutions presume an \\"imminent extinction\\" of their displayed subjects. In 2002 [Jungen] was awarded the inaugural $50,000 Sobey Art award. In 2004 Jungen installed Court at the exhibition space Triple Candie in New York. The life-size replica of a basketball court, made out of sweatshop sewing machine tables, pointed to globalization, exploitive labor and sports fetishism, and opened up new conceptual possibilities in Jungen's work. In 2005 a retrospective of his work traveled from New York's New Museum, to the Vancouver Art Gallery, and Musee d'art Contemporain de Montreal. Jungen had an incredibly rapid rise to international fame, which brought with it a rigorous travel schedule; in response Jungen has taken to spending extended periods of time each year \\"up north, on the Doig River first Nation\\".Milroy, Sarah. \\"Brian Jungen: Work in Progress .\\" Canadian Art, 2011. His 2010/11 exhibition at Catriona Jefferies incorporated \\"raw animal hides, which were produced during Jungen's visits up north, where he... started hunting again with his relatives\\".Jacques, Michelle. \\"Tomorrow, Repeated: Brian Jungen.\\" Exhibition Brochure: Art Gallery of Ontario. May 2011. Jungen has worked with the animal hides in numerous ways including making prints from them and stretching them over car parts and modern furniture \\"to make some of [his] own drums\\".\\"Brian Jungen in 'Vancouver.'\\" Art 21, 23 Sept. 2016, art21.org/artist/brian-jungen/. Trying to describe the sculpture Tomorrow Repeated, (2011) one journalist said: it is \\"a moose hide, stretched taut across a pair of metallic green car fenders and trussed in the back with strips of skin, like a corset, the whole thing sits on top of a white freezer ‚Äì convenient storage for the meat the skin once wrapped\\".Whyte, Murray. \\"Brian Jungen at the AGO: A Canadian Art Superstar Goes Personal.\\" Toronto Star, 7 May 2011. In his own words Jungen said: \\"people up there, on the reserve, have freezers everywhere, they have car parts everywhere, and they have animal parts everywhere\\". In 2012 Jungen collaborated with artist Duane Linklater on the film Modest Livelihood, the hour-long film silently documents the two artists on a hunting trip in Northern British Columbia. The title of the film references the \\"1999 Supreme Court of Canada decision confirming First Nations' hunting and fishing rights but clarifying their limitation to the earning of a 'moderate livelihood'\\".Waxman, Lori. \\"Artists from Canada's First Nations Go Hunting with a 1m Camera.\\" Chicago Tribune, 16 Jan. 2013.

In 2016 Jungen had shows at both Catriona Jefferies and Casey Kaplan, which saw the artist returning to one of his original materials: Nike sneakers. \\"The new sculptures [were] entirely different ‚Äì more open and abstract\\".Ledernan, Marsha. \\"Three Can't-Miss Contemporary-Art Shows.\\" Globe and Mail, 23 Jan. 2016. The abstract sculptures have a strong modernist sensibility and an understanding of materials that \\"characterizes so much of Jungen's work\\".Hill, Richard William. \\"Close Readings: Brian Jungen'.\\" CMagazine, 2016, p. 53. These new shoe \\"works are less a direct representation and contain more a suggestion of animal and human faces\\" they confront our desire to \\"search for and recognize... patterns\\" by disappointing audiences who may be searching for Jungen's iconic masks.\\"Brian Jungen CV.\\" catrionajeffries.com/wp-content/uploads/cv/Brian_Jungen_CV.pdf.  Themes  Throughout his career Jungen has created poetic artworks which explore a diversity of themes through their openness to multiple interpretations and have \\"resisted the trap of racial pigeon-holing\\". Jungen's work makes \\"connections between his First Nations ancestry, Western art history and the global economy\\". His breakout series Prototypes for New Understanding was loaded with enough clues to \\"[allow] writers to connect the dots between globalization, Nike's Third World sweat shops, and Canada's institutionalized\\" colonial racism.Watson, Scott. \\"Shapeshifter.\\" Brian Jungen: CAG, Contemporary Art Gallery, 2002, p. 15. Several themes have been consistently pursued throughout his career including museology, consumerism/ globalization, identity politics and animals.  Museology  From the early Prototypes for New Understanding (displayed in Plexiglas vitrines) through to more recent sculptures (using freezers as plinths), methods of display have been central to the aesthetic and conceptual success of Jungen's work. Canada's Indian Act of 1876 encompassed a Potlatch ban; the government implemented this ban by seizing much of the material culture (masks, blankets, baskets, etc....) that were central to Potlatches.Shier, Reid. \\"Cheap.\\" Brian Jungen, Charles H. Scott Gallery, 2000. p. 4. The confiscated 'culture' has subsequently been displayed in museums of anthropology; as Jungen says: \\"a lot of my exposure to my ancestry is through museums\\".Baird, Daniel. \\"Air Jungen.\\" The Walrus, Feb. 2006. Jungen realized the significance of 'display' to the colonial ideology and the way that museums of anthropology have historicized and \\"mythologized\\" Indigenous cultureWallace, Keith. \\"Forward.\\" Brian Jungen: CAG, Contemporary Art Gallery, 2002, p. 10 as a way of maintaining colonial domination. Fully aware of the colonial motives of anthropological display, it was coincidence that Jungen \\"went into Nike Town [where] they had sneakers of theirs in glass vitrines\\".\\"Brian Jungen in 'Vancouver.'\\" Art 21, 23 Sept. 2016, art21.org/artist/brian-jungen/. Min. 33.01. Jungen conflated these two experiences of museology in his Prototypes for New Understanding by presenting his Northwest Coast inspired masks made of Nike Air Jordan sneakers \\"as if they were anthropological artifacts ‚Äì on metal armatures inside plexi-glass vitrines\\";Shier, Reid. \\"Cheap.\\" Brian Jungen, Charles H. Scott Gallery, 2000. p. 7. thus tapping into the 'mythologizing' effect that the vitrine has had on both sneakers and Indigenous material culture. Jungen again invoked museology in his sculpture Shapeshifter (2000) where he transformed plastic lawn chairs into the form of a whale skeleton and hung it as if it were a \\"display found in natural history museums or public aquarium\\". The display of whales in museums and aquariums is like a \\"parallel to the situation of the First Nations individual who is both marginalized and fetishized\\" in settler society. Through their own methods of display, Jungen's sculptures point to \\"the values that modes of display bestow upon an object\\".Wallace, Keith. \\"Forward.\\" Brian Jungen: CAG, Contemporary Art Gallery, 2002, p. 10.  Consumerism and globalization  The manipulation of consumer products has been central to Jungen's practice and additionally, his use of \\"the raw materials of economic production\\" have been key tools for Jungen to address consumerism and globalization.Smith , Trevor. \\"Collapsing Utopias: Brian Jungen's Minimalist Tactics.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 83. In 2001 Jungen produced Untitled, which was a stack of wooden pallets \\"displayed in a seemingly random pile, the way pallets might be found at the edge of a loading bay\\".Augaitis, Daina. \\"Prototypes for New Understanding.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 8. Upon closer examination the pallets reveal themselves to be \\"painstakingly handcrafted by the artist from red cedar (the wood most commonly used by Northwest Coast Aboriginal carvers)\\". The pallet, as a fundamental tool for the mass movement of goods and commodities, becomes a symbol of globalization. Yet, in Jungen's hands the pallets become fetishized items of craftsmanship; that transformation is almost the opposite of Nike sneakers, which are produced under the sweatshop conditions of globalization, and transformed by the market into consumer fetishes.Medina, Cuauhtemoc. \\"High Curios.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 30. In 2004 Jungen produced Court a monumental sculpture made of \\"231 wood veneer sweatshop [sewing] tables, sourced from a secondhand broker in New Jersey\\", and arranged into a scale replica of a basketball court. Made up of sweatshop tables, Jungen's court had hundreds of holes where sewing machines would have sat. This treacherous court makes an uneasy connection between the millionaire athletes, who play on such courts, in shoes made on sweatshop tables like the ones Jungen's court is made of. The uncomfortable exploitive conditions of globalization are a theme that run through Jungen's work. Jungen is interested in commodities, often transforming prefabricated materials (such as baseball bats, chairs, shoes, gasoline cans...) into sculptures. As Jungen says: \\"I like using things people can recognize and that they see around them everyday\\".\\"Brian Jungen in 'Vancouver.'\\" Art 21, 23 Sept. 2016, art21.org/artist/brian-jungen/.

The Nike shoes being of economic value and the Northwest Coast masks Jungen's sculptures reference being of cultural value; Jungen's sculptural transformation makes the connections \\"between the commodification of those shoes, and the same thing that has happened to native art\\".\\"Brian Jungen in 'Vancouver.'\\" Art 21, 23 Sept. 2016, art21.org/artist/brian-jungen/.

Amidst the capitalist settler desire to understand and demystify Indigenous cultureMedina, Cuauhtemoc. \\"High Curios.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 37. they have transformed Indigenous \\"heritage into capital\\".Medina, Cuauhtemoc. \\"High Curios.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 32. Jungen has continued to explore the fetishistic nature of commodities and their relationships to Indigeneity. His 2011 sculpture Tomorrow Repeated takes \\"the ultimate consumer fetish object, the car,\\" and stretches over it a moose hide. This sculpture is again an example of Jungen exploring the territory between commodity and culture, and merging the settler fetishism of Indigenous imagery with the commodity fetishism of the car.  Identity politics  Jungen's personal heritage as Dane-Zaa, and living in the settler colonial state of Canada, have proved to be fruitful inspiration for much of his practice, as he \\"works the seam between native and white cultures\\".Milroy, Sarah. \\"Shaman of the Sofa .\\" Globe and Mail, 14 Feb. 2006. Jungen's art often calls into question the \\"stereotypical representations of Aboriginal culture\\"Augaitis, Daina. \\"Prototypes for New Understanding.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 7. and the colonial \\"ambition to assimilate native art\\". As Jungen states: \\"I was interested in the ubiquitousness of native motifs, especially in Vancouver, and how they have been corrupted and applied and assimilated commercially\\". Jungen's \\"art unfolds against [this] global context of colonial stereotyping\\",Medina, Cuauhtemoc. \\"High Curios.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 29 and he often plays-up that stereotyping by \\"appropriating imagery from nations that are not his own\\" (Milroy, 2006). His Prototypes for New Understanding, for example, are evocative of mask designs from coastal nations of BC including the Haida, Kwakwaka'waka, and Bella Coola nations. Being from the Dane-Zaa nation in the provincial interior, Jungen's masks appropriate the designs of coastal nations; in the same way that Indigenous coastal motifs have been co-opted by settlers and \\"come to be associated with the whole province\\".\\"Brian Jungen in 'Vancouver.'\\" Art 21, 23 Sept. 2016, art21.org/artist/brian-jungen/. Min. 29:10. Jungen again points to the formation of a generic 'Indigenous' identity that ignores distinctions between nations, by making Furniture Sculpture (2006), a Teepee built of leather stripped off sofas. Teepee's have become a generic symbol for 'Indianness', when in fact they are very specific to Plains nations. Thus, Jungen's teepee promoted one journalist to ask: \\"what is he doing erecting a teepee if not to provoke such essentialist presumptions about his ethnicity?\\". In Canada's British Columbia, imagery of Northwest coast First Nations have been \\"commercialized\\",Medina, Cuauhtemoc. \\"High Curios.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 29. and mythologized into the branding of the Province itself as 'supernatural British Columbia'. Indigenous imagery and \\"iconography\\" has been \\"sewn into the public consciousness\\" in an almost unconscious yet predictable fashion. This 'predictability' has been explored in some of Jungen's most recent sculptures in 2016. Returning to the medium of Nike sneakers these more recent sculptures are more abstract, some contain hints of reference to masks or animals, but are largely unrecognizable. Given the formal and conceptual success of Jungen's previous Nike sneaker sculptures, these new abstractions reject audiences' expectation of them as masks, instead, they refuses our \\"desire for meaning\\".Hill, Richard William. \\"Close Readings: Brian Jungen'.\\" CMagazine, 2016, p. 52. Given the strong desire by settlers to understand, and therefore assimilate, Indigenous culture these new sculptures consciously refute the stereotypes of Indigenous imagery (stereotypes which his earlier Prototype for New Understanding critically embraced) and reflect the 'desire to understand' back to settlers.  Animals  Animals have consistently appeared in Jungen's work. Sometimes as a subject matter, as when he constructed a whale skeleton in Shapeshifter (2000); It is made of only plastic chairs, but it looks like a real sculpture! And sometimes as a material, both living and not; his use of various animal hides, and also using live animals as he did with cats in Habitat 04: Cite radieuse des chats/ Cats radiant city (2004). Habitat 04: Cite radieuse des chats/ Cats radiant city was a temporary habitat for homeless cats, which Jungen build to mimic the iconic Moshe Safdie designed building 'Habitat' in Montreal for Expo 67.Augaitis, Daina. \\"Prototypes for New Understanding.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 12. Jungen's \\"fascination with animals\\" often circles back to questions around the domestication of pets and the \\"environments built for animals\\" such as at aquariums or zoos.Jungen, Brian, and Simon Starling. \\"In Conversation .\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 130. For his 2005 project Inside Today's Home Jungen Reconfiguring materials purchased at IKEA to created an \\"indoor aviary for six domesticated zebra finches\\".Augaitis, Daina. \\"Prototypes for New Understanding.\\" Brian Jungen, Vancouver Art Gallery, 2005, p. 13. So as not to disturb the birds, viewers were only able to see them and the structures through peepholes in the gallery walls, thus exaggerating voyeuristic tendencies towards animals. Jungen's interest in animals in captivity is a parallel between the voyeuristic way in which audiences look at captive animals and the way audiences look at Indigenous material culture.  Artistic approach  Jungen's art draws upon the tradition of found object art, espoused by such twentieth-century artists as Andy Warhol and Marcel Duchamp. Instead of presenting objects \\"as-is,\\" however, Jungen often reworks them without fully concealing their original meaning or purpose. For instance, Jungen's series Prototypes of New Understanding (1998-2005) consists of aboriginal masks assembled and hand-sewn from parts of Nike Air Jordan shoes. Jungen writes: \\"It was interesting to see how by simply manipulating the Air Jordan shoes you could evoke specific cultural traditions whilst simultaneously amplifying the process of cultural corruption and assimilation. The Nike mask sculptures seemed to articulate a paradoxical relationship between a consumerist artefact and an 'authentic' native artefact.\\" The Nike footwear that Jungen had employed incorporates in their unmodified forms similar colours to traditional First Nations artwork and wood carvings: red and black. However, other projects, such as a series of wooden pallets, painstakingly crafted out of red cedar, a First Nations tent made out of \\"11 leather couches\\" and Jungen's large \\"whale-bone\\" sculptures made out of plastic chairs (some still with Canadian Tire price stickers on them) seek to defamiliarize even members of Western society that are unfamiliar with First Nation themes by placing familiar objects in unfamiliar positions or situations and vice versa. Yet other projects, such as Jungen's \\"Isolated Depiction of the Passage of Time,\\" are more political. In this specific example, the plastic food trays are colour-coded to match the statistics of jail sentences given to First Nations individuals, while (inspired by a prison-break exhibit Jungen once saw), the inner part of the sculpture conceals a television and a DVD player, quietly playing the film The Great Escape from the inside. In 2004, he participated in A Grain of Dust A Drop of Water: The 5th Gwangju Biennale in Gwangju, Korea. An exhibition of Jungen's work was held at the Vancouver Art Gallery (Canada) from January 28 to April 30, 2006.https://web.archive.org/web/20060205052345/http://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/exhibitions_brianjungen.cfm Later that year he also held an exhibition at the Tate Modern from May 20 to July 9, 2006.https://web.archive.org/web/20090203221214/http://tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/jungen/default.shtm In 2008 he participated in the Sydney Biennale exhibiting his installation entitled Crux. Jungen is the first living Native American artist to exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in Washington, D.C. with his survey exhibition entitled \\"Strange Comfort\\" that was on view from October 16, 2009 to August 8, 2010. Jungen won the 2010 Iskowitz Prize for visual arts. In 2011, Jungen unveiled three public sculptures at the Banff Centre entitled The ghosts on top of my head, consisting of white powder- coated steel benches, each in the shape of an antler from an elk, moose, and caribou. His sculpture entitled Carapace was inspired by Jules Verne's mythical giant animals and was exhibited in Loire Valley, where Jules Verne is from. It was also shown at the Art Gallery of Alberta in Edmonton in 2011. He grew up in an isolated community in the Peace River area in credits this with stimulating his creativity.  Major collections  Jungen's work is in the National Gallery of Canada's permanent collection of contemporary artists. Shapeshifter (2000) was acquired in 2001; Court (2004) was acquired in 2012; Star/Pointro (2011) was acquired in 2011; People's Flag (2006) References and sourcesExternal links * Fetishism, Curiosity, and the Work of Brian Jungen by Kimberly Phillips in Fillip * Brian Jungen at Kadist Art Foundation Online exhibits and media * The Tyee * Cybermuse National Gallery of Canada. * Artfacts.net Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Dane-zaa Category:20th-century First Nations sculptors Category:Canadian male sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:21st-century sculptors Category:First Nations sculptors Category:Artists from British Columbia Category:Emily Carr University of Art and Design alumni Category:People from Fort St. John, British Columbia Category:Canadian installation artists Category:Canadian contemporary artists ","title":"Brian Jungen"},{"id":"3582805","text":"Franconville may refer to the following French municipalities : *Franconville, Meurthe-et-Moselle, in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department *Franconville, Val-d'Oise, in the Val-d'Oise department * Canton of Franconville ","title":"Franconville"},{"id":"3582807","text":"No. 10 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) maritime patrol squadron based at RAAF Base Edinburgh, South Australia, is part of No. 42 Wing RAAF.

It was re-formed in Australia in 1949 and since then has contributed to Australia's East Timor intervention, and has been deployed to the Middle East as part of the War on Terrorism and the 2003 Gulf War. History=Second World War No. 10 Squadron was formed on 1 July 1939 at RAAF Base Point Cook, under the command of Wing Commander Leon Lachal.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 67 Later that month aircrew and ground staff from the squadron departed for Britain to be trained on the Short Sunderland aircraft which had been acquired to equip the squadron. While it was intended that the aircrew would fly these aircraft to Australia after completing their training, following the outbreak of war the Australian government offered to retain the squadron in Britain. As a result, No. 10 Squadron was both the first RAAF squadron and the first British Commonwealth squadron to see active service in the Second World War, when one of its aircraft made a flight to Tunisia on 10 October 1939. It was also the only RAAF squadron to see continuous active service throughout the war.Stephens, Royal Australian Air Force, p.76 No. 10 Squadron Sunderland sets out on patrol in 1941 The squadron's major tasks during the war were escorting convoys, conducting anti-submarine patrols, and air-sea rescue.

No. 10 Squadron sank a total of six U-boats between February 1940 and May 1945. It also set a Coastal Command record in February 1944 for the most patrol hours flown in a single month: 1143. The unit lost 19 aircraft during the war, most of which, according to author Norman Barnes, are thought to have been shot down by long range German fighter aircraft.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 66 In June 1945, the squadron ceased operations as part of Coastal Command and a reorganisation of RAAF units in Britain resulted in No. 466 Squadron RAAF being redesignated as No. 10 Squadron and moving to Bassingbourn, in Cambridgeshire. Following the end of hostilities in Europe, No. 10 Squadron began preparations to deploy to the Pacific Theatre; however, this was curtailed by the Japanese surrender and it remained in Britain, disbanding on 26 October 1945. Wartime casualties amounted to 161 personnel killed. Post-war No. 10 Sqn. SP-2H with a USN P-5 and a RNZAF Sunderland in 1963 No. 10 Squadron was re-formed at Townsville on 1 March 1949 to increase the RAAF's reconnaissance capability. Operating modified Lincoln heavy bombers the squadron conducted maritime and anti-submarine patrols over northern Australia and the South Pacific. In June 1950, a detachment from the squadron was sent to Darwin to carry out search and rescue duties.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, pp. 66‚Äì67 The squadron continued in this role after re-equipping with Neptune aircraft in March 1962, and the longer range of the Neptune allowed the squadron to operate over South East Asia and the Central Pacific in an area that was equal to \\"one tenth of the world's surface\\".Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, p. 44. During the Vietnam War, Neptune aircraft from No. 10 Squadron operating from U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield supported US Air Force B-52 bombing missions on an opportunity basis whilst transiting Thai airspace, using their AN/APS-120 radar to provide early warning of surface-to-air missiles.Coulthard-Clark, The RAAF in Vietnam, p. 92. The Neptune's electronic equipment was also used during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation in the mid-1960s to monitor Indonesian radars. For a six-month period between June 1968 and January 1969, the squadron was commanded by a US naval officer, Lieutenant Commander J.A. Mueller.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 68 Throughout 1978‚Äì79, No. 10 Squadron was re-equipped with P-3C Orion aircraft and relocated to RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia. With the similarly equipped No. 11 Squadron, No. 10 Squadron continues to operate in the maritime patrol, surveillance and anti-shipping roles. Since the 1980s, No. 10 Squadron has contributed to the RAAF maritime patrol detachment based at Butterworth Air Base in Malaysia as part of Operation Gateway. More recently, it supported the Australian-led intervention into East Timor in 1999, and has contributed to the Australian maritime patrol detachment based in the Persian Gulf since 2003. In this role the squadron has supported coalition operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and undertaken border protection duties as part of Operation Resolute. It is currently assigned to No. 42 Wing RAAF where it operates two AP-3C Orions in an electronic warfare role. The squadron is set to operate the AP-3Cs until 2023, after which they will be replaced by four MC-55A Peregrine aircraft. Aircraft operated The squadron has operated the following aircraft: * Short Sunderland (1939‚Äì1945) * Supermarine Walrus Mk.I (1940) * Short S.26 G-Boat (1941) * Avro Lincoln (1949‚Äì1962) * Lockheed P2V-7S Neptune (1962‚Äì1977) * Lockheed P-3C Orion (1977‚Äì2002) * AP-3C Orion (2002‚Äìcurrent) No. 10 Squadron was also equipped with small numbers of Supermarine Seagull, Supermarine Southampton, de Havilland DH60 Moth floatplane, Consolidated Catalina and Supermarine Walrus aircraft for training purposes prior to receiving its Sunderland aircraft.Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, p. 41.

Musically, \\"Addicted to You\\" is an R&B; and rock song. \\"Addicted to You\\" received positive reviews from music critics, many who highlighted it from the parent album; one music critic viewed the single as \\"nostalgic\\". It achieved commercial success in Japan, with a peak position of number one on the Oricon Singles Chart and a Million certification by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). The single remains the fourth highest selling single in first week sales, and the thirty-ninth best selling single in Japan. A music video was shot in Hong Kong, and featured Utada inside a club.

There are two versions of the track: the Up-in-Heaven mix and the Underwater mix. EMI did not originally select \\"Addicted to You\\" as the lead single as they feared it would not make an impact in Japan. The song was then re-composed in order to appeal more to the Japanese audience. \\"Addicted to You\\" is a rock and R&B; song. \\"Addicted to You\\" was released on September 16, 1999 in CD format by EMI, as the lead single for the singer's second studio album Distance (2001).

A staff review from CDJournal discussed Utada's first greatest hits compilation Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 and commended Utada's \\"fine\\" vocal delivery and composition. Ian Martin from Allmusic also commended Jam and Lewis' collaboration, saying that \\"providing stark contrast to the cheap, tinny sound that characterized much Japanese pop of the previous decade, with \\"Wait & See\\" and \\"Addicted to You\\" both featuring the production talents of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis.\\" Miko Amaranthine from Yahoo! Music listed the song at number four on his Top Ten Hikaru Utada songs, stating \\"\\"Addicted to you\\" is one of my favorites for a slightly greedy purpose [...] When I listen to this song, I am reminded how much I love my marriage and am thankful I do not have to play the \\"dating game\\".\\" At the 15th Annual Japan Gold Disc Awards, \\"Addicted to You\\" and Utada's previous singles \\"Automatic\\" and \\"Movin' on Without You\\" received the award for \\"Song of the Year\\".

It provided air defense and surveillance of the southeastern region of the US. SEADS closed in winter 2005, giving up surveillance and control of their airspace to the Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) and the former Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS).  History =Cold War The origins of the Southeast Air Defense Sector (SEADS) are in September 1957 with the formation of its predecessor organization, the Montgomery Air Defense Sector (MoADS) by Air Defense Command (ADC). It was established in September 1957 with a mission to train and maintain tactical flying units in state of readiness in order to defend the Southeastern United States, assuming control of former ADC Central Air Defense Force units. Its original region consisted of ADC atmospheric forces (fighter-interceptor and radar units) located east of the Mississippi River, south of the 34th parallel north and east to a designated line west of the 86th meridian west, southeast to the southernmost point of Key Largo Island, Florida. It was consolidated on 1 January 1959 with the Shreveport and Miami Air Defense Sectors, defining a region south of 34th parallel north, bordering on the east along the intersection of the parallel southeast along the Georgia‚ÄìSouth Carolina border to the Atlantic coastline. In the west, the sector was responsible for most of Eastern Texas south of the 34th parallel north, including the state of Louisiana, eastwards. It operated a Manual Air Direction Center (MDC) at Dobbins AFB, Georgia. The sector's mission was to train and maintain tactical flying units in state of readiness in order to defend the northeast United States while initially continuing to operate the MDC. Beginning on 1 July 1958, it began operations of a SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) Direction Center DC-09 at Gunter AFB, Alabama. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, MoADS was the forward command center for Continental Air Defense Command, remaining on heightened alert for 36 days as part of Task Force 32. This period of constant alert was the longest alert period for any organization during the Cold WarNORAD/CONAD Participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis, Historical Reference Paper No. 8, Directorate of Command History Continental Air Defense Command, Ent AFB, CO, 1 Feb 63 (Top Secret NOFORN declassified 9 March 1996), pp. 15-16 On 1 April 1966, MoADS was inactivated, as were the other 22 sectors in the country. Most of its assets were assumed by the 32d Air Division; the 33d Air Division assumed assets in eastern North and South Carolina. The DC-09 SAGE Direction Center was assigned to the 32d Air Division, remaining in operation until 31 December 1969. Today it is used as offices by Air University, Air Education and Training Command at Gunter AFB. Modern era On 1 July 1987, the Montgomery Air Defense Sector (MOADS) was reactivated, and co-located with the 23d Air Division. The 23d Air Division was inactivated and all atmospheric defense assets of the Division were transferred to the MOADS, re-designated the Southeast Air Defense Sector (SEADS). SEADS was responsible for the atmospheric defense of approximately of airspace and of coastline extending from Virginia to Texas. It was the busiest of the air defense sectors comprising the NORAD Continental United States North American Aerospace Defense Command Region. It operated a Sector Operations Control Center (SOCC) at Tyndall AFB, part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) which had replaced SAGE in 1983. This system, using the latest advances in computerized airspace control, relied on digitized radar inputs from Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) sites jointly operated by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force, and tethered aerostat radar balloons. More than 2,000 aircraft were detected and identified each day by SEADS technicians and operators. On 1 October 1995, the Southeast Air Defense Sector was reassigned to the Florida Air National Guard; SEADS re- designated Southeast Air Defense Sector (ANG). It came under the Continental NORAD Region (CONR) Headquarters at Tyndall AFB, Florida. On 1 November 2005, SEADS ceased air defense operations and its duties were absorbed into the Northeast Air Defense Sector which is now known as the Eastern Air Defense Sector. The SEADS transformed into the 601st Air and Space Operations Center and currently performs the duties as the Air Operations Center for AFNORTH. Known Air National Guard units with an air defense mission under EADS were: * 187th Fighter Wing (F-16), Alabama ANG, Montgomery, Alabama * 125th Fighter Wing (F-15), Florida ANG, Jacksonville, Florida * 183d Fighter Wing (F-16), Illinois ANG, Springfield, Illinois * 159th Fighter Wing, (F-15), Louisiana ANG, New Orleans, Louisiana * 169th Fighter Wing (F-16), South Carolina ANG, Eastover, South Carolina Lineage * Designated as Montgomery Air Defense Sector and organized on 8 September 1957 : Discontinued on 1 April 1966 * Redesignated as Southeast Air Defense Sector and activated on 1 July 1987 : Inactivated on 1 November 2005  Assignments  * 35th Air Division, 8 September 1957 * 32d Air Division, 15 November 1958 * 26th Air Division, 1 July 1963 * 73d Air Division, 1 October 1964 - 1 April 1966 * 23d Air Division, 1 July 1987 * Florida Air National Guard, 1 October 1996 - 1 November 2005  Stations  * Gunter AFB, Alabama, 8 September 1957 - 1 April 1966 * Tyndall AFB, Florida, 1 July 1987 - 1 November 2005 ComponentsWing= * 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) : Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #9, Florida, 1 October 1959 - 1 July 1962Cornett & Johnson, p. 67 = Interceptor Squadrons= * 48th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron : Langley AFB, Virginia, 1987-1991 * 319th Fighter Interceptor Training Squadron : Homestead AFB, Florida, 1 March 1963 - 1 April 1966 * 482d Fighter- Interceptor Squadron : Seymour-Johnson AFB, North Carolina, 1 July 1965 - 1 April 1966 =Missile Squadron= * 4751st Air Defense Squadron (Missile) : Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #9, Florida, 1 July 1962 - 1 July 1963 =Radar Squadrons= * 609th Radar Squadron (SAGE) : Eufaula AFS, Alabama, 1 November 1959 - 1 April 1966Cornett & Johnson, p. 154 * 627th Radar Squadron (SAGE) : Crystal Springs AFS, Mississippi, 1 November 1959 - 1 April 1966 * 644th Radar Squadron (SAGE) : Homestead AFB, Florida, 25 April 1960 - 1 April 1966Cornett & Johnson, p. 155 * 657th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron (later 657th Radar Squadron (SAGE)) : Houma AFS, Louisiana, 1 November 1959 - 1 April 1966Cornett & Johnson, p. 157 * 660th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron (later 660th Radar Squadron (SAGE)) : MacDill AFB, Florida, 1 November 1959 - 1 April 1966 * 678th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron (later 678th Radar Squadron (SAGE)) : Tyndall AFB, Florida, 1 November 1959 - 1 April 1966Cornett & Johnson, p. 159-160 * 679th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron (later 679th Radar Squadron (SAGE)) : NAS Jacksonville, Florida, 1 July 1961 - 1 April 1966Cornett & Johnson, p. 160 * 691st Radar Squadron (SAGE) : Cross City AFS, Florida, 1 November 1959 - 1 April 1966Cornett & Johnson, p. 161 * 693d Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron (later 693d Radar Squadron (SAGE)) : Dauphin Island AFS, Alabama, 1 November 1959 - 1 April 1966 * 698th Radar Squadron (SAGE) : Thomasville AFS, Alabama, 1 November 1959 - 1 April 1966 * 702d Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron (later 702d Radar Squadron (SAGE)) : Hunter AFB, Georgia, 1 July 1961 - 1 April 1966Cornett & Johnson, p. 162 * 861st Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron (later 861st Radar Squadron (SAGE)) : Aiken AFS, South Carolina, 1 July 1961 - 1 April 1966Cornett & Johnson, p. 172 * 908th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron (later 908th Radar Squadron (SAGE)) : Marietta AFS, Georgia, 1 July 1961 - 1 April 1966 See also * List of MAJCOM wings of the United States Air Force * List of USAF Aerospace Defense Command General Surveillance Radar Stations * Aerospace Defense Command Fighter Squadrons * Alaskan Air Defense Sector (176th Air Control Squadron) * Hawaii Region Air Operations Center (169th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron) * North American Aerospace Defense Command * Western Air Defense Sector * Eastern Air Defense Sector * Southwest Air Defense Sector References=NotesBibliography  NORAD/CONAD Participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis, Historical Reference Paper No. 8, Directorate of Command History Continental Air Defense Command, Ent AFB, CO, 1 Feb 63 (Top Secret NOFORN declassified 9 March 1996) Further reading  McMullen, Richard F.

It is set during the Great Depression in Monterey, California, on a street lined with sardine canneries that is known as Cannery Row. The story revolves around the people living there: Lee Chong, the local grocer; Doc, a marine biologist; and Mack, the leader of a group of derelict people. The actual location Steinbeck was writing about, Ocean View Avenue in Monterey, was later renamed \\"Cannery Row\\" in honor of the book. A film version was released in 1982 and a stage version was produced in 1995. Plot Cannery Row has a simple premise: Mack and his friends are trying to do something nice for their friend Doc, who has been good to them without asking for reward. Mack hits on the idea that they should throw a thank-you party, and the entire community quickly becomes involved. Unfortunately, the party rages out of control, and Doc's lab and home are ruined‚Äîand so is Doc's mood. In an effort to return to Doc's good graces, Mack and the boys decide to throw another party‚Äîbut make it work this time. A procession of linked vignettes describes the denizens' lives on Cannery Row. These constitute subplots that unfold concurrently with the main plot. Steinbeck revisited these characters and this milieu nine years later in his novel Sweet Thursday.  Characters = Lee Chong  Lee Chong is the shrewd Chinese owner and operator of the neighborhood grocery store known as \\"Lee Chong's Heavenly Flower Grocery\\". \\"The grocery opened at dawn and did not close until the last wandering vagrant dime had been spent or retired for the night. Not that Lee Chong was avaricious. He wasn't, but if one wanted to spend money, he was available.\\" \\"No one is really sure whether Lee ever receives any of the money he is owed or if his wealth consisted entirely of unpaid debts, but he lives comfortably and does legitimate business.\\"  Doc  Ed Ricketts's lab at 800 Cannery Row, Monterey, which was the basis for Doc's marine Lab Doc is a marine biologist who studies and collects sea creatures from all along the California coast. Most of these creatures are preserved in some way and are sent all over the country to universities, laboratories, and museums. \\"You can order anything living from Western Biological, and sooner or later you will get it.\\" Doc is described as \\"deceptively small\\" with great strength and the potential for passionate anger. He wears a beard, very strange and unpopular at the time, and has great charisma. \\"Doc tips his hat to dogs as he drives by and the dogs look up and smile at him.\\" Doc is also the smartest man in Cannery Row, interested in knowing something about everything. \\"Doc would listen to any kind of nonsense and change it for you to a kind of wisdom. His mind had no horizon,\\" Steinbeck wrote. \\"Everyone who knew him was indebted to him. And everyone who thought of him thought next, 'I really must do something nice for Doc.'\\" The character of Doc is based on Steinbeck's friend Ed Ricketts, to whom he also dedicated the novel. Ricketts was a noted marine biologist and the one who got Steinbeck interested in the subject. Doc's Western Biological Laboratory is a reference to Ricketts's real Pacific Biological Laboratories, which stood at 800 Cannery Row from 1928 to 1948.  Dora Flood  Owner and operator of the Bear Flag Restaurant, Dora possesses a keen business mind as well as a strong spirit. Despite the fact that she runs a whorehouse, she has certain standards - selling no hard liquor, keeping an honest price on the services of the house, and allowing no vulgarity to be spoken on the premises. Dora is also kind to those who have helped her, never turning out a girl too old or infirm to work: \\"Some of them don't turn three tricks a month, but they go right on eating three meals a day.\\" Being an illegal operation, Dora has to be \\"twice as law abiding\\" and \\"twice as philanthropic\\" as anyone else in Cannery Row. When the general donation for a policeman's ball is a dollar, Dora is asked for and gives 50. \\"With everything else it is the same, Red Cross, Community Chest, Boy Scouts, Dora's unsung, unpublicized dirty wages of sin lead the list of donations.\\" During the darkest days of the Great Depression, Dora paid people's grocery bills and fed their children, very nearly going broke in the process. Dora runs a business that plays an important role in Cannery Row's society. Dora is debatably the most successful character in the book.  Mack  Mack, a 48-year-old man, described as \\"the elder, leader, mentor, and to a small extent exploiter of a little group of men who had in common no families, no money, and no ambitions beyond food, drink, and contentment. But where as most men in their search for contentment destroy themselves and fall wearily short of their targets, Mack and his friends approached contentment casually, quietly, and absorbed it gently.\\" Mack has few compunctions about lying, stealing, or swindling, but his intentions are generally good, so he is able to justify his actions and those of his friends as means to an end. It is said he is highly intelligent and \\"could be President if he wanted to be\\". He and his group of friends are known to all as \\"Mack and the boys\\" and spend a great deal of their time in an abandoned storage shed they christen \\"The Palace Flophouse and Grill\\".  Hazel  Hazel is a dim but good, strong and loyal young man living with Mack and the boys in the Palace Flophouse. His name is feminine because his mother was tired when he was born (the eighth child in seven years) and named the baby after an aunt who was rumored to have life insurance. When she realized that Hazel was a boy she had already gotten used to the name and never changed it. Hazel \\"did four years of grammar school, four years of reform school, and didn't learn anything in either place.\\" Hazel loves to listen to people's conversations and remembers everything he is told but can make sense of hardly any of it.  Eddie  Another resident of the Palace, Eddie is a part-time bartender who supplies the boys with \\"hooch\\" poured off from whatever patrons leave in their glasses at Ida's Bar. \\"He kept a gallon jug under the bar and in the mouth of the jar was a funnel. Anything left in the glasses Eddie poured into the funnel before he washed the glasses... The resulting punch he took back to the Palace was always interesting and sometimes surprising. The mixture of rye beer, bourbon, scotch, wine, rum and gin was fairly constant, but now and then some effete customer would order a stinger or an anisette or a cura√ßao and these little touches gave a distinct character to the punch.\\"  Chinaman  The enigmatic figure of \\"The Chinaman\\" appears in the story several times. He walks quietly through the town, usually while the narrator is himself on the way down to the ocean. The Chinaman's association with the eternal sea reminds one that the fast-paced and hilarious adventures of the Cannery Row characters are merely ripples in the vast sweep of human experience.  Locations  Cannery Row is the living backdrop for the book. As described in the opening paragraph: \\"Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses. Its inhabitants are, as the man once said, 'whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches,' by which he meant Everybody. Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, 'Saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,' and he would have meant the same thing.\\"  Lee Chong's Grocery  Lee Chong's is the first location we are introduced to in the novel, the hub of commerce in Cannery Row. Lee Chong's store is truly a \\"general store\\" in which you could buy, \\"clothes, food both fresh and canned, liquor, tobacco, fishing equipment, machinery, boats, cordage, caps, pork chops. You could buy at Lee Chong's a pair of slippers, a silk kimono, a quarter pint of whiskey and a cigar. You could work out combinations to fit almost any mood.\\" Almost everyone in the area owes money to Lee Chong, but he is generous with his debtors because he has found they will usually pay him back rather than make the long trek to the next nearest store over in New Monterey.  The Palace Flophouse and Grill  Home to Mack and the boys, the house was originally a storage shed for fish meal and was given to Lee Chong to clear a debt. Mack convinces Lee Chong that letting him and boys move in will keep it safe from vandals and arsonists (an implicit threat). To save face, Lee asks Mack for five dollars a week in rent (all the while knowing he will never see a dime of it). Lee figures that if Mack and the boys ever had any money they would spend it at his place and would have very little reason to steal from him, as he had the right to evict them at any time. \\"The saving to Lee Chong in cans of beans and tomatoes and milk and watermelons more than paid the rent. And if there was a sudden and increased leakage among the groceries in New Monterey that was none of Lee Chong's affair.\\" As the weeks go on furniture and paint and other niceties begin appearing in the Palace, and, piece by piece, it becomes a home to Mack and the boys and their adopted pointer dog, Darling.  The Bear Flag Restaurant  The Bear Flag is the local whorehouse, owned and operated by Dora Flood. It is described as, \\"A decent, clean, honest, old-fashioned sporting house where a man can take a glass of beer among friends... a sturdy, virtuous club,\\" where profanity and hard liquor are not allowed. The Bear Flag is respected (if not liked) by the residents of Cannery Row because many of them depend on it. When a sickness spreads through Cannery Row, it is the girls of the Bear Flag who go delivering soup and company to the sick while they recuperate, and on the list of generous donors to local charities or events, the Bear Flag is always at the top.  Western Biological Laboratories  Doc's home and office, the lab is a place where all kinds of living things are kept and preserved (e.g., live octopuses, rattlesnakes, starfish). Doc makes frequent trips up and down the California coast to collect specimens from the ocean and sells them for dissection or observation at labs, museums, and universities all across the country. Doc also has a library's worth of books and records and an old phonograph player. Scattered around the walls are reproductions of great works of art, \\".....pinned here and there at eye level so you could look at them if you want to.\\" Doc loves his records; each song evokes a different emotion in him. Doc is also known to bring a girl home from time to time, though these flings never seem to last. La Jolla Doc goes on a trip to collect octopuses from the tide pools in La Jolla, California. Major ideas = Camaraderie  Mack and the boys work together to plan a party for Doc. After a failed first attempt, where Doc is not even present, their second attempt is more successful. Their transformation into an organised group in order to do something nice for Doc shows the value of comradeship and sociality.  Contentment  Mack and the boys at the Palace Flophouse need little and appreciate much, and whatever they do need they acquire by cunning and oftentimes stealing. Doc is happy with his station in life and in the community (but many worry about his being lonely without a companion). Lee Chong could very easily go after the people in Cannery Row and collect on the debts he is owed, but he chooses instead to let the money come back to him gradually. \\"Henri the painter\\" is happy building his ever-changing boat and will continually dismantle it and start again so that he can continue building it. Cannery Row is content because its denizens are not ambitious to be anything other than who they are: their sole ambition is to better befriend Doc.  Prostitutes  Steinbeck expresses a certain respect for prostitution for its honesty of motives, while reserving moral judgment for the reader. In Of Mice and Men (1937), George has a small monologue in which he states that a man can go into a whorehouse and get a beer and sex for a price agreed upon up front - unlike less professional relationships, you know what you're going to get and what you will have to pay for it. The same theme of respect is expressed in Cannery Row in Steinbeck's descriptions of the Bear Flag: prostitution is a business that provides a service in demand, it is run cleanly and honestly, and it benefits the community. Overcoming superficial views of people Throughout the story characters such as Dora Flood, Mack, and Doc are all expanded upon, and they reveal that they are much more complicated than they at first appear to be. For example, Dora Flood owns the brothel and is disliked by the townswomen because of her business, but she is very generous and for two years donates groceries to hungry people. Doc, who is a loved and respected member of society, is, deep down, a very sad and lonely person who, until the end of the story, never opens up to other people. Nostalgia The novel opens with the words: \\"Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream.\\" Author John Steinbeck spent some of the happiest years of his life in a house in Pacific Grove near \\"Cannery Row\\" and the laboratory of his friend, Ed Ricketts. This began in 1930 and lasted to 1941, when Steinbeck's marriage failed, and he fled eastward to marry again (eventually). After a traumatic time documenting the war in the Mediterranean campaign in 1943, Steinbeck returned home to find that his second marriage was also in difficulties. He wrote Cannery Row in 1944 in an attempt to recover a Depression era world in Monterey which was, by then, already inaccessible to Steinbeck. Major influences for this change included the war's effect on both Steinbeck and Monterey, the breakup of Steinbeck's first marriage, and the insulation caused by Steinbeck's new wealth arising from his increasing fame and success as a writer. Steinbeck was already beginning to suspect that he would never again be able to go back to living in this, his favorite part of California. Indeed, after a failed attempt to live in California in the late 1940s, he left to spend the rest of his life in New York. Sweet Thursday Steinbeck later wrote a sequel released in 1954 called Sweet Thursday, in which several new characters are introduced and Doc finds love, with the active help of his friends. The film version of Cannery Row incorporates elements from both books. Rodgers and Hammerstein adapted Sweet Thursday into a Broadway Musical Pipe Dream. Because the pair were uncomfortable with the idea of their main character being a prostitute, she was turned into a free-lance nurse. Although the show ran for seven months, it still lost money. Still, the score is remembered fondly by many. Adaptations=Film A film version was released in 1982, starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger. The screenplay was written by David S. Ward, whose other screenplay credits include The Sting and Major League. Stage In 1994, the Western Stage in Salinas, California, commissioned J. R. Hall to do a stage adaptation of the novel to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its publication. A year later, it was produced as part of the National Steinbeck Festival. Subsequently, it was revived by the Western Stage in 2005, by the Community College of Allegheny County in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2007, and by The City Theatre of Sacramento, CA in 2014.  In popular culture  *The musician Will Oldham who began his career under the name Palace Flophouse, which was later changed to Palace and Palace Brothers, got the inspiration for his early monikers by reading Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday. *The titles of the 1950 Tweety Bird cartoon Canary Row and the 1967 Tom and Jerry cartoon short Cannery Rodent are plays on words of this book's name. *In the South Park episode, \\"Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?\\", the two-year-old Ike Broflovski is reading Cannery Row with his parents, who then compliment him on reading two of Steinbeck's books in one day. *On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Cannery Row on its list of the 100 most influential novels. *The Bob Dylan song Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands contains the line: \\"With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row\\".

It is located 22 km southwest of San Pedro Pochutla on coastal Highway 200. Mazunte is located some 10 km to the west of Puerto √Ångel and just about 1 km from San Agustinillo and 264 km south of the capital of Oaxaca. There are two etymologies for the name. Some sources state that ‚ÄúMazunte‚Äù is derived from a Nahuatl phrase, ‚Äúmaxotetia‚Äù which means ‚Äúplease deposit eggs here.‚Äù However, older residents of the community state that it is from the word ‚Äúmizontle,‚Äù used by locals to refer to a crab species that used to be very abundant in the area. Mazunte is famous for sea turtles. Before the mid 20th century, it had nearly no human population, but that changed when a market for sea turtle meat and eggs developed. Due to the many turtles that come to Mazunte to lay eggs, by the 1970s, Mazunte was the center of sea turtle hunting in Mexico, with its own slaughterhouse. Concern over the declining number of sea turtles eventually led to an absolute ban on turtle meat and eggs in Mexico, and deprived most families in Mazunte of their main source of income. To replace it, ecotourism based on the conservation of turtles and natural cosmetics developed. The main attractions of Mazunte today are the Mexican National Turtle Center and the Cosm√©ticos Naturales de Mazunte. In 2012, Mazunte was heavily damaged by Hurricane Carlotta. History A Map of Mazunte Up until the middle of the 20th century, very few people lived in this area as it was isolated and inaccessible. Only about two or three homes belonging to families who made a living by subsistence fishing and agriculture were here. The population began to rise with the establishment of sea turtle hunting, which began in nearby San Agustinillo. In the 1970s a turtle slaughterhouse was built in Mazunte, making the area the center of sea turtle exploitation, and the town became almost wholly dependent on the trade of turtle meat and eggs, the latter considered to be an aphrodisiac. Legally about 30,000 animals a year were butchered, but some environmentalists believe the illegal take may have been more than twice that. The idea of ecotourism based on sea turtles began in the 1970s when a company called the Pesquera Industrial Oaxaca, became concerned with the over exploitation of sea turtles and proposed an industry based on the raising and release of turtles as well as the monitoring of the commercial capture. They founded a center which was taken over in 1985 by the Institiuto Nacional de la Pesca, naming it after Daniel Le√≥n de Guevara. In 1971, Mexico banned egg collection, but this prohibition was mostly ignored. By 1988, the number of nests here dropped to 100,000 from an earlier average of 900,000. After the moratorium on sea turtles, nest number quickly rose again. The trade in turtle meat and eggs was banned by the Mexican federal government in 1990 causing most families to lose the primary source of income. Government and private organizations stepped in to provide alternatives. The federal government established the Mexican National Turtle Center (Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga) as the center of an effort to promote sea turtles as a base for tourism. The community was also assisted by an environmental group known as Ecosolar in Mexico City and developed plans to educate about the environment, reforestation, and ecotourism. By the end of 1993, these groups along with Accion Forestal Tropical planted about 6,000 trees, and bungalows for guests made from traditional materials, such as palm fronds and adobe, were built. These bungalows originally were built adjacent to family homes, with guests sharing in family meals, and accompanying fishermen out to sea. In 1993, Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop, was invited to visit Mazunte. Impressed with efforts here, an agreement was reached to distribute cosmetics made here with local ingredients. This effort also resulted in the creation of Cosm√©ticos Naturales de Mazunte, a cooperative of fifteen families that produce and sell their own line of cosmetics in 1996. The community has declared itself a \\"Reserva Econ√≥mica Ecol√≥gica Campesina\\" (Peasant Ecological Economic Reserve) as it has stopped hunting turtles and their eggs and work towards preserving them. The number of turtle nests increased from 60,000 in 1988 to nearly 700,000 in 1995 and the number continues to rise. In 1997, Mazunte was devastated by Hurricanes Pauline and Rick, which caused widespread destruction and economic collapse. Almost everything built here was destroyed. To rebuild tourism, annual events such as the Spring Equinox Festival, The International Dance Festival and the Jazz Encounter were founded, which are the largest of their kind in Oaxaca. Since the ban and the change in economy, household income has improved by an average of 17%. Before many residences had no running water, electricity, schools or health centers, which exist now. Now there is universal running water, three schools and a wider variety in diet. Land prices have risen as well as rents. The community Main street of Mazunte Mazunte is a small village wedged between a wide, one km long beach and the Sierra Madre del Sur. Parallel to the beach is the Avenida Paseo del Mazunte, the main street, which connects the village with others nearby. The area has mostly deciduous trees which drop leaves in the dry season. About twenty different species can be found here as well as a number of cactus and mangroves. It is still mostly a rural village, with mornings filling with the sound of roosters crowing. The village is somewhat larger than San Agustinillo, but the main distinction is that its architecture is based on the use of natural materials. Mazunte has building codes that stipulate that all constructions must blend with already existent structures. The community has strict rules about how, where and what to build in the community. Part of the reason for this is to discourage land speculation and over development. Building palapa roof with palm fronds Guido Rocco is simply called ‚Äúthe Italian‚Äù or ‚Äúthe architect‚Äù and is well known and respected for building many of the eco-friendly cabins and other buildings here, which he calls ‚Äúbio-architecture.‚Äù These structures consists mostly of palm fronds, adobe, bamboo, shells stones coconut shells and wood, designed to blend in with the landscape. He arrived in Mazunte in the late 1980s and has remained since. He and his family first arrived in the 1970s as visitors when there were no roads and Mazunte was accessible only by boat. Other Italians have immigrated to Mazunte and other towns along this stretch of coast. Their presence is most easily seen in the Italian restaurants that have been established, some of which offer pizza cooked in a wood-fired oven. Cosm√©ticos Naturales de Mazunte is a community enterprise dedicated to making high quality make-up that is 100% environmentally friendly. This began a decade ago with the sponsorship of British company The Body Shop, and the Mexican federal government. This and other projects were also supported by non-governmental agencies such as the embassies of Canada, France and England as well as universities such as Stanford, National Polytechnic Institute and National Autonomous University of Mexico, which helped with industrial design, knowledge of local products and cosmetics making. The cooperative produces shampoo, conditioner, bath gels, soap and other items and is a tourist attraction as well, with tour busses parking in front to let visitors see how the cooperative works and to shop. The cooperative has the slogan of ‚Äúel milagro de Mazunte‚Äù (the miracle of Mazunte). The Mazunte Jazz Festival was begun in 2005 and is held annually. It is one of the largest in Oaxaca state. The 2009 Jazz festival included artists such as Kati Mej√≠a of the U.S., Samuel Pi√±a of Tabasco state, the Adrian Oropeza Trio, the Jazz Oaxaca Big Band as well as Flamenco guitarist David Jenkins. The annual Fiesta de Mazunte, held in January, includes events such as floats, a Miss Bikini contest and a needlefish fishing contest. Public transportation in Mazunte is based on pick up trucks that have been outfitted to carry passengers as well as cargo. These ‚Äúcamionetas‚Äù connect Mazunte with nearby La Ventanilla to the west, and San Agustinillo, Zipolite, Puerto Angel and the city of Pochutla eastward. The beaches View of Mazunte beach from Punta Cometa Mazunte is a stretch of beach with a secluded cove on the far west end. Boats on this beach offer tours to Zipolite, Puerto √Ångel, Estacahuite, La Mina and La Boquilla. Depending on the season, it is possible to see whales, dolphins, sea turtles, manta rays and other aquatic species. Rentals for sports fishing are also available. The main beach and the cove on the west end both have a number of small hotels and restaurants. All beaches have lifeguards during the tourist seasons. There are two other secluded and non-developed beaches in the area, Playa Mermejita on Punta Cometa and Playa Escobilla just west of the principle beaches. All but one of the marine turtles come to the Mazunte area to lay their eggs, as well as a few land and freshwater turtle species. The Pacific coast town of Mazunte is famous for its sea turtles. Thousands of olive ridley sea turtles arrive en masse to lay their eggs in nearby Escobilla Bay. The nesting season generally begins in May and lasts for several months. Although an endangered species, the turtles come to the beach in large numbers for a few nights after a full moon. These events are called arribadas. Other turtles that lay eggs here are the Hawksbill turtle, the ‚Äúprieta‚Äù (a subspecies of green turtle), and some leatherback turtles. In 1997, The Centro Mexicano de Tortuga counted the arrival of about 900,000 sea turtles to La Escobilla beach alone. Volunteers from the Center monitor nesting areas in and around Mazunte. When females come onto the beaches at night, generally just after a full moon, they are measured, tagged and their eggs collected for incubation at the Center. The process ends with the liberation of the hatchlings from the same beaches they were collected from. On many of these occasions, the public may participate in the freeing of the hatchlings. National Mexican Turtle Center Hawksbill turtle in the aquarium of the Center The idea of promoting sea turtles as an ecotourism base began in the 1970s when the hunting of sea turtles in Mazunte and other nearby seaside communities was at its height. An organization to promote the idea was founded at that time, which became a small center in 1985, operated by the Instituto Nacional de la Pesca (National Fishing Institute) and named Daniel Le√≥n de Guevara. The modern Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga (Mexican National Turtle Center) was founded by the federal government in 1991 after the sea turtle trade was completely banned in the country. The Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga is an aquarium and research center dedicated to turtles, especially sea turtles. The installation covers four hectares located in Mazunte right next to the beach, near where the sea turtle slaughterhouse used to be. The Center contains specimens of all marine turtles native to Mexico as well as six species of fresh water and two species of land turtles also found in the country. It contains tanks and other habitats in which a variety of turtle species can be seen. The buildings on the site are designed to be similar to those around it, both traditional and modern. Outdoor tanks hold turtle species of different ages and include both natural and artificial incubators for turtle eggs. The installation also contains a multipurpose room, gift shop and a cactus garden. Research objectives include developing techniques to manage, increase and preserve the turtle species of the country as well as promoting knowledge and ecological tourism based on turtles. This facility receives 60,000 visitors a year. Punta Cometa Tip of Punta Cometa jutting into the Pacific Ocean The far west end of Mazunte beach is bordered by Punta Cometa (Comet Point), which is a small peninsula or mountain that juts out from the shoreline. Punta Cometa is also called Cerro Sagrado or ‚ÄúSacred Hill‚Äù. It is the southernmost point of the state of Oaxaca and an important stopping place for migratory birds and marine mammals such as whales. There is also a small virgin beach called Mermejita on the west side. In pre-Hispanic times this area was a military enclave of the Aztecs, who constructed a small wall around Punta Cometa, the remains of which are locally called the ‚Äúcorral de piedra‚Äù or stone corral. During the colonial period, the area was a stronghold for both Spanish forces and pirates who used Punta Cometa's location to survey the seas at 180 degrees of visibility. There are also stories about Aztec and or pirate treasure hidden at Punta Cometa.

Names, abbreviations, and technical terms are most often cited as being affected by the issue. The problem arises since computers can easily identify strings of text within a document, but interpreting words of this kind requires considerable ability to interpret a wide range of contexts, possibly across many cultures, which is an extremely difficult task. As a result, broad blocking rules may result in false positives affecting innocent phrases.  Origin and history  The problem was named after an incident in 1996 in which AOL's profanity filter prevented residents of the town of Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, England, from creating accounts with AOL, because the town's name contains the substring \\"cunt\\". In the early 2000s Google's opt-in SafeSearch filters apparently made the same mistake, preventing people from searching for local businesses or URLs that included Scunthorpe in their names.  Other examples  Mistaken decisions by obscenity filters include:  Refused web domain names and account registrations  * In April 1998, Jeff Gold attempted to register the domain name \`shitakemushrooms.com\`, but due to the substring shit he was blocked by an InterNIC filter prohibiting the \\"seven dirty words\\" which was active between 1996 and the transfer of control to ICANN in 1998. (Shitake is from the Japanese name for the edible fungus Lentinula edodes.) * In 2000, a Canadian television news story on web filtering software found that the website for the Montreal Urban Community (Communaut√© urbaine de Montr√©al, in French) was entirely blocked because its domain name was its French acronym CUM (www.cum.qc.ca); \\"cum\\" (among other meanings) is English-language slang for semen. * In February 2004 in Scotland, Craig Cockburn reported that he was unable to use his surname (pronounced \\"Coburn\\") with Hotmail. Separately he had problems with his workplace email because his job title, software specialist, contained the substring Cialis, an erectile dysfunction medication commonly included in spam e-mails. Hotmail initially told him to spell his name C0ckburn (with a zero instead of the letter \\"o\\"), but later reversed the ban. In 2010 he had a similar problem registering on the BBC website, where again the first four characters of his surname caused a problem for the content filter. * In February 2006, Linda Callahan was initially prevented from registering her name with Yahoo! as an e-mail address as it contained the substring Allah. Yahoo! later reversed the ban. * In July 2008, Dr. Herman I. Libshitz could not register an e-mail address containing his name from Verizon because his surname contained the substring shit, and Verizon initially rejected his request for an exception. In a subsequent statement, a Verizon spokeswoman apologized for not approving his desired e-mail address. * In August 2018, Natalie Weiner reported on social media that she was unable to create an account for herself on a website, because her last name is also a word used as slang for penis. It was reported that \\"hundreds\\" of people replied saying this also affected them as well. Names of those replying included Ben Schmuck (last name is a Yiddish word for \\"penis\\"), and Arun Dikshit (last name is Sanskrit for one who teaches or provides knowledge, containing the substring shit). Articles covering this stated that it was a common and extremely difficult technical problem for which no robust solution was currently available.

Maynard at the height of the Golden Age of Piracy The Golden Age of Piracy is a common designation for the period between the 1650s and the 1730s, when maritime piracy was a significant factor in the histories of the Caribbean, the United Kingdom, Indian Ocean states, North America, and West Africa. Histories of piracy often subdivide the Golden Age of Piracy into three periods: # The buccaneering period (approximately 1650 to 1680), characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies, and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. # The Pirate Round (1690s), associated with long-distance voyages from the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. # The post-Spanish Succession period (1716 to 1726), when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the North American eastern seaboard, and the West African coast. Narrower definitions of the Golden Age sometimes exclude the first or second periods, but most include at least some portion of the third. The modern conception of pirates as depicted in popular culture is derived largely, although not always accurately, from the Golden Age of Piracy. Factors contributing to piracy during the Golden Age included the rise in quantities of valuable cargoes being shipped to Europe over vast ocean areas, reduced European navies in certain regions, the training and experience that many sailors had gained in European navies (particularly the Royal Navy), and corrupt and ineffective government in European overseas colonies. The colonial powers at the time constantly fought with pirates and engaged in several notable battles and other related events. Name of the Golden Age=Origin Amaro Pargo, one of the most famous corsairs of the Golden Age of Piracy The oldest known literary mention of a \\"Golden Age\\" of piracy is from 1894, when the English journalist George Powell wrote about \\"what appears to have been the golden age of piracy up to the last decade of the 17th century.\\"George Powell, \\"A Pirate's Paradise,\\" in The Gentleman's Magazine, vol. CCLXXVI, N.S. 52, Jan- June 1894, p. 23. Powell uses the phrase while reviewing Charles Leslie's A New and Exact History of Jamaica, then over 150 years old. Powell uses the phrase only once. In 1897, a more systematic use of the phrase \\"Golden Age of Piracy\\" was introduced by historian John Fiske, who wrote, \\"At no other time in the world's history has the business of piracy thriven so greatly as in the seventeenth century and the first part of the eighteenth. Its golden age may be said to have extended from about 1650 to about 1720.\\"John Fiske, 1897, Old Virginia and Her Neighbors, p. 338. Fiske included the activities of the Barbary corsairs and East Asian pirates in this \\"Golden Age,\\" noting that \\"as these Mussulman pirates and those of Eastern Asia were as busily at work in the seventeenth century as at any other time, their case does not impair my statement that the age of the buccaneers was the Golden Age of piracy.\\"Fiske, p. 339. Pirate historians of the first half of the 20th century occasionally adopted Fiske's term \\"Golden Age,\\" without necessarily following his beginning and ending dates for it.R.D.W. Connor, 1909, Cornelius Harnett: An Essay in North Carolina History, P. 10; Francis Hodges Cooper, 1916, \\"Some Colonial History of Beaufort County, North Carolina,\\" in James Sprunt Studies in History and Political Science, v. 14, no. 2, p. 32. The most expansive definition of an age of piracy was that of Patrick Pringle, who wrote in 1951 that \\"the most flourishing era in the history of piracy ... began in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and ended in the second decade of the eighteenth century.\\"Patrick Pringle, 1951, Jolly Roger: The Story of the Great Age of Piracy, p. 9 of the 2001 edition. This idea starkly contradicted Fiske, who had hotly denied that such Elizabethan figures as Drake were pirates.Fiske, p. 341-42. Trend toward narrow definitions Of recent definitions, Pringle appears to have the widest range, an exception to an overall trend among historians from 1909 until the 1990s, toward narrowing the Golden Age. As early as 1924, Philip Gosse described piracy as being at its height \\"from 1680 until 1730.\\" In his highly popular 1978 book The Pirates for TimeLife's The Seafarers series, Douglas Botting defined the Golden Age as lasting \\"barely 30 years, starting at the close of the 17th Century and ending in the first quarter of the 18th.\\"Douglas Botting, 1978, The Pirates, p. 20. Botting's definition was closely followed by Frank Sherry in 1986.Frank Sherry, 1986, Raiders and Rebels: The Golden Age of Piracy, P. 7. In a 1989 academic article, Professor Marcus Rediker defined the Golden Age as lasting only from 1716 to 1726.Marcus Rediker, 1989, \\"'Under the Banner of King Death': The Social World of Anglo-American Pirates 1716‚Äì1726\\", William and Mary Quarterly, ser. 3, 38 (1981), 203-227. Angus Konstam in 1998, reckoned the era as lasting from 1700 until 1730.F; Konstam, supra, p. 5. Perhaps the ultimate step in restricting the Golden Age was in Konstam's 2005 The History of Pirates, in which he retreated from his own earlier definition, called a 1690‚Äì1730 definition of the Golden Age \\"generous,\\" and concluded that \\"The worst of these pirate excesses was limited to an eight-year period, from 1714 until 1722, so the true Golden Age cannot even be called a 'golden decade.'\\"Angus Konstam, 2005, The History of Pirates, p. 96. Recent countertrend toward broader meaning David Cordingly, in his influential 1994 work Under the Black Flag, defined the \\"great age of piracy\\" as lasting from the 1650s to around 1725, very close to Fiske's definition of the Golden Age.David Cordingly, 1995, Under the Black Flag: The Romance and Reality of Life Among the Pirates, pp. xvi‚Äìxvii. Rediker, in 2004, described the most complex definition of the Golden Age to date. He proposes a \\"golden age of piracy, which spanned the period from roughly 1650 to 1730,\\" which he subdivides into three distinct \\"generations\\": the buccaneers of 1650‚Äì1680, the Indian Ocean pirates of the 1690s, and the pirates of the years 1716‚Äì1726.Marcus Rediker, 2004, Villains of All Nations, p. 8. Martin Mares, drawing on both Cordingly and Rediker, took their arguments about the periodization of the Golden Age of Piracy even further in his seminal work The British Contribution to the Development of Piracy in the Golden Age of Piracy, proposing that the longer periodization can be also understood as an uninterrupted and continuous process with its points of peaks and regressions. Besides, Mares argued that such interpretation allows us to fully understand how the golden age of piracy helped the British to develop the understanding of their imperial policy as one single domain with interconnected interests rather than separate Western and Eastern spheres of influence. This argument was later reinforced from the economical perspective by Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Arosemena. Arosemena, using the analysis of Jamaica's development from the work of Martin Mares, proposes that empirical data collected by Mares has wider implications‚Äìmost notably‚Äìlegal ones such as the recognition of ius cogens even before the Industrial Revolution in terms of unfair enrichment, since \\"it is perfectly possible to have islands of prosperity within a sea of misery. And of course, if we just sample the islands, the world will look like a paradise.\\"  History  Piracy arose out of, and mirrored on a smaller scale, the conflicts over trade and colonization among the rival European powers of the time, including the empires of Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, and France. Most of these pirates were of Welsh, English, Dutch, Irish, and French origin. Many pirates came from poorer urban areas in search of a way to make money and reprieve. London especially was known for high unemployment, crowding, and poverty which would drive people to piracy. Piracy also offered power and quick riches. Buccaneering period, c. 1650‚Äì1680 Historians, such as John Fiske, mark the beginning of the Golden Age of Piracy at around 1650, when the end of the Wars of Religion allowed European countries to resume the development of their colonial empires. This involved considerable seaborne trade and a general economic improvement: there was money to be made‚Äîor stolen‚Äîand much of it traveled by ship. French buccaneers had established themselves on northern Hispaniola as early as 1625, but lived at first mostly as hunters rather than robbers; their transition to full-time piracy was gradual and motivated in part by Spanish efforts to wipe out both the buccaneers and the prey animals on which they depended. The buccaneers' migration from Hispaniola's mainland to the more defensible offshore island of Tortuga limited their resources and accelerated their piratical raids. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, a buccaneer and historian who remains a major source on this period, the Tortuga buccaneer Pierre Le Grand pioneered the settlers' attacks on galleons making the return voyage to Spain. The growth of buccaneering on Tortuga was augmented by the English capture of Jamaica from Spain in 1655. The early English governors of Jamaica freely granted letters of marque to Tortuga buccaneers and to their own countrymen, while the growth of Port Royal provided these raiders with a far more profitable and enjoyable place to sell their booty. In the 1660s, the new French governor of Tortuga, Bertrand d'Ogeron, similarly provided privateering commissions both to his own colonists and to English cutthroats from Port Royal. These conditions brought Caribbean buccaneering to its zenith. Pirate Round, c. 1693‚Äì1700 Henry Every is shown selling his loot in this engraving by Howard Pyle. Every's capture of the Grand Mughal ship Ganj-i- Sawai in 1695 stands as one of the most profitable pirate raids ever perpetrated. A number of factors caused Anglo-American pirates, some of whom had learned how to be a pirate during the buccaneering period, to look beyond the Caribbean for treasure as the 1690s began. The fall of Britain's Stuart period had restored the traditional enmity between Britain and France, thus ending the profitable collaboration between English Jamaica and French Tortuga. The devastation of Port Royal by an earthquake in 1692 further reduced the Caribbean's attractions by destroying the pirates' chief market for fenced plunder.Nigel Cawthorne (2005), Pirates: An Illustrated History, Arturus Publishing Ltd., 2005, p. 65. Caribbean colonial governors began to discard the traditional policy of \\"no peace beyond the Line,\\" under which it was understood that war would continue (and thus letters of marque would be granted) in the Caribbean regardless of peace treaties signed in Europe; henceforth, commissions would be granted only in wartime, and their limitations would be strictly enforced. Furthermore, much of the Spanish Main had simply been exhausted; Maracaibo alone had been sacked three times between 1667 and 1678,Cawthorne, pp. 34, 36, 58 while R√≠o de la Hacha had been raided five times and Tol√∫ eight.Peter Earle (2003), The Pirate Wars, , p. 94. At the same time, England's less-favored colonies, including Bermuda, New York, and Rhode Island, had become cash-starved by the Navigation Acts. Merchants and governors eager for coin were willing to overlook and even underwrite pirate voyages; one colonial official defended a pirate because he thought it \\"very harsh to hang people that brings in gold to these provinces.\\"Earle, p. 148. Although some of these pirates operating out of New England and the Middle Colonies targeted Spain's more remote Pacific coast colonies well into the 1690s and beyond, the Indian Ocean was a richer and more tempting target. India's economic output dwarfed Europe's during this time, especially in high- value luxury goods such as silk and calico, which made ideal pirate booty;Geoffrey Parker, ed. (1986), The World: An Illustrated History, Times Books Ltd., p. 317. at the same time, no powerful navies plied the Indian Ocean, leaving both local shipping and the various East India companies' vessels vulnerable to attack. This set the stage for the famous piracies of Thomas Tew, Henry Every, Robert Culliford, and (although his guilt remains controversial) William Kidd. Post‚ÄìSpanish Succession period, c. 1715-1726 In 1713 and 1714, a series of peace treaties ended the War of the Spanish Succession. As a result, thousands of seamen, including Britain's paramilitary privateers, were relieved of military duty, at a time when cross- Atlantic colonial shipping trade was beginning to boom. In addition, Europeans who had been pushed by unemployment to become sailors and soldiers involved in slaving were often enthusiastic to abandon that profession and turn to pirating, giving pirate captains a steady pool of recruits in West African waters and coasts. In 1715, pirates launched a major raid on Spanish divers trying to recover gold from a sunken treasure galleon near Florida. The nucleus of the pirate force was a group of English ex-privateers, all of whom would soon be enshrined in infamy: Henry Jennings, Charles Vane, Samuel Bellamy of Whydah Gally fame, Benjamin Hornigold, and Edward England. The attack was successful, but contrary to their expectations, the governor of Jamaica refused to allow Jennings and their cohorts to spend their loot on his island. With Kingston and the declining Port Royal closed to them, Hornigold, Jennings, and their comrades founded a new pirate base at Nassau, on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas, which had been abandoned during the war. Until the arrival of governor Woodes Rogers three years later, Nassau would be home for these pirates and their many recruits. Shipping traffic between Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe began to soar in the 18th century, a model that was known as Triangular Transatlantic Slave Trade, and was a rich target for piracy. Trade ships sailed from Europe to the African coast, trading manufactured goods and weapons for slaves. The traders would then sail to the Caribbean to sell the slaves, and return to Europe with goods such as sugar, tobacco, and cocoa. In another triangular trade route, ships would carry raw materials, preserved cod, and rum to Europe, where a portion of the cargo would be sold for manufactured goods, which (along with the remainder of the original load) were transported to the Caribbean, where they were exchanged for sugar and molasses, which (with some manufactured articles) were borne to New England. Ships in the triangular trade made money at each stop.Mark Kurlansky, Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World. Penguin, 1998. As part of the settlement of the War of Spanish Succession, Britain obtained the asiento, a Spanish government contract to supply slaves to Spain's new world colonies, which provided British traders and smugglers more access to formerly closed Spanish markets in America. This arrangement also contributed heavily to the spread of piracy across the western Atlantic. Shipping to the colonies boomed along with the flood of skilled mariners after the war. Merchant shippers used the surplus of labor to drive wages down, cut corners to maximize profits, and create unsavory conditions aboard their vessels. Merchant sailors suffered from mortality rates as high or higher than the slaves being transported.Rediker, 2004 Living conditions were so poor that many sailors began to prefer a freer existence as a pirate. The increased volume of shipping traffic also could sustain a large body of brigands preying upon it. During this time, many of the pirates had originally been either sailors for the Royal Navy, privateersmen, or merchant seamen. Most pirates had experience living on the sea, and knew how harsh the conditions could be. Sailors for the king would often have very little to eat while out on the sea, and would end up sick, starving, and dying. That resulted in some sailors deserting the king and becoming pirates instead. This also allowed for pirates to better fight the navy. Unlike other seaman, pirates had strict rules for how they were to be treated on the ship. Unlike what many people think, captains did not have a dictatorship over the rest of the pirates on their ship. Captains had to be voted in, and there were strict rules for them to follow as well. The captain was not treated better (with more food, better living conditions, etc.) than the other members of the crew, and was to treat the crew with respect. This was because many merchant captains treated their crews terribly. Many pirates had formerly served on these merchant ships and knew how horrid some captains could be. Because of this, all ships contained councils. These councils composed of all crew members on a given ship. Some councils were used daily to make decisions while other were used as a court system. Whatever the case, these pirates had as much power as the captain outside of battle. The captain only had full authority in times of battle and could be removed from this position if he showed cowardice in the face of the enemy. He was also to be bold in battle. The pirates did not want things to end up the same way as on a navy ship.Rediker, 1981  Return of the pirate round  Between the years 1719 and 1721, Edward England, John Taylor, Olivier Levasseur, and Christopher Condent operated from Madagascar. Taylor and Levasseur reaped the greatest prize in the history of the Golden Age of Piracy, the Plunder of the Portuguese East Indiman Nossa Senhora Do Cabo at R√©union in 1721, getting diamonds and other treasures worth a total of ¬£800,000. Condent was also a successful pirate, but Edward England was not. He was marooned on Comoros by Taylor and Levasseur in 1721, and died not long afterward. Despite the success of Taylor and LaBuse, the Pirate Round quickly declined again. Edward Teach died in the battle when his last ship, the Adventure, ran aground in a fight with Lieutenant Robert Maynard's navy ship. He was allegedly stabbed twenty times and shot five times before death.  Pirates of the era  Blackbeard's severed head hanging from Maynard's bowsprit Many of the best-known pirates in historical lore originate from this Golden Age of Piracy: * \\"Black Sam\\" Bellamy, captain of the Whydah Gally, was lost in a storm off Cape Cod in 1717. Bellamy was popularly known as the \\"Robin Hood of pirates\\" and prided himself on his ideological justifications for piracy. * Stede Bonnet, a rich Barbadian land owner turned pirate solely in search of adventure. Bonnet captained a 10-gun sloop named the Revenge and raided ships off the Virginia coast in 1717. He was caught and hanged in 1718. * Henry Every, one of the few major pirate captains to retire with his loot without being arrested nor killed in battle. He is famous for capturing the fabulously wealthy Mogul ship Ganj-i-Sawai in 1695. * Olivier Levasseur, aka La Buse, the only major French pirate in Nassau who was often associated with Hornigold, Bellamy, Kennedy, and Taylor. * William Fly, whose execution in 1726 is used by historian Marcus Rediker to mark the end of the Golden Age of Pirates. * William \\"Captain\\" Kidd, executed for piracy at Execution Dock, London, in 1701, is famous for the \\"buried treasure\\" he supposedly left behind. * Edward Low, born in Westminster, was active 1721‚Äì1724, was never captured, and was notorious for torturing his victims before killing them; he would cut off ears, lips, and noses. * Henry Morgan, a buccaneer who raided the Spaniards and took Panama City before burning it to the ground. He was to be executed in England, but was instead knighted and made governor of Jamaica. He died a natural death in 1688. * John \\"Calico Jack\\" Rackham, famous for his partnership with female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read, was captured, then hanged and gibbeted outside Port Royal, Jamaica, in 1720. * Bartholomew \\"Black Bart\\" Roberts, is considered by many to be the most successful Western pirate of all time with over 400 ship captures. Known to his enemies as \\"Dread Pirate Roberts.\\" * Edward \\"Blackbeard\\" Teach (Thatch), active from 1716 to 1718, is perhaps the most notorious pirate among English-speaking nations. Blackbeard's most famous ship was the Queen Anne's Revenge, named in response to the end of Queen Anne's War. He was killed by one of Lieutenant Robert Maynard's crewmen in 1718. * Charles Vane, a particularly violent and unrepentant pirate, who served under Henry Jennings before striking out on his own. Harsh and unpopular with his crew, Vane was marooned before being captured and hanged in 1721. * Amaro Pargo, a prominent Spanish corsair that dominated the route between C√°diz and the Caribbean, his figure has been wrapped in a halo of romanticism and legend that have linked him to piracy, hidden treasures, and illicit romances. In the marble headstone of his tomb in San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna is engraved a skull winking his right eye with two crossbones.  Female pirates  The best-known female pirates were Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and Rachel Wall. Anne Bonny (1698‚Äì1782) developed a notorious reputation in Nassau. When she was unable to leave an earlier marriage, she eloped with her lover, Calico Jack Rackham. Mary Read had been dressed as a boy all her life by her mother and had spent time in the British military. She came to the West Indies (Caribbean) after leaving her husband and joined Calico Jack's crew after he attacked a ship she had been aboard. She divulged her gender only to Bonny at first, but revealed herself openly when accused by Rackham of having an affair with Bonny. The nature of the relationships between Bonny, Read, and Rackham have been speculated to be romantic and/or sexual in various combinations, though there is no definitive proof. In David Cordingly's 2001 book Women Sailors and Sailors‚Äô Women: An Untold Maritime History, Cordingly suggests that Bonny and Read were sexually involved. When their ship was attacked in 1720, Bonny, Read, and an unknown man were the only ones to defend it; the other crew members were too drunk to fight. In the end they were captured and arrested. After their capture, both women were convicted of piracy and sentenced to death, but they stalled their executions by claiming to be pregnant. Read died in jail months later, many believe of a fever or complications of childbirth. Bonny disappeared from historical documents, and no record of her execution nor a childbirth exist.  Barbary pirates or Privateers  Cornelis Hendricksz Vroom, Spanish Men-of-War Engaging Barbary Corsairs, 1615. The Barbary pirates were pirates and privateers that operated from the North African (the \\"Barbary coast\\") ports of Algiers, Morocco, Sal√©, Tripoli, and Tunis, preying on shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea from the time of the Crusades as well as on ships on their way to Asia around Africa until the early 19th century. The coastal villages and towns of Italy, Spain and Mediterranean islands were frequently attacked by them, and long stretches of the Italian and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants; since the 17th century, Barbary pirates occasionally entered the Atlantic and struck as far north as Iceland. According to Robert Davis, between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in the Arab world between the 16th and 19th centuries. Barbary pirates flourished in the early 17th century as new sailing rigs by Simon de Danser enabled North African raiders, for the first time, to brave the Atlantic as well as Mediterranean waters. More than 20,000 captives were said to be imprisoned in Algiers alone. The rich were allowed to redeem themselves, but the poor were condemned to slavery. Their masters would on occasion allow them to secure freedom by professing Islam. Many people of good social position‚ÄìGermans, Italians, Spaniards, and English travelers in the south‚Äìwere captives for a time. In 1627, Iceland was subject to raids known as the Turkish Abductions. Murat Reis is said to have taken 400 prisoners; 242 of the captives were later sold into slavery on the Barbary Coast. The pirates took only young people and those in good physical condition. All those offering resistance were killed, and the old people were gathered into a church, which was set on fire. Among those captured was √ìlafur Egilsson, who was ransomed the next year and, upon returning to Iceland, wrote a slave narrative about his experience. Another famous captive from that raid was Gu√∞r√≠√∞ur S√≠monard√≥ttir. The sack of Vestmannaeyjar is known in the history of Iceland as Tyrkjar√°ni√∞. One of the stereotypical features of a pirate in popular culture, the eye patch, dates back to the Arab pirate Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalahimah, who wore it after losing an eye in battle in the 18th century. Whilst the Golden Age of European and American pirates is generally considered to have ended between 1710 and 1730, the prosperity of the Barbary pirates continued until the early 19th century. Unlike the European powers, the young United States refused to pay tribute to the Barbary states and responded with the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War against North Africa, when the Barbary pirates captured and enslaved American sailors. Although the U.S. had only limited success in these wars, France and Great Britain, with their more powerful navies, soon followed suit and stamped out the Barbary raiders.  Buccaneers  Buccaneers operated mainly in the Caribbean. They originated in Tortuga around the 17th century as hunters, but became \\"pirates\\" when government officials would pay groups of men to attack and loot Spanish ships. After a while, however, the raids got out of control, and buccaneers began attacking any ship worth value, enemy or not.  Privateers  Privateers were not Navy, but privately owned rascals. They usually only operated in times of war and were given \\"letters of marque\\" by Admirals, which gave them authority to raid enemy ships, keeping them exempt from piracy charges. Decline By the early 18th century, tolerance for privateers was wearing thin in all nations. After the Treaty of Utrecht was signed, the excess of trained sailors without employment was both a blessing and a curse for all pirates. Initially, the surplus of men had caused the number of pirates to multiply significantly. This inevitably led to the pillaging of more ships, which put a greater strain on trade for all European nations. In response, European nations bolstered their own navies to offer greater protection for merchants and to hunt down pirates. The excess of skilled sailors meant there was a large pool that could be recruited into national navies as well. Piracy was clearly on a strong decline by 1720. The Golden Age of Piracy did not last the decade. The events of the latter half of 1718 represent a turning point in the history of piracy in the New World. Without a safe base and with growing pressure from naval forces, the rovers lost their momentum. The lure of the Spanish treasures had faded, and the hunters gradually became the hunted. By early 1719, the remaining pirates were on the run. Most of them headed for West Africa, seizing poorly defended slavers.Ieuan W. Haywood (2009) Effect on popular culture Stories and histories from the Golden Age form the foundation for many modern depictions of pirates and piracy. A General History of the Pirates (1724) by Captain Charles Johnson is the prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates of the Golden Age, providing an extensive account of the period. In giving an almost mythical status to the more colorful characters such as the notorious English pirates Blackbeard and Calico Jack, it is likely that the author used considerable license in his accounts of pirate conversations. In 2002, English naval historian David Cordingly wrote an introduction to Johnson's 1724 book, stating: \\"it has been said, and there seems no reason to question this, that Captain Johnson created the modern conception of pirates.\\" Johnson's book would influence the pirate literature of Robert Louis Stevenson and J. M. Barrie. Such literary works as Stevenson's Treasure Island and Barrie's Peter Pan, while romanticized, drew heavily on pirates and piracy for their plots. Various claims and speculation about their overall image, attire, fashion, dress code, etc. have been made and contributed to their fanciful mystery and lore. For example, men wore earrings as the value of the gold or silver earring was meant to pay for their burial if they were lost at sea and their body washed ashore. They were also worn for superstitious reasons, believing the precious metals had magical healing powers. More recently, even less accurate depictions of historical-era pirates (e.g., Talk Like a Pirate Day) have advanced to the forefront. However, these phenomena have only served to advance the romantic image of piracy and its treasure-burying swashbucklers in popular culture. ReferencesBibliography    *Moss, Jeremy (2020).

The plain stretches from the Rimrose Valley in Seaforth, near Liverpool on the Mersey, to the south, to Preston on the Ribble, to the north. To the east, the plain is bounded by the foothills of the Pennines, while the western edge of the plain is separated from the sea by sand dunes. It is very flat, and much of it is only a few metres above sea level. The terrain is mostly glacial in origin. The area has been inhabited since Neolithic times, though large areas would have been marshy and contained Martin Mere. The WWT Martin Mere near the villages of Holmeswood and Tarlscough gives a glimpse of what this area was likely to reclamation. The mere as it was before drainage of the area was the second largest body of fresh water in England, behind Windermere.Historic Maps The rivers Mersey, Alt and Ribble feed into the plain and the flood plains add to the flatness. Large areas have been reclaimed and have a distinctive pattern of rectangular fields of dark peaty soil with deep drainage ditches. It is common to find the suffix \\"Moss\\" in the names of local places. As is usual in these types of areas, the settlements tend to be on any available hill, many formed by sandstone outcrops. The land is fertile and agriculturally very productive. Vegetable crops include potatoes, carrots, cabbages, brussels sprouts and onions. The main market town for this area was Ormskirk. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal crosses the plain and, in summer, is used for irrigation, bringing water from the Pennines. The Trans Pennine Trail starts in Southport and crosses the plain following the Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway to Aintree, before continuing towards Manchester and Hull.

In philately, an invert error occurs when part of a stamp is printed upside-down. Inverts are perhaps the most spectacular of postage stamp errors, not only because of their striking visual appearance, but because some are quite rare, and highly valued by stamp collectors. Characteristics The Dag Hammarskjold invert Invert errors, or \\"inverts\\" for short, most commonly arise when producing multi-colored stamps via multiple passes through the printing press. It is all too easy for a printing plant worker to insert a half- finished sheet the wrong way around, resulting in the inverts. Such an error being so obvious, nearly all misprinted sheets are caught and destroyed before they leave the plant, and still more are caught during distribution or at the post office before being sold. A much less common situation is for the invert to be embedded into the printing plate or stone, most famously the case for the Inverted Swan of early Western Australia. An invert may be characterized as an \\"inverted center\\" or \\"inverted frame\\" when the underlying paper is watermarked or otherwise carries a basic orientation. It is possible for a single-color stamp to be inverted relative to watermark, but this is called an \\"inverted watermark\\" rather than an \\"inverted stamp\\". Depending on the positioning of stamps within their sheet, the invert may be perfectly centered (as with the Inverted Jenny), or offset. Inverted overprint on a 1919 stamp of Siberia Not all inverts are spectacular. The Dag Hammarskj√∂ld invert of 1962 consists only of a misprinted yellow layer, and it is not immediately clear that the white area is not a deliberate element of the design. Early Danish posthorn issues have an ornate frame that is almost perfectly symmetrical, and an inverted frame can be detected only by minute examination. Overprints may also be inverted. Many of these are common, since the expedient nature of many overprints means that the production process is not so carefully controlled. Rare inverts often have significant monetary worth. Inverted Jennies have long sold for over 100,000USD apiece, and the St. Lawrence Seaway inverts of Canada approach those numbers. High prices for inverts have tempted printing company employees to steal misprinted sheets from the printing plant and attempt to pass them off as genuine, as in the 1996 case of the \\"Nixon invert\\". An inverted invert In 2013 the U. S. Postal Service offered a six-stamp souvenir sheet commemorating the famous Inverted Jenny issue. These stamps replicated the famous upside-down airplane image, but did not duplicate the original 24¬¢ denomination, instead being valued at $2. To publicize this issue, the Postal Service announced that one hundred sheets bearing six non- inverted Jenny images had also been printed and were being randomly distributed, ensuring that a few fortunate customers who had ordered the normal sheet would instead receive an inverted invert of far greater value. These non-inverts began appearing in public auctions in 2014, fetching high prices.https://www.siegelauctions.com/pr/1075pr.pdf  Notable inverts = Australia  * Inverted Swan  Belgium  * Inverted Dendermonde  Canada  * St. Lawrence Seaway invert (1959) India * Inverted Head 4 Annas (1854) Jamaica * Jamaica 1sh inverted-frame error (1920) Malta Melita issue 3d with inverted overprint * Melita issue 3d inverted Postage overprint (1926) New Zealand * 4d Lake Taupo invert (1904)  US  * Pictorial Issue inverts (1869) * Pan-American inverts (1901) * Inverted Jenny (1918) * Dag Hammarskj√∂ld invert (1962) * CIA invert (1976) * Nixon invert (1996) * Savings Bank invert See also * Inverted Center Stamps of the World  References  * L.

He was a Holocaust survivor who studied the late-onset psychological trauma experienced by people who went through separation and psychological pain early in life only to show traumatic experience decades later. He devoted a long period studying posttraumatic stress disorder among Holocaust survivors, which had led Holocaust survivors including Paul Celan (1920‚Äì 1970), Primo Levi (1919‚Äì1987) and many others to commit suicide several decades after the experience. Eitinger was a pioneer of research into psychological trauma among refugees, and also laid the foundation for Norwegian military psychiatry research with emphasis on psychological trauma among soldiers. Early life Leo Eitinger was born in Lomnice, Moravia, at that time a town in the Austrian-Hungarian empire. It lies in Jihomoravsk√Ω kraj in the Czech Republic. He grew up as the youngest of six siblings in a Jewish middle class home as the son of Salomon Eitinger (1877-1942) and Helene Kurz (1885-1936). He studied medicine at the Masaryk University of Brno, graduating in 1937. He fled Nazi persecution of Jews and came to Norway as a refugee with the help of a Nansen passport (Nansenhjelpen) after the German occupation of the Czechoslovak Republic in March 1939. Upon arriving in Norway, he arranged for Jewish children to escape from Czechoslovakia to settle in the Jewish orphanage in Oslo. He was given permission to work as a resident in psychiatry in Norway in Bod√∏, but the permission was revoked by the Nazis after the German invasion of Norway in 1940. During World War II He stayed underground from January 1941 until he was arrested in March 1942. He was imprisoned in various places throughout Norway and was deported on 24 February 1943, arriving at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp. At Auschwitz, Eitinger served in the camp hospital. Towards the end of his confinement he was Buchenwald. Of the 762 Jews deported from Norway to German concentration camps only 23 survived, Leo Eitinger being one of them. Holocaust Psychiatrist After the liberation of Norway at the end of World War II, he resumed his medical practice in Norway, specializing in psychiatry. He was assistant physician at R√∏nvik Hospital in Bod√∏ 1946-48. In 1950, he became associated with the psychiatric clinic of the University of Oslo in the neighborhood of Vinderen in Vestre Aker. In 1966 Leo Eitinger was appointed professor of psychiatry at the University of Oslo and became Head of the University Psychiatric Clinic. Leo Eitinger allocated all his time and efforts to the study of human suffering with emphasis on clinical psychiatry, in particular victimology and disaster psychiatry. He conducted several landmark studies about the long-term psychological and physical effects of extreme stress and also about being a refugee. His work confirmed that the rate of mental illness among refugees appeared much more frequently than in the general population. He published a number of works on the same subject. Eitinger was a board member and served a chairman from 1963-67 of the Norwegian Psychiatric Association (Norsk Psykiatrisk Forening). He served as chairman of the Psychiatric Section of the Forensic Commission and was President of the Nordic Psychiatry Congresse (Nordiske psykiaterkongresser) in 1962 and 1987. He was elected member of the Norwegian Academy of Sciences in 1971 and was a member of several foreign scientific and psychiatric associations. He received a number of Norwegian and foreign honors including the Fritt Ord Award (Fritt Ords pris) in 1988. In 1978, he was appointed Commander in the Order of St. Olav. Personal life In 1946 he married Elisabeth (‚ÄúLisl‚Äù) Kohn (1914‚Äì1999). Leo and Lisl Eitinger devoted their lives to the promotion of human rights and the fight against injustice and racism. Leo Eitinger died in 1996. Lisl Eitinger died during 1999. In their honor, the University of Oslo established \\"The Lisl and Leo Eitinger Prize\\". The award has been granted annually since 1986 in recognition of commitment to human rights issues or performance of outstanding research in psychiatry.

It was founded by Keith Poulter and published six times a year by World Wide Wargames (3W), although initially it was only published four times a year.the Wargamer issue 9, page 10 History Poulter founded the magazine in 1977. In the May/June 1988 issue, it was announced that 3W acquired Diverse Talents Inc., who published Fire & Movement, Battleplan and Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer. A planned merger of the two operations would see 3W publish all three of these magazines, as well as Strategy & Tactics. Volume 1 of The Wargamer was rolled into Strategy & Tactics and ceased to exist. Poulter, however, wanted a magazine to continue to support S&T;, by providing wargame reviews and general hobby news and information. Christopher Cummins, knowing that 3W had also acquired Moves, expressed his interest in returning that magazine to print. Poulter made Cummins assistant editor, co-ordinating various strategy and analysis articles. Cummins felt that the previous audience of The Wargamer was better served by a revival of that title, and in 1988 beginning with Issue 6 began offering \\"timely reviews on time\\" under the banner of Volume 2 of The Wargamer. By the end of the year, Poulter had offered Fire & Movement to Cummins, which at that time was the main competition for readership. Cummins agreed, and brought F&M; back to a regular publishing schedule in 1989. Volume 2 of The Wargamer printed issues on games by a variety of publishers, and printed a series of anthologies in of various categories of wargames, giving a historical look at the development of the wargaming hobby through the lens of its collective published works. By 1990, Cummins and his staff felt that The Wargamer, Volume Two was \\"suffering from a split personality\\" in that it had reviews like F&M; had, and strategy and scenario articles like the older Moves title had. The decision was finally made in June 1990 to reintroduce Moves magazine. The Wargamer ceased publication with Issue 25 of Volume 2 in the winter of 1990.

The heart of this rainforest is located in the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas near the border with Guatemala in the Monta√±as del Oriente region of the state. Although most of the jungle outside the reserve has been partially or completely destroyed and damage continues inside the Reserve, the Lacandon is still the largest montane rainforest in North America and one of the last ones left large enough to support jaguars. It contains 1,500 tree species, 33% of all Mexican bird species, 25% of all Mexican animal species, 56% of all Mexican diurnal butterflies and 16% of all Mexico's fish species. The Lacandon in Chiapas is also home to a number of important Mayan archaeological sites including Palenque, Yaxchilan and Bonampak, with numerous smaller sites which remain partially or fully unexcavated. This rainforest, especially the area inside the Biosphere Reserve, is a source of political tension, pitting the EZLN or Zapatistas and their indigenous allies who want to farm the land against international environmental groups and the Lacandon Maya, the original indigenous group of the area and the one that holds the title to most of the lands in Montes Azures Environment The jungle has approximately 1.9 million hectares stretching from southeast Chiapas into northern Guatemala and into the southern Yucat√°n Peninsula. The Chiapas portion is located on the Monta√±as del Oriente (Eastern Mountains) centered on a series of canyonlike valleys called the Ca√±adas, between smaller mountain ridges oriented from northwest to southeast. It is bordered by the Guatemalan border on two sides with Comit√°n de Dom√≠nguez to the southwest and the city of Palenque to north. The core of the Chiapas forest is the Montes Azules Biosphere reserve, but it also includes some other protected areas such as Bonampak, Yaxchilan, Chan Kin, Lacantum and the communal reserve of La Cojolita. Dividing the Chiapas part of the forest from the Guatemalan side is the Usumacinta River, which is the largest river in Mexico and the seventh largest in the world based on volume of water. The area has a mostly hot and humid climate (K√∂ppen Amg) with most rain falling from summer into fall, with an average of 2300 to 2600 mm per year. There is a short dry season from March to May when as little as thirty mm falls. The average annual temperature s 24.7C. The abundance of rain supports a large number of small rivers and streams many of which are fast moving and have waterfalls, such as the Agua Azul and the Lacanja waterfalls. The soils of the area are mostly clay and lacking phosphorus but sufficient to support a large diversity of plant species. Despite the fact that much of the area has been reduced to a patchwork of clearings for cattle ranches and peasant communities, the Lacandon contains some of the most extensive and best preserved remnants of lower montane rainforest in Mexico and Central America. The best conserved area is within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, which has about 290,000 hectares of the Reserve in good condition. The Lacandon is the best known of Mexico's rainforest areas because of the attention it has received in the press and efforts by international organizations to protect what is left of it. The Lacandon is one of the most biodiverse rainforests in the world, with as much as 25% of Mexico's total species diversity. The predominant native vegetation is perennial high rainforest with trees that can grow to an average height of thirty meters and often to fifty or sixty including Guatteria anomala, Ceiba pentandra, Swietenia macrophylla, Terminalia amazonia and Ulmus mexicana. Mammoth Guanacaste trees shrouded in vines and bromeliads among clear running streams, enormous ferns, palms and wild elephant's ear plants can still be seen. It has 1,500 tree species, 33% of all Mexican bird species, 25% of all Mexican animal species, 44% of all Mexican diurnal butterflies and 10% of all Mexico's fish species. The jungle contains many endangered species such as the red macaw, the eagle, the tapir, the spider monkey, the howler monkeys, and the swamp crocodile. Jaguars are reported, though rare, in Selva Zoque. Its size and biodiversity has designated it as a \\"biodiversity hotspot\\" by the Washington DC based environmental group Conservation International and under the Puebla-Panama Plan. It is part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, which aims to link similar sites from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec down through Central America for conservation purposes. This is especially true for those ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù located in remote trans-border tropical forests. There are two major attractions within the Chiapas portion of this rainforest, the El Chifl√≥n Waterfall and the Gruta de San Francisco cave. El Chifl√≥n is located 53 km west of Comit√°n de Dom√≠nguez formed by the San Vicente Rivers. The water fall from a height of over seventy meters surrounded by steeply sloped hills. El Chifl√≥n is preceded by two smaller falls called Suspiro and Ala del Angel, which are about six meters in height. A cascade after it is called the Velo de Novia. The Gruta de San Francisco is located in the La Trinitaria municipality near the community of Santa Mar√≠a. The cave has a number of chambers filled with stalactites and stalagmites with capricious shapes, formed by the dripping of water through the cavity. These caves were considered sacred in the pre Hispanic period as passages to the underworld. The cave is also home to millions of bat which emerge at night to feed in the surrounding jungle. Archeological sites The jungle is also home to some of Mexico's most numerous and impressive archaeological sites, all of which belong to the Mayan civilization. The most important of these sites are Palenque, Bonampak and Yaxchilan, but there are many more sites and ruins that still lie unexcavated under the vegetation. Palenque lies on the edge of the Lacandon, where the Eastern Mountains meet the Gulf Coast Plains. It is not the largest Mayan archaeological site, but it has some well-preserved sculpture and architecture the culture produced. Major structures include the Temple of Inscriptions, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Cross; however, only a small fraction of it has been excavated. Away from the ceremonial center and on the way to the site museum are smaller buildings around the Otolum stream with a small waterfall. Yaxchilan flourished in the 8th and 9th centuries. The site contains extensive ruins, with palaces and temples bordering a large plaza upon a terrace above the Usumacinta River. The architectural remains extend across the higher terraces and the hills to the south of the river, overlooking both the river itself and the lowlands beyond. Yaxchilan is known for the large quantity of excellent sculpture at the site, such as the monolithic carved stelae and the narrative stone reliefs carved on lintels spanning the temple doorways. Over 120 inscriptions have been identified on the various monuments from the site. The major groups are the Central Acropolis, the West Acropolis and the South Acropolis. The South Acropolis occupies the highest part of the site. The site is aligned with relation to the Usumacinta River, at times causing unconventional orientation of the major structures, such as the two ballcourts. The site is relatively natural with howling monkeys, bats, toucans and other wildlife to be seen in and around the buildings. The city of Bonampak features exceptionally well-preserved Maya murals, depicting Mayan clothing, rituals, games, food and other aspects of life from that time. The realistically rendered paintings depict human sacrifices, musicians and scenes of the royal court. The name means ‚Äúpainted murals‚Äù. It is centered on a large plaza and has a stairway that leads to the Acropolis. There are also a number of notable Maya stelae. Tonin√° is a set of progressively smaller terraces going up a mountain instead of a cluster of buildings. Many of the stones are carved including those of residences belonging to various social strata. The site was discovered in the 17th century and is still being excavated. There is a site museum including photographs of what it looked like before the recent excavations, completely covered in jungle. Tenam Puente is on the west side of the Lacandon near Comit√°n de Dom√≠nguez. The site was initially built on a hill overlooking the area as a fortification. It contains about 160 buildings with thick stone walls with access by ramps which act as buttresses. The main areas in the site are the Mesoamerican ballcourt and the Acropolis. Lagartero is located 74 km south of Comit√°n in La Trinitaria. The site contains various mounds covering eight hectares with the largest containing burials. Excavations of burials have yielded clay figures, multicolored pottery shards and musical instruments. One area has been determined to be a Mesoamerican ball court and another as the Acropolis, for the ruling elite. About two- thirds of the buildings have been determined to be for government or religious purposes. Religious structures contain a number of stelae and low reliefs of figures with detailed faces. The site is surrounded by the Lagos de Col√≥n or Columbus Lakes. Other ruins include those at Lacanja. Lacandon people The population of the area is mostly subsistence peasants. These include indigenous groups of Chiapas such as the Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Ch'ol, Tojolabal and Lacandon Maya as well as non- indigenous. However, except for the Lacandon Maya, almost all of the population has migrated to the Lacandon, especially during the 20th century on. Until the early 18th century, the Lacandon Jungle and bordering areas of Guatemala were occupied by the now-extinct Lakandon Ch'ol., who lived along the tributaries of the upper Usumacinta River and the foothills of the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. Most of the Lakandon Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Huehuetenango area of Guatemala by the Spanish in the early 18th century. The resettled Lakandon Ch'ol were soon absorbed into the local Maya populations there and ceased to exist as a separate ethnicity. Prior to the Spanish conquest, the Xocmo were a Cholan-speaking group; they occupied the remote forest somewhere to the east of the Lacandon. The Xocmo were never conquered and escaped repeated Spanish attempts to locate them; their eventual fate is unknown but they may be ancestors of the modern Lacandon people. After the fall of the Itza capital Nojpet√©n to the Spanish invaders in 1697, a mix of Itza, Kejache and Kowoj refugees fled into the Lacandon Jungle, where they too became the ancestors of the modern Lacandon people. The Lacandons are descendants of the ancient Maya. Since the 16th century, they have been able to survive as a culture by living deep in the rainforest, with many communities out of contact with the rest of the world until the 20th century. Before the Conquest, the Lacandon dominated about a million hectares of these lands, but since then they have been encroached upon, mostly by indigenous from other areas of Chiapas since the early 20th century. This has dramatically altered their lifestyle and worldview. Today the Lacandon Maya are primarily found in three villages called Naja, Lacanja Chansayab and Metzobok. near the ruins of Bonampak and Yaxchilan. Local lore states that the gods resided here when they lived on earth. The traditional dress an undyed tunic called a xikul. Some Lacandon still wear traditional clothing but other use modern clothes and conveniences as well. Traditional Lacandon shelters are huts made with fronds and wood with an earthen floor, but this has mostly given way to modern structures. The Lacandon Maya have supported themselves for centuries practicing a method of ‚Äúagro-forestry‚Äù in which they rotate areas in which they plant crops. This features a fallow period to allow for soil regeneration. In the mid 20th century, the Lacandon had all but disappeared. In the mid 20th century, Franz and Trudy Blom were one of the first Europeans to make sustained contact with the Lacondons since the Spanish conquest. For the rest of their lives, the Bloms worked to publicize the plight of these people and by the time she died in 1999, Trudy Blom had created a collection of over 55,000 photographs of both the people and the Lacandon Jungle. The couple's efforts, along with those of Lacandon activist Chan Kin, have spurred the Lacandons to work to preserve their land and culture. This has included developing ecotourism with cabins, rafting, horseback riding and more. While there are concerns that ecotourism will make the jungle a commodity and cause changes in Lacandon culture, it also helps to keep younger generations from migrating out of the area. Today, the Lacandon Maya numbers have increased and are estimated to be anywhere from 600 to 1000 people in about a dozen villages. Deforestation Frontera Corozal The deforestation of the Lacandon in Mexico has been dramatically high, with the rate increasing over the past decades. It is estimated that only 10% of virgin rainforest still exists with the rest having been strip-mined, logged and more. Most of what is left hugs the Guatemalan border. Of the remaining forest, about 5% is still lost per year in spite of conservation efforts. This deforestation began in the mid 19th century by loggers and ‚Äúchicleros‚Äù who tapped trees for sap to make chewing gum. By the 1940s, much of the old growth forest had already been destroyed. Illegal logging is still a serious concern. Twenty one municipalities in Chiapas have significant problems with illegal logging, most of which are in or near the Montes Azules Reserve. While migration of people into the lowland rainforests had been going on since the 1930s, it accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s, as there was high population growth in the highlands areas. The government encouraged people, especially the indigenous, to move to the lowlands and claim lands there. During the 20th century, the population of municipalities in this area, such as Altamirano, Las Margaritas, Ocosingo and Palenque has risen from 11,000 in 1920 to over 376,000 in 2000. In 1990, a World Bank study declared that the following decade would make or break the Lacandon Selva's chances for survival as the rainforest had been \\"reduced to the minimum size essential for the integrity of its ecosystem.\\" The destruction of the jungle has been such that satellite photos show the Mexico-Guatemalan border where the deforestation on the Mexican side stops. Much of the destruction of the rainforest has occurred through slash and burn farming, which allows for little to no fallow time and creates soil erosion. It also depletes what little nutrition there is in the soil, which is then also polluted by the use of fertilizers and pesticides. As of the first decade of the 21st century, it is estimated about two thirds of the Lacandon outside the main biosphere reserve has been converted into pasture or cropland. Once this land has been cleared and used, it is very difficult to revert it to rainforest, even after it has been abandoned. Grass for pasture is particularly problematic because after it takes hold, does not allow natural vegetation to compete with it. In addition, the soil becomes compacted by the trampling of livestock. This degradation causes streams to dry up as evaporation rates rise from the lack of shade. In the latter 1970s, the government changed its policies in regards to the Lacandon, establishing the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve. It evicted some squatters, and granted the tiny group of Lacandones ownership of huge tracts in the reserve. That caused resentment in some indigenous communities, and would be a factor in the Zapatista uprising two decades later. However, even with the establishment of the reserve, the government did not sufficiently protect it, and many squatters made their way onto the lands, creating patchworks of squatter camps. Even today, there are only about twenty forest rangers for the entire reserve. Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve The Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve was established in 1978 as Mexico's first biosphere reserve. This reserve covers part of the Lacandon Jungle, covering 331,200 hectares, only one fifth of the original rainforest in Chiapas. In 1992 the 61,874-hectare Lacantun Reserve, which includes the Classic Maya archeological sites of Yaxchilan and Bonampak, was added to the original biosphere reserve. It was financed in 1994 by the World Bank's Global Environmental Fund. It is recognized by the UN Environment Program for its global biological and cultural significance. Its management plan endeavors to strike a balance between habitat conservation and the demand for research into its vast genetic resources. There is a significant difference in vegetation between the reserve areas and the jungle outside of it. However, areas of the Reserve have been damaged as it is carved in disconnected patches. In many areas, tapirs, howler monkeys and parrots are already gone. Reserve managers say even small-scale development within the conservation area is a threat, since its natural balance has been altered over the centuries. According to Conservation International, there are 140 peasant settler communities in the Biosphere Reserve and 225 including those in other protected areas in the Lacandon. All but thirty two of these have a certain amount of legal protection as they were registered as ejidos before the Reserve was created. Since the Reserve was created, the thirty two have been in limbo, which some efforts by the government to force them to move with promises of other lands in Chiapas. However, these farmers have resisted with support of the EZLN. EZLN believes the evictions are a pretense to dislodge them from their base of support and the turn over the Lacandon to ‚Äúcorporate exploitation‚Äù as the area is still rich in timber with oil, hydro electric and even genetic resources. The Reserve and the Zapatistas The EZLN, commonly known as the Zapatistas, came to the forefront of Chiapas politics in the mid 1990s. Since then, their bases of support have mostly come from indigenous communities in the settled areas of the Lacandon Jungle and the areas around San Cristobal de las Casas. While migration to the Lacandon had been occurring earlier in the 20th century, it accelerated even more in the 1990s, with the Zapatistas encouraging people to seize ‚Äúunoccupied jungle.‚Äù For this reason, the Zapatistas do not have the support of the Lacandon Mayas, who have also feared for their villages‚Äô and people's safety when confronted by the EZLN. The Zapatistas claim that as indigenous farmers, they are the best protectors of the rainforest, and that they want to turn Montes Azules into an ‚ÄúIndian Farmers‚Äô Reserve‚Äù, a patchwork of farms and jungle. This pits them against the Lacandon Maya and environmentalist groups who state that the jungle cannot take any more farming. They also state that the agricultural methods do not help alleviate the migrants‚Äô economic system as they can only farm a plot for a couple of harvests before the soil is depleted. The Zapatistas have accused environmentalists of siding with the government and corporate interests, and the Lacandons are too small in number to challenge the other groups, despite being the legal owners of much of the reserve. There were some attempts to evict settlers from the Reserve, especially from the thirty two undocumented settlements, but it was met by fierce resistance by the Zapatistas. In 2005, some Zapatista allied communities decided to relocate on their own, while still opposing forced resettlement. These included the settlements of Primero de Enero, Santa Cruz, Ocho de Octubre and San Isidro, with all moved to areas outside the Reserve. Since then in a communiqu√©, EZLN leader Subcomandante Marcos warned against trying force the removal of any Zapatista allied community. In 2008, Zapatistas and allied prohibited the entrance of federal police and army into ejidos such as La Garrucha, San Alejandro and Hermenegildo Galena to search for marijuana fields, claiming that these forces are outside their jurisdiction to do so. However, as late as 2010, illegal settlements, new and old, were being dislodged by police and military forces and moved to areas outside the conservation zones. In 2011, EZLN issued another warning that operations against these settlements pose a threat to indigenous people in the state. They and certain NGOs such as Maderas del Pueblo de Sureste oppose programs such as Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), claiming it ‚Äúcommodifies‚Äù indigenous culture, giving a commercial value to it vis-√†-vis the environment. One aspect of the REDD program is to pay local ejido or other communal land owners to keep parts of their lands in a wild state and/or participate in reforestation of them. Oil Oil deposits have been found in the Lacandon area in both Mexico and Guatemala. There has been some exploration and pumping in the area, however it seems unlikely that there is far more. Some of these rock formations are in Zapatista held areas of the forest, but many geologists and the Mexican government have insisted there is little promise of oil in these areas. The Zapatistas claim that the government is hiding the presence of oil in the area as they try to force them and the indigenous people who support them off the lands.

Shown is the southern end of Egan Drive and large-scale development on filled- in tidelands. Top of the tramway (\\"Skybridge\\") on Mount Roberts. The Mount Roberts Tramway is an aerial tramway located just south of downtown Juneau in the U.S. state of Alaska. In operation since 1996, the tram makes a six-minute ascent of 3,819-foot (1,164 m) Mount Roberts from the cruise ship docks (just feet above sea level) to a height of about 1,800 feet (550 m). A restaurant, theater, nature center and retail shops are located at the top of the tramway, as well as connections to trails leading both up and down the mountain. One trail up the mountain leads to a large crossFather Brown's Cross erected by Roman Catholic Father Brown in the early 1900s. History The tramway was conceived by John Heiser in 1994. Heiser, together with Bruce Booher, Marc Bond, Kevin Branson and Ron Greisen, formed Mount Roberts Development Corporation (MRDC). MRDC designed the facility, acquired the necessary land and rights-of-way, and obtained permits. Following the preliminary stages, MRDC partnered with Goldbelt, Incorporated,Goldbelt, Incorporated the ANCSA corporation for Alaska Natives in and from Juneau, to finance, construct and operate the venture. MRDC managed the partnership and oversaw construction of the tramway. The tram opened for limited operation in September 1996 and the grand opening was held in May 1997. MRDC sold its partnership interest to Goldbelt the following year. Anne Hunter, the tram's operation manager, was contracted to stay on another year as part of the sale agreement. The tram ferried nearly 160,000 people to the alpine region above downtown Juneau the summer of 1997, its first full season. It was built in 1996 at a cost of nearly $16 million (or $ million today) and took in $3 million in revenue in its first year of operation ($ million today).Juneau Empire Tram ascending to the Skybridge The Mount Roberts Tramway is one of Southeast Alaska's most popular tourist attractions,Fodor's Travel: Inside Passage Sights with around 200,000 visitors each summer. Technical Information and Operation The Mount Roberts Tramway uses a cable transportation system known as an aerial tramway, first used in the European Alps in the late 1800s. Tramways have been traditionally associated with ski areas, but today these systems are also used in other visitor attractions, material hauling and urban transportation. Leitner-Poma of America, the Mount Roberts Tramway builder, is a subsidiary of Pomagalski, S. A., the world's largest supplier of ropeway transportation systems. The tram has two 60-passenger cabins, capable of a maximum uphill capacity of 1050 people per hour. Maximum speed is . This type of tram is known as a double-reversible or \\"jig-back\\". Both cabins are coupled to a common haul rope and they move in unison, one up and one down. The main drive system is a 600 hp 500V DC GE electric motor. The full-time back up system is two 360 hp Cummins diesel engines with a hydro static drive. Both systems are coupled to a common gearbox. The haul rope is of solid core cable. The cable has a breaking strength of . The haul cable operates at tension per side. The cabins ride on two each double locking coil track ropes. Each cable is long with a breaking strength of . All cables were manufactured by Fatzer of Switzerland. Base Facilities The base terminal of the tram is located on the cruise ship docks on South Franklin Street. The terminal building features a large main hall, ticket windows, loading platforms with waiting areas, offices, and maintenance facilities for the tram. Summit Facilities The top terminal of the tram is located on a tower and has views of the City of Juneau and the Gastineau Channel, Douglas Island and the community of Douglas to the west, the Chilkat Mountain Range to the north, and Kupreanof Island to the South. The terminal platform is joined to the ridge of Mount Roberts by the Skybridge which leads to the summit facilities. The main building includes the Timberline Bar & Grill, the Chilkat Theater showing an informative film of the local Alaska Natives, and Raven Eagle Gifts. Located at the main building is the Stephen Jackson totem pole, a modern rendition of traditional Native themes. The Juneau Raptor Center operates a bald eagle display at the summit, which provides a recovery center for injured eagles and educational programs for tram visitors. Visitors can also enter the Nature Center which offers guided hiking adventures and books and maps on local recreation. Several hiking trails of varying degrees of difficulty (including wheel-chair accessible paths) have been laid out leading from the summit facilities. Many of these feature extensive views from the Mount Roberts ridgeline, and some wind through the forest trees and meadows with wild flowers and animals. The forest paths feature trees with totemic carvings depicting Native legends. Interpretive markers describing many of the flowers, plants, trees, birds and animals are placed along the loop trail for self-guided walks.

The West Indies' captain Frank Worrell was full of praise for the calm and unobtrusive competence of the umpiring in that tension-filled series. After that series, Hoy retired from umpiring to concentrate on business and grade cricket in Brisbane, playing for the Valley District Cricket Club until 1988. He returned to umpiring for the World Series Cricket tour of 1978-79. His working life was spent in the retail trade and with Ansett Airlines, and he was the Australian rules football reporter for the Brisbane Courier-Mail.

Although stricken as an infant with poliomyelitis, Kassner traveled widely to northern Africa, the Sahara, India, Russia, Spain, and throughout Europe. His translations of William Blake introduced this English romantic poet to German-speaking audiences. His literary career covered six decades, including a period of isolation during the Nazi years in Vienna. His writings on physiognomy reflect his effort to understand the problems of modernity and Man's subsequent disconnectedness from time and place. His later autobiographical writings suggest a brilliant literary mind attempting to make sense of a chaotic post-nuclear world. He was nominated for the Nobel prize for literature thirteen times. Biography Before his birth, Rudolf Kassner's family emigrated to Moravia (at the time part of Austro-Hungary) from Silesia. His father, Oskar Kassner, was a landowner and factory owner, descended from government officials and businessmen. His maternal ancestors were peasants. Kassner regarded himself as a German-Slavic mixture, having inherited German Blut (German: blood) from his mother and a Slavic Geist (German: spirit) from his father (Das physiognomische Weltbild, 116ff.). The seventh of 10 children, Rudolf Kassner was born in 1873 in Gro√ü Pawlowitz in southern Moravia, near Znaim. Shortly after Kassner's birth, his father moved the family to the countryside near Nikolsburg, where he leased imperial property, profitably cultivated beets, and ran a sugar factory. Kassner contracted poliomyelitis at nine months of age, which affected both his legs and required him to use crutches for the rest of his life. He grew up in a strict Catholic milieu and was schooled at home. He and his siblings were educated by governesses. When he was a young adult, a tutor prepared him for annual state examinations that allowed him to attend the gymnasium in neighboring provincial town of Nikolsberg. Student life In 1892 Kassner enrolled at the University of Vienna where he set out to study German philology, Latin, and Philosophy. He spent the last two semesters, in 1895 and '96, in Berlin, where he attended the lectures of the nationalist historian Heinrich von Treitschke. Kassner, too, was an enthusiastic theater-goer. This formed the basis for later reflections on acting and the role of the actor, important for his physiognomic worldview. In 1896 he returned to Vienna and completed his studies with a doctoral dissertation on Der ewige Jude in der Dichtung (The Eternal Jew in Poetry), which he completed in 1897.http://fondationrilke.ch/en/rainer-maria- rilke/rudolf-kassner/rudolf-kassners-biography/ Despite his physical handicap, Kassner traveled extensively in Russia, North Africa, and India. He lived in Paris, London, and Munich for short periods of time. His first publications found favor among fin-de-si√®cle poets and artists. He was a member of the so- called Bohemian circle in Munich to which Frank Wedekind and Eduard Graf von Keyserling also belonged. Kassner was acquainted also with Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Paul Val√©ry, and Andr√© Gide. From 1900 to 1906 he was a regular member of the Viennese group gathered around the cultural philosopher and anti-Semite Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Kassner later distanced himself from Chamberlain. In 1902 he met Hugo von Hofmannsthal and in 1907, Rainer Maria Rilke, and developed deep and lasting friendships with both men. Rilke dedicated the eighth Duineser Elegie to Kassner. For a time both Hofmannsthal and Rilke considered Kassner to be the most far-sighted contemporary cultural philosopher. His close friendship with Rilke has received a great deal of scholarly attention. Schm√∂lders speculates that at least on Kassner's part this friendship was latent homosexuality (in: Neumann/Ott 1999). After the outbreak of World War I, Kassner moved to Vienna. He married in 1914. During the war years Kassner passionately studied Mathematics and Physics; for this was the period when Albert Einstein's great work was published and much of the work on the foundations of mathematics were taking place. He met Einstein once in Vienna. Kassner tried to understand in his own way, new ideas such as the concept of four-dimensional space and the concept of Number etc. His book Zahl und Gesicht is the result of this deep engagement. During this period he was often in Berlin where he met Georg Simmel, Gerhart Hauptmann and Walter Rathenau. In 1924 and in 1931 Kassner was again in Rome. From 1926 to 1931 he traveled every year to Paris and he spent every late summer in the castle Sch√∂nhausen, where Princess Herbert Bismarck lived. During the interwar period also Kassner published many of his books, although they were prohibited in Germany after 1933. Nevertheless, his books continued to appear until he was forbidden to write (Schreibverbot) after the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938. During World War II, Kassner remained in his home in Vienna. Out of his years-long work in isolation emerged a monumental work Das neunzehnte Jahrhundert: Ausdruck und Gr√∂√üe. His wife, who was Jewish, had escaped from Austria after the Anschluss with the help of Hans Carossa. Through the intervention of some of his Swiss friends Kassner moved to Switzerland in 1945. In 1946 he moved to Sierre (Siders) in Valais where his friend Rilke had also spent the last years of his life. He lectured at the University of Z√ºrich and lived in Sierre until his death after a long illness on 1 April 1959. There he was visited by his pre-war acquaintance Marguerite Yourcenar in 1951. Travels Between 1898 and 1912 Kassner traveled extensively. In the years 1897-98, 1908, 1910 and in 1912 he was in England. His first book Die Mystik, die K√ºnstler und das Leben is about English poets of the eighteenth century. The English writer Laurence Sterne influenced Kassnerr and he appears as a character in Kassner's Die Chim√§re. Kassner translated Sterne's Tristram Shandy and Cardinal Newman's Apologia Pro Vita Sua into German, and wrote several essays on Sterne, Thomas de Quincey and Thomas Hardy. In 1900 Kassner made his first trip to Paris. Here he met Andr√© Gide, whose work Philoktet he translated into German. He also met Maurice Maeterlinck. His involvement with French culture is reflected in his essays on Baudelaire, Auguste Rodin, Abbe Galiani and Diderot and in his translations of the works of Gide and St. John Perse. While in Paris, Kassner received a visit from T. S. Eliot and during this trip, he formed his great friendship with Rilke, the poet. In many histories of German literature, Kassner finds mention at best as a friend of Rilke and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Yet, the two poets have testified amply to Kassner's profound influence on them. Rilke dedicated his eighth Duino Elegy, the most important elegy, to Kassner. In a letter to Princess Marie von Thurn and Taxis, Rilke says of Kassner: \\"...is not this man, I say to myself, perhaps the most important of all those who are writing today?\\" On his deathbed Rilke recalled with great fondness his association with Kassner. Kassner's association with Hofmannsthal began in 1902. He visited the poet in Rodaun. Both of them belonged to that generation of Austrians who believed they were witness to the steady decline of western culture and the inexorable erosion of its institutions. Hofmannsthal wrote about Kassner in 1904: \\"I believe that he is perhaps the most important literary man, the most important culture critic that we have ever had in Germany\\" Kassner also knew Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the notorious racial theorist and anti-Semite, to whom he had sent his first book. At Chamberlain's House in Vienna Kassner often met Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Count Hermann von Keyserling and the Indologist Leopold von Schr√∂der. In 1905 Kassner traveled through Spain, and from to Tangier in Morocco. His father died in Vienna in 1906, and Kassner spent that year in Vienna. In 1907 he traveled again to Italy, further to Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and by motorcar through the Sahara. On 16 October 1908 Kassner's began his lengthy journey through India. From London he proceeded by sea to Bombay. On board he became acquainted with the Maharaja of Kapurthala and one Mr. Inder Choudhary, a judge at the Calcutta high court. In the first week of November 1908 Kassner traveled from Bombay to Jaipur; then to Thaneswar and arrived on 24 November 1908 in Kapurthala to take part in the birthday celebrations of the Maharaja. From there he went towards Lahore and Peshawar, also a jaunt to the Khyber Pass. He returned south through Delhi and Agra to Lucknow. In a train accident on 3 December Kassner lost his baggage. Ten days after that he reached Benaras via Allahabad. Next he proceeded to Calcutta, where, incidentally, he met Stefan Zweig. In Calcutta he stayed with his friend, whom he met on the journey to India, Inder Choudhary. On 1 January 1909 he went to Darjeeling, from where he viewed the Kanchanjunga. He went by steamer to Burma and traveled up to Bhano on the Chinese border. From Calcutta Kassner went by sea to Colombo, from there he reached South India in mid- February; setting out most likely from Tuticorin to Madras via Madurai and Thanjavur. He reached Madras on 24 February 1909. He also visited Hyderabad and Ellora and journeyed home from Bombay on 6 March 1909. On the return journey he spent some time in Egypt; from there he proceeded to Rome and spent the rest of that year in Italy. We do not know much about Kassner's experiences in India or about the sources of his knowledge about India, apart from what he himself says in his writings. But it is evident that India deeply influenced Kassner. Kassner himself confessed later that he became a philosopher through the Indians. Besides his two major works on India, Indian themes constantly recur in Kassner's writings. Kassner's Indian journey and his experiences in India are of immense importance in understanding his life and works, evidenced by his publication Der indische Idealismus (Indian Idealism). In 1911 he traveled to Russia. He started from Vienna in May 1911 and traveled to St Petersburg; then to Moscow and from there along the Volga up to Saralow. He went southwards to Yalta and then to Kieslovodsk, north of Caucasus. In an automobile he crossed the Caucasus and went along the route that leads via the Caspian to Samarkhand in Turkestan. He returned after a brief stay in St. Petersburg and Moscow to Berlin towards the end of October 1911. Soon translations from the Russian followed: Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy. Works Kassner himself divided his work, into three periods: aestheticism 1900-1908; physiognomy 1908-1938: and after 1938 autobiographical writings, religious and mystical essays, and \\"meta-political\\" interpretations of world events. Kassner rejected rigid philosophical systems and thus preferred looser literary forms such as essays, aphorisms, prose sketches, parables, and allegories. Nevertheless, his works revolve around certain coherent contexts and returns again and again to the same themes. Aestheticism Kassner can be characterized as an antirationalist. His writings deal with themes and concepts of medieval mysticism, hermetics, and Indian philosophy. For him the most important ability of the mind (Verstand) is not reason (ratio) but rather the imagination (Einbildungskraft)which he believed make \\"living perception\\" possible. He believed that he had overcome the analytical and rational dissection of the world by means of a \\"totality\\" of perception. According to Schm√∂lders (1999) Kassner's essays have a \\"predatory component.\\" His early adversary was the \\"dilettante\\", that is, modern man who overestimates himself and his place in the world, who would be an artist without being able to the recognize the \\"whole\\" of the world, who is a victim of relativism and individualism. He accuses modernity of being without \\"standard\\" (Ma√ü), no longer able to show man his place in the world. The only way to attain \\"standard\\" and \\"greatness\\" is through passion and suffering. Kassner further denounces the \\"actor\\" who only plays with social roles and turns himself into the accomplice of modernity. Physiognomy Kassner's post-1908 writings on physiognomy are probably the most original part of his work. His physiognomy is not a system for reading character from facial features; rather it is at its core a conservative cultural philosophy. Kassner saw in modernity a cultural crisis that left traces of alienation and uprootedness in human faces. In the intellectual landscape of the 1920s Kassner's world-view thus reflects the \\"conservative revolution.\\" According to Kassner's physiognomy, in the old, aristocratic corporate society every person had a face that resulted from his connection to his estate. Modern man has, however, lost the \\"standard\\" that anchored him in the community: the face of modern man is thus \\"gaping\\" like a wound because it is no longer anchored in the world. Kassner uses \\"face\\" in its dual meaning as vision and visage, seeing and countenance. Physiognomic interpretation is, however, not something that can be learned; Kassner believed that the \\"seer\\" alone is called to physiognomy. \\"Imagination\\" becomes for Kassner the most important human ability, for it alone makes it possible to see the world as a unity or \\"form\\" and \\"to see things together.\\" For Kassner the physiognomy is basically a ‚Äòphenomenology of Being‚Äô. It is based on Goethe's anti-Kantian statement \\"The highest is to understand that all facts are already theory. One need not search behind the phenomenon, for they themselves are the theory\\". Kassner's physiognomy is an attempt to portray the world in all its manifestations. Of course, Kassner's teachings are not easy to understand. Kassner's physiognomy though is distinct from the traditional rational physiognomy from pseudo- Aristotle to Lavater. Rational science objects to physiognomy thus: How can one draw conclusions about the inner character of anybody from his external features? Can one? Yet, physiognomy tried to be ‚Äòscientific‚Äôand came to be devalued. Even in the eighteenth century Lavater tried to reduce the differences among the human faces to certain common denominators and tried to build a system of symbols to interpret it. (Kant considered it too pretentious a task for mere mortals). Nevertheless the idea was to build a system and to give a scientific explanation. Kassner's physiognomy studies the rhythmic and changeable aspects of the face, which are not accessible to the rational physiognomy characteristic of its early period. Freudian psychoanalysis considered every face a mask and tried to unravel what lies behind it. This is a far cry from Kassner's physiognomy. Of course psychoanalysis has recognized that \\"man no longer appears as he is\\". But Kassner's physiognomy asserts, \\" Man is just as he appears to be because he does not appear as he really is.\\" This is the basic axiom of Kassner's physiognomy. Kassner developed a style suited to the articulation of this physiognomy: the frequent use of zeugma for example is characteristic of his writing; he brings together things that appear to be contradictory on the surface in order to show not immediately evident interconnections between them. The seemingly contradictory phenomena combine to give a total image of the whole. One distinct advantage of this method is its usefulness in avoiding of the tendency to reify. Kassner's physiognomy is not about na√Øve inference of individual characteristics from physical features. It is a seeing-together of the soul and cosmos. Kassner uses the word Gesicht (an untranslatable word which refers to what sees, namely face or countenance, and also what is seen, the vision.). This physiognomy is also a cosmogony. For Kassner all that can have a form: animals and humans, ideas, philosophies and religions, concrete things and products of pure fantasies, things of the present and the remote past all these can be Gesicht. In this Gesicht. rather than behind it, is the relationship of the soul to the entire cosmos and it needs interpretation. For Kassner, the physiognomist is the mystic of the whole created world. The paradox as a form of thinking is very important to understand Kassners diagnosis of modernity. The incongruence between the external appearance and the internal disposition of man, the surface and deep structure of humans, as it were, forms the basis of his understanding of the modern individual. Psychoanalysis and other theories of human nature, analyse the appearance to unmask the reality. Kassner avoids all reification and takes that which appears first to his sight, his vision, namely human action and behavior, as the basis for his searching physiognomic enquiry. Phenomena considered purely externally call for a rational explanation for establishing causal nexus, whereas to understand authentic form requires imaginative interpretation. To be able to see the form, one need to fuse critical and creative faculties, in short ‚Äòr√§sonnieren‚Äô as Kassner terms it. Hence, the conscious use of paradoxes that characterizes much of Kassner's writing. This indeed produces a shock-effect, much like the stunning effect of the Socratic elenchos. His zeugmas confront the reader to provide him a surprisingly new perspective. Like a Zen master with his counter-rational sayings, Kassner shakes the reader's rational, analytic thought processes in order to make him aware of the dynamic whole, the whole reality of the appearance. Kassner uses many ideas such as form, gestalt, whole, order, idea etc., to emphasize the holistic aspects of his approach. The activity that forms the basis of this type of perception is seeing and interpreting (deuten). It calls for seeing‚Äìtogether, for a synoptic vision. This is why Kassner rejects the ‚Äòthing-in-itself‚Äô that never manifests itself in phenomena. Kassner holds that the image includes the thing along with its movement, its dunamis. The phenomena are not the external covering of content. Form and content yield a unity, held together by imagination, whereas critical reason separates them. Imagination is synthetic; reason is analytic. Autobiographical Kassner addressed the important intellectual movements of his time. He is a pronounced opponent of psychoanalysis which for him is a further symptom of cultural crisis. It tries to discover in man the most extreme appetites - parricide, incest - and turns the great into the banal. On the other hand, Albert Einstein's theory of relativity was for him the most important confirmation of his philosophical thought. In Zahl und GesichtKassner even tried to make Einstein's theory compatible with his own understanding of \\"space world\\" and \\"time world.\\" Although Kassner alludes to current events in his writings and analyzes contemporary society, this is done in his later work increasingly in a kind of private mythology that makes use of ambiguous, enigmatic and often unclearly defined ideas that often cannot to attributed to a political stance. Kassner's autobiographical works are difficult to understand; even his reminiscences contain passages, which are not easy to follow because of their idiosyncratic terminology. But many great modern texts are difficult (who will not vouch for enigmatic intricacies of Eliot and Pound, Joyce and Heidegger to mention but a few). \\"Works of this kind with their closely woven thoughts, are not easily accessible\\", wrote Hofmannsthal. \\"It consists of a number of unconnected writings...the contents are new and important, the title is unobtrusive. In the writings there is no system or definite terminology nor does the author mention about the unity of the work\\" . Surely Kassner does not provide an easy approach to his works. One cannot build a system out of his works. As he himself says \\"I have no system and hence not the language of the system\\". Kassner's world is a world without masters and disciples. It is not built upon his predecessors, he had no precursors, hence the difficulty of categorizing his work. From the viewpoint of a traditional Indian one can designate him a ‚ÄòGnanayogi‚Äô. His life as second birth, as second sailing was the journey of a soul to realization, an unending journey of the quest for knowing. It is not as though his physical disability prompted an inward journey. With Kassner the elemental and strong power of the senses and the spiritual energy is unmistakable. Kassner's world is a paradox. In it there is suffering and that makes it very Christian; there is in him the drama of the soul, a deep, unresolved tension; every feeling call forth its denial, with every thought its contradiction. There is also unity in division. With every division there is also a crossing. It is lived paradox, not dialectics. It is tension, not antitheses. No dialectic, no millennium, no utopia, no synthesis, no telos, only the middle and one has to live with it. Hence the absence of any revolt in him. This is titiksha in the real sense of the term. Kassner's view of history In his keen inquiry into human history Kassner differentiates two worlds‚Äì ‚Äòthe world of the father‚Äô and ‚Äòthe world of the son‚Äô. ‚ÄòThe world of the father‚Äô is the world of the ancient man. Kassner says that ancient man with his magic hieratic cultures had no sense of individuality. These myth-dominated cultures, like that of the Greeks, are also a space world (Raumwelt). It is a world without division. It is also the world of identity. In this finite world, the polis with its norms regulates the tension between the individual and the group and the word approximates the thing designated by it. The divergence between the word and the thing occurs in ‚Äòthe world of the son‚Äô, which is a time world (Zeitwelt), the world of individuality. The conflict between inside and outside, form and content, soul and body, dream and reality, begins in this ‚Äòworld of the son‚Äô. Here myth and mystery part company. The magico-mythical world, the unified but repetitive world gives way to the world of individual, divided but unique in history. But in Kassner we find no theories about the philosophy of history, no conflict of nature versus civilization as in Rousseau, no progress in history as in Hegel. In Kassner there is no dialectic but drama. The figure of Christ and The Word becoming flesh are of central importance to Kassner's thoughts. Kassner said that the hold of the myth held sway as ‚Äògrand form‚Äô, as order, rank and institution even in the ages of Christian dogma. The complete dissolution takes place in the age of baroque. Then in the nineteenth century, the French Revolution, Kant's Critiques and Goethe's Faust inaugurate the real chronicle of the individual. Through a ‚ÄòGleichgewichtst√∂rung‚Äô, to use Kassner's phrase, the individual is loosened from tradition and becomes a slave to the collective. Kassner diagnoses the individual of his times as dilettante, achiever, speculator, actor, dialectician, materialist, mediocre, indiscrete humans lacking altogether the sense of measure. But the world of the individual is also the world of freedom. The isolated derailed individual seeking his counterpart finds him in the Gerechte (the just man, or the righteous man). The notion of the der Heilige (the Holy) is absent in the western world. Kassner says the counterpart of the Indian Rishi in the West is the Just Man. Kassner sees the saviour of the modern times in the Just man, in the pilgrim, in the Christian and the child like man. According to Kassner the contradiction between thought and action is Christian. This state of being at odds with oneself, induced no doubt by the elemental tension occasioned by the psyche's experience of contradictory, or even conflicting experiences, is what prompts Kassner to rehabilitate Platonic periagoge in a Christian context. In other words, the want of alignment with the temporal world leads to the profound onset of imagination ‚ÄìEinbildung, restored by Kassner to the transitive sense of Middle High German‚Äì the boundless imagination, i.e. its \\"lack of measure\\" holds for today's humans according to Kassner the only promise of accomplishing the amalgam of truth and justice. Steigerung and Umkehr (antilepsis) are the twin features of this transcendence in immanence. Evocative images characterize Kassner's writing. Instead of analytic concepts he deliberately employs paradoxes and zeugmas that meaningfully bring together the small and the big, the near and the distant to obtain deep insights. In this context one needs to investigate Kassner's key terms such as Middle, Measure, Magic Body, Personality, Imagination, Vision, Seeing, Order, Umkehr, Saint, Chimera etc. \\"His concepts are not really concepts\\", writes Usinger \\"... not defined, the ideas occur again and again.\\" One of Kassner's characters says, \\"You know very well my weakness and understand that I cannot define and all my definitions are false.\\" His works have no linear development and do not yield swiftly to rational analysis. Politically, Kassner saw himself early on as a European who tried to characterize the peoples of Europe without favoring his own. His sharpest criticism is often reserved for the Germans. In spite of his youthful enthusiasm for Treitschke and Chamberlain he was never openly antisemitic; he married a woman of Jewish ancestry. Nevertheless, derogatory comments about Jews and Jewish stereotypes can be found in his writing (cf. Schm√∂lders in Neumann/Ott 1999). In his late work the tendency toward mystical and religious syncretism comes to the fore: Kassner sees himself as the \\"magician\\" who employs a magical and inaccessible language to point to \\"mysteries\\" and \\"secrets\\" of the world: he plays with themes of Buddhism and Indian religions that he mixes with Christian ideas. Kassner regretted his early admiration of Friedrich Nietzsche. As early as 1910 in Dilettantismus he accuses Nietzsche of having contributed to \\"everyone wanting to be an artist.\\" One of the greatest influences on Kassner was S√∏ren Kierkegaard to whose Christian anthropology he refers again and again. Other named role models are Blaise Pascal and Plato. Contemporaries and the Unknown Eminence Kassner received the Schiller Memorial Prize of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1949. On the occasion of this award Theophil Spoerri spoke of Kassner as \\"Die unbekannte Gr√∂√üe\\", the unknown eminence. Anyone who tries to understand Kassner's work has to confront this paradox. Kassner is remarkably great and yet unknown. Here is a person, of whom it can be said without reservation that he is one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century; and some of the greatest writers, poets and philosophers of Europe have acknowledged their indebtedness to him. Intellectually, Kassner is closest to his contemporaries Hofmannsthal and Rilke, Karl Wolfskehl and Marx Picard (who also produced physiognomic works), but there are also clear philosophical parallels to Oswald Spengler. Georg Luk√°cs, Georg Simmel and Walter Benjamin admired Kassner's early works - although Benjamin also sharply criticized Kassner. He was praised by his contemporaries: in 1908 Rudolf Borchardt called him the \\"only genuine mystic of quality;\\" in 1911 Friedrich Gundolf attested to his \\"purity and loftiness of sentiment;\\" Dolf Sternberger, Fritz Usinger, Hans Paeschke were among his admirers. But Kassner also encountered criticism and a lack of understanding, for example, by Rudolf Alexander Schr√∂der. Thomas Mann characterized his book Zahl and Gesicht as \\"hair-splitting and precious;\\" the Swiss playwright Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt reported that for him a meeting Kassner had \\"broken Kassner's spell.\\" \\"A new Nietzsche has appeared among us. He is called Rudolf Kassner and he speaks in antitheses, contradictions and paradoxes, deep and mystical, here and there in the tone of a prophet. Whether ‚Äòthe Modern‚Äô places him above, below, or beside Nietzsche one does not know yet, but as far as I am concerned he is to me dearer than Nietzsche\\" hailed a reviewer of his first published work in 1900. Congratulating Kassner on his eightieth birthday T. S. Eliot wrote: \\"To contribute to the chorus of praise and thanks which should greet Rudolf Kassner on his eightieth birthday is a privilege which confers greater honour to the contributor than to the recipient. I am happy to have the opportunity on this occasion to salute and pay homage to so distinguished an author and so great a European who has every reason to look back with pride upon his life-work.\\" In the same volume W. H. Auden writes on Kassner's book Zahl und Gedicht: \\"Among all the books which a writer reads over the years, the number which have so essentially conditioned his vision of life that he cannot imagine who he was before he read them is, naturally, very small.... Zahl und Gesicht was for me, and still is, such a book; in such a case discussion is not called for, only gratitude and homage.\\" Ludwig Curtius wrote to him: \\"You were to me always a ‚Äòsage‚Äô like the sages of the ancient times, whom I approached as a child, which I still do today.\\" In Kassner's writings on system and order in the work Zahl und Gesicht the Swiss dramatist D√ºrrenmatt could read a premonition of later inhuman totalitarian regimes. Yet Kassner is relatively unknown; most histories of literature and philosophy do not even mention his name. Accomplishments Kassner introduced the work of William Blake to Germany. He discovered the Christian poet in Baudelaire. In 1903 he made the German public aware of the works of Andr√© Gide through his translation. Even before existential philosophy came into vogue, Kassner in his essay on Kierkegaard, which incidentally is the first German writing on Kierkegaard, had spoken about the existential predicament, the thrown-ness of man in the World. He translated from Greek, English, French and Russian. His understanding of the Indian society is full of rich insights quite different from that of a philosopher like Hegel, who had never set foot in India. Despite his physical handicap, Kassner traveled to India, met people there, saw for himself how people live there. Kassner's insights into India are an admirable example of his distinctive approach to cultural understanding and anthropology. In his own nonacademic way he was one of the most learned men of the last century. He traveled far and wide, even to inaccessible regions, despite a lifelong crippling disability. He was more widely traveled than most of his contemporaries. His knowledge of the classical world, of the oriental and occidental texts, of religion and philosophy, of history and culture, of literature and art is profound and comprehensive. He had a deep knowledge of the cultural history of modern man. He saw, as perhaps no one else saw, the internal contradictions and discontents of modernity. Kassner was immensely productive; his literary activity extends over sixty years and he was writing till the age of eighty-five. He is considered one of the greatest essayists and \\"the only German essayist who processed humor.\\" In his writings he judges severely his contemporaries and his criticisms are provocative. Given his vision and his relentless focus on man even his silences are telling. Kassner was no less an iconoclast than Nietzsche, though temperamentally he is the exact opposite of the overwrought philosopher. Mason wonders: \\"How little there is in the post-renaissance mental activities and achievements that he does not abominate!\\" But he adds, \\"There is something curiously authoritative about these denunciations of his.... They raise important issues, which have hitherto been overlooked; one cannot afford to ignore them.\\" But this criticism of his never ended up in nihilism. He was above all an anti- nihilist. Kassner speaks of being a mystic in order not to become a nihilist. Though Kassner says that he is a conservative due to the exasperation and consternation that modern world caused him, he is in no sense a reactionary, cynic, pessimist or defeatist and had no romantic yearning for the past, and no escapist delusions. Yet he is unknown. Could it be that Kassner's works were ‚Äòout of season‚Äô? In as early as 1929 Hofmannsthal wrote about Kassner's writings that \\"a not too distant future will wonder how our period that is craving for new forms and contents could neglect such fresh content in such novel forms.\\" Forty years later in 1969 Michael Schmidt comments that \\"this ‚Äòstaunende Zeit‚Äô cannot of course be ours.\\" Still a generation later in 2005 in the latest article published on Kassner Prof. Subramanian writes that even today \\"fame has eluded Kassner.\\" Kassner is variously described as ‚ÄòPhilosopher‚Äô, ‚ÄòThinker‚Äô, ‚ÄòCultural‚ÄìHistorian‚Äô, ‚ÄòPlatonist‚Äô, and ‚ÄòPhilosopher‚ÄìPoet‚Äô. One may call him a ‚Äòcultural philosopher‚Äô, for the primary object of his studies were cultures and their symbolic representations. His contributions to the understanding of Greek antiquity, ancient India and European Modernity form an essential part of his writings. It is indeed appropriate to call him a ‚Äòseer‚Äô, in the multiple sense of the term, for ‚Äòseeing‚Äô and ‚Äòvision‚Äô are central to his physiognomy. Whenever he observes, he conveys unfailingly his sense of wonderment. It is this wonderment of the seer that sets in train his deep probing inquiry bordering on the mystic, which yet again to Kassner becomes manifest when poetry affiliates to philosophy. It is his vision, his Anschauung that gives his works an intensity and luminosity. For as Kassner himself said \\"I should regard every line of my work suspect... if the knowledge and the feeling desert me that any enlightenment of man from them must work like a physical light; out of this desire arose the form, style and the language of the whole work\\". His works present a distinctive way of seeing, totally different from the current empirical methods of the social sciences. The same themes recur in Kassner again and again, in their prismatic break-up as essays, parables, dialogues and reminiscences. He visits the same zone time and again with profit. It is not as though there is no progress, indeed the progress in thought can be said to have a spiral movement, as his dogged, unflinching gaze winds itself around the phenomena. But as Eudo C. Mason suggests, Kassner's texts, given their importance and greatness are justifiably difficult. For when we seek the source of their difficulty we cannot say that his style is pedantic or jargon-filled. His sentences are always clear and sober without rhetorical flourish but laced with gentle humor and irony. It is in a sense unfortunate that he labeled his worldview physiognomy, for it was a discredited discipline and Kassner has had to an explain over and again how his physiognomy differs from traditional physiognomy.

It was created in 1963 when the roll of Kelston High School (formed in 1954) became too large for the site on the corner of Archibald and Gt North Rds. The boys moved to a new site further down Archibald Road, leaving the original site to be the home of Kelston Girls High School (now Kelston Girls' College). Although the school is known for the strength of its various sports teams, it has also had some notable achievements in music, dance and theatresports and produced some outstanding academic results. The school has consistently had strong rugby teams in the top Auckland division, producing several All Blacks and international players. Kelston Boys have won the National top 4 rugby tournament five times (1989, 1995, 1996, 1999, and 2011) sharing the most wins with Wesley College. Kelston Boys have also won the Condor National sevens tournament five times (2002, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013). The former All Black coach Graham Henry is a former headmaster. The previous principal, who retired in April 2011, Stephen Watt played for the Auckland regional team in the 1970s (where he was affectionately nicknamed 'The Kicking Prop' for his unusual goalkicking prowess). Brian Evans was the former principal; he coached the women's Black Ferns national side to rugby world cup victory in 2010. Currently, the principal of Kelston Boys' High School is Adeline Blair, who became the first woman to head a state boys' school in Auckland. Adeline Blair has been teaching at Kelston Boys' High School since 2002 but began teaching English for adults in the school's community education division in 1996. https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=12018216 Long- standing Member of Parliament and Speaker of the House of Representatives Jonathan Hunt taught history at Kelston Boys'.

The same year, the schools softball league lost only one game in the whole season. In 1995 the school won in debating against Western Springs AFC but lost to Green Bay. The same year the school had excelled in soccer by winning 1‚Äì0 against Avondale, a 4‚Äì4 draw with Mount Albert Grammar School and a 6‚Äì2 victory over Mount Roskill Grammar School. During the 1995 rugby season KBHS had won 27‚Äì0 against Papakura and had 98 wins over Rotorua Boys' High School, Te Awamutu and Morrinsville, all of which scored three each. The same year, the school won 17‚Äì0 against Saint Kentigern College in a semi-final but then lost 30‚Äì10 to Auckland Grammar School. The school was also a winner in judo at the New Zealand Secondary Schools Championships which were held in Hamilton in August 1995 and won 4 out of 5 games in badminton. In 1995 the Junior A3 Tennis won all five games. In 1997 the school's trampoline diver Todd Anderson came in first place with 134.6 points while Bruce Utatao scored 78 in golf.

After the defeat of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, Grouchy's army withdrew to Paris via Namur and Dinant, reaching Paris on 29 June, a few days before the Prussians, who camped at Versailles. While negotiating the final armistice, Exelmans was ordered to attack the Prussians at Versailles on 1 July 1815. Under attack the Prussians retreated from Versailles and headed east, but were blocked by the French at V√©lizy. They failed to re-enter Versailles and headed for Saint-Germain-en- Laye. Their first squadron came under fire at the entrance of Rocquencourt and attempted to escape through the fields. They were forced into a small, narrow street in Le Chesnay and killed or captured.

Bendel was born in Sch√∂nlinde, Bohemia, Austrian Empire. He was a student of Franz Liszt for five years in Weimar. From 1862, he lived in Berlin and taught at Theodor Kullak's Music Academy, Neue Akademie der Tonkunst. He was also the author of over four hundred compositions, many of them for the piano, including one piano concerto. Bendel was a superb pianist who toured extensively until his death from typhoid fever in Boston while on an American tour. He was aged 41. Life Franz Bendel was a son of an elementary school teacher. After the first instruction from his father, he became a student of Josef Proksch. Through his teacher, who encouraged him very much, Bendel later went to Franz Liszt in Weimar, where he also met Wendelin Wei√üheimer. In 1848, Count Otto von Westphal hired Bendel as a house and music teacher. He held this office for 14 years. Bendel had already emerged a composer by 1885 when Proksch performed a mass by him in Prague. In 1862 Bendel settled in Berlin and became a lecturer at the Neue Akademie der Tonkunst. He lived and worked there until his death, only interrupted by several small concert tours, such as Prague in 1863, which were praised in the press. In 1866, he also worked at Carl Tausig‚Äôs Schule des h√∂heren Klavierspiels for some time. As a performer as well as a creative artist, Bendel pursued the direction of the serious and solid, and his numerous trips accompanied by the best success (the last one even led him to America occasionally at the Boston Music Festival) were unable to detract from the ideality of his pursuit. He was even able to participate as a concert pianist at Patrick Gilmore‚Äôs National Peace Jubilee in Boston in 1872. Bendel was under an engagement with the Steinways for a series of eighty concerts in 1874, but typhoid fever caused his death after four days illness in July, 1873. His grave monument is located in Berlin-Mitte, Oranienburg. First French Cemetery. Legacy After his death, Bendel‚Äôs music lost much of their deserved recognition, coming as they did at a time when Wagner was revolutionizing. One of Bendel‚Äôs publishers, Augener & Co., based in London, and their journal, The Monthly Musical Record, continually reviewed his music after Bendel‚Äôs passing. In regard to his death, the journal stated, ‚Äúmuch to be regretted, and will be regretted more and more, for the qualities of his compositions are becoming increasingly rare in pianoforte music.‚Äù Some of Bendel's notable students were Silas Pratt, Edward Morris Bowman, and Max Schwarz. Style Bendel was most active as a composer. Of his compositions, including four masses, symphonies, a piano concerto, and a piano trio; the salon-style piano works and numerous songs have found widespread use. The number of his compositions for the piano (light and descriptive pieces, Fantasias, Idylls & etc.) is over one hundred. The most admired are the Fantasias on a theme from Gounod's ‚ÄúFaust and Margaret,‚Äù Meyerbeer's ‚ÄúAfrikanerin,‚Äù and the Bohemian National songs (Op. 8, 45, and 47). In Bendel's tone poems, Franz Liszt's predilection for symphonic treatment also comes to the fore. The powerful way of performing as a piano virtuoso had also become his own. Bendel's teaching under Proksch kept a remnant of inclination for seriousness and solidity in his composition. Similar to the nocturnes of John Field, Bendel wrote many Stimmungsbilder (mood pictures). His preference for mountain trips were expressed with a series of these type of pieces, with examples from Schweizer Bilder, Op. 137 and books Am Genfer See Op. 139. Some of these pieces were accompanied with a brief explanation of the content. When describing these pieces, C.F. Weitzman says, ‚ÄúBendel portrays the impressions of his journeyings in the fresh air of the valleys and heights of Switzerland; and in the ‚ÄúSechs deutsche M√§rchenbilder‚Äù (Op. 135, Hamburg, Hugo Pohle), illustrated with more striking colors, the dream-like, weird, and bizarre scenes of these Fantasiest√ºcke pass before our inner vision with dramatic animation.‚Äù For a span of time, The Monthly Musical Record reviewed Bendel's works, giving description of his different approaches to his own style. The journal introduced his Rococo-Tanz with this quote: ‚ÄúNow, Franz Bendel did not simulate qualities he did not possess; but, on the contrary, cheerfully applied himself to the cultivation of the gifts he had been endowed with, which, moreover, were worth at least as much as many gifts of a prouder and more pretentious nature. What we find in his works is elegance, grace, ease, and charm in thought, feeling, and expression, and along with this an always effective pianoforte language.‚Äù  Selected Compositions  * 2 Barcarollen, Op. 5 # Napoli # Venezia * Il Baccio, Celebre Valze d'Artini, Transcription de Concert, Op. 7 *Fantasie sur de Airs boh√®miens nationaux, Op. 8 *Souvenir de Hongrie, Polka de Concert, Op. 9 *3 Characteristische St√ºcke, Op. 10 # Am Sontag Morgen, Idylle # Scherzetto # Romanze * Weihnacht Idylle, Op. 11 * Nizza, Barcarolle, Op. 13 * Mozart, Op. 14 # Andante Favori # Menuet Favori # Adagio Favori *4 Poesion, Op. 15 # Nocturne # Schummerlied # Fr√ºhlingstraum # Rublick, Lied ohne Worte * Grand Fantasie sur l'Opera: Faust de Guonod, Op. 17 * 3 Grandes Valses, Op. 18 * Sexten Etude, Op. 27 * La Coquette, Op. 29 * La Clochette, Op. 30 * 4 Klavierst√ºcke, Op. 40 # Scherzetto # Nocturno # Schummerlied # Kleiner Walzer * 4 Klavierst√ºcke, Op. 41 # Impromptu #Lied ohne Worte # Etwas Seltames # Leid ohne Worte * Souvenir de Tyrol, Op. 49 * Polkas de Salon pour le Piano, Op.58.

Career Before his NFL career, Breeden played for North Carolina Central University. After graduating college, he was selected by the Bengals in the seventh round of the 1977 NFL draft.NFL DraftTracker He ended up missing the entire 1977 season on injured reserve, but in 1978, he became a starter and immediately made a big impact for Cincinnati, intercepting 3 passes and recovering 2 fumbles.Football Database Breeden once again had injury problems during the 1979 season, playing just 10 games and recording no interceptions, but he came back full- time in 1980, and ended up leading the Bengals with a career-high 7 picks. In 1981, Breeden set a Bengals record in a game against the San Diego Chargers by intercepting a pass from Chargers future hall of fame quarterback Dan Fouts and returning it 102 yards for a touchdown, helping his team win the game 40‚Äì17. To this day it is the longest play in franchise history, although it has been tied by Eric Bieniemy's 102 yard kickoff return in 1997 against the New York Giants, and Artrell Hawkins' 102 yard interception return in 2002 against the Houston Texans. Breeden finished the season with 4 interceptions, 145 return yards, 1 touchdown, and a fumble recovery, assisting the Bengals to a 12‚Äì4 regular season record. Cincinnati advanced through the postseason to the AFC championship game, where they once again faced Fouts' Chargers, this time in one of the coldest games in NFL history (it later became known as the Freezer Bowl). Just like in the previous game, Breeden had a key interception that helped his team win the game. After the Bengals built a 17‚Äì7 lead, Breeden intercepted a pass from Fouts on the Chargers 5-yard line to prevent them from responding with a score. The Chargers never scored again for the rest of the game and the Bengals ended up winning the game 27‚Äì7, and advanced to their first championship game in franchise history, Super Bowl XVI.

Near the city is the Pre- Columbian Maya archaeological site of Comalcalco. The literal English translation of \\"Comalcalco\\" is \\"In the house of the comals\\". A comal is a pan used to prepare food. Demography The present-day city of Comalcalco reported a 2005 census population of 39,865 inhabitants, while the municipality of which it serves as municipal seat had a population of 173,773. The city is the third-largest community in the state of Tabasco, behind Villahermosa and C√°rdenas. The municipality, which has an area of 723.19 km¬≤ (279.225 sq mi), includes many smaller outlying communities, the largest of which are Tecolutilla, Chichicapa, Aldama, and Miguel Hidalgo. Archaeological site The site of Comalcalco, whose coordinates are 18¬∞16‚Ä≤N 93¬∞10‚Ä≤W, is notable for two characteristics. First, it is the westernmost known Maya settlement. Second, and due to a dearth of locally available limestone (the primary material used in architectural construction), the city's buildings were made from fired-clay bricks held together with mortar made from oyster shells. The use of bricks at Comalcalco was unique among Maya sites, and many of them are decorated with iconography and/or glyphs. Important architectural features include the northern plaza and two pyramids, the Gran Acropolis and the Acropolis Este. Economy Comalcalco has fertile soil. Large amounts of tropical products are grown. Corn and beans and vegetables are also cultivated. Cocoa is the largest harvest in Comalcalco. Comalcalco produces 20% of the cocoa harvested in the state of Tabasco. Also coconut, avocado, and some tropical fruits are important in some zones. Livestock raising, even though it is not widely practiced, is of high quality, most ranchers have their farms just sideout of Comalcalco, away from urban development. Comalcalco produces 5% of the total extracted petroleum in the state of Tabasco. History In 1820, the river Mazacalapa was drying up, and many of the families made residence in the middle of the river on an island. The Government of the State of Tabasco; consisting of Juan Mariano Sale, Antonio Solana and Fausto Gordillo, and all members of the congress; established a town in October, and named it Isidro de Comcalco. The decree was published by Don Marcelino Margalli, governor of the state and Jose Mariano Troncoso, who was secretary of the state. The town is located in the Comalcalco municipalities, and on November 14 of 1834 the first local government was created.

It is operated by the Saint Kentigern Trust Board which also operates Saint Kentigern Boys' School, Saint Kentigern Girls' School and Saint Kentigern Preschool based in 2 different campuses in Remuera. Established in 1953, the college is semi-coeducational with a single- gender Middle College for years 7 and 8, with years 9 and 10 single-gender in core subjects and a co-educational Senior College for years 11‚Äì13. Kentigern (or Mungo) is the patron Saint of Glasgow. In 2003, the college introduced girls into the school for the first time with 140 female students. There are now over 540 female students attending, with numbers increasing every year. Saint Kentigern College is an IB World School offering the IB Diploma Programme for Year 12 and 13 students. The Saint Kentigern Trust Board approved the decision in late 2006. The course was first offered to Year 12 students in 2009. History Saint Kentigern College opened in 1953 on a rural site from the centre of Auckland, bordering the waters of the Tamaki Estuary. With ninety foundation pupils and a staff of four, the College was the realisation of a dream for a group of Presbyterian ministers and laymen who had established the Saint Kentigern Trust in 1949Our History. Saint Kentigern College. 2010/05/22 to found a school for 'the acquisition of knowledge, for the glory of God, and the benefit of mankind, a proper discipline of mind and body, and a life of service to others.' The College took the name of the patron saint of Glasgow, Saint Kentigern, who is also affectionately known in Scotland as Mungo. The foundation Headmaster of the College, chosen in 1952, was a Scottish minister, the Reverend Adam MacFarlan. With a distinguished academic record at the University of Glasgow and a Military Cross from active service in World War II, MacFarlan led the College from its beginnings until his retirement in 1983. In 1972 he was awarded the Doctor of Divinity degree by his old university for services to education in New Zealand, and on his retirement was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to education and the community, in the 1983 Queen's Birthday Honours. As its second Headmaster, Saint Kentigern College chose an Old Boy, Nigel Toy. During his leadership, the College grew from 700 to over 1000 students and a building programme saw significant new facilities, including the Sir William Goodfellow Memorial Library and a new classroom block, as well as refurbished dormitories and new residential lodges at Bruce House, the College boarding hostel, where Toy had once been Head Prefect. In 1997, Toy left New Zealand to take up a leadership position at St George's School, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was succeeded as Headmaster at Saint Kentigern by the Reverend David Williams, formerly Chaplain to the College. In his four years as Headmaster, he led major initiatives in pastoral care and information technology. Major landscaping changes enabled the development of the exceptionally designed Saint Kentigern Old Boy's Sports Centre as well as a range of new sports fields, and opened the way for the possibility of girls' education at Saint Kentigern in its second half-century. Williams left in 2001 when he was appointed Headmaster of Kinross-Wollaroi School in Orange, New South Wales, Australia. He was succeeded by Warren Peat, who from a background of teaching in New Zealand co-educational schools was charged with leading the College in its introduction of girls and significant campus development. With Peat in the position of Executive Head, Saint Kentigern College was restructured as a Senior School and Middle School and the roll rose to over 1600 boys and girls. As well as the Elizabeth MacFarlan Centre for girls, the magnificent Art and Technology complex and the extensively re-developed Music and Science buildings provided impressive specialist facilities for an expanding College. Peat attracted a large staff of men and women, highly qualified across a wide range of subject disciplines, and challenged both staff and students to set the highest standards in all their endeavours. Major academic initiatives under his leadership saw both strong achievement in NCEA assessments and the endorsement of the College as an IB World School, authorised to teach the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Saint Kentigern College Executive Head Warren Peat left at the end of 2008 to become headmaster of John Paul College, near Brisbane, Australia. He stated that there was \\"an offer he couldn't refuse\\". Stephen Cole then took up the role of headmaster. Cole left Saint Kentigern at the end of Term 1, 2017. The position of Head of College was then disestablished and replaced with separate positions for Principal of Middle College (Years 7‚Äì10) and Principal of Senior College (Years 11‚Äì13). At the same time a new role as Head of Saint Kentigern was created with former headmaster of Rangitoto College, David Hodge taking up the position. Moving away from the separate middle college and senior college model, Russell Brooke is now the new principal of Saint Kentigern College. Brooke came from ACG Parnell College. School structure The school's houses are named after Scottish Presbyterian church members, each of whom died for their cause (martyrs), and could be considered to have given their all for their faith. Students are allocated into one of the six houses and compete throughout the year in house competitions.

The school has a tennis and golf academy for students who excel in the two sports respectively. Saint Kentigern has dominated tennis, golf, rugby, cycling and triathlon competitions in the last decade. Many school teams such as the rugby, hockey and cricket teams play in the top grades, while the Cycling and Triathlon programme (under the governance of Mr Rick Faulding) has thrived. Saint Kentigern College holds several Auckland cycling records and national titles. In triathlon, the College has many national titles also. Rugby Saint Kentigern College is noted for its rugby presence, producing All Blacks such as Joe Rokocoko, John Afoa and Jerome Kaino, all of whom were members of the Auckland 1A 1XV championship side in 2001. The 1st XV are previous holders of the Moascar cup. Firstly in 1981, defeating Wesley, and again in 1999 when they defeated, the then World champion, Kelston Boys 18- 14. Other notable years were in 1996, 1998 and 2000 where they were Runners up in the 1A competition. 2001 saw the 1st XV eclipse the previous year's 1A competition and storm the championship in their defeat of King's College in the final. The 1st XV was relegated from 1A in 2003, but promoted back to the premier grade in 2005 after going undefeated in the 1B competition. Since then Saint Kentigern College has had a profound impact and presence on the current Auckland 1A competition. The Saint Kentigern 1st XV won back to back 1A titles in 2011 and 2012, its first Top 4 National Championship in 2012, and back to back Co-educational National Titles in 2010 and 2011. As a result of winning the Top 4 National Final, the 2013 First XV had been invited to the Sanix Youth World Invitational Tournament. The tournament was staged in early May, where the 1st XV defeated Hartpury College to take the world championship title. The team then went on to win their third consecutive Auckland 1A title in 2013 with a last-minute penalty. They became the first-ever side to win a three-peat of 1A rugby titles. Saint Kentigern has also gone on to win the 2015 and 2017 Auckland 1A competition. In 2019 Saint Kentigern won the CO-ED division in the national 1XV Championships beating Feilding High School 29-22. Notable Alumni of the Rugby Program include John Afoa, Joe Rokocoko, Jerome Kaino, Steve Surridge, and Seta Tamanivalu who have represented New Zealand (All Blacks). Another notable player who had attended Saint Kentigern for a short time was Kieran Read. In more recent times there has been a resurgence in Saint Kentigern old boys playing at Super Rugby level. TJ Faiane, Sione Mafileo, Matt Duffie, Dalton Papalii, Sam Nock, Blake Gibson, Finlay Christie, and Tanielu Tele‚Äôa are Saint Kentigern old boys in the current Blues (Super Rugby) squad. Other former St. Kentigern old boys who play in the Super Rugby competition are: Etene Nanai- Seturo - Chiefs (rugby union), Tiaan Tauakipulu - New South Wales Waratahs, Ere Enari - Crusaders (rugby union), Braydon Ennor - Crusaders (rugby union), Pari Pari Parkinson - Highlanders (rugby union), Tevita Mafileo - Hurricanes (rugby union) and Scott Scrafton - Hurricanes (rugby union). In addition, there are few old collegians who play in the Premiership Rugby in England and some in the Top 14 (french rugby competition). There is also a couple of old boys playing in the National Rugby League, the 2011 Saint Kentigern's college 1XV captain Albert Vete who currently plays for Melbourne Storm and Suliasi Vunivalu who is also in the current Melbourne Storm team. Vunivalu was dubbed the highest try scorer for the club in 2016. It's been announced that Vunivalu has signed a deal to play for Queensland Reds in the Super Rugby competition starting from 2021. Another notable mention is the Saint Kentigern old boys who are in the current New Zealand national under-20 rugby union team: Rivez Reihana, Tamaiti Williams, and Etene Nanai-Seturo. Rivez and Tamiti are in the development sides for the chiefs and crusaders respectively. Demographics The 2009 Education Review Office (ERO) report states that the school have 129 qualified teachers and 1634 students (11 of which are international). The gender composition is 66% male and 34% female out of which 71% are PƒÅkehƒÅ, 9% are Chinese and 3% are Indian. The MƒÅori, Irish, British and Koreans represent 2% each of the school population while Australians, Samoans, Taiwanese, and other Asian and Pacific represent 1% each.

It is located in the south-western suburbs of Paris, from the center of Paris, in the \\"new town\\" of Saint-Quentin-en- Yvelines. Geography The commune of Guyancourt comprises several districts. The first of them, corresponding to the old village, is known as \\"le village\\", the others are named: * Bouviers (Herdsmen), ancient hamlet of the village * Les Garennes (the warrens) * L'Europe (Europe) * Le Pont du Routoir (the bridge over the retting pit) * Les Saules (the Willows) * Le Parc (the Park) * Les Ch√™nes (the Oaks) * Villaroy (the recently constructed districts of the city) The bordering communes are Versailles to the northeast, Voisins-le- Bretonneux to the southwest, Montigny-le-Bretonneux to the west, Ch√¢teaufort to the southeast, Magny-les-Hameaux to the south and Saint-Cyr-l'Ecole in the northwest. Although located in the Paris suburbs (in an Anglo-Saxon conception of suburbs), more than half of the territory of the commune of Guyancourt is covered in natural spaces: forests, wood, parks, gardens and ponds. History=Prehistoric The site of the city was already inhabited by Neolithic tribes who left hundreds of vestiges such as arrows, flint scrapers, polished axes... which have been recovered in the districts of Bouviers, Troux and Villaroy. Antiquity The civilization continued through Roman times, as Mr. Lecl√®re, a farmer, demonstrated in a fortuitous way in 1892 by unearthing an antique ballot box in his field. The religious life Work to restore the church Saint-Victor put the date of the sarcophages at the Merovingian era (from the seventh century). It is believed that the construction of the first church dates from the fourteenth century. Several funerary vases and a tomb stone dating from the sixteenth century were updated. The church was renovated in the fifteenth century, then entirely rebuilt in the sixteenth century. The most recent restoration goes back to 1998. Guyancourt and the Palace of Versailles Guyancourt forms part of the \\"Grand Parc\\" of the sun king Soleil (Louis XIV), which extended around the castle of Versailles. The essential vocation of the populous communes neighbouring the castle is market-gardening, to provide for the important needs for the Court. French revolution Thanks to the register of grievances sent to the governmental authorities (1789), we know that Guyancourtois, who were mostly modest peasants, lived with difficulty under conditions of famine. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 France is partly occupied by the Prussian armies. The enemy spreads terror, the houses are plundered, the inhabitants maltreated. Four hundred of them (an enormous figure for the time) prefer to flee. The 1900s At the beginning of the twentieth century, Guyancourt was a large village where one cultivates corn, oats, beets, fodder and potatoes. The trades were numerous, with almost 16 wine merchants for 614 inhabitants. =First World War= The war of 1914‚Äì1918 cost the lives of thirty-six Guyancourtois. =Second World war= The war of 1939‚Äì1945 also touched Guyancourt, which was liberated by August 25, 1944. =The end of the twentieth century= Starting from the beginning of the 1950s, the Paris area saw a considerable demographic growth. To structure the development of the suburbs, it was decided to create several new towns around Paris, one of which being Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. The new city of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines includes today seven communes (eleven in the beginning), one of which is Guyancourt. In 1950 Guyancourt was only one small village. The commune grew since 1970 to reach the figure of 27,000 inhabitants in 2004.

playwright, whose works include twenty-five plays, and screenplays for three films (in collaboration with Nikolai Erdman).  Life =Early life Evgeny Schwartz was born in Kazan, Russia, into a physician's family. His father was a baptized Jew, his mother Russian. In 1910 he studied law at Moscow University, where he also became involved in theater and poetry. He was drafted into the army at the end of 1916 to serve on the front. After the Bolshevik Revolution he joined the Whites and served under general Kornilov. He suffered injuries and shell-shock during the storming of Yekaterinodar in 1918, lost several teeth and acquired a tremor of the hands that plagued him for the rest of his life. After the end of Russian Civil War, Schwartz studied theater in Rostov-on-Don. In 1921 he moved with the theater troupe to Petrograd, becoming involved with the \\"Serapion Brothers,\\" a literary group including Ivanov, Zoschenko and Kaverin. In 1923 he moved to Bakhmut and began to publish satirical verse and reviews in the local newspaper. With Mikhail Slonimsky and Nikolay Oleynikov, he organized the literary magazine Slaughter in 1925. Career In 1924, Schwartz returned to Leningrad to become an employee of Gosizdat, Children's Department of State Publishing House, under the administration of Samuil Marshak. He became an author of the children's magazines Hedgehog and Siskin. He also wrote children's books, including The Story of Old Balalaika (1924), The Adventures of Shura and Marousi (1937), Alien Girl (1937) and First Grader (1949). During this time, he also became associated with members of the avant- garde literary group OBERIU. In 1929 Evgeny Schwartz began collaborating with Nikolay Akimov at the Leningrad Comedy Theater, writing contemporary plays based on the folk and fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. These included Golyi korol (The Emperor's New Clothes) (1934), Krasnaya Shapochka (Little Red Riding Hood) (1936), Zolushka (Cinderella) (1938), Snezhnaya Koroleva (The Snow Queen, after Hans Christian Andersen) (1938), Tyen (The Shadow, after Hans Christian Andersen) (1940), Drakon (The Dragon, an original) (1944), and Obyknovennoye Chudo (An Ordinary Miracle) (1956). At the beginning of World War II, Schwartz wrote Under the Linden Trees of Berlin (1941) with Zoschenko. During the war, he wrote One Night and The Far Country. After the war, Schwartz wrote An Ordinary Miracle and The Tale of the Brave Soldiers. Schwartz's adaptations of The Snow Queen and The Shadow were adapted as movies in 1966 and 1971. He also completed film scripts for Cinderella, First Grader, Don Quixote and Ordinary Miracle. He died in Leningrad. Plays=The Dragon In 1944, Schwartz completed the satirical play The Dragon, which was seen as subversive in the political climate of post-war Russia. The play tells the story of the knight Lancelot, who sets out to slay the dragon. However, in his quest, he stumbles on a community governed by a bureaucratic hierarchy using the dragon to cover their own use of power. A filmed version, To Kill a Dragon, was produced in 1988. This play, the most \\"mature\\" of Schwartz's plays, is a political satire aimed at totalitarianism in all forms. The plot is based on the attempt of the hero, Lancelot, to liberate people in a land suffering under Dragon's brutal rule. But his efforts meet with resistance, since most of the people have gotten used to the Dragon and considered his methods, though harsh, the only possible way; their souls become, in a way, crippled with this inability and unwillingness to resist. Says the Dragon in the play: \\"You see, the human soul is very resilient. Cut the body in half ‚Äî and the man croaks. But tear the soul apart ‚Äî and it only becomes more pliable, that's all. No, really, you couldn't pick a finer assortment of souls anywhere. Only in my town. Souls with no hands. Souls with no legs. Mute souls, deaf souls, chained souls, snitch souls, damned souls.\\" Lancelot killing the Dragon in a fight did not free the people; all that changed was the Burgomaster acceding to the position formerly occupied by the Dragon and demanding that Elsa, the same girl who was destined to be sacrificed to the Dragon, become his wife. When Lancelot returns to the town a year later, he realizes that his task is much more complex: \\"This is going to be a very meticulous job... We have to kill the dragon in each one of them.\\" The Ordinary Miracle This is a romantic and philosophical parable on love and relationship between the creator and his creation. This play was made into films in 1964 and in 1978.

They may be numbered consecutively in the score, and may be interspersed with recitative or spoken dialogue. Opera numbers may be arias, but also ensemble pieces, such as duets, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets or choruses. They may also be ballets and instrumental pieces, such as marches, sinfonias, or intermezzi.Apel, p. 582. The number opera format was standard until the mid-19th century and most opera genres, including opera seria, opera buffa, op√©ra comique, ballad opera, Singspiel, and grand opera, were constructed in this fashion. The replacement of numbers with more continuous music began in operas by Jommelli, Traetta, Gluck, and especially Mozart, whose late operas Le Nozze di Figaro and Don Giovanni contain several segments in which different numbers are unified by bridge passages to form a musical whole. This trend became even more striking in the operas of the German composers Beethoven, Weber, and Meyerbeer, while their Italian and French contemporaries Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and Auber retained the number opera style. The number opera was strongly condemned by Wagner for dramatic reasons, and he replaced it with continuous music that advances the drama without interruption. The number opera became unfashionable, and the late operas of Verdi and those of Puccini and the Verismo school, cannot be described as such. Many operatic composers subsequent to Wagner adopted his approach. However, in the 20th century some composers intentionally revived or adapted the number opera format, e. g., Busoni's Arlecchino (1917),Chris Walton, \\"Neo-classical opera\\" in Cooke, p. 108.Busoni, Ferruccio (1918). Arlecchino. Part.-Biibl. 1700. Leipzig: Breitkopf & H√§rtel. See this work page of the International Music Score Library Project. Accessed 3 October 2009. Berg's Wozzeck (1925), Hindemith's Cardillac (1926, rev. 1952), and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress (1951). In operetta and in popular music theatre, number opera format has remained the norm.

It is a kind of stroke or other form of arterial thrombosis caused by embolism of a thrombus (blood clot), air, tumor, fat, or amniotic fluid of venous origin, which travels to the arterial side through a lateral opening in the heart, such as a patent foramen ovale, or arteriovenous shunts in the lungs. The opening is typically an atrial septal defect, but can also be a ventricular septal defect. Paradoxical embolisms represent two percent of arterial emboli. Pathophysiology Passage of a clot (thrombus) from a systemic vein to a systemic artery. When clots in systemic veins break off (embolize), they travel first to the right side of the heart and, normally, then to the lungs where they lodge, causing pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, when there is a hole at the septum, either upper chambers of the heart (an atrial septal defect) or lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defects), a clot can cross from the right to the left side of the heart, then pass into the systemic arteries as a paradoxical embolism. Once in the arterial circulation, a clot can travel to the brain, block a vessel there, and cause a stroke (cerebrovascular accident). Diagnosis CT angiography; bubble echocardiography may also be used to detect a patent foramen ovale. Treatment Therapeutic preventional anticoagulation is first line, if correction of the underlying anatomical pathology is not already done, by using Heparin or other anticoagulative agents. This approach is also used in the treatment of a present embolism, albeit at higher doses. Once these are exhausted or the use of therapeutic anticoagulation is contraindicated (for example, in a cooccurring traumatic hemorrhage), mechanical thrombectomy may be used to physically remove the embolism from the blocked artery.

Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Dyer was ordained as an apostle on October 5, 1967, (but was not added as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles) and subsequently was set apart as a counselor in the First Presidency to church president David O. McKay. After McKay's death in 1970, Dyer was returned to a position as an Assistant to the Twelve Apostles, and later to the First Quorum of the Seventy when it was reconstituted in 1976. Dyer is the only person in the history of the LDS Church to serve in the First Quorum of Seventy after having been ordained to the office of Apostle.  Life  Raised in Utah, Dyer was an accomplished baseball player as a youth, but put baseball aside to serve as a missionary for the LDS Church in the Eastern States Mission from 1922 to 1924. In 1926, he was married to May Elizabeth Jackson in the Salt Lake Temple. After his mission, Dyer had the opportunity to play professional baseball, but declined the offer because he would have to play on Sundays.\\"Elder Alvin R. Dyer Dies,\\" Ensign, May 1977, p. 119. Instead, he studied mechanical drafting and technical engineering in order to become a sheet metal journeyman. He later managed the heating and air conditioning department of Utah Builders Supply. Eventually, he formed the Dyer Distributing Company which he owned until 1954, when he dissolved all his business interests upon being called to full-time service as a mission president in the church. Alvin R. Dyer's grave marker In addition to his service as a general authority, Dyer served in many capacities within the church, holding such positions as bishop and stake high councilor. He served as president over the Central States Mission of the church beginning in 1954, and over the European Mission from 1960 to 1962. While leading the European Mission, Dyer was an enthusiastic supporter of Henry D. Moyle's Baseball Baptism Program that accelerated the rate of baptisms among young people. He told the missionaries, \\"you can teach ... everything that a person needs to know to be baptized in this Church in less than three minutes. Aside from his business and church activities, Dyer was active in both the Missouri Historical Society and the Jackson County Historical Society. He authored a book on LDS Church history in Missouri, The Refiner's Fire, Historical Highlights of Missouri (Deseret Book, 1960). In 1961, Dyer taught that the reason most negroes were prohibited from being ordained to priesthood offices was because they were descended from Cain and thus were a \\"cursed lineage\\".\\"For What Purpose?,\\" Missionary Conference, Oslo, Norway, March 18, 1961, printed in The Negro in Mormon Theology, pp. 48‚Äì58. Church president Spencer W. Kimball announced the end of these restrictions in 1978. In August 1967, McKay resolved to appoint Dyer as one of his counselors. McKay made the decision without consulting his other counselors Hugh B. Brown and N. Eldon Tanner. The appointment caused some tension between Brown and Tanner and the newly called Dyer over what Dyer's role would be and whether his calling was as a counselor \\"to\\" the First Presidency or \\"in\\" the first presidency. In 1972, Dyer suffered a stroke that limited his activity. He died at his home in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1977. See also *Joseph T. Bentley NotesExternal links *Grampa Bill's G.A. Pages: Alvin R.

Inspiration \\"When Geoffrey McSkimming was a boy he found an old motion-picture projector and a tin containing a dusty home movie in his grandmother's attic. He screened the film and was transfixed by the flickering image of a man in a jaunty pith helmet, baggy Sahara shorts and special desert sun-spectacles. The man had an imposing macaw and a clever looking camel, and Geoffrey Mcskimming was mesmerised by their activities in black-and-white Egypt, Peru, Greece, Mexico, Sumatra, Turkey, Italy and other exotic locations. Years later he discovered the identities of the trio, and has spent much of his time since then retracing their footsteps, interviewing surviving members of the Old Relics Society, and gradually reconstructing the lost true tales of Cairo Jim, which have become the enormously successful Cairo Jim chronicles.\\"Text taken from Cairo Jim and the Sumptuous Stash of Silenus, published in Australia and New Zealand in 2005 by Hachette Children's Books Australia, an imprint of Hachette Livre Australia Pty Ltd.

The aqueduct fell into disuse with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, but was fully restored nearly a millennium later during the Italian Renaissance to take its current form as the Acqua Vergine. The Aqua Virgo was completed in 19 BC by Marcus Agrippa, during the reign of the emperor Augustus.Ovid, Fast. I.464Frontinus, de aquis I.4, 10, 18, 22; II.70, 84 Its source is just before the 8th milestone north of the Via Collatina, in a marshy area about 3 km from the Via Praenestina. It was also supplemented by several feeder channels along its course. The name is thought to be derived from the purity and clarity of the water because it does not chalk significantly. According to a legend repeated by Frontinus, thirsty Roman soldiers asked a young girl for water who directed them to the springs that later supplied the aqueduct; Aqua Virgo was named after her. The only remains above ground, in via del Nazzareno Along its more-than-20 km length, the aqueduct dropped only 4m to reach Rome in the centre of the Campus Martius. At its height, the aqueduct was capable of supplying more than 100,000 cubic metres of water every day. The aqueduct ran underground for nearly all of its length except the last stretch of 1,835m running on arches in the Campus Martius area, of which one section remains in via del Nazzareno. Claudius renovated it 46 AD as witnessed by an inscription on the architrave which states that he rebuilt large sections of the aqueduct at this point because Caligula had removed stone for use in constructing an amphitheatre. In 537 CE, the Goths besieging Rome tried to use this underground channel as a secret route to invade Rome according to Procopius. After deteriorating with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Aqua Virgo was repaired by Pope Adrian I in the 8th century. In 1453, Pope Nicholas V made a complete restoration and extensive remodelling from its source to its terminus points between the Pincio and the Quirinale and within Campo Marzio and consecrated it Acqua Vergine. This also led the water to the Trevi Fountain and the fountains of Piazza del Popolo, which it still serves today. In the 1930s, a pressurised version was built, the Acqua Vergine Nuovo, separate from the other channels. The aqueduct can be visited below the Spanish Steps and the Villa Medici, where a spiral staircase in perfect condition still leads to the underground conduit.  Written sources on ancient Roman aqueducts  Vitruvius, a Roman architect who worked for Caesar and Augustus, wrote the De Architectura, or in English, On Architecture. This work, probably written between 30-27 BCE but possibly even as late as 23 BCE, owes its survival to the palace scriptorium of Charlemagne. One concept contained in the De Architectura is that the quality of an architectural work depends on the social relevance of an artist‚Äôs work, not the form or workmanship of the work itself. Another assertion from Vitruvius is that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas, utilitas, and vinustas (in English, it must be strong and durable, useful, and beautiful and graceful). Sextus Julius Frontinus (Frontinus) wrote the Aqueducts of Rome which is a study of the water supply of the Roman Empire. He points out that the welfare of the urban community of Rome depends on the quality of the water supply.  Route through Rome  Map of Rome with Aqua Virgo in red Much research has been done on the aqueducts of ancient Rome, primarily to chart the course of these aqueducts from their sources in Rome and secondarily, tracing their routes from the points of entry to the terminal distribution centers or castella. Complementing the aqueducts already in use not only in terms of geographical distribution but also in functions served, the Aqua Virgo was one of the most specialized main aqueducts of ancient Rome. The Aqua Virgo entered the city from the north over the Pincian and ran 700 paces from a point of entry under the Horti Lucullani to a place in the Campus Martius in front of the Saepta Julia. Easily being traceable today, the 700 paces spanning arches starts in the triangle formed by the modern-day streets of Capo le Case, Due Macelli, and South Giuseppe. From this point, it ran to the Trevi Fountain where it then turned westward and crossed the Via Lata at the Palazzo Sciarra. Crossing many arches from this point still more arches were discovered in 1871 even though Frontinus wrote that they ended at the Saepta, also short of the 700 paces he described for their length. After later interpretation, it has been found that the aqueduct‚Äôs arches did continue along the Via del Seminario to a point east of the Pantheon. During the 17th century extensive lead piping was found in front of the church of Saint Ignazio where many believed this to be the terminal distribution for the aqueduct although this theory has since been put to scrutiny in the light of recent evidence. Due to the main reasons for the Aqua Virgo of supplying Agrippa‚Äôs baths as well as supply water to the inadequately served regions VII, IX, and XIV in the city of Rome the aqueduct continued beyond the Pantheon and the baths. The water was carried across the bridge of Agrippa after it was first transported from the low area of the Campus Martius over the higher ground of the ridge surrounding the Pantheon basin by using the baths drainage system as well as the Stagnum (an artificial lake) and the Euripus (an artificial channel for swimming) where it was drained into the Tiber River.  Construction tools = Levels  Besides standard water levels similar to those used by contractors today, other kinds of levels were in use during ancient Roman times. * The chorobates, a bench with weighted strings on its sides for measuring the angle of the ground. It had a system of notches and a short channel in the middle which could have been used for determining the direction of water flow. * The dioptra was another kind of level which rested on the ground and was adjusted on the top with precision screws for checking the angle of various objects by looking through pivoting sights. Vitruvius explains that while the chorobates may seem to be superior to the dioptra in a project such as the aqueducts, the chorobates is not immune to wind disturbing the plummets on the device (weighted strings) the dioptra and water levels were immune to this. * The groma is another surveying tool in use during the ancient Roman times. Although none survive intact today partial pieces of them are believed to be found in the tomb of Lucius Aebutius Faustus and in a surveyor‚Äôs workshop in the remains of Pompeii. A possible reconstruction of this device from these remains is that it might have been a shaft with iron-sheeted enclosed wooden arms in the shape of a cross at the top, and bronze angle-brackets near the center of the arms to help prevent inaccuracy and wear of the wood with a plumb line hanging near the end of each of the arms. The plumb-bobs at the end of the lines were paired in two, opposite of each other from the arms. One would sight down the plummet to its opposite side to get a reading when the cross was off center. The cross was placed on a bracket and not directly on the shaft. The bottom of the bracket fitted into a bronze collar set into the top of the staff. The distance horizontally across from the center of the cross was 23.5 cm while the staff may have been as long as 2m. To use the groma sights could be set onto a second groma a distance away from the first, then two more gromas were positioned the same distance as the first to the second away from the first two at right angles to form a square. The groma enabled the survey of straight lines, squares, rectangles and other geometric shapes. * A portable sundial was also available for use during this time as was evident from remains found in Pompeii. Not only could it tell time, it could also sight buildings from each other. * The libella was another leveling instrument in use during this time and consisted of an A shaped frame with a horizontal bar on top. A plumbline from the apex was suspended down to the lower bar indicating when the instrument was level.  Lifting Tools  Modern day windlass used for an Anchor Many lifting tools would have been in use during the Roman times in the construction of temples, tall buildings, bridges, and arches to move large stone blocks and materials from for example a quarry to the job site and then lifted into place. * The windlass consists of a drum on a horizontal axle anchored against displacement. Tensioning a rope to the drum by using some form of a grip the drum is rotated. The windlass would have been used in cranes during the Roman times. * The toothed wheel is the most primitive gear and was used by Egyptians to lift water by one gear turned on a horizontal axis which would turn another gear on a vertical axis. * To lift water the Romans used a tool called a tympanum which consisted of a large wheel with many internal sectional chambers. * Another water lifting device was the cochlea which consisted of spiral turning inside a tube. * A Ctesibica machina is a pump device which could lift water a large height. As described by Vitruvius: > It is to be made of bronze. The lower part consists of two similar cylinders > at a small distance apart, with outlet pipes. These pipes converge like the > prongs of a fork, and meet in a vessel placed in the middle. In this vessel, > valves are to be accurately fitted above the top openings of the pipes. And > the valves by closing the mouths of the pipes retain what has been forced by > air into the vessel. Above the vessel, a cover like an inverted funnel is > fitted and attached, by a pin well wedged, so that the force of the incoming > water may not cause the cover to rise. On the cover of the pip, which is > called a trumpet, is jointed to it, and made vertical. The cylinders have, > below the lower mouths of the pipes, valves inserted above the openings in > their bases. Pistons are now inserted from above rounded on the lathe, and > well oiled. Being thus enclosed in the cylinders, they are worked with > piston rods and levers. The air and water in the cylinders, since the valves > close the lower openings, the pistons drive onwards. By such inflation and > the consequent pressure, they force the water through the orifices of the > pipes into the vessel. The funnel receives water and forces it out by > pneumatic pressure through a pipe. A reservoir is provided, and in this way > water is supplied from below for fountains.  Construction  Vaulted Ceiling Most of the ancient aqueducts were gravity systems, that is by ensuring the source was higher than the termination and plotting a uniform course for the aqueduct to follow a downward gradient, gravity would provide all the power needed for the water to flow. The aqueducts were for most of their length, channels about 50 cm to one meter below ground, tunnels, and pipes and only the final stretches of the aqueducts used arches. The channels were made of three kinds of material, masonry (the most common form), lead pipes, and terracotta. These channels were made using a ‚Äúcut and cover‚Äù technique where the channel path was cut into the ground and then covered in order to easily access the channels that were in need of repair. The floors and walls of the channels were lined with cement and the roof was usually a vault. The cement was usually as high as the water would reach, which was meant to be about a half to two thirds full. Lining the walls and floor with cement served three purposes, protect against leaks and seepage, to provide a smooth contact surface, and to make the contact surface continuous and joint free from one end to the other. In order to maintain the slight downward gradient, the aqueducts didn‚Äôt follow a direct route to Rome but instead used the lay of the land. Typically, the gradient was shallow to make the water flow slower so less repairs would be needed due to quicker water flows causing damage and too shallow of a gradient meant that the water would not flow at all. Different degrees of gradient were used for different reasons. While traveling through a tunnel for example, a steeper gradient could be used to speed up water flow. Since inside the tunnel repairs were less likely to be needed the water could flow at a higher rate requiring a steeper gradient and then once through the tunnel the gradient would need to increase in order for the water to be slowed back down to its average speed. In later times, the use of high arches across valleys and plains were employed for the aqueducts and some were even as high as 27m off the ground.  Costs  The aqueducts at first were financed mainly through wealth collected from war and the patronage of wealthy individuals. Taxes also served to help finance the building by taxation on conquered people because the aqueducts were never meant to pay for themselves but serve as a benefit to the people of Rome. In Republic times the private use of aqueduct water was not common, only the overflow water was sold to individuals. In Imperial times the construction of more aqueducts meant that more water was available to be sold for private use.  Locating the source  The source of the water was an empirical science in that when the source was obvious such as a spring, lake, or stream, the engineer had to determine the quality of the water. The engineer had to test the taste, clarity, and flow of the water as well as the physique and complexity of the local people who drank it. Soils and rock types were also used as indicators. Clay was regarded as a poor source while red tufa was considered pure.  Acqua Vergine  The Acqua Vergine is the Renaissance restoration of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct. In 1453, Pope Nicholas V renovated the main channels of the Aqua Virgo and added numerous secondary conduits under Campo Marzio. The original terminus, called a mostra, which means showpiece, was the stately, dignified wall fountain designed by Leon Battista Alberti in Piazza dei Crociferi. Due to several additions and modifications to the end- most points of the conduits during the years that followed, during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the Acqua Vergine culminated in several magnificent mostre - the Trevi Fountain and the fountains of Piazza del Popolo.  Courses  Two separate aqueducts emerge from the source for the Acqua Vergine unlike the Aqua Virgo: * Acqua Vergine Antica, which travels underground through some of the same channels constructed by Agrippa's engineers, proceeds into Rome on the northeast under Via di Pietralata, at a point formerly called Fosso Pietralata, crosses Via Nomentana, flows westward toward and through the park of Villa Ada, passes under the western limits of the Villa Borghese, traverses the gardens of Villa Medici, descends the Pincio to Piazza di Spagna, extends under Renaissance Rome to burst forth into the Roman sky in the spectacular, baroque mostra on the Quirinal Hill, the fountain of Trevi. * Acqua Vergine Nuova, which travels into Rome from the northeast under Via Tiburtina, flows under the Pincio to Porta Pinciana, where it branches into 2 channels: ** one passes southwest to link up, but not mingle, with Acqua Vergine Antica just behind Piazza di Spagna and descends the Pincio to emit its water through the fine, elegant sprays of its regal mostra, the lions of Piazza del Popolo ** one passes northwest under Galoppatoio, curves through the Borghese Gardens, makes a sharp southerly turn toward Piazzale Flaminio to make its triumphant appearance in the triple-arch mostra cascading on the western slopes of the Pincio overlooking Piazza del Popolo.  Termini  Trevi Fountain Today, as in days of old, the Acqua Vergine is regarded to furnish some of the purest drinking-water in Rome, reputed for its restorative qualities.

The center is home to research projects ranging from plant and animal sciences to human ecology and medicine, and includes branches across the state covering a total of over 7,000 acres (28 km¬≤). The OARDC's main campus is located in Wooster, Ohio, next to the Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute. History The Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station was founded in 1882 in Columbus and moved to Wooster ten years later. The station grew at Wooster, focusing on crops commonly raised in Ohio, such as corn, wheat, livestock husbandry and nutrition, and expanding into other departments such as entomology. It was renamed the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center in 1965 and entered a period in which it thrived with increased funding and new breakthroughs, such as Lowell \\"Skip\\" Nault's immensely important discovery of a teosinte in Mexico that could be crossed with corn to make it more resistant to disease in 1979. This golden age was cut off shortly afterwards, though, as the OARDC suffered from the state's need to cut expenditures and merged with the Ohio State University in 1982 due to funding problems. After a decade of continued financial woes, the OARDC experienced a resurgence in the 1990s with the help of new director Thomas Payne and new funding. Research and projects The OARDC has pioneered research in aerial pesticide application, round hay bales, new apple cultivars, Phytophthora sojae oomycete in soybeans, removal of lead contamination in soil, and hundreds of other projects. The center provides information for farmers and an education for graduate students, and also deals with consumer-friendly products, rural and urban communities, environmental stewardship, and many other issues important in and beyond Ohio.

Acqua Vergine is one of several Roman aqueducts that deliver pure drinking water to Rome. Its name derives from its predecessor Aqua Virgo, which was constructed by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 19 BC. Its terminal castellum is located at the Baths of Agrippa, and it served the vicinity of Campus Martius through its various conduits. In an effort to restore fresh water to Rome during the Renaissance, Pope Nicholas V, in 1453, renovated the main channels of the Aqua Virgo and added numerous secondary conduits under Campo Marzio. The original terminus, called a mostra, which means showpiece, was the stately, dignified wall fountain designed by Leon Battista Alberti in Piazza dei Crociferi. Due to several additions and modifications to the end- most points of the conduits during the years that followed, during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the Acqua Vergine culminated in several magnificent mostre - the Trevi Fountain and the fountains of Piazza del Popolo.  Courses  Beginning as rainwater falling on the Alban Hills to the east of Rome, then percolating through miles of volcanic tuff, the water springs forth in marshland approximately eight miles to the east of Rome off Via Collatina, in a small town called Salone. From the same source, but running different courses, two separate aqueducts emerge: *Acqua Vergine Antica, which travels underground through some of the same channels constructed by Agrippa's engineers, proceeds into Rome on the northeast under Via di Pietralata, at a point formerly called Fosso Pietralata, crosses Via Nomentana, flows westward toward and through the park of Villa Ada, passes under the western limits of the Villa Borghese, traverses the gardens of Villa Medici, descends the Pincio to Piazza di Spagna, extends under Renaissance Rome to burst forth into the Roman sky in the spectacular, baroque mostra on the Quirinal Hill, the fountain of Trevi. *Acqua Vergine Nuova, which travels into Rome from the northeast under Via Tiburtina, flows under the Pincio to Porta Pinciana, where it branches into 2 channels: **one passes southwest to link up, but not mingle, with Acqua Vergine Antica just behind Piazza di Spagna and descends the Pincio to emit its water through the fine, elegant sprays of its regal mostra, the lions of Piazza del Popolo **one passes northwest under Galoppatoio, curves through the Borghese Gardens, makes a sharp southerly turn toward Piazzale Flaminio to make its triumphant appearance in the triple-arch mostra cascading on the western slopes of the Pincio overlooking Piazza del Popolo.

Originally reported in January 1996, it drew considerable attention that year; but in December a printing plant employee was arrested on charges of having stolen the misprinted stamps from the plant where he worked, meaning that instead of a legitimate error, they were worthless printer's waste. The first public notice of the invert came in the form of an announcement by Christie's that they planned to auction a single copy of the invert on February 1, estimating its value at $8,000-$10,000. Christie's did not supply the name of the consignor (a common practice), but did say that the stamp was one of 160. The appearance of the stamp was that the portrait of Nixon was upside-down, and shifted so that it was split across. The \\"USA / 32\\" inscription was at the bottom and also inverted, leaving only the intaglio \\"Richard Nixon\\" inscription in its correct orientation and position. This was possible because the stamp was actually printed in two steps. First, the portrait and denomination combination was printed by Barton Press on a Heidelberg six-color sheet-fed offset press, then the stamps were sent to the Bank Note Corporation of America's (BCA) plant in Suffern, New York, where the intaglio inscription was applied using a Giori press. BCA also perforated and finished the stamps. The claim of 160 stamps and the lack of information on the discovery immediately generated both interest and skepticism. To be a valid error, the stamps must have been sold to a postal customer; until that point, they are simply government property. By comparison, the story of the Inverted Jenny discovery was known in minute detail and verified by multiple persons. In addition, it was unclear to philatelic experts how 160 were possible, given what they knew about size and handling of sheets of stamps. Christie's auctioned off the one stamp to an unknown collector for $14,500, thus setting a market price. Two days previously, dealer Dana Okey of San Diego had purchased 141 of the inverts from Christie's, and by April was selling them for $12,500, characterizing response as \\"awesome\\". On December 12, Clarence Robert Robie, a former cutting machine operator at BCA's Suffern plant, was charged with theft of the 160 stamps. He was also charged with having transported them to New York, and having sold 120 to a Brooklyn dealer for $60,000 in June, and the remaining 40 in August to a different dealer. (Neither dealer was charged, apparently being unaware of the theft.) It turned out that the nature of the misprint was such that of the original 200-stamp sheets (grouped into four 50-stamp panes), 10 stamps on the edge of each pane did not receive the intaglio inscription, and thus appeared as printing shifts, rather than as inverts. Conviction Robie had first contacted dealer Williams Langs in March 1995, then in a May meeting revealed the existence of the inverts, representing them as coming from a \\"woman in Virginia\\". The deal struck in June was actually a trade (Robie being a collector himself), whereby Langs received 120 inverts in exchange for $60,000 worth of rare US stamps. The 40 remaining stamps had been purchased by dealer Gary Posner with a combination of cash and stamps, who testified that Robie had told him that \\"a lady had purchased it in Virginia at a post office\\". Shortly thereafter Posner sold his 40 to Langs, who in November showed a single and block of four to Christie's. Robie was convicted on both charges, May 22, 1997, after a trial lasting three days. Subsequently, the United States Postal Inspection Service recovered all but one of the inverts. This lone stamp may remain in private hands, but as it continues to be considered stolen property, the current owner cannot openly display or sell it to anyone else.

The film stars Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, and Julie Benz as girls in an exclusive clique in their high school. Charlotte Ayanna has a non- speaking cameo role as the murdered fourth member of the group. The film was inspired by the 1988 film Heathers, and is often compared to it, particularly the plot involving a popular female clique, the use of bright pastels, and the ostensibly accidental killing of one of its members. Of his concept for the film, Stein has stated, \\"The jawbreaker just came to represent the duality of the poppy sweetness of the girls, of high school and of youth, versus the whole idea that this thing could break your jaw\\". The film was released on February 19, 1999, and was a critical and financial failure, although it has come to gain a cult following. Similarities have been drawn between Jawbreaker, Heathers and the 2004 film Mean Girls. Plot On the morning of her 17th birthday, high-school senior Liz Purr, the most popular girl in Reagan High, is kidnapped in her bed by three masked assailants, one of whom stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth as a gag before she is placed in the trunk of a car. The kidnappers turn out to be Liz's \\"friends\\"‚ÄîCourtney, Marcie, and Julie‚Äîplaying a cruel prank on her for her birthday, which they do annually. When the girls drive up to a diner to treat Liz to breakfast, they open the trunk and discover she is dead, having choked to death on the jawbreaker Courtney had used to gag her. Julie wants to go to the police, but Courtney forbids her. Courtney calls the school pretending to be Liz's mother and tells them Liz is ill and cannot attend school, then the three go to school as though nothing had happened. Fern Mayo, school outcast and fervent admirer of Liz Purr (whom she calls \\"The Cat's Meow\\"), is sent by the school principal, Miss Sherwood, to deliver Liz's homework at the end of the day. She stumbles upon the three girls at Liz's house trying to arrange her body in bed. Courtney tries to fabricate a story that Liz died at the hands of a rapist. Fern attempts to flee the house, but the girls catch her and Courtney buys her silence by accepting her into the clique, telling her to take Liz's place, despite Julie's protests. Courtney and Marcie give Fern a makeover, transforming her from plain and awkward to elegant and beautiful. The transformation is so complete, Courtney introduces Fern as the beautiful exchange student \\"Vylette\\". Julie, overwhelmed by guilt at her part in Liz's death, breaks away from the clique, only to be reviled by Courtney and Marcie. As her popularity dissolves, she becomes a new target for abuse and contempt throughout the school. Her only real friend during this time is her boyfriend, a drama student named Zack. As Vylette's popularity soars, Julie watches in silence as Courtney spins an endless web of lies to cover up the murder and maintain her popularity. Julie threatens to go to the police and tell the truth, but Courtney retorts that she, Marcie, and now Vylette will claim Julie killed Liz if she attempts to expose them. To her disgust, Julie learns that, after they had returned Liz's corpse to her house, Courtney went out that same night and seduced a stranger at a sleazy bar and had sex with him in Liz's bed in order to frame him for the murder. Vylette becomes intoxicated with her new-found popularity, which has eclipsed Courtney's own. Courtney orders Vylette to learn her place, but Vylette vows that if Courtney does not watch her step, then she will reveal the truth behind Liz's death. In response, Courtney and Marcie post enlarged yearbook photos of Fern Mayo all over the school with the message \\"Who is Vylette\\" written on them, revealing Vylette's true identity and leaving her humiliated by the entire school. Julie takes pity on Fern and forgives her for being corrupted by Courtney. Feeling no remorse for the lives she has destroyed, Courtney attends the senior prom with Liz's boyfriend, jock Dane Sanders. Meanwhile, Julie is at home going through a bag of Liz's belongings that were given to her. She finds a recordable greeting card she was fiddling with when Courtney was faking Liz's death scene, on which Courtney's admission to the killing was inadvertently recorded. Armed with this evidence, Julie, Fern, and Zack hurry to the prom. When Dane and Courtney are announced as Prom King and Queen, Zack sneaks backstage and broadcasts the card's message saying \\"I killed Liz. I killed the teen dream. Deal with it!\\" over the sound system. Shocked and disgusted, Dane quickly abandons Courtney while Marcie hides under a table. Horrified that her scheme has unraveled and exposed, Courtney races for the exit as the rest of the furious students pelt her with corsages and other projectiles, call her a murderer, saying 'We hate you', 'You're gonna burn in hell', 'How could you?' and 'Why?' and make use of profanity. Julie snaps a picture of a devastated Courtney to immortalize the occasion. The yearbook closes with Fern's quote to Detective Vera Cruz, \\"This is high school, Detective Cruz. What is a friend, anyway?\\" Cast * Rose McGowan as Courtney Shayne * Rebecca Gayheart as Julie Freeman * Julie Benz as Marcie \\"Foxy\\" Fox * Judy Greer as Fern \\"Vylette\\" Mayo * Chad Christ as Zack Tartak * Charlotte Ayanna as Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Purr * Ethan Erickson as Dane Sanders * Pam Grier as Detective Vera Cruz * Carol Kane as Principal Sherwood * Marilyn Manson as The Stranger * Tatyana Ali as Brenda * William Katt as Mr. Purr * P. J. Soles as Mrs. Purr * Jeff Conaway as Mr. Fox * Sandy Martin as Nurse Production Director Darren Stein brought his script to executives at Columbia Tri-Star, who agreed to finance the film if he could cast either Natalie Portman, Kate Winslet or Rose McGowan. The role of Julie originally went to Rachael Leigh Cook, who was eventually replaced with Rebecca Gayheart because the producers felt she did not have the right chemistry with the two other actresses. Gayheart had auditioned for the roles of Fern and Marcie before she was selected for Julie. Marilyn Manson, who was then dating McGowan, agreed to appear in a non-speaking cameo role. On a small budget of $3.5 million, Jawbreaker was filmed at locations in and around the Los Angeles area. 'Reagan High School' was actually University High School in West Los Angeles, with the cafeteria scenes filmed at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. The diner that the girls drive up to at the beginning of the film is Johnie's Broiler in Downey, California, the filming site for many film and television productions. McGowan based her performance on that of Gene Tierney's sociopathic character in Leave Her to Heaven (1945). The distinctive costumes were designed by Vikki Barrett, who drew on 1980s and 1950s-era fashion trends blended with fetishistic elements like lycra skirts, all in bright, candy-like colors to evoke the jawbreaker. Before the film could be released, the MPAA objected to a graphic sex-scene between McGowan's and Marilyn Manson's characters, which had to be cut down to give the film an R rating instead of an NC-17. To accompany the release of the film, Imperial Teen's music video for the song \\"Yoo Hoo\\" featured McGowan as Courtney Shayne harassing the band members with jawbreakers. Reception Critical response was overwhelmingly negative. Many pointed out and criticised the plagiarism from the cult-classic Heathers. On Metacritic the film has a score of 22% based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 11% based on 62 reviews, with an average 3.4 out of 10. The website's consensus states: \\"This throwaway comedy falls victim to its hip sensibilities.\\", leading to its inclusion on several of the websites lists ranking the worst films, earning the distinction of being the single worst film of 1999, as well as ranking among the top-ten worst films of the 1990s. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave Jawbreaker a grade D+JAWBREAKER (1999) CinemaScore Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half out of four, stating \\"The movie is a slick production of a lame script ... If anyone in the plot had the slightest intelligence, the story would implode\\". Francesca Dinglasan from Boxoffice magazine gave the film one and a half out of five, criticizing the film's humor and similarities to Heathers. James Berardinelli gave the film a more favorable two and a half out of four, calling it \\"palatable, and occasionally even clever\\", but concluding, \\"while the film offers more than a Heathers rehash, it never fully develops its own identity. McGowan was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain, but lost to Matt Dillon and Stephen Dorff for their roles as Pat Healy and Deacon Frost in There's Something About Mary and Blade. Legacy Despite the negative critical feedback, Jawbreaker found success through home video release and subsequent television airings; it has developed a cult following. Vice magazine called the film a \\"teen classic\\" when it published a retrospective in 2016 titled \\"Perverting the Youth of America: The Oral History of Teen Classic Jawbreaker\\". Dazed magazine published a similar feature, crediting the film with inspiring 2004's Mean Girls, and praising the dark tones and performances. McGowan's Courtney Shayne has become something of a pop culture icon on social media, with TribecaFilm.com declaring of McGowan's performance that \\"...every single line-reading was a thing of Bette Davis-aspiring beauty, and with any justice, it's a performance that will only grow in esteem over time.\\" The film and characters also enjoy a following in the LGBT community. In 2016 it was screened at RuPaul's DragCon, an LGBT- centered fan convention, which was followed by a Q&A; with Darren Stein and Rebecca Gayheart. Jawbreaker's costumes have also been celebrated, drawing praise from the likes of Vogue and Rookie magazines. The scene where the actresses strut down the hallway in slow-motion to Imperial Teen's \\"Yoo Hoo\\" has become a signature feature of the film, drawing homage in film and television, most notably Mean Girls, and being parodied in films like Not Another Teen Movie (2001). In 2014, Judy Greer said in an interview: \\"I really didn't think it was anything special while we were shooting it, but when I saw the final product, I knew it was really good. I was so proud of it. I thought it looked beautiful. It had just the right amount of sexy, pop culture fun to it. I do think it's quite special.\\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/how-judy-greer-became- hollywoods-most-in-demand-best-friend Soundtrack # \\"Yoo Hoo\\" (Imperial Teen) ‚Äì 3:31 # \\"I See\\" (Letters To Cleo) ‚Äì 3:56 # \\"Next to You\\" (Ednaswap) ‚Äì 2:35 # \\"Don't Call Me Babe\\" (Shampoo) ‚Äì 2:58 # \\"Bad Word for a Good Thing\\" (Friggs) ‚Äì 2:53 # \\"Stay in Bed\\" (Grand Mal) ‚Äì 4:49 # \\"Flow\\" (Transister) ‚Äì 5:59 # \\"She Bop\\" (Howie Beno) ‚Äì 3:06 # \\"Water Boy\\" (Imperial Teen) ‚Äì 1:36 # \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" (Scorpions) ‚Äì 4:14 # \\"Rock 'n' Roll Machine\\" (The Donnas) ‚Äì 2:54 # \\"Beat You Up\\" (The Prissteens) ‚Äì 2:36 # \\"Trouble\\" (Shampoo) ‚Äì 3:21 ; Songs not included on the soundtrack * The Cars, \\"Good Times Roll\\" * Connie Francis, \\"Lollipop Lips\\" * The Friggs, \\"Heartbreaker\\" * Veruca Salt, \\"Volcano Girls\\" (opening scene) Musical adaptation In 2013, a musical adaptation of Jawbreaker was made starring Elizabeth Gillies as Courtney Shayne.

It lies on the Olza River, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The city has approximately 35,000 inhabitants and is the smallest statutory city in the Czech Republic. In the 2001 census, 17.7% of the population were Poles. The city is notable for its steel plant, the T≈ôinec Iron and Steel Works, the largest in the Czech Republic, which still has a major impact on the city, on its character, demographics, and air quality. T≈ôinec is also an important cultural center of the Polish minority in Zaolzie. Etymology The name T≈ôinec is of topographic origin, derived from the Polish word for reed (Polish: trzcina, locally trzena // trzyna, strzena, trzcena). History The village of T≈ôinec was founded in the 14th century and first mentioned in 1461, when a person z [from] Trencze was attested to. Politically, the village then belonged to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The majority of the population worked in agriculture. The area was, however, rich in limestone, iron ore, and clay. The region also offered a large enough workforce, so it was decided to build an iron works there. In 1836, construction of the first metallurgical furnace had begun. The iron mill began operation in 1839, becoming the largest in the entire Cieszyn Silesia. The first schools (Polish-German) in T≈ôinec were opened by the initiative of the iron works in 1851. After the construction of the Ko≈°ice-Bohum√≠n Railway line in 1871, rapid development of the town took place. After the revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was added to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900, and 1910, the population of the municipality grew from 1,792 in 1880 to 3,849 in 1910, with a majority being native Polish- speakers (growing from 51.4% in 1880 to 96.6% in 1900 and 96% in 1910), accompanied by a German-speaking minority (at most 32.5% in 1880, then dropping to 12.2% in 1900 and up to 24.3% in 1910) and Czech-speakers (peaking in 1890 at 17.4%, then dropping to 6.7% in 1910). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (63.2%), followed by Protestants (34.5%), Jews (76 or 1.9%), and 13 people adhering to another faith. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking the Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War, and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. T≈ôinec gained town rights in 1931. Following the Munich Agreement in October 1938, together with the Zaolzie region, it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of the Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war, it was restored to Czechoslovakia. In 1946, it was merged with the village of Ly≈æbice, where in the 1950s the ruling Communist Party of Czechoslovakia began large-scale development in the style of socialist realism. Afterwards, Ly≈æbice became a new downtown, taking the place of Star√© Mƒõsto (lit. Old Town). Geography The city of T≈ôinec is located in the Moravian-Silesian Region in the north-east of the Czech Republic, very close to the Polish border and also near the Slovak border, with an elevation of approximately above sea level. It is situated approximately away from the city of Ostrava and about from the country's capital, Prague. The city is surrounded by the picturesque Beskydy mountain range, a popular place for cycling, skiing, cross-country skiing, hiking, and paragliding. The city itself comprises the main town built around the steel works but also incorporates a number of surrounding villages. Beskids mountains in the background Music and culture There are a number of musical concerts that take place in the city throughout the year. They are usually held at the local football stadium or the T≈ôineck√Ω Zimn√≠ Stadion sports arena, or alternatively at the T≈ôinec-Borek football grounds. The year's biggest events are the 'Hutnick√Ω den', which takes place in May, and 'Noc Pln√° Hvƒõzd' (Star-Studded Night) in the summer, both festivals which feature numerous live performances from bands and artists from all over the country and abroad. Another yearly event is the 'Zlot' concert in the nearby town of Byst≈ôice, aimed at the local Polish population. Sport Ice hockey and football are by far the city's most popular sports. The ice hockey team, HC Ocel√°≈ôi T≈ôinec, which currently plays in the Czech Extraliga, the top tier of Czech ice hockey, has a massive following and fan base in T≈ôinec. The team holds a regional rivalry with Ostrava-based HC V√≠tkovice. Ocel√°≈ôi (Steelers) play their home games at Werk Arena, which opened in 2014 and has a seating capacity of 5,200. The arena also hosted the Team Czech Republic at the 2016 Davis Cup World Group. The city's football team, FK Fotbal T≈ôinec, has seen a rise in popularity after its promotion to the Czech National Football League several years ago. Average attendance for league matches is now more than 1,000. A rivalry with neighbouring sides FC V√≠tkovice and MFK Karvin√° has also been established. T≈ôinec also has a popular athletics team. Local dialect Evangelical church Although the majority of the city's population speak Czech, a large number speaks in a Cieszyn Silesian dialect, a mixture of Czech, Polish, and German. The dialect is very specific to the whole region of Cieszyn Silesia.

It was one of several engagements that took place after the War of 1812 had ended, and was the final action between British and American forces. The American gunnery was far more effective than the British, despite the two vessels being virtually identical in strength. After exchanges of broadsides and musket fire, the British commander was killed. The British brig rammed the American ship in an attempt to board, but the two were separated and Penguin was disabled shortly afterwards when the foremast fell, forcing the British to surrender. The British brig was too badly damaged to be salvaged and was set ablaze by the victors after its stores and surviving crew were removed. Background Late in 1814, the United States Navy had been preparing a small squadron at New York City, to attack British shipping in the Indian Ocean. The squadron consisted of the frigate (Captain Stephen Decatur), the sloops of war (Master Commandant Lewis Warrington) and (Master Commandant James Biddle) and the brig-rigged tender . On 15 January, Decatur took advantage of a north- westerly gale to break out alone in President, but the frigate went aground on the bar at the harbour mouth and received damage which delayed it for two hours and slowed it. Decatur was unable to turn back as the gale was still blowing, and President was captured after being pursued by the four frigates of the blockading British squadron.Forester, pp.205-209 The commanders of the other American vessels were not aware of Decatur's fate. When another gale blew up on 22 January, they sailed out in broad daylight under storm canvas and evaded the blockaders through their speed and weatherliness.Forester, p.217 They made for a pre-arranged rendezvous with President off Tristan da Cunha, which was being used by the Americans as a cruiser base. During the voyage, Hornet lost touch with the other two vessels. Peacock and Tom Bowline reached the rendezvous first, on 18 March, but were then driven off by a gale. Hornet reached the island on 22 March. Battle Biddle, commanding Hornet, was about to drop anchor when a strange sail was sighted to the southeast. Biddle at once made for the stranger. This was the , commanded by Captain James Dickenson. Penguin was a new vessel, which had first sailed in September 1814. It carried roughly the same armament (sixteen 32-pounder carronades, one 12-pounder long gun and two 6-pounder guns) as Hornet (eighteen 32-pounder carronades and two 12-pounder guns). Some time earlier, Penguin had been sent from Cape Town to hunt an American privateer (Young Wasp) which had been attacking homeward-bound East Indiamen.Roosevelt, p.236 As soon as Hornet was sighted, Dickenson steered for the sloop and prepared to engage. Penguin had the weather gage and for a time, Hornet ran before Penguin, yawing occasionally to avoid being raked. Then Penguin turned up-wind to port at almost the same moment as Hornet turned to starboard. The two vessels exchanged broadsides for 15 minutes, with the range gradually closing from \\"musket shot\\". Dickenson turned downwind, to close with Hornet in an attempt to board and capture Hornet, but was mortally wounded. Penguins bowsprit ran across Hornets deck between the main and mizzen masts, badly damaging the American rigging. Penguins crew made no attempt to board Hornet and Hornets crew prepared to board but Biddle stopped them, to continue the gunnery duel. Biddle believed that the British had surrendered at this point and prepared to step aboard Penguin but was wounded by musket balls.Roosevelt, p.237 As the two vessels separated, Penguins foremast fell, breaking off the bowsprit. The brig had already been severely battered by American shot, and with the brig unable to manoeuvre, Lieutenant McDonald, now in command of Penguin, surrendered. The British had lost 14 men killed and 28 wounded. The brig was \\"riddled through\\" and most of the starboard side carronades had been dismounted. By comparison, the Americans had lost only one man killed, one mortally wounded and seven wounded, mostly to musketry. (Penguin had embarked twelve extra Royal Marines in Cape Town.) Strikingly, not a single British carronade shot had hit the hull of Hornet. Aftermath USS Hornet captures HMS Penguin Penguin was too badly damaged to be repaired and put into service, so the Americans prepared to destroy the brig after removing the stores. Another sail was sighted and the Americans hastily set the Penguin on fire, but the strange sails proved to be Peacock and Tom Bowline.Roosevelt, p.238 Tom Bowline was sent to a neutral port (Rio de Janeiro, then part of the Portuguese Empire) with Penguins crew, where they were escorted ashore by U.S. Marines. They became the last body of British troops and sailors to be taken prisoner during the war.Forester, pp.219-220Lloyd's List, No. 4980, - accessed 8 March 2014. The two American sloops of war waited in vain for President until 15 April, then headed for the East Indies, as originally intended. On 27 April, they sighted a large ship, which they at first believed to be an East Indiaman, and eagerly headed for it but then realised that their intended victim was a British ship of the line, . The Americans split up. Peacock was the faster of the two sloops and was soon out of sight. Cornwallis had recently been completed at Bombay from teak woodElting, p.234 and proved to be very fast and weatherly. Hornet escaped only after a chase lasting two and a half days, during which Biddle had been forced to jettison his stores, ballast, anchors, cables, guns, small arms, capstan, the armourer's anvil, ship's bell and even substantial parts of the forecastle to lighten the sloop enough to outrun Cornwallis. Since Hornet no longer had any fighting strength, Biddle had to turn home. He reached the Cape of Good Hope on 9 May, where he learned that the Senate had ratified the Treaty of Ghent on 18 February, ending the war more than a month before the engagement with Penguin.

It was operated by the Salvation Army during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to provide comfort and support to its destitute clients. What made this shelter unique was that in exchange for a penny, clients would be allowed to sit on a bench in a reasonably warm room all night. They were not allowed to lie down and sleep on the bench. A penny sit-up was the cheapest homeless shelter at that time. There were more expensive shelters available in London, such as a \\"two penny hangover\\" (where the clients were provided a rope to lean on so that they can fall asleep on the bench without the risk of falling out) or a \\"four penny coffin\\" (where the clients were provided with a coffin-sized box so that they can sleep lying-down). By today's standards, the penny sit-up would be considered inadequate and callous. However, at the time it was considered a well-meaning, inexpensive, and compassionate attempt to deal with the relatively new phenomenon of homelessness. The Salvation Army believed these shelters provided relief from the harsh London winters and provided new followers of Christianity. Others, such as Professor Howard Sercombe of the University of Strathclyde, have argued that such institutions were more likely to have been designed to control the homeless, or at the very best were a compassionate response to the harsh \\"moving on\\" laws of the time, which made it illegal for people to remain vagrant upon the streets.Youth studies journal of Australia References * Category:Homelessness ","title":"Penny sit-up"},{"id":"3583400","text":"The following is a list of notable deaths in January 2006.

French investigators assert that, when Benchellali returned to France, from Afghanistan, he built a home lab in his bedroom, where he manufactured ricin. Benchellali is reported to have sent his younger brother and a friend, Nizar Sassi, to Afghanistan. Mourad and Sassis were captured and detained in Guantanamo. Benchellali, was convicted, along with 24 others, on June 14, 2006 for their roles in planning a terrorist attack that was to have taken place in France to support Chechen independence. Benchellali was described as the group's leader, and received a 10-year sentence. Benchellali's father, a younger brother, and his mother were also convicted for their roles. Mourad Benchellali published a book about his experiences, and on June 14, 2006 the New York Times published an op-ed by Mourad, in which he blamed Menad for tricking him into attending a military training camp on what he thought would be a kind of vacation.

Postal orders have been issued by the Canadian Post Office roughly since confederation (the timeline linked to below, for example, cites the postal money order system as expanding to Manitoba in July 1873). Money orders were issue for values up to $100, while postal notes (introduced 4 August 1898) were for sending small sums between 10¬¢ and $5. Canadian postal orders and notes were not issued in Newfoundland, as Newfoundland was an independent dominion, and a British colony, before it became a Canadian province, although Canadian postal notes were allowed to be paid in Newfoundland. Range of denominations Here is a list of denominations of the Canadian postal notes as noted on P.N.107-12,000, which was issued by the Post Office Department, Ottawa with effect from 13 December 1934. They are listed as pairs of values and commissions, including revenue tax: 10¬¢ (1¬¢), 20¬¢ (2¬¢), 25¬¢ (2¬¢), 30¬¢ (2¬¢), 40¬¢ (2¬¢), 50¬¢ (3¬¢), 60¬¢ (3¬¢), 70¬¢ (3¬¢), 75¬¢ (3¬¢), 80¬¢ (3¬¢), 90¬¢ (3¬¢), $1 (3¬¢), $1.50 (5¬¢), $2 (6¬¢), $2.50 (6¬¢), $3 (6¬¢), $4 (6¬¢), $5 (6¬¢), $10 (8¬¢). The $10 postal notes were issued at non-accounting offices. Postal Note Stamps Canada was the only British Commonwealth country to issue special postal note stamps. These were used for the purpose of extending the value of a postal note up to a value of 99c. above the denomination of the postal note itself. The United States had issued postal note stamps as well. British Forces Post Office-issued British Postal Orders These have been issued only in Alberta and Newfoundland. There is also a British Forces Post Office in Ottawa - B.F.P.O. 487. B.F.P.O. issues from B.F.P.O. 14, Suffield, Alberta have been confirmed. British overprinted postal orders A series of British postal orders were overprinted in about 1905 as examples of what Canadian-issued British postal orders might look like. However, plans to issue British postal orders throughout Canada never materialised. In July 2006, a set of 3 British postal orders overprinted \\"Canada\\" and the word \\"Specimen\\" turned up and were sold on eBay for ¬£7,123. These are believed to be unique.

It has about 10,000 inhabitants. It lies on the Ostravice River at the foot of Lys√° hora, the highest mountain of the Moravian-Silesian Beskids. In the past it was an important ironworks center. Today it is mainly a holiday resort. Fr√Ωdlant nad Ostravic√≠ is also the seat of a Municipality with Extended Competence and a Municipality with Commissioned Local Authority within the same borders. Administrative parts The town historically belonged to Moravia, but two Silesian villages were merged within its municipal borders and are its administrative parts: Lubno and Nov√° Ves. History The first written record dates to 1395. The town was founded in the 2nd half of 14th century during the Germanic colonization. For most of its history Fr√Ωdlant nad Ostravic√≠ belonged to the Hukvaldy manor of the Olomouc Archdiocese. Until the first half of the 17th century the inhabitants were mainly farmers and lumberjacks. In 1618‚Äì1620 the first iron-mills and smelters were built, using easily accessible deposites of pelosiderite and plenty of firewood from the nearby mountains. The coat of arms which depicts a blacksmith with a smelter behind him comes from those times. Following the discovery of rich hard coal deposits in Ostrava in 1763 the importance of Fr√Ωdlant's ironworks declined, they later specialized in production of cast iron and later enamel ware. In 1871 the town was connected with the Ostrava region by a railroad (which continued further to the heart of the Moravian- Silesian Beskids). Tourism Today Fr√Ωdlant nad Ostavic√≠ is an important holiday resort. There are many sport facilities in the town and its surroundings, especially plenty of tennis courts and a new sports centre named Kotelna. There is also a small air-strip offering flightviews. Ond≈ôejn√≠k Mountain has a ridge soaring facility. Skiers can enjoy a few slopes in the nearby villages. The town also served as a starting point for hiking in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids which start to rise literally on the town border. Education Two gymnasiums are located in Fr√Ωdlant. The first one is Gymnasium of Fr√Ωdlant (renamed from Gymnasium of T.G.M.) and the second is Beskydy Mountain Academyhttp://gymnaziumbma.cz/ with language specialization such as English, Spanish, German, Latin, Russian and French.

Along with Drogo and his illegitimate half-brother Theodoric, Hugh was tonsured and sent from the palace of Aachen to a monastery in 818 by his father's successor, Louis the Pious, following the revolt of King Bernard of Italy. Hugh rose to become abbot of several abbacies: Saint-Quentin (822/23), Lobbes (836), and Saint-Bertin (836). In 834, he was made imperial archchancellor by his half-brother. On Louis's death in 840, his sons began to fight over the inheritance. In 841, Hugh sided with his nephew Charles the Bald against Louis and Lothair. In 842, Charles spent Christmas with Hugh at Saint-Quentin on his eastern frontier. Hugh's interventions probably secured Saint-Quentin for Charles's kingdom in the division that came with the Treaty of Verdun (843). Hugh was part of the small army which, on its way south to join Charles at Toulouse, was ambushed by Pippin II in the Angoumois on 14 June 844. Hugh was killed by a lance, and according to the anonymous verse lament composed about his death‚Äîcalled the Rhythmus de obitu Hugonis abbatis or Planctus Ugoni abbatisMGH, Poetae II, p. 139.‚ÄîPippin wept over his body.

The late accounts of the Angevin origins actually make Petronilla a kinswoman of Hugh the Abbot, not of Charlemagne's son.

The proposal would have carved out a strip of land to serve as a corridor between two newly formed Slavic countries with shared interests, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. A different name often given is Czech‚ÄìYugoslav Territorial Corridor. It is primarily referred to as \\"the Czech Corridor\\" today, because representatives of Yugoslavia at the Peace Conference stated that they would prefer it if the corridor were to be controlled solely by Czechoslovaks. The proposal was ultimately rejected by the conference and never again suggested.  Territory  The corridor would have consisted of Burgenland and neighboring areas that would be found along the future border of Austria and Hungary. The area is sometimes called Western Transdanubia. In a February 1916 memorandum to the French government, Tom√°≈° Masaryk stated that the corridor would correct \\"the division of the Czechoslovaks and Yugoslavs\\" (i.e. West Slavs and South Slavs),Oskar Krejƒç√≠, Martin C. Styan: Geopolitics of the Central European Region, 2005, , arising from the 9th century Hungarian invasion. The planned corridor would have been some 200 kilometers long and at most 80 kilometers wide. It would have cut through four Hungarian counties (Moson, Sopron, Vas and Zala). However, there exist variant proposals that would have made the area significantly larger.  History  Czechoslovak delegates used the principle of self-determination, which was used as legitimate basis for creation of many nation states in Europe after World War I, as an argument for the creation of the corridor; however it is unlikely that the proposal would have been accepted on that principle, since of the 1.17 million people that lived in the area at the time, some 662,000 were ethnic Hungarians, 220,000 were Slavs (mostly Croats and Slovenes) and 289,000 belonged to other ethnolinguistic groups (mostly Germans). They further argued that the corridor would by virtue also connect the Germans in Southeastern Europe (Danube Swabians) with Central Europe. They also mentioned that this would benefit France's influence in the region. Today, however, European historians speculate that it was intended to give Czechoslovakia a larger share of land along the Danube in order to turn Pressburg/Pre≈°porok (shortly thereafter renamed to modern Bratislava) into a major Danube harbor; this would have marginalized Hungary even more than it already was following the collapse of Austria-Hungary. The Czechoslovak delegates claimed that the city was the ancient capital, omitting the fact that the very multicultural city was also the royal capital of the Kingdom of Hungary for two and a half centuries and had a large German and Hungarian populace. The proposal was backed by supporters of pan-Slavic ideologies as it would have created a joint border between two states that represented Slavic unity (Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia) ‚Äì an idea that was also defended by Croatian nationalists who wanted the Burgenland Croats to be part of the Yugoslav state.Arnold Suppan: Jugoslawien und √ñsterreich 1918-1938 Seite 563f Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 1996 They argued that since Austria-Hungary no longer existed, there was no reason for Austria and Hungary to share a border and the creation of such a corridor would discourage both countries from harboring any thoughts of future alliance. Violating the self-determination of the majority of inhabitants and opposing the interests of Yugoslavia's rival Italy, the plan was eventually rejected.

Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este (25 April 1781 ‚Äì 5 November 1850) was the third son of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este and of his wife Princess Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este, last member and heiress of the House of Este. For much of the Napoleonic Wars he was in command of the Austrian army. Ferdinand was born at Milan. He attended the military academy in Wiener Neustadt before embarking on a military career. In 1805 in the war of the Third Coalition against France, Ferdinand was commander-in-chief of the Austrian forces with General Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich as his quartermaster general. In October his army was surrounded at Ulm. General Mack surrendered, but Ferdinand managed to escape with 2000 cavalry to Bohemia. There he took command of the Austrian troops and raised the local militia. With a total of 9,000 men he set out for Iglau to distract attention from the Coalition's movements. He succeeded in holding the Bavarian division of Prince Karl Philipp von Wrede in Iglau thereby and preventing it from joining the Battle of Austerlitz. In 1809 in the war of the Fifth Coalition against France, Ferdinand commanded an Austrian army of 36,000 men. In April he invaded the Duchy of Warsaw hoping to encourage a local uprising against Napoleon (see Polish‚ÄìAustrian War). But the Poles rallied to Prince J√≥zef Antoni Poniatowski. Ferdinand was defeated at the Battle of Raszyn, but managed to occupy Warsaw. In June, however, Ferdinand was compelled to withdraw from Warsaw, and to give up Krak√≥w and Galicia as well. In 1815 in the war of the Seventh Coalition against France, Ferdinand commanded two divisions of the Austrian Reserve. The following year he was appointed military commander in Hungary. In 1830 Ferdinand was appointed military and civil governor of Galicia, taking up residence in Lviv. After the Revolution of 1848 he lived mostly in Italy. Ferdinand never married. In 1850 he died at Schloss Ebenzweier in Altm√ºnster near Gmunden, Austria.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 14, 2002. Bender aspires to be a cook for the Planet Express crew, but the meals he produces are awful. One day, Bender overhears the crew complaining about one of his meals and is overcome by feelings of worthlessness and self- pity. Plot Bender aspires to be a cook for the Planet Express crew, but the meals he produces are awful. One day, Bender overhears the crew complaining about one of his meals and is overcome by feelings of worthlessness and self-pity. After running away, Bender asks Elzar to teach him how to cook, but Elzar refuses. Bender then becomes a hobo and travels to the \\"biggest hobo joint in the universe\\". There he meets Helmut Spargel, a legendary cook who lost his TV show when a young, upcoming Elzar replaced him. Spargel trains Bender how to cook in order to get revenge on Elzar. As a final test, Spargel challenges Bender to cook an edible meal. Spargel tries the food and tells Bender that it is \\"acceptable\\". As a result of eating the food, his stomach explodes, and he dies. With his dying breath, Spargel reveals the secret to perfect cooking: a vial of unknown liquid (\\"the essence of pure flavour\\") to use whenever he needs to spice up a food. To avenge Spargel, Bender challenges Elzar to a cook-off on the TV show \\"Iron Cook\\". The main ingredient used in this cook-off is Soylent Green. Bender prepares terrible looking food, but applies the liquid that Spargel gave him and wins. As the loser, Elzar is forced to wash the dishes. When the Professor examines the liquid in the bottle Spargel gave Bender, it turns out the liquid is ordinary water. Fry says that all Spargel gave Bender was confidence, before the Professor adds that the water was laced with trace amounts of LSD. Bender then proposes a meal for his co-workers, who are unsure, but joyfully accept when Bender adds that the meal will include plenty of \\"confidence\\". Meanwhile, Zoidberg accidentally destroys a scale replica of the universe's largest bottle that Professor Farnsworth has just made. He frames Fry for the damage and the Professor demands that Fry pay $10 for the material cost. Zoidberg is riddled with guilt as Fry is easily persuaded to make the payment, not having the wherewithal to defend himself. During the contest, Fry is unable to pay for a commemorative turkey baster, having given the Professor his last $10. Zoidberg's guilt becomes unbearable, and he publicly apologizes for framing Fry before trying to commit seppuku using the Chairman's ceremonial Wakizashi. Instead, his hard shell damages the $5000 sword, and he quickly accuses Fry before running away.

The island is located some east of Cairns, Queensland. It is the southernmost of the Willis Islets, a group of three islands which with their associated sandy cays stretch in a NNE to SSW line for about . Willis Island itself is aligned NW to SE and is about long by wide, in area, rising to about above sea level. Weather monitoring station The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has a weather station on the island. There are usually four weather observers, one of whom is Officer-in-Charge, and one Technical Officer (electronic engineering) living on the island. History The Willis Island weather monitoring station was established in 1921 and equipped with a radio transmitter in order to provide a cyclone early warning service for Queensland. The first officer in charge was John King Davis. =Cyclone Yasi= On 2 February 2011, sometime shortly after 08:30 AEST, the eye of Cyclone Yasi moved directly over Willis Island as a Category 5 tropical cyclone. Four station staff had been evacuated the previous day. A wind gust speed of was recorded by the weather station equipment before the anemometer failed. The barometric pressure fell to an exceptionally low . Around 9:00 am, radar data was disrupted. Roughly an hour later, communication with the island was completely cut off. The cyclone was so strong it altered the shape of the island and cleared much of its vegetation. Limited services were restored on 17 February 2011. A Bureau of Meteorology spokeswoman later said the core building sustained minor damage to the roof, deck covering and one of the solar panels. \\"The radome which protects the radar was completely destroyed and the radar itself sustained damage and needed to be replaced,\\" she said. The associated storm surge also damaged the power generator, sewage system and desalination equipment.Yasi-hit weather station to be back on track Operation of the weather monitoring station was restored on 12 December 2011. InfrastructurePast infrastructure= Up to 2004 most of the infrastructure constructed in either 1950 or 1968 still existed. Maintenance and refurbishment had been an ongoing costly process. The small parcel of land (total island is 7.7 hectares) accommodated eight buildings of varying structure as follows: * Main building housing recreation, kitchen/dining, sleeping, office and equipment room constructed in 1950 * Main store constructed in 1950 * Laundry building constructed in 1950 * Bunker/Cyclone Shelter constructed in 1950 * Generator building constructed in 1968 * Fire pump building constructed in 1968 * Flammable liquids bunker constructed in 1968 * Balloon filling and hydrogen storage building constructed 1950 (condemned) Personal living accommodation was provided in a barracks-like wing between the meteorological office and the kitchen-living room area. Meteorological equipment included a defined equipment enclosure and a radar tower plus dome. Other equipment included a desalination plant and enviro- cycle sewage treatment plant.REDEVELOPMENT OF WILLIS ISLAND METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE, CORAL SEA, Bureau of Meteorology, June 2005 (accessed 2 February 2011) =Current infrastructure= From 2005, the following new facilities and services have been constructed: * Meteorological office, mess area, accommodation, recreational area, powerhouse * Hydrogen generator building and gas storage, including associated site works * Relocated fuel storage tanks to a new concrete bunded diesel fuel area * Underground services related to communications, power distribution, water, sewage and fire hose reel services * Relocated satellite dishes and radar tower * Refurbished salt water pump building Accommodation facilities caters for four permanent staff and up to 10 visiting personnel. Meteorological equipment includes a defined equipment enclosure and a radar tower plus dome. Other equipment includes a desalination plant and enviro-cycle sewage treatment plant. Power generation comprises a hybrid system of a diesel generator combined with a wind generator and solar power. Rainwater harvesting has not been implemented due to the high level of marine bird life and guano deposits. Recreation The station has a recreation room which includes amenities such as a pool table, darts and table tennis, along with an outside sporting area and a home gym. There are also opportunities for recreational fishing. A substantial library caters for all tastes. Two satellite television systems enable reception of Australian Channel 10 and the ABC, and of free-to-air transmissions from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. Programming includes the American television channels CNN and MTV and an extensive video library completes the passive entertainment options. Occasional amateur radio operations occur in the Willis islets. Under DXCC rules Willis is considered to be a separate \\"entity\\" (equivalent to country) for award credit. A major DXpedition visited for several weeks in October 2008 (VK9DWX).Willis Island ‚Äì Coral Sea expedition 2008 Another operated here in November 2015 (VK9WA). Hazard reduction In the past, landfill was buried on the island, and occasionally high winds and heavy seas from a cyclone would uncover parts of the waste. A major clean-up campaign was conducted in 2004 and 2005 to protect the sensitive areas such as the coral cays and sand dunes. Today, all waste generated on the island, as well as any debris that washes ashore, is placed in bins and shipped back on the staff exchange vessel for appropriate disposal on the mainland. Tropical Cyclone Yasi uncovered a landfill site on the island, which was found to include some asbestos containing material (ACM). The area was remediated and all waste was removed from the island. Three formal Occupational Health and Safety investigations on Willis Island have been undertaken by independent assessors ‚Äì GHD (2007 and 2011) and Parsons Brinkerhoff (April 2011 ‚Äì after TC Yasi). These investigations found no significant potential for exposure to asbestos fibre for employees stationed on Willis Island. Occasionally old asbestos cement sheet washes up on Willis Island and is collected and bagged before being transported back to the mainland where it is disposed of in line with the Queensland Government's EPA legislative requirements. Full safety equipment is used. Staff generate their own supply of hydrogen for use in weather balloons. Prior to 1994, a chemical process to meet hydrogen needs was used. This process produced a toxic residue that was a danger to the local birdlife. Because of this danger, a safer \\"electrolytic converter\\" is now used to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen. Birdlife The most common inhabitants are wedge-tailed shearwaters, sooty terns and common and black noddies. Their numbers are usually quite high and bird cries continue day and night on the island. Several species of booby migrate through the Island including masked, brown and red-footed boobies, and also the lesser frigatebird. Crested terns are also seen to migrate, although not as often.Fletcher, P. Chapter 10: The Original Inhabitants. Seventy-Five Years at Willis Island. 1996. Bureau of Meteorology. Other birds mentioned by John King Davis are the buff-banded rail as a resident, wood sandpiper, and sacred kingfisher and red-tailed tropicbird as occasional visitors.

He also fronted his own Michigan-based bands, The Frost and The Bossmen. Performing career Born in Oelwein, Iowa, Wagner grew up in the Owosso, Michigan, area and graduated from Waterford Township high school in 1961. His first band, called the Bossmen, was a favourite in the Detroit area and scored radio play with the Wagner-penned composition \\"Baby Boy\\", \\"You're the Girl for Me\\" and others. Wagner formed his next band, the Frost, with Donny Hartman, Bobby Rigg and Gordy Garris, in the late 1960s and built up a substantial following in the Michigan area. The band featured the dual lead guitars of Wagner and Hartman. The band released three albums during their tenure together on Vanguard Records: 1969's Frost Music and Rock and Roll Music, plus 1970's Through the Eyes of Love. Wagner was the principal songwriter, arranger and lead singer of The Frost. Their live appearances brought out large crowds of young fans throughout the region. In 1972, Wagner moved to New York and formed the short-lived group \\"Ursa Major\\". The original line-up included Billy Joel on keyboards and Rick Mangone on drums. As Billy Joel had to leave the band for personal reasons, Wagner replaced him with former Amboy Dukes bassist Greg Arama. They released one seminal, acclaimed self-titled album as a power trio. The band toured nationally with Jeff Beck and then with Alice Cooper. In 1973, Wagner was recruited by producer Bob Ezrin for Lou Reed's band along with Steve Hunter. Wagner and Hunter were featured guitarists on Lou Reed's dark and controversial 1973 studio album, Berlin. Soon after, Wagner and Hunter were joined by Prakash John, Pentti \\"Whitey\\" Glan and Ray Colcord for Lou Reed's Rock 'n' Roll Animal Tour. As band leader and arranger, Wagner took the early Lou Reed songs that had been recorded by the Velvet Underground and rearranged them for the concert stage. The new arrangements left behind the laid back feeling that had been established by the prior Reed band and won Reed his first gold album. The band toured internationally with Reed, culminating in the Rock 'n' Roll Animal album, recorded live at the New York Academy of Music in December 1973. Readers of Guitar World ranked the Hunter/Wagner solos on the 1973 live version of \\"Sweet Jane\\" 81st among the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of all time. It was during Wagner's days with the Frost that he first met Alice Cooper. Producer Bob Ezrin brought both Wagner and Steve Hunter into the studio to play guitar on the early Alice Cooper albums. Wagner had already been featured on the band's School's Out album, notably for playing the memorable guitar solo on the track \\"My Stars\\". Wagner continued to play lead guitar (sometimes uncredited) on every Alice Cooper Group album that followed, through the break up of the original group. When the members of the original Alice Cooper group parted ways in 1974, Wagner officially teamed up with Alice Cooper and became his principal co-writer, lead guitarist and band director. Together they wrote their first concept album, Welcome to My Nightmare. Produced by Bob Ezrin, the album was released in 1975. The Nightmare Tour became the largest and longest touring rock show of the time. The live show also featured the duelling lead guitars of Wagner and Hunter in a guitar battle captured on the film of the same name. The film became a TV special and was released on home video in 1976. The world tour covered more than 120 cities over an eighteen-month period. Wagner continued to co-write songs and play lead guitar on additional Cooper albums, including: Goes To Hell, The Alice Cooper Show, Lace and Whiskey, From the Inside (written by the team of Alice Cooper, Dick Wagner and Bernie Taupin), Zipper Catches Skin, DaDa and Hey Stoopid among others. At the suggestion of producer Bob Ezrin, Wagner contributed guitar tracks to the highly successful 1976 Kiss album Destroyer the first Kiss album to prominently feature outside musicians. Though uncredited, Wagner replaced Ace Frehley as lead guitarist for the tracks \\"Flaming Youth\\" and \\"Sweet Pain\\", while also playing the acoustic guitar found on the ballad \\"Beth\\".Leaf and Sharp, Behind the Mask As one of Ezrin's hired guns throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, Wagner continued to lend his playing (and in some cases, songwriting) talents to albums including Peter Gabriel's self-titled solo debut (1977), Air Supply, Aerosmith's Get Your Wings (Wagner played the guitar solos on \\"Same Old Song and Dance\\" and \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", the latter with Steve Hunter), Hall & Oates' Along the Red Ledge, Kiss's Revenge, and Burton Cummings' Dream of a Child. Wagner produced and co-wrote songs for Mark Farner's solo d√©but and a pair of albums for the star of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Tim Curry, and more. In 1978, Wagner released a solo LP called Richard Wagner, produced by Bob Ezrin, and released on Atlantic Records. The album title confused both record stores and disc jockeys, who relegated the record to the classical music bin, assuming it was a classical music record composed by the 19th-century classical composer with the same name. Songwriting credits One of the best-known songs written by Wagner is \\"Only Women Bleed\\". Written during Wagner's days with the Frost and titled \\"Movin' On\\", Wagner was unhappy with his lyrics and did not release it. After starting his collaboration with Alice Cooper, Wagner played the song for him. Alice had a title for a song he had been wanting to write. While keeping the main riff and vocal melodies, Cooper and Wagner penned new lyrics and recorded it for Cooper's album Welcome to My Nightmare. The song delivered a message against domestic abuse. Since its initial release in 1975 \\"Only Women Bleed\\" has been covered by more than 30 artists, including Tina Turner, Etta James, Guns N' Roses, Lita Ford, Carmen McRae and Tori Amos. Following \\"Only Women Bleed\\", Wagner co-wrote a series of hit power ballads with Alice Cooper, including \\"I Never Cry\\", \\"You And Me\\" and \\"How You Gonna See Me Now\\" (the latter written by Cooper, Wagner and Bernie Taupin). Other songs co-written by Wagner brought him public recognition as a songwriting talent. First \\"Shine Silently\\" with Nils Lofgren, who performed it originally on his 1979 album Nils, then as part of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band's 1990 eponymous first album. \\"Just as I Am\\", written by Wagner with Rob Hegel, was a Top 20 hit for Air Supply. At the behest of producer Bob Ezrin, Wagner flew to Toronto and recorded guitar on seven tracks of the Air Supply album that included this song. Another power ballad, \\"I Might As Well Be on Mars\\", again with Alice Cooper, was featured on Cooper's 1991 album Hey Stoopid. One of the songs Wagner was most proud of is \\"Remember The Child\\", written to address the issue of child abuse. Written from the point of view of a child, the lyrics and song melody deliver a powerful and poignant message to adults that a child will forever remember the love or abuse of their childhood. New York Times best selling author John Bradshaw selected \\"Remember The Child\\" as the theme song for his award-winning PBS television special, \\"Homecoming: Reclaiming and Healing Your Inner Child\\". Bradshaw invited Wagner to join him on his nationwide tour to perform the song as a cathartic and healing piece of music to the thousands who attended Bradshaw's lectures and seminars. Embraced by psychiatrists and psychologists in their practices, the song has been used as a tool to evoke emotion from patients who are unable to express feelings. In 1996, Wagner was invited by Leo Najar, conductor of the Saginaw Bay Symphony Orchestra to perform a two and a half hour concert of his songs with the symphony. Wagner entitled the concert, \\"The Remember The Child Concert\\", raising funds for child abuse agencies in central Michigan through his \\"Remember The Child Foundation\\". Later life and career Wagner moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in 2005 where he was writing a new album with Alan Gordon (Happy Together, Celebrate). In 2007 he wrote songs for the artist Wednesday for her debut album Torch Rock, released on his independent record label Desert Dreams Records. Because of the efforts of his career strategist and publicist Al Gomes, Wednesday's album, produced by Wagner, was placed on the official ballot by The Recording Academy for the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Three years later, Gomes assisted in getting Wagner and songwriting partner Alice Cooper's song 'Something to Remember Me By' (from 'Welcome to My Nightmare 2') placed on the 55th Annual Grammy Awards ballot for Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song. A film about the work of Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter, entitled \\"Rock and Roll Animals\\", was in production in 2007 by Noble Savage Productions. In filmed interviews, Alice Cooper talks about hiring Dick Wagner, writing with him and hiring the greatest guitar players to be in his band. Fred Mandel, keyboardist with the Alice Cooper Band was also interviewed. The film was never completed, but the clips are on YouTube. In 2006, Wagner cooperated with the Italian rock singer Chris Catena in recording a cover version of \\"Theme for an Imaginary Western,\\" the famous rock song by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown, which will be released in the third album of the Italian singer around 2015. In 2007, Wagner suffered a massive heart attack and stroke. After arriving DOA at a Scottsdale hospital, he spent two weeks in a coma, awakening with a paralyzed left arm. While recovering from his heart attack, Wagner continued to write songs and began writing his memoirs, which ultimately became his book, Not Only Women Bleed. As he slowly recovered from his heart attack and stroke, Wagner manifested unusual symptoms, including difficulty walking and concentrating, loss of balance, and symptoms of dementia, threatening his music career and his life. In 2011, Wagner was diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a type of dementia which affects, among other things, fine motor skills and gait. In late 2011, after successful surgery at Barrow Neurological Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, Wagner was able to make a significant recovery, regaining almost all of the dexterity which had been lost over the course of the disorder's progression. Dick Wagner's former band the Frost was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends online Hall of Fame in 2008. The group's recording of \\"Mystery Man\\", a Wagner composition, was voted a Legendary Michigan Song in 2009. He continued to recover from his near-fatal heart attack and recorded with long-time collaborator Steve Hunter on an unnamed single for Wednesday. Wagner released a new CD in October 2009, called Full Meltdown on Desert Dreams Records. It features 15 lost and newly discovered songs recorded by Wagner between 1979 and 1995. He also produced the band Warsaw Pact and the independent artist Brandon Bullard with releases from both in early 2010. Wagner scored with Alice Cooper and the British funk rock band the Velvet Hearts the soundtrack to the Indie horror film Silas Gore, A Film Trilogy. Similar to his original work on the first Alice Cooper solo album Welcome to My Nightmare, Dick also contributed lead guitar to the final track, \\"The Underture\\", from the album Welcome 2 My Nightmare. It represents instrumental versions of several songs from each album. In 2010, Gibson.com honored the guitar tandem of Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter with two places in the Top 50 Guitar Solos of All Time - #25 for \\"Intro to Sweet Jane\\" (Lou Reed), and as #41 \\"Train Kept A Rollin' (Aerosmith). In 2012, Gibson published Riff This Way: Aerosmith's Top 10 Riff-Heavy Tracks, placing Dick Wagner with two winning guitar solos: The #1 Best Aerosmith Guitar Solo for his lead guitar on \\"Same Old Song and Dance\\", and also #4, honoring his performance as lead guitarist with Steve Hunter on \\"Train Kept A Rollin'\\". Wagner won a number of BMI Songwriter awards and other international music awards and his work has been featured on albums earning more than 35 gold and platinum records. In 2012, Dick Wagner was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. In 2012, Wagner's memoirs, Not Only Women Bleed, Vignettes from the Heart of a Rock Musician, were released to tremendous acclaim, spending more than two weeks at No. 1 on Amazon.com's Hot New Releases in Biographies & Memoirs of Entertainers. His book has won five international book awards. The same year, Wagner joined forces with the Mugshots - the only European band ever produced by the musician \\\\- and spent two weeks in Italy to produce their acclaimed release \\"Love, Lust And Revenge\\" (GCM Music/Alka Records/Black Widow Records), on which he is featured as lead guitarist as well. Susan Michelson is featured as associated producer, British ladies Never The Bride provided backing vocals, American actress Suzi Lorraine is featured on the cover. The record was then mixed in Phoenix by Otto D'Agnolo at Chaton Studios, and mastered by Wagner's longtime friend and collaborator, Gil Markle. The Mugshots - \\"a majestic Euro-American combination of classic rock and dark stories\\" in the musician's words - are known to be the only band to have recorded a cover version of \\"Pass The Gun Around\\", written by Dick Wagner back in 1983 for Alice Cooper's DaDa. In 2013 and 2014, after suffering more than six years of extreme health adversities: two heart attacks, a stroke, a paralyzed left arm, a diagnosis of hydrocephalus (NPH) two brain surgeries, a pacemaker and more, Wagner's guitar playing facilities had returned, and he fully resumed performing, touring with the Dick Wagner Band, writing songs and producing music. His book tour for Not Only Women Bleed took him to more than 40 states. With personal appearances in documentary films and writing film scores, Wagner had three songs featured in the multi-award-winning documentary \\"Louder than Love\\" (including the opening song and the closing credits song). Leading up to his death, Wagner's projects included producing and writing for Danish rock star, Maryann Cotton, in a concept album and TV project reminiscent of Wagner's shock rock history, a featuring in the forthcoming third solo album of the Italian rocker Chris Catena, entitled Return of the Freak. On July 30, 2014, Wagner died of respiratory failure at the age of 71. Charitable contributions In November 2013, Wagner released his song and video tribute, \\"If I Had the Time (I Could Change the World)\\", on various digital download sites to raise money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Wagner gathered more than 50 musicians to record at Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles, including Mark Farner on lead vocals; Danny Seraphine on drums; Lee Sklar; Fred Mandel on piano; Elliot Easton; Jennifer Batten; Merilee Rush; and Trini Lopez and Laurie Beebe Lewis on lead vocals. In November 2011 Wagner, along with Detroit musicians Ray Goodman, Dennis Burr, Prakash John, Jim McCarty, Johnny Bee Badanjek, Jimmie Bones, Ty Stone, Robert Wagner, Muruga and Pat Lewis, recorded Motor City Music at Harmonie Park Studios in Detroit in support of Franciscan friar Brother Al Mascia's \\"Bicycle Ministry.\\" Mascia pedals a bicycle cart around the streets of downtown Detroit, delivering hot drinks, food and warm clothing to the homeless. The donated proceeds enable Brother Al to purchase additional supplies. Wagner is also the First Artist Ambassador for Guitars for Vets. Recovering from hydrocephalus, Wagner became a National Spokesperson for Hydrocephalus.org. To support awareness of violence against women and children, Wagner and his production company, Desert Dreams Productions, created a video featuring Desert Dreams artist, Wednesday, performing her gospel-inflected version of \\"Only Women Bleed,\\" at Alice Cooper's Christmas Pudding Show in Phoenix, Arizona. Footage from her performance, featuring Dick Wagner on guitar, was interspersed with researched data on abuse among a variety of age groups and cultures, along with empowering photos of women from around the world.

Together, these two clades form the clade Neornithes. Palaeognathae contains five extant branches of flightless lineages (plus two extinct clades), termed ratites, and one flying lineage, the Neotropic tinamous.*Wetmore, A. (1960) There are 47 species of tinamous, 5 of kiwis (Apteryx), 3 of cassowaries (Casuarius), 1 of emus (Dromaius) (another became extinct in historic times), 2 of rheas (Rhea) and 2 of ostrich (Struthio).Clements, J. C. et al. (2010) Recent research has indicated that paleognaths are monophyletic but the traditional taxonomic split between flightless and flighted forms is incorrect; tinamous are within the ratite radiation, meaning flightlessness arose independently multiple times via parallel evolution. There are three extinct groups that are undisputed members of Palaeognathae: the Lithornithiformes, the Dinornithiformes (moas) and the Aepyornithiformes (elephant birds). There are other extinct birds which have been allied with the Palaeognathae by at least one author, but their affinities are a matter of dispute. The word Paleognath is derived from the ancient Greek for \\"old jaws\\" in reference to the skeletal anatomy of the palate, which is described as more primitive and reptilian than that in other birds.Houde, P. T. (1988) Paleognathous birds retain some basal morphological characters but are by no means living fossils as their genomes continued to evolve at the DNA level under selective pressure at rates comparable to the Neognathae branch of living birds, though there is some controversy about the precise relationship between them and the other birds. There are also several other scientific controversies about their evolution (see below).Leonard, L. et al. (2005)  Evolution  No unambiguously paleognathous fossil birds are known until the Cenozoic (though birds occasionally interpreted as lithornithids occur in Albian appalachian sitesPalaeogene Fossil BirdsA lithornithid (Aves: Palaeognathae) from the Paleocene (Tiffanian) of southern California ), but there have been many reports of putative paleognathes, and it has long been inferred that they may have evolved in the Cretaceous. Given the northern hemisphere location of the morphologically most basal fossil forms (such as Lithornis, Pseudocrypturus, Paracathartes and Palaeotis), a Laurasian origin for the group can be inferred. The present almost entirely Gondwanan distribution would then have resulted from multiple colonisations of the southern landmasses by flying forms that subsequently evolved flightlessness, and in many cases, gigantism. Pseudocrypturus cercanaxius fossil cast, Copenhagen Zoological Museum One study of molecular and paleontological data found that modern bird orders, including the paleognathous ones, began diverging from one another in the Early Cretaceous.Cooper, Alan & Penny, David (1997) Benton (2005) summarized this and other molecular studies as implying that paleognaths should have arisen 110 to 120 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous. He points out, however, that there is no fossil record until 70 million years ago, leaving a 45 million year gap. He asks whether the paleognath fossils will be found one day, or whether the estimated rates of molecular evolution are too slow, and that bird evolution actually accelerated during an adaptive radiation after the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìPg boundary).Benton, Michael J. (2005) Other authors questioned the monophyly of the Palaeognathae on various grounds, suggesting that they could be a hodgepodge of unrelated birds that have come to be grouped together because they are coincidentally flightless. Unrelated birds might have developed ratite-like anatomies multiple times around the world through convergent evolution. McDowell (1948) asserted that the similarities in the palate anatomy of paleognathes might actually be neoteny, or retained embryonic features. He noted that there were other feature of the skull, such as the retention of sutures into adulthood, that were like those of juvenile birds. Thus, perhaps the characteristic palate was actually a frozen stage that many carinate bird embryos passed through during development. The retention of early developmental stages, then, may have been a mechanism by which various birds became flightless and came to look similar to one another.McDowell, Sam (1948) Life restoration of Lithornis. Hope (2002) reviewed all known bird fossils from the Mesozoic looking for evidence of the origin of the evolutionary radiation of the Neornithes. That radiation would also signal that the paleognaths had already diverged. She notes five Early Cretaceous taxa that have been assigned to the Palaeognathae. She finds that none of them can be clearly assigned as such. However, she does find evidence that the Neognathae and, therefore, also the Palaeognathae had diverged no later than the Early Campanian age of the Cretaceous period.Hope, Sylvia (2002) Vegavis is a fossil bird from the Albian period of Early Cretaceous Antarctica. Vegavis is most closely related to true ducks. Because virtually all phylogenetic analyses predict that ducks diverged after paleognathes, this is evidence that paleognathes had already arisen well before that time.Clarke, J. A. et al. (2005) An exceptionally preserved specimen of the extinct flying paleognathe Lithornis was published by Leonard et al. in 2005. It is an articulated and nearly complete fossil from the early Eocene of Denmark, and thought to have the best preserved lithornithiform skull ever found. The authors concluded that Lithornis was a close sister taxon to tinamous, rather than ostriches, and that the lithornithiforms + tinamous were the most basal paleognaths. They concluded that all ratites, therefore, were monophyletic, descending from one common ancestor that became flightless. They also interpret the paleognath-like Limenavis, from Early Cretaceous Patagonia, as possible evidence of a Cretaceous and monophyletic origin for paleognathes. Mysterious large eggs from the Pliocene of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands have been attributed to ratites. An ambitious genomic analysis of the living birds was performed in 2007, and it contradicted Leonard et al. (2005). It found that tinamous are not primitive within the paleognathes, but among the most advanced. This requires multiple events of flightlessness within the paleognathes and partially refutes the Gondwana vicariance hypothesis (see below). The study looked at DNA sequences from 19 loci in 169 species. It recovered evidence that the paleognathes are one natural group (monophyletic), and that their divergence from other birds is the oldest divergence of any extant bird groups. It also placed the tinamous within the ratites, more derived than ostriches, or rheas and as a sister group to emus and kiwis, and this makes ratites paraphyletic.Hackett, S. J. et al. (2008) A related study addressed the issue of paleognath phylogeny exclusively. It used molecular analysis and looked at twenty unlinked nuclear genes. This study concluded that there were at least three events of flightlessness that produced the different ratite orders, that the similarities between the ratite orders are partly due to convergent evolution, and that the Palaeognathae are monophyletic, but the ratites are not.Harshman, J. et al. (2008) Beginning in 2010, DNA analysis studies have shown that tinamous are the sister group to extinct moa of New Zealand.  History of classifications  In the history of biology there have been many competing taxonomies of the birds now included in the Palaeognathae. The topic has been studied by Dubois (1891), Sharpe (1891), Shufeldt (1904), Sibley and Ahlquist (1972, 1981) and Cracraft (1981). Merrem (1813) is often credited with classifying the paleognathes together, and he coined the taxon \\"Ratitae\\" (see above). However, Linnaeus (1758) placed cassowaries, emus, ostriches, and rheas together in Struthio. Lesson (1831) added the kiwis to the Ratitae. Parker (1864) reported the similarities of the palates of the tinamous and ratites, but Huxley (1867) is more widely credited with this insight. Huxley still placed the tinamous with the Carinatae of Merrem because of their keeled sterna, and thought that they were most closely related to the Galliformes. Pycraft (1900) presented a major advance when he coined the term Palaeognathae. He rejected the Ratitae-Carinatae classification that separated tinamous and ratites. He reasoned that a keelless, or \\"ratite\\", sternum could easily evolve in unrelated birds that independently became flightless. He also recognized that the ratites were secondarily flightless. His subdivisions were based on the characters of the palatal skeleton and other organ systems. He established seven roughly modern orders of living and fossil paleognaths (Casuarii, Struthiones, Rheae, Dinornithes, Aepyornithes, Apteryges, and Crypturi ‚Äì the latter his term for tinamous, after the Tinamou genus Crypturellus). The Palaeognathae are usually considered a superorder, but authors have treated them as a taxon as high as subclass (Stresemann 1927‚Äì1934) or as low as an order (Cracraft 1981 and the IUCN, which includes all palaeognaths in \\"Struthioniformes\\").  Cladistics  Cladogram based on Mitchell (2014) with some clade names after Yuri et. al (2013) Cloutier, A. et al. (2019) in their molecular study places ostriches as the basal lineage with the rhea as the next most basal.Cloutier A, Sackton TB, Grayson P, Clamp M, Baker AJ, Edwards SV (2019) Whole-genome analyses resolve the phylogeny of flightless birds (Palaeognathae) in the presence of an empirical anomaly zone. Syst Biol Description Paleognathes are named for a characteristic, complex architecture of the bones in the bony palate. Cracraft (1974) defined it with five characters. # The vomer is large and articulates with the premaxillae and maxillopalatines anteriorly. Posteriorly the vomer fuses to the ventral surface of the pterygoid, and the palatines fuse to the ventral surface of this pterygovomer articulation. # The pterygoid prevents the palatine from articulating medially with the basisphenoid. # The palatine and pterygoid fuse into a rigid joint. # The articulation on the pterygoid for the basipterygoid process of the basicranium is located near the articulation between the pterygoid and quadrate. # The pterygoid‚Äìquadrate articulation is complex and includes the orbital process of the quadrate.Cracraft, Joel (1974) Paleognathes share similar pelvis anatomy. There is a large, open ilio‚Äìischiatic fenestra in the pelvis. The pubis and ischium are likely to be longer than the ilium, protruding out beneath the tail. The postacetabular portion of the pelvis is longer than the preacetabular portion. Paleognathes share a pattern of grooves in the horny covering of the bill. This covering is called the rhamphotheca. The paleognath pattern has one central strip of horn, with long, triangular, strips to either side. In Paleognathes, the male incubates the eggs. The male may include in his nest the eggs of one female or more than one. He may also have eggs deposited in his nest by females that did not breed with him, in cases of nest parasitism. Only in ostriches and the great spotted kiwi does the female also assist in incubating the eggs. The tinamous of Central and South America are primarily terrestrial, though they fly weakly. Tinamous have very short tail feathers, giving them an almost tailless aspect. In general, they resemble galliform birds like quails and grouse. Tinamous have a very long, keeled, breastbone with an unusual three- pronged shape. This bone, the sternum, has a central blade (the Carina sterni), with two long, slender lateral trabeculae, which curve to either side and nearly touch the keel posteriorly. These trabeculae may also be thought of as the rims of two large foramina that incise the posterior edge of the sternum, and extend almost its whole length. Tinamous have a proper semicircular furcula, with no trace of a hypocleidium.Eyton, T.C. (1867) There is an acute angle between the scapula and coracoid, as in all flying birds. The pelvis has an open ilio‚Äìischiatic fenestra that incises the posterior edge between the ilium and ischium, as in all paleognathes. Tinamous have no true pygostyle, their caudal vertebrae remain unfused, as in ratites.Feduccia, Alan (1996) Tinamou feathers look like those of volant birds in that they have a rachis and two vanes. The structure of tinamou feathers is unique, however, in that they have barbs that remain joined at their tips. Thus the parallel barbs are separated only by slits between them.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2002) Tinamous have uropygial glands. kiwi, ostrich, and Dinornis, each with its egg Ratite birds are strictly flightless and their anatomy reflects specializations for terrestrial life. The term \\"ratite\\" is from the Latin word for raft, ratis, because they possess a flat breastbone, or sternum, shaped like a raft. This characteristic sternum differs from that in flighted birds, where the pectoral musculature is disproportionately large to provide the power for wingbeats and the sternum develops a prominent keel, or carina sterni to anchor these muscles. The clavicles do not fuse into a furcula. Instead, if present at all, each is splint-like and lies along the medial border of the coracoid, attached there by a coraco‚Äìclavicular ligament. There is an obtuse angle between the scapula and coracoid, and the two bones fuse together to form a scapulocoracoid. Ratites have reduced and simplified wing structures and strong legs. Except in some rhea wing feathers, the barb filaments that make up the vanes of the feathers do not lock tightly together, giving the plumage a shaggier look and making it unnecessary to oil their feathers. Adult ratites have no preen gland (uropygial gland) that contains preening oil. Paleognaths as a whole tend to have proportionally small brains, and are among the living birds with the most limited cognitive abilities. Kiwis are exceptional, however, and have large brains comparable to those of parrots and songbirds, though evidence for similar levels of behaviour complexity are currently lacking.Jeremy Corfield, John Martin Wild, Mark E Hauber and M Fabiana Kubke, Evolution of Brain Size in the Palaeognath Lineage, with an Emphasis on New Zealand Ratites, Brain, Behavior and Evolution 71(2):87‚Äì99 ¬∑ February 2008 Impact Factor: 2.01 ¬∑ DOI: 10.1159/000111456 ¬∑ Source: PubMed Sizes Living members of Palaeognathae range from to and weight can be from .Robertson C.J.R.

Cassowaries and rheas show a similar likeness in agility and some extinct forms may have reached speeds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Biogeography Today, the ratites are largely restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, though across the Cenozoic they were also present in Europe, North America and Asia. In the Cretaceous, these southern continents were connected, forming a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana is the crucial territory in a major scientific question about the evolution of Palaeognathae, and thus about the evolution of all of the Neornithes. There are two theories regarding the evolution of paleognathes. According to the Gondwana vicariance hypothesis, the paleognathes evolved once, from one ancestor, on Gondwana during the Cretaceous, and then rode on the daughter landmasses that became today's southern continents. This hypothesis is supported most strongly by molecular clock studies, but it is weakened by the lack of any Cretaceous or southern fossil paleognaths, as well as the early radiation of paleognaths in Laurasian landmasses. According to the Tertiary radiation hypothesis, they evolved after the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event from multiple flying ancestors on multiple continents around the world. This hypothesis is supported by molecular phylogeny studies and matches the fossil record, but it is weakened by morphological phylogenetic studies. Both hypotheses have been supported and challenged by many studies by many authors. A 2016 study of both genetic and morphological divergence concludes that the group had a Laurasian origin. Gondwana vicariance hypothesis Cracraft (2001) gave a comprehensive review to the data and strongly supported the Gondwana vicariance hypothesis with phylogenetic evidence and historical biogeography. He cites molecular clock studies that show a basal divergence date for neornithes being around 100 Mya. He credits the authors of the molecular clock studies with the observation that the lack of southern paleognath fossils may correspond to the relatively scarce southern Cretaceous deposits, and the relative lack of paleontological field work in the southern hemisphere. Moreover, Cracraft synthesizes the morphological and molecular studies, noting conflicts between the two, and finds that the bulk of the evidence favors paleognath monophyly. He also notes that not only the ratites, but other basal groups of neognathous birds, show trans-Antarctic distribution, as would be expected if the paleognaths and neognaths had diverged in Gondwana.Cracraft, Joel (2001) Geological analyses have suggested that New Zealand may have been entirely under water as recently as 28 Mya, making it impossible for flightless birds to have survived. However, the discovery of a Sphenodon fossil dating to the Early Miocene 19‚Äì16 Mya raises question as to whether the island mass was completely submerged. This finding offers further evidence that ancient Sphenodon species lived on some portion of the land mass since it separated from Gondwana approximately 82 Mya. Evidence of a sea level rise submerging much of New Zealand is generally accepted, but there is a debate about how much of New Zealand was submerged. A Sphenodon species surviving on a remnant part of the island suggests that larger species may have survived as well.Jones, M. (2009) Ultimately, the earliest recorded paleognaths are flying, presumably plesiomorphic lithornithids, found quite possibly as early as the Late Cretaceous in North America, while some of the earliest flightless ratites occur in Europe. The vicariance hypothesis relies on the assumption southern landmasses were more relevant to ratite evolution than the northern ones. Tertiary radiation hypothesis Feduccia (1995) emphasized the extinction event at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary as the probable engine of diversification in the Neornithes, picturing only one or very few lineages of birds surviving the end of the Cretaceous. He also noted that birds around the world had developed ratite-like anatomies when they became flightless, and saw the affinities of modern ratites, especially kiwis, as ambiguous.Feduccia, Alan (1995) In this emphasis on the Cenozoic, rather than Cretaceous period, as the time of basal divergences between neornithines, he follows Olson.Olson, Storrs L. (1989) Houde demonstrated that the Lithornithiformes, a group of flying birds that were common in the Cenozoic of the northern hemisphere, were also paleognaths. He argues that the lithornithiform bird Paleotis, known from fossils in Denmark (northern hemisphere), shared unique anatomical features of the skull that make it a member of the same order as the ostriches. He also argued that the kiwis should not have reached New Zealand, which moved away from the mainland in the Early Cretaceous, if their ancestor was flightless; this claim at least has been vindicated by the discovery of the possibly volant Proapteryx. He therefore deduced that lithornithiform ancestors could have reached the southern continents some 30 to 40 million years ago, and evolved flightless forms which are today's ratites.Houde, Peter (1986) This hypothesis is contradicted by some later molecular studies (Cooper 1997), but supported by others (Harshman et al. 2008) (see below). Relationship to humans The human lineage evolved in Africa in sympatry with ostriches. After Homo appeared and left Africa for other continents, they continued to encounter ostriches in Arabia and much of southern and central Asia. No contact was made with other palaeognath genera until the Aborigines populated New Guinea and Australia. Subsequently, Paleo-Indians encountered tinamous and rheas in Central and South America, Austronesian settlers encountered and exterminated the elephant birds of Madagascar, and the Maori did likewise to the moa of New Zealand. The giant ratites of Madagascar and New Zealand had evolved with little or no exposure to mammalian predators, and were unable to cope with predation by humans; many other oceanic species met the same fate (as apparently had the Australian dromornithids earlier). Worldwide, most giant birds became extinct by the end of the 18th century and most surviving species are now endangered.

It is intended for attaching a bayonet, which is typically a long spike or thrusting knife. The bayonet lug is the metal mount that either locks the bayonet onto the weapon or provides a base for the bayonet to rest against, so that when a bayonet thrust is made, the bayonet does not move or slip backwards. Less than 400 years ago, bayonet lugs or their predecessors that allowed them to slip over the barrel did not exist. Prior to the lug's invention plug bayonets were used, which were stuffed into the muzzle's end from a tight-fitting stub, rendering the firearm virtually useless and certainly preventing it from being discharged. But by the late 17th century, this type of bayonet was entirely phased out and subsequently replaced with the socket bayonet, that slides over the muzzle with the blade offset to the side, just above or underneath. The socket bayonet would be replaced by the press stud and bayonet lug. Bayonet lugs are usually located near the muzzle end of a musket, rifle, or other longarm barrel. The lug is occasionally placed on top of the barrel, if serving as the base of the front sight, or more often mounted to the side or bottom of the barrel. Legality Unlike collection worthy firearms that were military issue, civilian firearms based on their military versions are often subject to legal issues in various states. Many manufacturers do not even bother with making the bayonet lugs. The Assault weapons ban in 1994 issued that new firearms could not have bayonet lugs. In the context of that law, the National Rifle Association deemed telescoping stocks a \\"cosmetic feature\\". Most AR uppers for example being sold today do not have bayonet lugs, because they are typically free-float quad-rail setups with hidden gas blocks and no way to attach a bayonet.

WQDR-FM's studios and offices are on Highwoods Boulevard in Raleigh.947QDR.com/contact The transmitter is off Business Route 70 in Garner, on an antenna used by many Raleigh TV and FM stations.Radio-Locator.com/WQDR- FM WQDR-FM is a Primary Entry Point (PEP) station for the Emergency Alert System, and was previously the Common Program Control Station (or CPCS-1) for the Raleigh operational area of the Emergency Broadcast System.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxmCYGdmcNs WQDR-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format, with its HD-2 subchannel carrying the soft oldies programming of co-owned AM 850 WPTK. WQDR-FM's HD-3 subchannel airs the adult contemporary programming of AM 570 WPLW. History=Early years In August 1949, the Durham Life Insurance Company signed on WPTF-FM, then at 94.5 MHz. The station, which moved the following year to 94.7 MHz, transmitted from atop one of co-owned AM 680 WPTF's three towers in what is now Cary, near Interstate 40 East. Both stations had studios and offices in downtown Raleigh at 410 Salisbury Street. During its early years, WPTF-FM simulcast its sister station. In the 1960s and early 1970s, WPTF-FM was separately programmed, airing a classical music format. The creative force behind a change to a rock music format was Durham Life Broadcasting's then President and General Manager, Carl Venters. Venters, who succeeded Richard Mason in June 1972, believed quadraphonic (four channels versus the two channels of the dominant audio format, stereo) music, particularly rock music, to be the wave of the future for FM radio. The new call letters of WQDR were selected to match the phrase \\"quadraphonic rock\\". Quadraphonic rock Venters hired Lee Abrams, a 19-year-old broadcaster then working for ABC Radio's progressive rock station in Detroit, WRIF. Abrams' mission was to create an Album Rock format for the Raleigh radio market. Abrams' idea was that album sales should determine a rock station's playlist, with songs from the hottest selling LPs played the most often. Venters also appointed David Berry as station manager. David Sousa was hired as program director, having previously worked with Abrams at WMYQ in Miami. Abrams, Sousa, and Robert W. Walker (an associate of Abrams) created an Album Rock music playlist and a program structure that was later known as the \\"Superstars\\" format. WQDR became the first FM station in the nation using this guide. The new format went on the air on December 26, 1972 at midnight. The last song on WPTF-FM was \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\", while the first on WQDR was \\"Bitch\\" by the Rolling Stones. Within a year the station had double-digit ratings. After that first year, the \\"Superstars\\" format was being used in over 30 markets around the country. Abrams teamed up with veteran consultant Kent Burkhart, and later helped develop music formats for XM Satellite Radio. In its rock days, WQDR garnered some impressive listener ratings. Among the many memorable on-air personalities during the WQDR rock era were David Sousa, Frank Laseter, Mike Koste, Bill Hard, Jason Janulis, Roger Nelson, Bob Heymann, Steve Mitchell, Mark Silver, John Scott (John Chrystal), Chris Miller, Keith Wilson, Jim Huste, Sean Sizemore (Sean Scott), and Rad Messick. In later years, the air staff included Greg Wells, Jo Leigh Ferriss, Bob Kirk (Robert Kirk), Daniel Brunty, Tom Gongaware, Bob Walton, Rockin' Ron Phillips, Tom Guild, Tim Sullivan(Tim Sampair over-nights), John Lisle, Steve Kahn, Tom Evans, Brian McFadden, Cabell Smith (who was previously WDBS's morning classical DJ), Bob Robinson, and Pat Patterson, who was hired for mornings in 1978 after years at crosstown Top-40 station WKIX. In 1981, WQDR's News Department won a Peabody Award for a series produced by News Director Gayle Rancer and Joan Siefert on Vietnam Vets, entitled \\"Our Forgotten Warriors.\\" It was an accomplishment almost unheard of at the time for a rock-music radio station and a first for a North Carolina radio station. This extensive and comprehensive investigative news series also reeled in an Ohio State Award and other honors regionally and nationally. In 1977, the Durham Life Broadcasting Company bought a local television station, Channel 28 WRDU-TV (now WRDC) in Durham. WQDR's transmitter joined Channel 28, renamed WPTF-TV, using a tower that stood off Penny Road in Apex. Switch to country Despite continued success as a rock station into the 1980s, the Durham Life Broadcasting Company decided WQDR would have more success in the country music format. Venters left to form Voyager Communications group in 1982. In the summer of 1984, Durham Life Broadcasting, under Don Curtis' management, announced plans to switch WQDR's format to country in September. This predictably set off a howl of protest from listeners, and added media coverage for the station and its staffers. When Durham Life flipped WQDR to country music in early September 1984, several fired DJs and a number of off- air personnel re-appeared on 106.1 WRDU-FM (now WTKK), owned by Voyager Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1985 page B-202 WRDU-FM made the opposite switch, going from Country to Rock, on the same day as WQDR's format flip. WQDR ended its run as a rock station exactly how it began 12 years earlier, closing out with \\"Bitch\\" by the Rolling Stones. The running joke at the time was that WQDR stood for \\"We Quit Doing Rock\\". WQDR, now playing country, and WRDU-FM playing rock, enjoyed ratings success in the following years. WQDR's switch to country gave listeners in the Raleigh market the chance to hear their favorite country artists on a full-power FM station, broadcasting in stereo. Till the 1980s, most country stations were on the AM band. In 1987, Durham Life moved the studios for WQDR and WPTF radio from Salisbury Street to a new broadcast center at 3012 Highwoods Boulevard in North Raleigh, where they were joined by WPTF-TV, which moved from studios on NC Highway 54 in Durham. On December 10, 1989, WPTF-TV, broadcasting from a antenna near Garner, lost its tower when it collapsed due to uneven ice thawing. WPTF-TV returned to its former tower in Apex, with WQDR, to be joined by 101.5 WRAL-FM, whose site on the WRAL-TV tower was also destroyed that same day. When WRAL-TV and WPTF-TV re-built a common tower at the Garner site, both radio stations soon moved there. Since that tower placement substantially increased WQDR's antenna height above average terrain, its effective radiated power was reduced to 95 kilowatts in order to conform to the FCC's \\"Class C\\" FM station parameters. In 1991, Durham Life divested its broadcast properties, with WQDR and sister AM station WPTF going to what is now the Curtis Media Group. After three nominations in previous years, WQDR won Country Music Association Large-Market Station of the Year in 2011. In 2017, the station's call sign changed from WQDR to WQDR-FM. The -FM suffix was added to the call letters to allow co-owned AM 570 WFNL to switch its call sign to WQDR. The AM station had at that time flipped to a classic country format, playing many of the past country hits made popular on 94.7 WQDR-FM years ago. Programming WQDR's morning radio team, dubbed \\"The Q Morning Crew,\\" features Mike Wheless and Mike Raley. From 2004 to 2006 The Q Morning Crew also included the country singer Heather Green.index After Green's exit, the show added broadcasting newbie Janie Carothers and Marty \\"The One Man Party\\" Young to the lineup. It is one of the most popular morning radio shows in the Raleigh media market. Until the end of 2010, WQDR also aired MRN and PRN radio broadcasts of the NASCAR Sprint Cup series races. Those broadcasts were relocated to co-owned 680 WPTF. Some of the notable radio announcers that used to work at the radio station included long-time employee and morning man Jay Butler, Donna Reed and Dan Robins. In January 2018, WQDR-FM listeners were saddened with the loss of Program Director and afternoon drive time personality Lisa McKay, who died at age 54. She fell ill during the Christmas holidays and tests confirmed she had bile duct cancer. During the mid 1990s Jerry Carrol hosted a show called Wild Man Wednesday. The show aired from 7 am to 9 am every week on Wednesday.

Released in 1976, this was his second of three solo albums with the DJM Records label. This album was released in the USA and Canada in May 1977 under the title Danny Kirwan, with a different sleeve (front and back) and a biography / review written by Michael Hogan. The recorded material is identical to the UK release. It was released for the first time on CD, only in Japan, in February 2006. Songs and backing band Apart from the self-penned tracks, Kirwan includes a reggae-style cover of The Beatles' \\"Let It Be\\", which was a single in the United States. The other single from this album was \\"Misty River\\". Another cover version was \\"Look Around You\\", written by Dave Walker, himself an ex-Fleetwood Mac member. Kirwan's backing band on the album was made up of members of Stretch; an earlier incarnation of Stretch had briefly toured as a bogus version of Fleetwood Mac in 1974. Reception Allmusic critic Joe Viglione claimed that the album was \\"chock-full of quality material ‚Äì there isn't a bad track on it musically\\". Raising comparisons with America, The Beatles, Kirwan's last album with Fleetwood Mac, Bare Trees, and also the music of his old bandmate Bob Welch, he suggested that Kirwan's record label should have supported the album more strongly. Viglione gave particular credit for Kirwan's creative treatment of \\"Let It Be\\", rather than simply covering the Beatles song note for note.

It is midway between Larne and Carrickfergus, overlooking Islandmagee, and is part of the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council area. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 981. Archaeology Neolithic artefacts found in the village suggest ancient settlement, while the Lislaynan ecclesiastical settlement looks back to a thousand years of Christian witness. There was also a Norman settlement in the area, at Redhall, and at Brackenberg, now the centre of modern Ballycarry. An early Christian stone coffin lid which was uncovered at Redhall in the 18th century, was reinstated in the Templecorran cemetery and displays an early Christian cross engraved within an arc. Community The town is home to Ballycarry Presbyterian Church. Founded in 1613, Ballycarry is the oldest congregation in the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. The present church building dates from 1830. The Old Presbyterian (Non-Subscribing) Presbyterian Congregation also traces its roots back to 1613, and this congregation remained strongest in 1829 when the Presbyterian Church was split over the Subscription Controversy, the Non-Subscribers leaving open the issue of subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith. The Old Presbyterian Church is located on the Main Street in the village. The most imposing church building is that of St. John's Parish Church, the Church of Ireland congregation, built in the 19th century by the Ker family of Redhall. Ballycarry Community Association organises the Broadisland Gathering community festival held each year on the first Saturday in September and associated dates. The Gathering highlights the strong Ulster Scots heritage of the community and includes dancing, music, pipe bands, discussions, re- enactment, exhibitions and the Aul Kinntra Fair, revived from the 1930s but dating back to the 17th century. Chief guests at the Gathering have including Rt. Hon. Dr. John Reid, when Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Ballycarry has a vibrant community association, which succeeded in attracting funding for a modern community centre in the village in 2001. The Association includes representatives from all local groups in the village including the three local churches, sports clubs, fraternities and social groups. In 2009 many events were held in Ballycarry to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the community being established in 1609.  People  *James Orr, known as the Bard of Ballycarry, was the foremost of the Ulster Weaver Poets, and was writing contemporaneously with Robert Burns. He was one of many Ulster Presbyterians who fled to America after taking part in the ill-fated United Irish Rising in 1798. He returned to Ballycarry under an amnesty and died in the village in 1816. An imposing monument to Orr, erected by local Freemasons in 1831, is sited in the adjacent Templecorran cemetery. In 2011 a tourist trail, the Weaver's Trail, was officially launched in Orr's honour by the Mayor of Larne, Cllr. Bobby McKee MBE, and was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.Ballycarry - Co Antrim - Home of Poet James Orr http://www.weavers-trail.co.uk/poems-of-orr-passengers *Rev. Edward Brice, the first Presbyterian minister in Ireland, came to Ballycarry in 1613 and ministered in the Templecorran Church, now in ruins. He was originally from Stirlingshire in Scotland and was brought to the village by William Edmondstone, who settled there in 1609. Brice was one of several Scottish clergymen who were forbidden to preach by the Established Church authorities in the 1630s. *General Sir James Steele, who was born in Ballycarry, was the British Army officer who signed the mobilisation order to take the United Kingdom to war with Nazi Germany in 1939. He later played a part in the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940 and the Normandy landings in 1944. A memorial on the village green highlights his military achievements, his connection with the Royal Ulster Rifles and his love of Ballycarry. *Rev. John Bankhead, who was minister at Ballycarry for almost 71 years, was married twice and had 22 children. He was ordained in August 1763 and died in July 1833. *William Nelson, a 16-year-old hanged for his part in the ill-fated Irish Rebellion of 1798, which involved many Presbyterians in East Ulster, is known as The Ballycarry Martyr. His brother John was transported for his part in the Rising and became a successful architect in Virginia and a personal friend of President Thomas Jefferson. *William James Hume, local farmer, poet and entertainer, was author of a popular 1940s Ulster folksong The Muttonburn Stream, which is a local river lying to the north west of Ballycarry. He died in 1948. *William Calwell, who emigrated from Ulster to California, returned to the village after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and brought back architects plans for basement style bungalows, some of which still remain in the village and are unique in Northern Ireland. He was also one of the founders of a co-operative creamery in the community, which continued to operate under the Dale Farm company until the 1990s. Calwell was also a local poet and died on his 90th birthday. *The late Michelin Star chef Robbie Millar was from Ballycarry. *The graves of over 50 locally notable figures are documented in \\"The Templecorran Project: an historic guide to Templecorran cemetery, Ballycarry\\" by David Hume and John W Nelson (1999), providing a historical trail through the old cemetery in the village.

B-Fighter is short for \\"Beetle Fighter\\". It was part of Toei's Metal Hero Series franchise. It dealt with three members of the prestigious fighting against the evil forces of the otherworldly Jamahl Empire. The action footage and props were used for Big Bad Beetleborgs and it has a sequel called B-Fighter Kabuto. Storyline Insects all over the world begin to swarm for unknown reasons, with other animals and plants acting strange as well. To investigate this, Takuya Kai is dispatched with an Earth Academia group. Investigating independently, Takuya finds Guru who reveals that insects are preparing for battle against invaders from another dimension. Offering their aid, the Earth Academia create suits of armor to combat the threat as the Jamahl arrive to Earth to enslave humans. Though they have trouble perfecting the Bio-Machinery, Guru arrives to infuse the armor with the life force of many insects. Once the suits become the B-Commanders, one suit chooses Takuya while the other two bond to Daisaku Katagiri and Rei Hayama. With their newfound power, the B-Fighters fight to drive back Jamahl's forces. Characters=The B-Fighters The members use Bio-armor developed by the Earth Academia's brightest and infused with the life force of insects. * is a 23-year-old entomologist at the Earth Academia Japan Branch and is the team leader. He is very tender-hearted. His sense of responsibility is very strong. The first to meet Guru in the South American rainforest, he was also the first to gain a B-Commander and use his suit. As Blue Beet, his armor was modeled after a male Japanese rhinoceros beetle. His blood was used in the creation of his \\"evil twin\\", Shadow. After learning the true colors of the shadow, he feels responsible and goes missing. In the second half of the series, Blue Beet gained the ability to evolve into by the command . * at 23, is an impetuous but nature-loving man. A tree doctor, Daisaku claims to be able to hear trees and plants when they are dying. He was captured along with Rei by the Jamahl during the start of the invasion of Earth. Upon receiving his B-Commander, Daisaku made quick work of Jamar soldiers. He was aquaphobic until he overcame his fear to save his father Daitetsu Katagiri, a fisherman, from a trap laid by the Ebikaania. As the most physically powerful of the B-Fighters, G-Stag's armor is modeled after a stag beetle. G-Stag is strong enough to lift the Jamar soldiers and toss them around like rag dolls. * is a 22-year-old animal instructor at Earth Academia's Aquarium. Captured along with Daisaku at first and receiving her B-Commander at the same time, she demolished the Jamar soldiers before joining forces with Takuya and Daisaku. The only female B-Fighter, her armor was modeled after a female Japanese rhinoceros beetle. Reddle is the fastest and most nimble of the B-Fighters. She eventually left for the South American branch of Earth Academia to do research and help with protecting the wildlife there. * is Rei's successor, a young and cheerful 19-year-old student who was \\"chosen\\" by Rei's B-Commander as the next Reddle. Mai has a positive look on life and tries to see the good in everything. She also has a love for animals. =Allies= * is the chief of the Earth Academia's Japanese branch, dedicated to the pursuit of justice. He fell in love with Sayuri, a plant researcher, many years ago, but left her. When they meet again during Rasbelga's attack, Mukai donned a special armor and donned the title of to save her, with attacks like , , , and . He works as a \\"mentor\\" for the B-Fighters, usually working at Earth Academia to assist the team by leading research on Jamahl's warriors and developing new weaponry and vehicles for the B-Fighters. * is the elder of the insect tribe, and looks like a big brown rhinobeetle. He carries a staff with a curled top and was the one who gave the B-Fighters their powers. Guru possesses great mystical power of his own. * is another insect warrior. Drago lost any memory of his past until his fight with Blue Beet restores it. His powers are dragonfly-based. Once learning who he really was, he helped the B-Fighters defeat Hellsgyra. * is one of Jera's mercenaries who fights the B-Fighters for the money. When Mai scolds him for following Jera, and ultimately Jamahl for money, Gorgodal quits and tries to return the money he has been paid. But Gaohm didn't accept this and brainwashes Gorgodal so that he is nothing but a raging monster. Mai tries to talk to him again, but he can barely remember her name. Reddle eventually destroys Gorgodal by using her Saber Magnum. He is given a burial and his grave is marked with his own shuriken. * is a scientist from the Aroa dimension who falls in love with Takuya. * is a ghost called forth by one of Jera's soldiers, who breaks free of his control and helps fight against him. * is originally Kazuma Iwata, a reckless biker. He is put in Jamhal's \\"Survival School\\" with Mai, who tries to get him and the other captured people out of the School. Kazuma is brainwashed and changed into an evil warrior by a machine used by Jera. The control device is in his bike's fairing, and when that was destroyed, Night Biker changed back into back to normal Kazuma. * appears first as an old woman in a brown kimono with a brown cloth over her head and a wooden cask on her back. She can suck people inside the cask, which she uses to turn them into pickles for sale to creatures in other dimensions. She later revealed her true form, a demonic creature that can sprout and attack with claws and fangs. Babamba is not truly evil, and although Jera tries to trick her into fighting the B-Fighters, an old man who had befriended her convinces her that she doesn't need to fight anymore. She decides to stay in this dimension with him and shatters her cask freeing the people inside. * is a so-called bodyguard from another dimension who wears cowboy-like attire. He appears during a fight and offers Jera his services, but in the fight he misses the B-Fighters and escapes back to Jamahl for his pay. Later, he approaches the B-Fighters and claimed that he was just trying to infiltrate Jamahl to take out Gaohm, and if they pay him he would do just that. Mai believes him and scrounges up enough to pay him. Nero is planning to take money from both sides and leave this dimension, when Mai discovers that he has Jamahl money. Jera also appears, having discovered his secret, impales Nero. Meanwhile, Mai had scanned Nero's gun, learning that it was designed to miss. Nero hates war, and never means to kill anyone. He dies after telling Mai to end the fight quickly, because war is a terrible thing. * is a contestant in Jamahl's \\"Ghost Zone\\" battle, for which they kidnapped the B-Fighters and sent them to another dimension where they forced them to participate in combat. Daisaku soon learned that Sinbad was infiltrating Jamahl in an attempt to assassinate Gaohm for destroying his homeworld.

The company produced the Farm King line of grain augers, snowblowers, mowers and compact implements. Buhler Industries expanded in 1982 with the purchase of the Allied line of front-end loaders and the company began trading on the TSE in 1994, at which time all products were marketed under the \\"Buhler\\" brand name. The company acquired the Versatile Tractor division of New Holland Ag in the year 2000. Buhler purchased the Versatile tractor plant with a $32-million government loan. According to labour historian Doug Smith, Buhler \\"provoked a strike by demanding a gutting of benefits and seniority provisions in the union contract\\". The result was a prolonged strike that almost crippled the plant. However, the union took Buhler to the Manitoba Labour Board charging bargaining in bad faith and won a $6-million dollar settlement. Buhler pledged $5 million to build a performing arts centre in 2005 at the Morden Collegiate high school in Morden, Manitoba. The donation was eventually withdrawn in the face of community opposition to the project and cost overruns. In January 2010, John Buhler and his wife Bonnie were thanked by Lloyd Axworthy President of the University of Winnipeg after the retired industrialist gave the university $4 million to construct a building in Buhler's name.https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/uw-news-action/story.265/title.-buhler- centre-transforms-downtown-campus Axworthy noted, without any hint of irony, that \\"John and Bonnie Buhler recognize that investing in people is critical\\". However, this statement appears to be at odds with Buhler's conduct during the 2001 strike at Versatile, the result of which was that \\"Over 250 men, all of them with at least twenty years of experience, lost their jobs.\\"Smith, Doug.

The company is moving toward developing a full-line of product for large-acre growers. The company announced the second-highest earnings in history for fiscal year 2013. However, recent years have been marked by declining sales and slumping share prices: ‚ÄúOver the course of the last two years, annual sales have fallen by nearly 27 per cent, from $312 million in 2017 to $229.1 million for its year ending Sept. 30‚Äù https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/poor-harvests-affect-buhler- industries-bottom-line-566673341.html In 2019, share prices declined by 19%. https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/poor-harvests-affect-buhler- industries-bottom-line-566673341.html In March 2014, there were calls for sanctions against several Russian members of Buhler's board of directors in connection to Vladamir Putin's actions in Crimea. Konstantin Babkin, Yury Ryazanov and Dmitry Udras are connected to Rostselmash Ltd. and are said to be members of Russia's Action Party. According to media reports, a video has recently emerged from a rally in Moscow that shows Babkin publicly supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine. In March 2014, the Ukrainian-Canadian Congress called for an investigation of the Russian members of Buhler's board of directors.

In Imperialism, the player is the ruler of a 19th-century country and aims to become ruler of the world by conquest or by vote. Imperialism was followed by Imperialism II: Age of Exploration. Gameplay There are two ways to play Imperialism: in a fictional, randomly generated world, or in a historical scenario. In the first case, the player selects one of seven \\"great powers\\" and starts ruling in 1815, a year considered by many historians the beginning of the 19th-century era in the real world. The goal is to be voted world ruler by a two-thirds majority in the \\"Council of Governors\\", in which all provincial governors of the world convene once in a decade. Governors in \\"minor nations\\" tend to vote for great powers that have favored their country in trade and diplomacy, whereas governors in great powers vote for strong military powers. If no two-thirds majority is ever reached, the game continues until the year 1915, when the power with the largest number of governors behind it wins the game. Although victory is determined by the Council of Governors, the game score is determined by how much a player has built, including the size of a Great Power's military, workforce, transportation network, merchant marine, diplomatic standing and number of provinces controlled. Empire building can be achieved either through diplomacy or through conquest. In either case, the empire must have a solid economic grounding, which is established by the exploitation of the country's resources (wood, ore, etc.), by industry (for example, turning raw materials iron and coal into steel) and by trade. In the historical scenarios, the player chooses a European power - available are Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, and, depending on the period chosen, Prussia and Sardinia, or respectively Germany and Italy. The game starts not in 1815 but either in 1820 (apparently so that France isn't too weak at the start of the game), in 1848, the year of revolutions, or in 1882, at the start of the arms race that eventually led to World War I. The end of the game is still the same, except that in the third scenario (1882) the Council of Governors does not convene until 1915. Imperialism is entirely turn-based. Each turn, players make their decisions in five screens: the map screen, where \\"specialists\\" (prospectors, engineers, etc.) are put to work, and military orders are given; the transport screen, where transport capacity is allocated; the industry screen, where production is determined and workers are trained in various ways; the trade screen, where offers and bids for the next trade session are determined; and the diplomacy screen, where diplomatic decisions are made. As the game progresses the players will also be given the option to buy Research. Research can allow increased production of some raw materials, or allow for military upgrades, or in some cases render parts of the navy fleet obsolete. When all the players click the \\"End turn\\" button, the orders are processed. Turn-based trade sessions, diplomacy sessions (the acceptance/declining of treaties) and battles follow. Battles too are turn-based, and they can be either fought by the player or left to the game AI. Naval battles are always handled by the AI. In multiplayer mode, at most 7 players can play together over a network. Games can be played over a LAN or the Internet. Imperialism offers a tutorial mode and five levels of game difficulty. Game editors and mods have also been published to create new scenarios, such as a world map. Economy In Imperialism's economic model, states control production and engage in trade. To produce anything, raw materials are needed. These can be bought on the world market, or gained by exploitation of resources in the player's country. For instance, timber can be obtained by exploiting forests. It can subsequently be transformed into lumber in a lumber mill. Lumber can be used to expand internal transport, to increase factory output, or for producing merchant ships and warships. It can also be processed further into furniture, which is used to recruit new workers, but more commonly is sold on the market to produce revenue. Timber can also be processed into paper, which is used to train workers for higher levels of productivity, and then educate them so that they can serve in more advanced military units. Paper is also necessary to train expert workers as specialists (i.e. prospectors, engineers, miners, ranchers, farmers, foresters and oil drillers). Often a Great Power will buy raw materials (such as timber) from a Minor Nation and sell the refined goods (furniture) back to the same or another minor nation, generating revenue as well as improving diplomatic relations. From the start of the game, Great Powers compete to be the favored trade partner of resource-rich minor nations, using trade subsidies and various forms of diplomacy. Diplomacy In the Imperialism diplomacy screen, various treaties can be proposed to other countries, and war can be declared on them. Also, trade subsidies may be offered. These increase the prices paid for a country's export goods and decrease the price the other country pays for the player's exports, making trade more profitable for the other country and thus more likely. The treaties which may be proposed are: * Non-aggression pact. Only possible between great power and a minor nation. When a minor nation is attacked by another great power (they never attack each other), the minor nations will request help from any power with which it signed a non-aggression pact. If the request is honored, the minor nation joins the great power's empire. * Alliance. An alliance can only be forged between two great powers. When any of them enters a war, the allies are asked to wage war as well. * Request to join an empire. Minor nations will voluntarily join the empire of any power that has been sufficiently kind to them in the past (lots of trade, financial grants, a pact). * Peace treaty. * Declaration of war. This is the only treaty which may not be refused (although no minor nation will ever refuse a non-aggression pact). Before a Great Power can reach a trade agreement with a Minor Power, the Great Power must build a Trade Consulate in the Minor Power. Before the Great Power can sign a treaty with a Minor Power, the Great Power must build an Embassy in the Minor Power. The money required to build Trade Consulates and Embassies is significant, especially early in the game, when the player's revenue is limited. All Great Powers automatically possess Embassies with each other at the beginning of the game. Great Powers can encourage closer relationships with Minor Powers and each other with subsidies and grants of cash. Building Diplomatic power can be key to winning the game. When a Great Power is in an alliance with another Great Power or has signed a non- aggression pact with a Minor Power, the Great Power is expected to go to war if the other Power is attacked. In the case of two Great Powers that share an alliance, if one Great Power starts a war, the other Great Power is also expected to go to war. If a player decides not to honor an alliance or non- aggression pact, the player's Great Power loses diplomatic standing and may find it harder to negotiate alliances in the future. Negotiating a separate peace instead of waging total war will also break an alliance, with the same effect on a Great Power's diplomatic standing as if the Great Power had refused to go to war in the first place. Compatibility Although the program was written for Windows 95, it can be run under other versions of Windows using the Windows Compatibility Wizard and a change of screen resolution to 640 x 480 for complete stability. The GOG.com edition runs under Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8. Strategic Simulations Inc. also published a Macintosh version of the game, which runs on System 7 and MacOS 8. The game also runs on Wine with occasional crashes. Development Imperialism underwent several name changes during development, such as Sphere of Influence, Age of Industry and Sid Meier's Industrialization. Since 2004 Ubisoft holds the copyright. Reception According to former members of Frog City Software at Sidecar Studios, Imperialisms commercial performance was unexpectedly strong. In December 1998, Barry Brenesal of CNET Gamecenter called it a \\"sleeper hit\\" and \\"extremely successful for a turn-based strategy title\\". At the time, he noted that it was \\"still selling and has even topped the 100,000 mark.\\" Sidecar's staff noted that Imperialism outsold the \\"original sales goal more than seven-fold\\", and reached sales surpassing 300,000 copies by 2007.

Castle says the script they originally offered him was \\"horrible\\", the story of a gangster who is killed, rejected from Heaven and sent back to earth. Castle had made a movie from a script he disliked, Chance of a Lifetime and did not want to repeat the experience, so told the King Brothers they should not make the movie. The Kings, especially Frank agreed, and introduced Castle to the writer Philip Yordan. Castle says he and Yordan came up with the new story which the Kings liked.

Orson Welles wrote a contemporary review of the film which said , \\"It isn't as slick as Double Indemnity or as glossy as Laura, but it's better acted and better directed ... than either.\\" (He and Castle later worked together on The Lady from Shanghai).

Biography The daughter of a Second World War Australian Army commando and salesman, Webb was brought up in the Newcastle suburb of Charlestown and was educated at local schools. She then studied at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales where she gained a Ph.D. in literature in 1983. For many years, she taught at the Institute of Catholic Education (later part of the Australian Catholic University) in Melbourne, Victoria where she was Associate Professor and Reader in literature. From 1987-1991, Webb was a member of the editorial collective of Australian Science Fiction Review: Second Series, and is currently on the advisory board of Science Fiction Studies. She is perhaps best known for her co-editorship, with her second husband, Jack Dann, of a major anthology of Australian science fiction and fantasy, Dreaming Down-Under (Sydney: HarperCollins, 1998; New York: Tor Books, 1999), which won its editors a World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology, as well as a 1999 Ditmar Award. Her other publications include Aliens & Savages: Fiction, Politics and Prejudice (1998), The Fantastic Self (an edited collection of critical essays on fantasy and science fiction) (1999) and a scholarly edition of The Yellow Wave, Kenneth Mackay's important 1895 scientific romance (2003). These books were written and edited with her colleague, Andrew Enstice. Webb is currently working on a series of novels for young adults, The Sinbad Chronicles. The first two books are Sailing to Atlantis (2001) and The Silken Road to Samarkand (2003). In 1995, she married Jack Dann, an American science fiction author, with whom she resides near Foster in rural Victoria.

Autocars obtained licences for both parts and contracted Reliant to develop the Sabra for Autocars. Reliant introduced a right-hand drive version for the UK market and renamed it the Sabre. At Reliant, David Page redesigned the chassis and the bodyshell was redesigned by Eddie Pepall to meet US requirements.

Two ambitious actresses, who share an apartment, learn they have been short-listed for the same part and that they have to wait for one more night to see who wins the part. As they bicker throughout the night, their competitiveness and hidden grudges turn their apartment into a battlefield. Synopsis Although aspiring actresses Nozomi (Koike) and Lana (Nonami) share a Tokyo apartment that's owned by their talent management agency, they're a world apart. Nozomi is a soft-spoken country girl from Sado Island who prides herself on being demure. City girl Lana, who grew up in a rough area of Tokyo, is more worldly, experienced and jaded. Whilst in apartment, they learn they have auditioned for the same part in a highly anticipated film called Yakuza Wives and that there will be a phone call in the morning that will reveal who wins the role. They decide to stay in for the phone call. A conversation between two actresses turns sour, bringing their hidden resentment to the surface, which pushes them into committing a series of violent acts against each other while arguing over their backgrounds, lifestyles, choices, and love lives. As they lay dying from severe injuries they inflicted on each other, their apartment phone finally rings at dawn. When it goes unanswered, it's switched to their answering machine. A male voice on the machine announces they both won the part. Production 2LDK was paired with Ryuhei Kitamura's film Aragami as the Duel Project. Producer Shinya Kawai issued a challenge to directors Tsutsumi and Kitamura to create a feature-length movie each consisting a duel, two actors and one setting, along with a rule that the filming should take just one week. Tsutsumi's 2LDK was filmed in eight days, with the cast and crew often working throughout the night. The title is a Japanese real estate acronym for a 2-bedroom apartment with a Living-room, Dining-room, and Kitchen. Releases 2LDK was released in DVD form in Japan, U.S. and Korean versions. It was also included in the 3-disc box set \\"Danger after Dark\\" (which includes Suicide Club and Moon Child as well). 2LDK, part of the Duel Project, was broadcast together with Aragami in Australia through Foxtel Television in 2005.

In the past, and to a lesser extent nowadays, they often served as hospices for saliks (Sufi travelers), Murids (initiates) and talibs (Islamic students). Khanqahs are very often found adjoined to dargahs (shrines of Sufi saints) and t√ºrbes (tombs of notables), mosques and madrasas (Islamic schools). In the Arab world, especially North Africa, the khanqah is known as a zƒÅwiyah (, plural zƒÅwiyƒÅt; also transliterated as zawiya, zƒÅwiya or zaouia). In Turkey, Iran and formerly Ottoman areas like Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, they are locally referred to as tekije (; also transliterated as tekke, tekyeh, teqe or takiyah).

Shrine of Islamic Naqshbandi saints of Allo Mahar Sharif All khanqahs, regardless of size, feature a large central hall. The daily ritual prayers incumbent on all Muslims, salat, are held in this hall, as are the specifically Sufi forms of dhikr, meditation and celebration of the divine. Large khanqahs often grew up around the dargah of a tariqa's founder or of a Sufi saint. Some khanqahs include dwellings for the Sufi sheikh or pir, and his family, or cells for Sufis who wish to pursue their dhikr in quiet and isolation. They may also include lodgings for traveling Sufis and pilgrims and premises for charities such as hospitals. Sufi movements have been banned in some Muslim-majority countries such as Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, or the communist and post-communist states of Central Asia. In these countries, khanqahs have been converted to other purposes, turned into museums or mosques. In other countries, Sufism survives and the old khanqahs are still in use.

When attacking these chains, the weak spot is the backmost pawn, because it is not protected . Discussion Connected pawns that are both passed, i.e., without any enemy pawns in front of them on the same file or adjacent files, are referred to as connected passed pawns. Such pawns can be very strong in the endgame, especially if supported by other pieces. Often the opponent must sacrifice to prevent one of the pawns from promoting. Connected passed pawns are usually superior to other passed pawns. An exception is in an opposite- colored bishops endgame with a bishop and two pawns versus a bishop on the opposite color. If the pawns are connected and not beyond their fifth , the position is a theoretical draw whereas widely separated pawns would win. Two connected pawns on the same without any friendly pawns on adjacent files are called .

Opened 1999. GEM operates on the philosophy of \\"buyers beware\\" and \\"let the market decide\\" based on a strong disclosure regime. Its rules and requirements are designed to foster a culture of self compliance by listed issuers and sponsors in the discharge of their respective responsibilities. The following major features are to support this philosophy: Greater, More Frequent and Timely Disclosure GEM requires a listing applicant to disclose in detail its past business history and its future business plans which are key components of the listing documents. After listing, a GEM issuer is required to make half yearly comparison of its business progress with the business plan for the first 2 financial years, publish quarterly accounts in addition to half yearly and annual accounts and a shorter period is allowed to make available these information to the public. To allow market participants easy access to information, GEM has a separate website which provides comprehensive information covering all aspects of the market including company announcements and other information of listed issuers, trade prices and market statistics. Since 1999, more than 267 companies have raised more than HKD 40 Billion in this market.  GEM Sponsor Scheme  In recognition of the pivotal role that a GEM sponsor plays in the listing process, a GEM sponsor is required to satisfy a set of detailed eligibility criteria and assume clear responsibilities in the discharge of its duties. Amongst its duties, a GEM sponsor is required to conduct due diligence and to satisfy itself, to the best of its knowledge and belief and having made due and careful enquiries, that proper disclosures have been made.  Corporate Governance  From the time of listing, an issuer is required to establish a strong corporate governance base to facilitate its compliance with the GEM Listing Rules and adherence to proper business practices. These measures include the appointment of a qualified accountant to supervise its finance and accounting functions, designating an executive director as the compliance officer, appointment of 2 independent directors and the establishment of an audit committee. In the first 2 years after listing, a GEM issuer is also required to retain a sponsor to advise and assist the company and its directors in the discharge of their listing obligations.  Role of the Exchange  At the time of listing the Exchange reviews the listing documents of an applicant to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Companies Ordinance and the GEM Listing Rules. However, the Exchange does not assess the commercial viability of any applicant. The Exchange similarly reviews all public announcements made by an issuer after it has been listed.

History The club was founded in Kinning Park in 1848 by Archibald Campbell. It was formed by members of two previous clubs which played on Glasgow Green, to cater for the burgeoning residential developments south of the river Clyde. It is now the oldest surviving team sports club in Glasgow. On moving to Pollokshields, the club sold its previous grounds in Kinning Park in 1873 to a newly founded football club called Rangers. At that time, the club also fielded a football team, Clydesdale which came second to Queens Park in the first Scottish Cup final in 1874, after many associated with the club had been instrumental in the foundation of the Scottish Football Association. In the modern era, Clydesdale Cricket Club continues to be a major force in the amateur sporting worlds of cricket and both men's and women's hockey under the name of Clydesdale Western Hockey Club and has its own international-standard water- based synthetic-surfaced hockey pitch upgraded in 2011. Members and former members of the club were selected to play for Scotland in the 1999 and 2007 Cricket World Cups and in the Olympic Games hockey tournaments in Barcelona, Athens, Beijing and London. Home Ground In 2007, Clydesdale's Titwood cricket ground was approved for the staging of official One-Day Internationals for crowds of up to 5,000. It became the fourth Scottish ground to be granted ODI status, as it was seen as a hub of cricket in Scotland along with The Grange, Aberdeenshire's Mannofield and Ayr's Cambusdoon New Ground. The first of these, an 'offshore international' between India and Pakistan in July 2007 was a victim of the wet weather. The second game was played in August the same year, was between Scotland and India. In January 2014, Titwood hosted Scotland's last three Clydesdale Bank 40 home group games.

Background Of Irish-Italian ancestry. he was born to William and Kathleen McNulty Bresciahttps://www.legacy.com/obituaries/inquirer/obituary.aspx?pid=179731896. He grew up in the Andorra neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where his father was a firefighter and his mother was an accountant. Brescia was both a member of the Aryan Republican Army and a part-time student at La Salle University, at the time of his arrest. Extremism involvement While a student at La Salle University, Brescia attempted to create a white supremacist group on campus. In 1993, during his third-year at the school, he abruptly dropped out of school and told friends he was moving to Oklahoma for a job. He actually moved to Elohim City, a white separatist community in Eastern Oklahoma. While staying at Elohim City, Brescia was roommates with Andreas Strassmeir, a German national who was phoned by Timothy McVeigh two weeks prior to the bombing. Aryan Republican Army Michael William Brescia was recruited for the Aryan Republican Army (ARA) by Aryan Nations Pennsylvania state leader, Mark W. Thomas. The ARA committed 22 bank robberies across the Midwest between 1994 and 1996, seven of which Brescia was accused of being involved in. Brescia was arrested for bank robbery on January 30, 1997 and later pleaded guilty to bank robbery charges and was sentenced to 57 months in federal prison. Brescia was released from prison on March 22, 2001. \\"John Doe #2\\" Allegations Private lawsuits by Edye Smith and Glenn Wilburn worked on the assumption that Brescia was the \\"John Doe Number Two\\" seen by several witnesses with McVeigh in the days preceding and the day of the bombing. The Daily Telegraph also ran an interview with a witness named Connie Smith who said \\"I kept telling them that the man in the (John Doe II) sketch was that Mike guy, a nice-looking guy, dark-skinned. But the FBI made me feel guilty, then ignorant, as if I didn't know what I was saying. Then, later, I tried to call in with more information and they wouldn't even talk to me.\\" Strassmeir claimed that on the day of the bombing, Brescia was in Arkansas attending a rally protesting the execution of Richard Wayne Snell. Federal officials have stated that there is no link between the ARA robberies and the Oklahoma City bombing.

With its 'Eternal Flame', the Shrine is a war memorial dedicated to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzacs). The Shrine of Remembrance is a major Brisbane landmark of cultural, architectural and historic importance and is a key component of the Queensland Heritage listed square and annually hosts ceremonies for ANZAC Day and Armistice Day (now referred to as Remembrance Day). A service marking Singapore Day (The Fall of Singapore, 15 February 1942) is held annually on the closest Sunday to the 15th, in remembrance of the losses of the 8th Division during World War 2. History Anzac Square and the Shrine of Remembrance c1930 Anzac Memorial, Brisbane, ca. 1939 Funds were raised by public subscription for a memorial to fallen soldiers in World War I and in 1928 a competition was held for its design. The competition was won by Sydney architects Buchanan and Cowper who proposed a Greek Revival structure. The Shrine took two years to build and was dedicated on Armistice Day 11 November 1930 by Governor John Goodwin with a dedication plaque. Architecture Designed in the Greek Classic Revival style, the columns of the Shrine of Remembrance are built of Helidon sandstone,and the Eternal Flame is kept in a brass urn within the Shrine. The steps leading to the Shrine of Remembrance from ANZAC Square are made of Queensland granite. The 18 columns of the Shrine symbolise the year 1918, when hostilities ceased. Memorial There is a crypt in the lower section of the Shrine of Remembrance which contains the World War I and World War II Shrine of Memories, which contains memorial plaques to numerous Australian regiments who fought during these campaigns. There is also a World War I memorial sculpture on the Shrine of Memories external wall.

Previously, Ali was the lead vocalist for Sneaker Pimps, a trip-hop group, who are best known for their 1996 album Becoming X which featured Ali on vocals. Ali co-produced and co-wrote the album with internationally renowned producers, Rick Nowels and Marius de Vries. Singles released off the album include, \\"Kids\\", \\"Inferno High Love\\", and \\"Teardrop Hittin' The Ground\\". Overview Tigermouth was recorded primarily in Los Angeles at the home studios of hit-making producer Rick Nowels. Nowels' knack with radio-friendly hooks and the sunny climate of L.A. clearly informed Tigermouth, which is a bright, lush, and unabashedly pop-oriented record. Tigermouth stands in stark contrast to the moody, atmospheric sounds associated with Ali's Sneaker Pimps recordings. However, because of this new sound and her high-profile collaborators, some in the British press dismissed the album as a blatant grab for \\"mainstream\\" success. Ali herself responded to this criticism a year later on her website: ::Nothing could have been further from my mind... For the sake of ease and sales, it is easier for the media to \\"understand\\" what it is they're selling but rest assured, I make music with all my heart and soul without any commercial interest what so ever [sic] and I am glad that I made Tigermouth when and how and with whom I made it. The doubters may kiss my sorry ass. Tigermouth was not a commercial success upon its release, despite its radio-friendly disposition.

The only known species of Hynerpeton is H. bassetti, named after the describer's grandfather, city planner Edward Bassett. Hynerpeton is known for being the first Devonian four-limbed vertebrate discovered in the United States, as well as possibly being one of the first to have lost internal (fish-like) gills. This genus is known from few remains discovered at the Red Hill fossil site in Hyner, Pennsylvania. The most notable fossil is a large endochondral shoulder girdle consisting of the cleithrum, scapula, and coracoid (but not the interclavicle and clavicles), all connected into one shoulder bone. The inner surface of this shoulder bone possesses an array of depressions believed to have been attachment points for a unique set of powerful muscles around the chest. This may have given Hynerpeton improved mobility and weight-bearing abilities compared to other Devonian limbed vertebrates such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. The cleithrum (upper blade of the shoulder) is fused to the scapulocoracoid (lower plate of the shoulder, in front of the shoulder socket), unlike in most tetrapods, but the shoulder girdle is independent of the skull, unlike in most fish. Early four-limbed vertebrates are sometimes referred to as tetrapods (using a trait-based definition of the term), although animals like Hynerpeton, Ichthyostega, and Acanthostega are placed outside the crown group Tetrapoda by the vast majority of paleontologists. From a cladistic (relations-based) point of view, a more accurate term would be \\"stem-tetrapod\\" or \\"stegocephalian\\", indicating that they were part of the lineage of animals that would lead to true tetrapods such as modern amphibians (Lissamphibia), reptiles, mammals, and birds. Hynerpeton hails from the Red Hill fossil site, which, during the Late Devonian, was a warm floodplain inhabited by a diverse ecosystem of aquatic fish and terrestrial invertebrates. Hynerpeton was one of several genera of four-limbed vertebrates known from the site, although it was the first to be discovered. It has been theorized that animals like Hynerpeton were able to use their amphibious lifestyle to find shallow pools where they could spawn, isolated from predatory fish which inhabited the deeper rivers. History In 1993, paleontologists Edward \\"Ted\\" Daeschler and Neil Shubin found the first Hynerpeton fossil at the Red Hill fossil site near Hyner, Pennsylvania, USA. They were surveying the Devonian rocks of Pennsylvania in search of fossil evidence for the origin of limbed vertebrates. This initial find was a robust left endochondral shoulder girdle, belonging to an animal which had powerful appendages. This fossil, designated ANSP 20053, is now considered the holotype specimen of Hynerpeton, which Daeschler and his colleagues formally named in an article published by Science Magazine in 1994. At the time of its discovery, Hynerpeton was the oldest four-limbed vertebrate known from the United States, and its presence in a complex ecosystem such as that preserved at Red Hill helped to answer some of Daeschler and Shubin's questions on the origin and lifestyle of limbed vertebrates. The generic name Hynerpeton is in reference to Hyner and herpeton (\\"creeping animal\\"), a Greek word which is commonly used as a suffix for newly named ancient amphibians. The specific name, bassetti, is named in honor of Edward M. Bassett, an American city planner and Daeschler's grandfather. The most fossiliferous layer of the Red Hill site, the \\"Hynerpeton lens\\", was named after the genus. It is believed to have been deposited during the Middle to Upper Famennian stage, about 365 to 363 million years ago. Since 1993, more stegocephalian remains have been found in the Hynerpeton lens (also known as the Farwell paleosols). These include shoulder bones, jaw bones, skull fragments, gastralia (belly scutes), a femur, and a large and unusually-shaped humerus. In 2000, a pair of jaw bones were assigned to a second genus, Densignathus, and other studies have argued that several additional unnamed taxa were present at the site, including possibly the oldest known whatcheeriid. Some of this material has been assigned to Hynerpeton, but in many cases, these assignments were reverted. For example, paleontologist Jenny Clack referred several addition fossils to the genus in her 1997 review of Devonian trackways. These fossils, which had not been previously noted in the scientific literature, included a jugal (cheek bone), belly scutes, and a portion of the mandible (lower jaw). In 2000, Daeschler described the mandible (ANSP 20901) in more depth, and compared and contrasted it with the remains of Densignathus. A more comprehensive review of Red Hill \\"tetrapod\\" fossils was undertaken by Daeschler, Clack, and Shubin in 2009. They noted that most fossils were assigned to Hynerpeton based on their close proximity to the point where the original endochondral shoulder girdle was discovered. However, they argued that, since there were other unique animals (i.e. Densignathus, the owner of the unusual humerus, and whatcheerids) close to this point, proximity was not a sufficient reason to consider these referrals valid. Therefore, they did not consider the remains described by Clack (1997) and Daeschler (2000) to be guaranteed examples of Hynerpeton material. Nevertheless, they did retain a referred left cleithrum, ANSP 20054, within the genus due to its structure being practically identical to that of the holotype.  Description  Hynerpeton individuals were presumably similar to other early limbed vertebrates such as Ichthyostega or Acanthostega. Although a lack of sufficient fossil material makes it unwise to come to specific conclusions about the anatomy of Hynerpeton, the structure of the preserved endochondral shoulder girdle offers some information on its classification. The endochondral shoulder girdle is the portion of the shoulder girdle containing the scapula, coracoid, and cleithrum, but not the clavicles and interclavicle. As a whole, the endochondral shoulder girdle is massive and cleaver-shaped. The upward-pointing \\"shaft\\" is formed by the cleithrum, a blade-like bone of the shoulder girdle lost by most amniotes. The rear-pointing \\"blade\\" is formed by the scapulocoracoid, a plate-like bone which also possesses the glenoid fossa (shoulder socket) along its rear edge and in later tetrapods would separate into the scapula and coracoid. In lobe- finned fish ancestral to tetrapods, such as Eusthenopteron, the endochondral shoulder girdle was attached to the skull. In true tetrapods, the endochondral shoulder girdle is divided into two separate bones: the cleithrum and scapulocoracoid. Hynerpeton is intermediate between these two states, as the endochondral shoulder girdle is separated from the skull but not yet divided into two separate bones. In this way Hynerpeton is comparable to Devonian stem-tetrapods rather than true tetrapods, which did not appear in the fossil record until the Carboniferous. Based on the size of the bone, the Hynerpeton individual to which it belonged had an estimated length of 0.7 meters (2.3 feet).236x236pxThe cleithrum portion is smooth, unlike the rough-textured cleithrum of tetrapodomorph fish. In addition, the upper portion of the cleithrum is expanded and slightly tilted forwards, a derived character similar to Tulerpeton and true tetrapods. The scapulocoracoid region is large when seen from the side but very thin when seen from below. The glenoid fossa (shoulder socket) is positioned on the posterolateral (outer and rear) edge of the scapulocoracoid, a position significantly more lateral than other Devonian tetrapods (apart from Tulerpeton). Above the glenoid fossa is a raised area known as the supraglenoid buttress. Hynerpeton also has several autapomorphies, unique features which no other known stem-tetrapod possesses. The inner face of the scapulocoracoid has a large, deep depression known as a subscapular fossa. The upper rim of this depression is very roughly textured due to being covered with muscle scars. The rear edge of the subscapular fossa, on the other hand, is formed by a massive raised area, known as an infraglenoid buttress. A second depression known as the infraglenoid fossa, which is continuous with the glenoid fossa, wraps around the rear of the bone to bisect the infraglenoid buttress. These characteristics combined seem to support the idea that Hynerpeton had very powerful muscles attached to the scapulocoracoid portion of the endochondral shoulder girdle. The infraglenoid fossa is particularly well-developed in this genus, and may have been an origin point for retractor muscles. A similar groove on the front edge of the bone may have helped with elevating or protracting the limb. The rim of the subscapular fossa also evidently provided a site for muscle attachment. As these features are unknown in other stem- and crown-tetrapods, it is likely that Hynerpeton's musculature was used for some unique, experimental form of movement that did not survive the Devonian. The original describers suggested that strong muscles could have been equally viable for walking or swimming. Unusually, Hynerpeton seems to lack a postbranchial lamina. This blade of bone, preserved in many fish and some stem-tetrapods (Acanthostega, for example) extends lengthwise along the inner edge of the cleithrum. It typically forms the rear wall of the branchial chamber (gill cavity), and may have helped ensure that water flows in a single direction through the gills. Its absence in Hynerpeton may indicate that it lacked gills, and that the Hynerpeton lineage may have been among the first vertebrates to evolve this adaptation. However, this interpretation is not without controversy. Janis & Farmer (1999) noted that postbranchial laminae were absent in some eusthenopterid fish (which retained gill bones) and present in Whatcheeria (which had no evidence for gills despite well-preserved remains). Shoch & Witzmann (2011) note that it is not always clear when or how postbranchial laminae are preserved due to the divergent morphology of many stegocephalian cleithra. In addition, they point out that aquatic salamanders, which breathe with external gills, do not require nor possess postbranchial laminae. Daeschler et al. (1994) considered the loss of the postbranchial lamina to be a derived feature indicating that Hynerpeton was more \\"advanced\\" than Acanthostega. On the contrary, Schoch & Witzmann (2011) found evidence for a postbranchial lamina in true tetrapods such as Trematolestes and Plagiosuchus. Thus, Hynerpeton's loss of a postbranchial lamina (and possibly internal gills) likely evolved independently of true tetrapods.  Classification  The original 1994 description of Hynerpeton tentatively placed it within the order Ichthyostegalia of the superclass Tetrapoda. At the time, \\"Tetrapoda\\" referred to any four-limbed vertebrate and \\"Ichthyostegalia\\" referred to \\"primitive\\", Ichthyostega-like Devonian members of the category. However, the arrival and popularity of cladistics has altered both of these terms. The cladistic definition of \\"tetrapod\\" now popular among biologists and paleontologists refers to a clade (relations-based grouping) containing only descendants of the last common ancestor of living tetrapods. While Hynerpeton is a tetrapod in the sense that it is a four-limbed vertebrate, it is not a member of the clade Tetrapoda because its lineage went extinct long before the lineages of modern tetrapods evolved. Likewise, \\"Ichthyostegalia\\" has been abandoned in the age of cladistics due to being an evolutionary grade leading to true tetrapods, rather than a relations-based clade. The traditional, non- cladistic definition of Tetrapoda, which begins at the earliest limbed vertebrates, corresponds closely to a clade named Stegocephalia, which is defined as all animals more closely related to temnospondyls than to Pandericthys. Hynerpeton has not been included in many phylogenetic analyses, but those that have included it usually place it as a transitional form on a series of stem-tetrapods leading to Tetrapoda. The shape of the cleithrum and the loss of the postbranchial lamina allow it to be placed higher than Acanthostega (and usually Ichthyostega as well), but the retention of a single-piece endochondral shoulder girdle usually means that it is not placed higher than Tulerpeton. The following is a simplified cladogram based on Ruta, Jeffery, & Coates (2003):  Paleoecology  The modern day Murray River of Australia, a similar environment to the Catskill Formation during the Devonian Hynerpeton was found at the Red Hill site of Pennsylvania. This roadcut preserved fossils from the Duncannon member of the Catskill Formation, which was laid down in an ancient coastal floodplain. During the late Devonian, the floodplain was close to the equator, so the climate was warm and humid, with a dry and wet season. It formed along the coast of a shallow sea which bisected the continent Euramerica, and was dominated by several small, slow rivers flowing down from the Acadian mountains in the eastern part of the continent. These rivers were prone to changing their course dramatically, creating oxbow lakes and ponds adjacent to the main river channels. The most abundant plants were forests of ancient broadleaf trees (Archaeopteris) supplemented with marshes filled with fern-like plants (Rhacophyton). Wildfires were common during the dry season, as evidenced by the large amount of charred Rhacophyton material. Other plants include lycopsids such as Lepidodendropsis and Otzinachsonia, as well as difficult-to-place herbs and shrubs such as Barinophyton and Gillespiea. The animal life of Red Hill was also quite diverse. Early arachnids (Gigantocharinus), millipedes (Orsadesmus), and undescribed scorpions were among the few fully terrestrial members of the Red Hill fauna. The waterways were inhabited by a large variety of fish. Benthic placoderms such as the rare Phyllolepis, the common Groenlandaspis, and the abundant Turriaspis were a large part of the fish assemblage. The early ray- finned fish Limnomis was also abundant, likely forming large schools. Early sharks were present, including the minuscule Ageleodus and the spine-finned Ctenacanthus. Various lobe-finned fish populated the floodplain, as well as the large acanthodian Gyracanthus. The apex predator of the assemblage was Hyneria, a 3-meter (10 feet) long tetrapodomorph fish. Hynerpeton was not the only purported four-limbed vertebrate at the site. A somewhat larger genus, Densignathus, coexisted alongside it. In addition, an unusual humerus incompatible with the endochondral shoulder girdle of Hynerpeton may show that a third genus lived in the floodplain. Skull fragments similar to those of whatcheeriids such as Pederpes and Whatcheeria indicate that a potential fourth genus was also present. The depositional environment and fauna of the Red Hill site offered new hypotheses for the questions on why and how terrestriality evolved in stem-tetrapods. The Catskill floodplain never became dry enough for its waterways to completely dry up, but at certain times of the year shallow ponds became isolated from the main river channels. Terrestrial or semiaquatic animals could have used these ponds as refuge from the larger predatory fish which patrolled the deeper waterways. A modern equivalent would probably be the Murray River of Australia. In this subtropical modern environment experiencing wet and dry seasons, spawning golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) take refuge in oxbow lakes to escape larger, faster murray cod (Maccullochella peeli) in the main river channel. In a Devonian environment, vertebrates with terrestrial capabilities may have had the advantage when navigating between these different environments. The flexibility imparted by such a lifestyle could also have let them take advantage of a larger variety of food sources.

Completed in 1868, it stands at the southwestern corner of Monterey Square. The house was the scene of the 1981 shooting death of Danny Hansford by the home's owner Jim Williams, a story that is retold in the 1994 John Berendt book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The house is currently owned by Dorothy Williams Kingery, Williams' sister, and is open to the public for tours. Kingery's daughter and Williams' niece, Susan, manages the museum, which is based out of the carriage house at the rear of the property. History Designed by John S. Norris for General Hugh Mercer (great-grandfather of the songwriter Johnny Mercer), construction of the house began in 1860. Construction was interrupted by the American Civil War, and finally completed around 1868 by the new owner, John R. Wilder. Nobody of the Mercer name ever lived in the house. In 1969, 11-year-old Tommy Downs fell from the roof of the house and was killed after being impaled on the iron fence on the West Gordon Street (southern) side of the house. It is believed he was hunting pigeons. One of the two spiked prongs he landed on is still broken.\\"Tragedy Ends Pigeon Hunt\\" - Savannah Morning News, 1969 For a period in the twentieth century, the building was used as the Savannah Shriners Alee Temple.Savannah Morning News, May 2 1981 It then lay vacant for a decade until 1969, when Jim Williams, one of Savannah's earliest and most dedicated private restorationists, bought the house for $55,000John Berendt on Good Morning America, 1998 and fully restored it over two years. Williams died in 1990, and Dorothy Kingery put the house up for sale later that decade with a price tag of just under $9,000,000.

Doorway detail. The red- brick property is three stories, including a basement, where Williams' restoration workshop was. It consists of a front yard, the house, a courtyard and a carriage house. It takes up a city trust lot ‚Äî the only building in Savannah in private ownership to do so. An iron railing surrounds the northern, eastern and southern sides of the house, with a brick wall continuing either side between the courtyard and the carriage house. The main fa√ßade, facing east onto Monterey Square, has five French windows (two on the first floor, three on the second). Except for the window above the double front doors, each French window on the three open sides of the house has a balcony surrounded by an iron railing.

In total, there are 40 windows (including the basement level) and eight iron balconies. Another notable feature of the home's exterior are the support brackets all around the soffit in the eaves of the roof. In 1997, Dorothy Kingery established a trademark for the home's fa√ßade, and her layer dispatched letters to local artists demanding that they either stop using photographs of it for their own gain, or give her 10% of their proceeds. Interior=Layout and furnishings Many of Williams' antiques and furnishings were sold by Williams' sister at a Sotheby's auction on October 20, 2000. Where their locations in the house were known, they are mentioned in the relevant section below. ;First floor Looking at the front of the house, at the bottom right is the drawing room, with a fireplace on the side of the house flanking West Wayne Street to the north. A George I Chinoiserie Japanned cabinet dating from around 1720, on a later George I-style stand, was located in this room. On top of this were three Chinese sang-de-b≈ìuf glazed porcelain vases from the 19th century.\\"The Furnishings: Mercer House\\" - The Devoted Classicist, December 16, 2011 Also in the drawing room, Williams kept an \\"assortment of curiosities\\", including Faberg√© items such as its jeweled eggs. His first purchase, made in London in 1971, was a large silver-gilt and enamel-mounted leather box, or presentation casket, bearing the Imperial coat-of-arms and the gold-crowned cypher of Tsar Nicholas II. It is dated 1899 and is estimated at around $10,000. It was given by the Tsar to the Shah of Persia to commemorate the settlement of a long-standing border dispute. Williams put it on the jade-green coffee table in the drawing room, where it stayed for thirty years. He also owned a large silver-gilt and enamel-mounted leather desk folio, with the initial N 11 and the corners decorated with Imperial eagles. It was made for Tsar Nicholas II and was purchased by Williams at a Sotheby Parke Bernet sale in New York in 1979. The folio is estimated at $25,000. An American carved wooden eagle with outspread wings, which was perched on a bracket in the drawing room and used on the first tug boat to ply the Savannah harbor, is estimated at $4,000. More than one hundred pieces of Chinese blue and white porcelain from the Nanking cargo ‚Äì a wreck of treasures which sank in the South China Sea in 1752 ‚Äì is also included, with an estimate of $5,500‚Äì8,500. The Sotheby lot comprised soup plates, plates with scallop borders and plain rims, octagonal plates and a pair of large chargers with scalloped borders. They were displayed in a breakfront cabinet. Facing the rear of the house from the drawing room, there is the music room, in which, on the left-hand side, there was a William IV mahogany sideboard, Irish, circa 1835. Above this was one of two Brussels tapestries from the 18th century, depicting a couple (possibly Venus and Adonis) embracing, with Cupid holding a shield emblazoned with a heart. Each tapestry was estimated to be around $25,000 in value.\\"MERCER HOUSE, SAVANNAH. THE COLLECTION OF THE LATE JAMES A. WILLIAMS.

After Williams' death, his sister hung a painting of him in this room, with Williams holding his cat, Sheldon. Williams owned nine pastels on paper depicting members of the Southwell and Perceval families, attributed to artist Henrietta Johnston, with seven in their original black frames. Williams kept these in a shuttered upstairs dressing room to protect them from sunlight. Of the nine portraits, seven are inscribed Dublin, Ireland and are dated from 1704 to 1705.

It was signed Laurent Dey, a master of the Paris Clockmakers' Guild. In front of the clock was a white statuary marble bust of Edward VII, English, dated 1906, by Walter Merrett, on a late-19th-century green marble column. There is also a fireplace in this room, on its southern wall. The semi-circular staircases leading down to the basement and up to the second floor is halfway along the left side of the entrance hall, just before which was the grandfather clock that Hansford knocked over immediately prior to his death. On the right-hand wall of the entrance hall was another 18th-century Brussels tapestry, woven with silk, wool and metallic threads, depicting Diana and her nymphs bathing beside a fountain. In front of the tapestry was a Regency-period inlaid mahogany parcel-gilt side table from the early 19th century. Either side of the table was a pair of George III-style carved giltwood torch√®res from around 1900. Immediately inside the front door, to the left, was a George III mahogany linen press, albeit with some replacement parts. The hallway was designed to double as a summer living room.\\"'For Sale' Sign Goes Up in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" - New York Times, June 3, 1999 The dining room is at the left rear, also featuring a fireplace. Above the fireplace was a Louis XVI-style painted and parcel-gilt mirror, continental, late 19th century. A pair of paintings by Thomas Hudson, portraits of Mr. and Mrs. James Hilhouse of Cornwallis House, Clifton, Bristol, were hung in this room. Also in the dining room was a Regency gilt-metal mounted dining room pedestal, circa 1815, in the manner of Thomas Hope. The dining table was a Regency mahogany, made in the first quarter 19th century, and was in two parts. The eight chairs around it were a set of George II-style red-Japanned and parcel-gilted moderns. Also, a mahogany three-tier server, which Williams had found in poor condition in the countryside around the island of Grenada, where it is known as a \\"cupping table\\" ‚Äì referring to its use to hold cups and dishes beside the dining table. It is estimated at $4,000. Williams used the carriage house, which fronts onto Whitaker Street to the west, as a guest house for visitors. Between the house and the carriage house is a courtyard. ;Second floor Directly across the hallway from the top of the staircase, on the northern side of the house, is the ballroom. Against the wall to the right of the door to the ballroom was an eight-legged George III mahogany sofa, circa 1770. Either side of the sofa was a pair of carved polychrome and giltwood lamps in the Chinese taste. They were standing on a pair of painted wood and tole pedestals. Above the sofa was a portrait of the Reverend Rhodes by Thomas Hudson. The dome skylight above the top of the spiral staircase. Inside the ballroom was a painted and gilted modern center table with a marble top, in addition to the main attraction at the rear of the room: the pipe organ. Above the fireplace, on the northern wall, was one of a pair of rococo-style giltwood and composition pier mirrors, American, mid-19th century, nine feet high. The master bedroom is also on this floor, on the southern side of the house. A continental turned beechwood stool, late 17th century, with a crewelwork cover, was located in this room. One of the two guest rooms is dominated by a mahogany four-poster bed, hand- carved in Grenada in the 19th century with foliage designs. The posts were carved with spiral flutes and a nutmeg design. It is estimated at about $10,000. There were also several pieces of 19th-century furniture from Guatemala. A stained-glass dome skylight was installed above the top of the stairs. It contains vents to cool the house.

It is home to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro Spartans wrestling and volleyball teams.Fleming Gymnasium - UNCGSpartans.com. Accessed March 21, 2008. It also hosts the women's basketball team. It was formerly the full-time home of the men's basketball team as well, but beginning in the 2009‚Äì10 basketball season, they moved to larger Greensboro Coliseum for most of their games.. The men's basketball team plays a few games every season at Fleming Gymnasium when the Coliseum is being used for other large events. Prior to the 2006‚Äì2007 season, Fleming Gym underwent a facelift to improve seating amenities. The new seating includes chairback seating on the lower half with bleacher bench seating in the upper half. Also as part of the renovation, the team locker rooms and meeting areas for film breakdown and other activities were expanded. History The gymnasium, which has seating for more than 1,800 for basketball and 1,200 for volleyball and wrestling, was named for Fleming, a Greensboro civic leader and one of the most ardent supporters of UNCG athletics, on December 1, 1994. Spartan teams first occupied the gym during the 1989-90 academic year. The largest crowd to see an athletic contest in the gym was 2,302 for a men's basketball game against Charleston Southern on February 25, 1995. The Spartans won, 98‚Äì70. Fleming Gymnasium has played host to various conference championship tournaments, including Big South volleyball in 1994 and 1995, Big South women's basketball in 1994, Southern Conference (SoCon) women's basketball in 1998 and 1999, SoCon wrestling in 1999 and SoCon volleyball in 2001 and 2008. In 2005, it played host to the SoCon / ACC Wrestling Championships, also known as MatJam. Prior to the 1996‚Äì97 season, the National Basketball Association's Boston Celtics held their preseason training camp in the gym.

It was the band's commercial breakthrough. It was released on Setanta and certified Gold in the UK in July 1997. This was helped by the release of the album's first single \\"Something for the Weekend\\" which reached number 13 on the charts. Two other singles released from the album, \\"Becoming More Like Alfie\\" and \\"The Frog Princess\\", charted at 27 and 15 respectively. Composition Treble writer A.T. Bossenger wrote that Neil Hannon \\"started going for a more straightforward pop tone as the base for his songwriting\\" for Casanova, resulting in the album having a more Britpop flow to it. Its central theme is sex, around which all songs on the album centre, except \\"The Dogs and the Horses\\", which is the last song on the album and whose theme is death. The Dogs and the Horses\\" is very close to the musical style of Scott Walker's first four solo albums. \\"Through a Long & Sleepless Night\\", a track off Casanova, shares the same title as a track off Scott's first solo album. Two of the album's songs were originally composed by Hannon as potential theme tunes for the 1995 sitcom Father Ted. Hannon's first attempt was rejected, and he reworked it to become \\"A Woman of the World\\". His second attempt was accepted and used as the theme for the series; however, Hannon later reworked it, played on harpsichord (rather than the series' guitar), to become \\"Songs of Love\\". Recording Casanova had the longest recording period of any Divine Comedy album up to that point and consequently cost more. Setanta was able to indulge Neil Hannon's desire because of the success of Edwyn Collins' hit single \\"A Girl Like You.\\" Although more musicians were involved than on Liberation and Promenade, for most of the album, as with the previous two albums, Neil Hannon plays the majority of the parts himself, with co- producer/drummer Darren Allison directing proceedings. The album's last track \\"The Dogs and the Horses\\", which was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, features a large orchestral ensemble which includes future members of the live band, namely Joby Talbot, Stuart 'Pinkie' Bates, Grant Gordon, and Bryan Mills. Talbot was beginning to play an increasingly important role in the band; he arranged and orchestrated \\"The Dogs and the Horses,\\" and he co-arranged \\"Theme from Casanova\\" with Hannon. Legacy The album's sixth track, \\"Songs of Love\\", made its debut on the popular Channel 4 and RT√â sitcom Father Ted, officially remaining the show's theme song, as heard in its opening titles and end credits. The album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2014, NME included the album in its list of \\"30 Glorious Britpop Albums That Deserve a Reissue Pronto,\\" saying \\"Gawky Neil Hannon as smooth loverman was a conceit that actually worked and it produced two of Britpop‚Äôs least obvious classics in the hilarious Cold Comfort Farm-inspired tale of ‚ÄòSomething For The Weekend‚Äô and the movie fantasy of ‚ÄòBecoming More Like Alfie‚Äô.\\" Track listing All songs written and arranged by Neil Hannon, except Track 10 arranged by Hannon and Joby Talbot; Track 11 arranged and orchestrated by Talbot.

It grows 25‚Äì30 m tall and 1 m in trunk diameter at breast height, forming a pyramidal crown with spreading, horizontal branches. The bark is dark gray, rough, and furrowed in a vertical pattern. Branchlets are orange-red and pubescent when young, turning yellow-gray or yellow-brown in their second or third year. The leaves are 1.2‚Äì3 cm long by 2‚Äì4 mm broad, stiff, sharply pointed on young trees and rounded or rarely slightly notched on mature trees. They are shiny dark green above and pale green on the underside with 12-17 stomatal lines on each side of the midrib. The cones are cylindrical, 6‚Äì18 cm long, 3‚Äì5 cm wide before opening and up to 7.5 cm wide after opening. They stand erect on short pubescent stalks and mature in October to a purple-brown color. The cones open upon maturity to release the seeds, which are large and oblong, 1-1.3 cm long with a yellow-brown wedge-shaped wing 3 cm long. The tree is grown as an ornamental in warm climates, and the wood is used in construction and furniture, although the species is protected under Chinese forestry regulations.

The station was founded in 1990, and the first news broadcast was made on 1 April the same year. The station covers the eastern part of Jutland, which includes ten municipalities: Aarhus, Randers, Silkeborg, Horsens, Syddjurs, Norddjurs, Favrskov, Skanderborg, Odder and Sams√∏.  History  TV 2/√òstjylland originally started out in an old warehouse in the city of Randers, the second largest city in the station's broadcast area. This was a political decision, meant to force the station to produce news that did not entirely focus on the area's largest city, Aarhus. The headquarters of TV2 √òstjylland in Skejby. In 1999 TV 2/√òstjylland moved from Randers to a purpose- built TV-station in the northern part of Aarhus, Skejby. The new building was - contrary to the old warehouse in Randers - designed to house a modern TV- station. The new building was packed with new technology. Based on the Sony DNE-2000 news editing system, the new station was completely digital and thereby it was - at the time - the most technologically advanced TV station in Europe.  Broadcasting  The station's motto is \\"Near and necessary\\" (N√¶r og n√∏dvendig, in Danish), a motto the station tries to fulfill by spreading out reporting to even the smallest town in the area of coverage. TV 2/√òstjylland has the ambition to bring the best coverage and the coverage that is closest to the station's viewers. Therefore, TV 2/√òstjylland prioritises the experiences and problems of ordinary people in contrast to \\"expert sources\\" in the stations news coverage. A typical day's broadcast on TV 2/√òstjylland starts at 11 a.m. (11.00 o'clock) with a 30-minute program which features the stations most popular reporters such as Kurt Leth, Michael N√∏rgaard and Anne Louise Tran√¶s Didriksen. These programs are followed by an inter-regional program called Danmark Rundt. 12.10 a.m. the station broadcasts its most popular talkshow Go' Aften √òstjylland a program that embrasses every story rooted in the eastern part of Jutland in a warm atmosphere. This show nearly always includes three interesting guests, their pets, their tricks, their beliefs or simply just their story. At 4.05 p.m. (16.05 o'clock) TV 2/√òstjylland returns with a brief newsbulletin with the day's headlines. This bulletin is preceded by a TV 2-Denmark news update on national and international news. Another, slightly longer, news update is sent at 6.10 p.m. (18.10 o'clock). This broadcast is also preceded by 10 minutes of national and international news from TV 2-Denmark. At 7.30 p.m. (19.30 o'clock) TV 2/√òstjylland's main news broadcast of the day is aired. 30 minutes of local and regional news, features, and other programs. This program is extremely popular and usually around 2/3 of all TV-sets in the area are tuned in. From 8-9 p.m. TV 2/√òstjylland broadcast an hour on the new regional digital channel Kanal √òstjylland. It is here Go' Aften √òstjylland has premiere together with many of those longer features that are broadcast in the morning.

During his playing days, he had the nickname ‚ÄúThe Laser.‚Äù  Amateur career  Lansing attended Wichita State University, and in 1988 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Utilizing a never-before-used rule, Lansing was drafted late in the 6th round of the 1990 MLB Draft by the Miami Miracle, an independent minor league team. Lansing played two seasons with the Miracle before making the major league with the Expos in 1993.  Professional career  Lansing made his major league debut in the lineup early on in 1993 as a second baseman. In one of his first games, Lansing had five hits in a win over the Rockies. In 1999, Lansing accompanied Denver Police on a fatal SWAT raid that killed Ismail Mena. The team was at the wrong address.Rise of the Warrior Cop by Radley Balko, PublicAffairs, 2013, Kindle Location 5200 In 2001, while playing with Boston, Lansing made a fine catch for the 2nd to last out helping to preserve Hideo Nomo's no-hitter vs. the Baltimore Orioles. Lansing had his best season in 1996, finishing with a .285 batting average and 183 hits in 159 games. Lansing also had 40 doubles that season, placing 6th. In 1997 Lansing had another strong season, with career bests in home runs, 20, and RBIs, 70. On May 7, 1997, in a game against the San Francisco Giants, Lansing became the first National League second baseman since Bobby Lowe in 1894 to homer twice in the same inning. Lansing also became the third Expo to do so. After the '97 season, Lansing was traded to the Colorado Rockies for a couple of minor leaguers. Lansing had a couple of disappointing seasons with the Rockies as injuries took their toll. Then, on June 18, 2000, in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Lansing hit for the cycle faster than any player in MLB history, completing it by the fourth inning in a 19-2 win. A little more than a month later, Lansing, along with a couple of pitchers, were traded by the Rockies to the Boston Red Sox. He played a couple of mediocre seasons with the Red Sox before being released into free agency after the 2001 season. Lansing was signed as a free agent by the Cleveland Indians, but played in the minors and suffered a back injury before retiring after the 2002 season. Mike Lansing Field, the stadium that is the home field of the Casper Horseheads of the Pioneer League, is named for Lansing.

It is designed to remove loose particles of dust, dirt and lint that would contaminate a surface that is to be painted, coated, laminated, photo-etched, or otherwise finished. Design=Tack The tack component is typically a kind of resinous material, often a petroleum derivative. The resin system may be solvent-based, water-based, or (more commonly in North America) a hot-melt. Different tack treatment materials, formulations and systems present different advantages or disadvantages. Concerns with different tack treatments may be seen in the tendencies of some to dry out or to leave residues from free oils or evaporating solvents, or with liabilities due to content of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), or in health risk from volatile organic components (VOCs), and in materials that can chemically interfere with paints, etc. Common misnomers for tack treatments are varnish, lacquer, beeswax or other references that do not describe the actual materials in modern commercial tack cloths. Adjuncts may be incorporated into the tack treatments, such as anti-static additives, fire retardants, dyes or other performance-enhancing materials. Overall tack performance is actually a combination of independent qualities such as adhesion, cohesion, wet tack (quick-stick) and other well-defined adhesive related properties. Each of these can be manipulated to optimize performance in different types of applications and conditions. Tack cloth must be changed frequently when working with softer woods as the dust from the sanded wood tends to clog the cloth fibers quickly, reducing performance. Cloth The cloth component is most commonly a cotton gauze textile, but the grade and quality can vary greatly. Typical gauze specifications are in weaves of 29 (commodity) to 44 or more (commercial/professional) yarns per square inch, with the cloth weights, wiping properties and overall cost varying accordingly. Gauze may be bleached and scoured (as for medical gauze) or unbleached quality that contains more contaminants. A standard size of the cotton gauze varieties is 18 in. √ó 36 in. in North America (other standards are found in other countries, such as 50 cm √ó 80 cm). Other textiles used in tack cloths are made from continuous filament (non-fibrous) synthetic yarns to eliminate linting or from various non-woven fabrics that can reduce cost. The textile type, style, grade, quality and size are the greatest factors in tack cloth cost, and these variables can differ greatly among tack cloth brands and product designs.  Innovations  In recent decades researchers have developed lint-free tack cloths, made from continuous filament (non-fibrous) synthetic yarns and finished edges. Similar to electronics cleanroom wipers, this design is commonly required for paint process in automotive assembly plants. Another innovation has been modification of common tack cloths that are normally electrically resistive to perform at antistatic levels, defined by independent standards organizations (like ASTM, IEEE, MIL-SPEC, etc.). More recent developments have been made in tack treatments that are water-soluble, allowing them to be washed from hands, tools or a surface to reduce the incidence of tack transfer from accumulated resins or to wash the tack from the cloths. They can be recycled like utility wipes. Water-soluble tack also improves antistatic performance, and offers potential for improved compatibility with water-based paints. A new type of tack cloth has been developed at the Y-12 National Security Complex, a nuclear weapons plant. Its purpose was to clean up microscopic beryllium particles that posed a health hazard. The inventor, Ron Simandl, also found he could use the cloths to dry- buff the alloy wheels on his car. The stubborn brake and road dirt came right off and left the wheels clean and bright.

The Joint Liaison Group was specifically tasked with: (1) the action to be taken by the two Governments to enable the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to maintain its economic relations as a separate customs territory, and in particular to ensure the maintenance of Hong Kong's participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization), the Multi Fibre Arrangement and other international arrangements; (2) the action to be taken by the two Governments to ensure the continued application of international rights and obligations of Hong Kong; (3) the procedures to be adopted for the smooth transition in 1997; (4) the action to assist the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and conclude agreements on these matters with states, regions and relevant international organisations. The JLG ceased operations on December 31 1999, two years after the transfer of sovereignty.http://www.scmp.com/topics/sino-british-joint-liaison-group The full official proceedings of the meetings of the group were closed and remain secret, and it was last decided on application in 2015 that the British version of the details would remain closed under the 40-year Rule, and will only be opened and released no earlier than 1 January 2026 under the \\"International Relations - prejudice\\" exemption as provided for under Section 21(1)(a)(c)(d) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, according to the National Archives of the United Kingdom (TNA (UK)), formerly known as the Public Records Office (PRO (UK)).https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16246883 References Category:British Hong Kong Category:20th century in China Category:Politics of Hong Kong Category:20th century in the United Kingdom Category:China‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations Category:Intergovernmental organizations established by treaty Category:Organizations established in 1985 Category:Organizations disestablished in 2000 ","title":"Sino-British Joint Liaison Group"},{"id":"3584190","text":"Shanks may refer to:  People with the surname  * Alison Shanks (born 1982), New Zealand professional racing cyclist * Bill Shankly, British football manager nicknamed \\"Shanks\\" * Bill Shanks, American sports broadcaster and writer * Bruce Shanks (1908‚Äì1980), American editorial cartoonist * Charles G.

It is one of the most famous examples of the use of resident spies, who operate in a foreign country without the cover of their embassy. Its members included Harry Houghton, Ethel Gee, Gordon Lonsdale (real name: Konon Molody), and the Americans Morris and Lona Cohen (known as Peter and Helen Kroger). Tracking the spy ring Lonsdale visited the Krogers regularly at their home in Ruislip In 1959, the CIA received letters from a mole, codenamed Sniper (who later was revealed to be Michael Goleniewski). Sniper said information was reaching the Soviets from the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment and HMS Osprey at Portland, England, where the Royal Navy tested equipment for undersea warfare. The CIA passed the letters to MI5, the British domestic counter-intelligence and security service. Suspicion fell on Harry Houghton, a former sailor who was a civil service clerk at the base, as his spending seemed to have an unusual pattern. He had just bought his fourth car and a house, and was also a heavy drinker who would buy rounds at the local pubs. Houghton's expenses were far beyond his meagre salary. MI5 put Houghton under surveillance. They also watched his mistress, Ethel Gee. She was a filing clerk who handled documents to which Houghton did not have access. They often went to London, where they would meet a man identified as Gordon Lonsdale, a Canadian businessman. During these meetings, Lonsdale and Houghton exchanged packages. Lonsdale purportedly dealt in jukeboxes and bubble gum machines. He often travelled abroad and was known as a ladies' man. MI5 promptly put him under surveillance. They learned that Lonsdale often went to 45 Cranley Drive, Ruislip in Middlesex to visit an antiquarian bookseller and his wife at home, Peter Kroger and Helen. The Krogers were also placed under close but discreet watch. The arrests On Saturday 7 January 1961, Houghton, Gee, and Lonsdale were meeting in London when they were arrested by Special Branch Detective Superintendent George Gordon Smith. (MI5 officers are not authorised to make arrests.) Gee's shopping bag contained film and photographs of classified material, including details of , Britain's first nuclear submarine, and the stalling speed specifications of the Borg Warner torque converter. Smith and two colleagues then went to Ruislip to see the Krogers. Claiming to be investigating local burglaries they gained entry to the house. Once inside, they identified themselves as Special Branch officers and said that the Krogers had to accompany them to Scotland Yard for questioning. Before leaving, Mrs Kroger asked to be allowed to stoke up the boiler. Before she could, Smith insisted on checking her handbag. It was found to contain microdots, the photographic reduction of documents to make them small enough to be smuggled more easily. Smith, a veteran spy catcher, had guessed her intention to destroy these microdots. The microdots found at the Krogers' home were letters sent between Lonsdale and his wife, who lived in Poland with their children. These included things like money matters and how the children were doing at school. Kroger had used the print in his antique books to hold the microdots and smuggle them between Britain and the Soviet Union. They would have included the secrets passed on by Houghton and Gee. The Kroger's house contained spying equipment, including code pads for coding messages, a long-range radio transmitter-receiver for communicating with Moscow and photographic material, as well as large sums of money. It took several days to unearth all the equipment. Other items, including fake passports, were not found until after the police had left. The MI5 intelligence officer Peter Wright stated that the Krogers' radio transmitter was not located until after nine days of searching.Peter Wright, Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, Toronto, Stoddart, 1985 (paperback), p. 171 Over the years, during subsequent renovations, several other radio transmitters were unearthed. Large amounts of money were also found in the homes of Houghton, Gee, and Lonsdale. Trial Two days after their arrest, all five were charged with espionage at Bow Street Magistrates Court. Gee and the Krogers protested their innocence; Houghton tried to turn Queen's evidence but was refused; Lonsdale maintained complete silence. The trial began on Monday 13 March 1961. In evidence, Gee claimed that as far as she knew, Lonsdale was Alex Johnson, an American naval commander who wanted to know how the British were handling information passed on by the United States. She had had no idea that the information was actually going to the Soviets. She had gone along out of love for Houghton, her first lover after a lifetime of spinsterhood. Houghton claimed that he had been the subject of threats by mystery men and beatings by thugs if he failed to pass on information. The men had also made threats concerning Gee and Houghton's ex-wife. He too claimed to have known Lonsdale only as Alex Johnson and tried desperately to minimise Gee's involvement. Neither Lonsdale nor the Krogers gave evidence, but in statements read out in court, Lonsdale took responsibility. He claimed that the Krogers were innocent and that he had often looked after their house while they were away and had used it to hide his spying equipment without their knowledge. Peter and Helen Kroger backed up the claim by saying that Peter was simply an antiquarian bookseller and Helen a housewife. However, they did not explain why fake Canadian passports with their photographs were in the house, apparently intended for a possible getaway. The jury returned verdicts of guilty for all of the accused. Superintendent Smith said that through their fingerprints, the Krogers had been identified as Morris and Lona Cohen, renowned spies who had worked with Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, Rudolf Abel, and David Greenglass in the United States. Smith also revealed Cohen's past life in the military and scholastic service. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29985359 Lonsdale remained mysterious in spite of extensive inquiries made by MI5 and the FBI. While he was in prison, the authorities managed to ascertain that he was Konon Molody, a KGB agent who was duly exchanged for Greville Wynne in a 1964 spy-swap. Sentences and later lives Houghton and Gee were sentenced to 15 years in prison. They were released in 1970 and married the following year. The Krogers (Cohens) were sentenced to 20 years. In 1969, they were exchanged for the British citizen Gerald Brooke, who had been arrested by the Soviets. As part of the process, the Soviets confirmed that they had been spies. https://spartacus-educational.com/SSkrogerP.htm Professor Christopher Andrew has suggested that the ring numbered more than the five who were arrested, possibly the ring included staff at the Russian and Polish embassies who would have been immune from prosecution anyway.. He suggests that the ring may have involved more senior members of staff at the Admiralty Research Establishment who remained undetected. Houghton was a low-grade clerk, and Gee a secretary who would not have necessarily known the significance of the documents that they encountered. In popular culture The events were used in the movie Ring of Spies (aka Ring of Treason, 1964), directed by Robert Tronson and starring William Sylvester as Gordon Lonsdale and Bernard Lee as Henry Houghton (Lee was M in the early James Bond films). Hugh Whitemore's stage play Pack of Lies concerns the relationship between the Krogers and their neighbours, the parents of the broadcaster Gay Search, whose house was used as a base for British Special Branch investigating the Krogers in the months leading up to their arrest. It has received several major productions in London and New York. In 1987, the play was made into a CBS television drama starring Teri Garr, Alan Bates, and Ellen Burstyn, though the name \\"Kroger\\" was changed to \\"Schaefer\\".IMDB entry. It was also broadcast as BBC Radio 4's Saturday Play on 9 September 2006, starring Ed Begley, Jr. as Peter Kroger, Teri Garr again as Helen, Alfred Molina as their neighbour and Michael York as the man from MI5. It was directed by Martin Jarvis. The Spy Game by Georgina Harding uses the Krogers and their cover as a harmless and typical suburban couple as background to her novel, published in 2009. Information released by National Archives In September 2019 the National Archives declassified papers relating to the case, including MI5 files and letters that Gee and Houghton sent to one another in prison. The documents revealed that in 1955, Houghton's wife approached the Admiralty with concerns about her husband on three occasions in 1955. In 1956, the admiralty informed the security services that she believed that \\"her husband was divulging secret information to people who ought not to get it\\". The Admiralty added that \\"it is considered not impossible that the whole of these allegations may be nothing more than outpourings of a jealous and disgruntled wife\\". The files also record that Houghton beat his wife and tried to kill her by pushing her off a cliff, only to be disturbed by a passerby. She alleged that when they returned home after the incident, her husband threw gin in her face and told her, \\"I've got to get rid of you, you know too much\\". In March 1961, Martin Furnival Jones, later director-general of MI5 wrote, \\"It is clear that we ought to have carried out some investigation in 1956\\". The documents revealed that after the ring was exposed, the Admiralty and MI5 were concerned that she would speak to the press.

Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, based on their tour in China as reporters for The New York Times. (Hardcover); (paperback) Google Book They were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for their reporting.  Summary  In this book, Kristof and WuDunn, husband and wife, wrote about their experiences in China from 1988 to 1993. The couple spent five years in China as journalists reporting for The New York Times. For a time, WuDunn worked and traveled around China as a tourist after her press credentials had been revoked by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on a technicality. The authors present alternating chapters with Kristof writing the odd-numbered chapters and WuDunn writing the even-numbered chapters. Only the last chapter of the book was written by both authors. Kristoff and WuDunn cover various topics such as the lives of Chinese peasants, corruption, sex, religion, the one-child policy, the June 4th Incident (Democracy Movement), and the future of the Communist party. The two journalists are assisted by local Chinese friends, anonymous sources, and Communist officials in researching stories for The New York Times. In the Author's Note it is stated that the names of some Chinese sources have been changed for their protection, while the names of corrupt Communist officials have been left uncensored. The authors' view of China is that of a country torn between Deng Xiaoping's successful economic strategy and frustrated political reform and human rights. Reception Matei P.

Personal history  Aged 32 during the events of Pattern Recognition, Cayce lives in New York City. Though named by her parents after Edgar Cayce, she pronounces her given name \\"Case\\". She is a freelance marketing consultant, a coolhunter with an unusual intuitive sensitivity for branding, manifested primarily in her physical aversion to particular logos and corporate mascots. A notable exception to her ability to immediately discern semiotic content in imagery is the succession of images of the September 11 attacks in 2001, for her \\"an experience outside culture\\". The attacks had added significance to Cayce's backstory in that they encompassed the disappearance of her father, Win, which in turn impelled her mother, Cynthia, to exploring electronic voice phenomena as her own means of divining patterns in the background static. Cayce is left feeling \\"ungrieved\\" for her father until she reviews footage and records of that day tracking his movements until he vanishes.  Apparel  As a consequence of her sensitivity, Cayce dresses in plain clothing she has either bought or rendered unadorned with brand markings of any kind (one possible exception is her \\"Luggage Label\\" hip bag, bought from Parco in Tokyo). These are referred to as \\"Cayce Pollard Units\\" or C.P.U.s, a term initially used by her friend Damien, and subsequently by Cayce, although never aloud. They are typically Fruit of the Loom shrunken cotton T-shirts worn with black oversized Levi's 501s, skirts, tights, boots, and a Buzz Rickson MA-1 bomber jacket.  In pursuit of the footage  Cayce's role in Pattern Recognition begins with her arrival in London in August 2002, commissioned by marketing firm Blue Ant to judge the effectiveness of a proposed corporate logo for a footwear company. In accordance with her terms, dictated in advance, she rejects the logo but does not explain her judgement. After dinner with some Blue Ant employees, the company founder Hubertus Bigend propositions Cayce with a new mission: to uncover those responsible for distributing a succession of mysterious, anonymous, artistic film clips (\\"the footage\\") on the internet. Cayce had been following the footage and is a participant in Fetish : Footage : Forum, a cult-like online discussion forum hosting a collection of obsessives theorizing on the clips' meaning, setting, sequence and origin. Although wary of corrupting the artistic process and mystery of the clips, she reluctantly accepts. An acquaintance from the forum passes Cayce a lead of someone who claims to have discovered an encrypted watermark on one clip. After concocting a fake persona to seduce the Tokyo native who claims to know the watermark code, Cayce travels to Tokyo to meet him and retrieve the code. Thwarting an attempt by two unknown men to steal the code, Cayce escapes and returns to London. There, she learns from Blue Ant that she has been investigated by a shady group of Russians who had wanted her to refuse the job of tracking the footage. Through a chance encounter, Cayce meets a pair of London natives dealing in antiquated technological artifacts who put her in contact with a collector, the retired cryptographer and mathematician Hobbs Baranov. Cayce strikes a deal with Baranov: she buys an artifact he dearly covets but cannot afford (a factory prototype of the earliest Curta calculator) and in return he deciphers the email address to which the watermark code was sent. Using this email address, Cayce makes contact with Stella Volkova, and through their correspondence learns that the legendary maker of the footage is Stella's sister Nora. Cayce flies to Moscow to meet Stella in person and to witness Nora crafting the footage. It emerges that Nora had been catastrophically injured in a Claymore mine explosion that killed their parents years earlier and because of brain damage can only express herself through film. After returning to her hotel, Cayce is drugged and abducted, and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility outside the city. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses, but is rescued and later brought to the prison where the film is processed. There, Bigend, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal that they have been spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the footage to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father‚Äôs disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence; \\"she was weeping for her century, although whether the one past or the one present she doesn't know\\".  Literary analysis and significance  Cayce is located by literary critic Pramod Nayar in a line of \\"information-living\\" Gibson characters beginning with Bobby Newmark (Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive, the Sprawl trilogy) and continuing with Colin Laney (Idoru, All Tomorrow's Parties, the Bridge trilogy). Ulrike K. Heiser concurs, citing the reassurance Cayce gets from logging into Fetish : Footage : Forum after a flight as indicative that she is the latest in a tradition of technomadic Gibsonian protagonists \\"with rootedness in the virtual rather than the real\\" who \\"find their true homes in the non-spatial reaches of digital networks\\". In her quest to uncover the meaning of the footage, Cayce is haunted with epistemological doubt; her compulsion to seek answers to whether there is an order to the footage or a creator behind it gives rise to the central thematic element of the novel ‚Äì the centrality of pattern recognition and corresponding ubiquitous risk of apophenia in the contemporary world. Post-structural literary theorist Richard Skeates compared Cayce with Oedipa Maas, the protagonist of Thomas Pynchon‚Äôs novel The Crying of Lot 49, as detectives interpreting clues but with neither the character nor the reader knowing if there actually is a pattern to be found and, if there is one, whether it is real or conspiracy. Critic Jeremy Pugh proffers that Gibson employs \\"the precocious Pollard to personify and humanize the uncertain anxiety, optimistic hope, and downright fear many feel when looking to the future.\\" For cultural historian Jeffrey Melnick, Cayce's obsession with the footage is born out of her exceptional experience of the 9/11 attacks as something which \\"fundamentally challenged the commercialization of all human experience and emotion\\". Like the imagery of 9/11, the footage is free of the hegemonic cultural context of the capitalist superstructure and thereby seems to escape commodification, to be beyond \\"the reified society of brands in which objects assume the status of social relations in contrast to people's objectified ones ... to which Cayce has such an involuntary affinity\\". Pollard is ever-aware of her complicity as a conduit between the authentic culture of the street and the reconstructed cultural units manifested as products of branded corporations. Philosopher Nikolas Kompridis casts her desire in terms of a novelty which defies contextualization, positing that Cayce is \\"yearning for the unconsumably and unsubsumably new\\", citing a line preceding a description of the footage: \\"It is as if she participates in the very birth of cinema, that Lumi√®re moment, the steam locomotive about to emerge from the screen, sending the audience fleeing, out into the Parisian night.\\" For Kompridis, the footage is at the crux of Cayce's existential angst as an agent of unearthing novelty and facilitating commodification who also holds out hope for the possibility of a future immune to commodification and instrumentalisation.

Cantonments are established under and governed by the Cantonments Act 1924. In recent times, the demographic character of most independence era cantonments has changed, as they are no longer primarily \\"garrison\\" areas, and include significant civilian populations and private businesses. Based on the strength of civil population, the cantonments have been divided into three classes. Class I Cantonments, in which the civil population is one hundred thousand or more; Class II Cantonments, in which the civil population is fifty thousands or more but less than one hundred thousand; and Class III Cantonments, in which the civil population is less than fifty thousand. There are a total of 56 Cantonments in Pakistan. As of 2013, the greatest amount 27 is in Punjab, then 10 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 10 in Sindh, 7 in Balochistan and 2 in Gilgit Baltistan.  Administration of cantonments  Sadar Bazaar in Multan Cantonment Prior to 1864, cantonments used to be administered by military authorities under various government orders.

The act also regulated the funds granted by Government for the purpose of bettering the various facilities. In 1880, another act was passed that empowered the cantonment authority to impose taxes, as well as granting legal status to the cantonment committee. The act gave power to impose fines and penalties for non-payment of taxes, and for encroachments. After World War I, political changes took place in South Asia that affected the administration of the cantonments. The changes also became part of day-to- day life in cantonments, as it had to do with its working. The Cantonments Act of 1924 was a landmark in the history of cantonments, as it brought in its wake some sweeping changes. The act introduced the representative local government system, under which elected representative of the civil population became members of the Cantonment Boards. The Boards were created as autonomous statutory local bodies for providing civil services. The powers and functions of the Cantonment Board are synonymous to Municipal Committees in the cities. The members constituting the Board are both officially nominated as well as elected through a direct vote on the basis of adult franchise. Officials nominated as members hold the majority. The station commander, a senior military officer, is the ex officio President of the Board. This is to protect the interest of troops, and ensure their welfare and discipline. The administration of cantonments and management of the military lands inside and outside the cantonments is centrally controlled and supervised by the Military Lands and Cantonments Department, which is an attached department of the Ministry of Defense headed by a Director General. The Director General is assisted by an Additional Director and a Deputy Director at the headquarters. In addition, five Regional Deputy Directors based at Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Karachi and Quetta supervise the respective cantonment boards in their jurisdiction. The Cantonment Executive Officer is the principal executive at the local level. The Board normally decides and lays down policies, while the executive officer executes these policies. He is the chief exponent of the Board‚Äôs policies. He acts as an adviser and is a permanent officer specially trained in local administration. He is empowered to carry out the policies and decisions and ensure adherence to the various laws and bylaws. The presence of elected members in the board has a salutary effect, and is most beneficial for the civilian residents because the elected members are the medium to convey their views. The elected members play an important role in the development of public services in their respective areas. Development works are usually carried out in consultation with the respective elected members. Major development schemes are finalized in the budget meeting held before the beginning of the fiscal year, with the consent of all the members. The Cantonment Board is an organ of the local government and is free to formulate policies for local development within the frame work of the Cantonments Act and other government regulations. The board ordinarily holds one meeting each month. All matters are decided by majority, but in case of a tie, the matter is decided through the President's vote. All meetings of the board are open meetings, unless specifically directed otherwise by the President of the Board. All Cantonments Boards work under the administrative control of the Director General of Military Lands and Cantonments. The Director General may issue various directives on important policy matters, and the Cantonment Boards comply with the same. All accounts are audited annually by the Audit Department of the Government of Pakistan.  Local Government & Elections  Local government elections have not been held in the cantonments since year 2000 in Pakistan. The absence of local government across the various cantonments board in Pakistan was challenged in the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2009. The Government of Pakistan has responded by stating that changes to the Cantonment Boards Act of 1924 are pending at the National Assembly of Pakistan, as of 2014. Many of the identified anomalies in the existing Act of 1924 are in direct conflict with the Constitution of Pakistan.http://www.dawn.com/news/1091958/govt-opposes-polls-in-cantonments- under-existing-law The Government of Pakistan has responded by saying that: \\"The presence of a number of laws (the Cantonment Act 1924 , the Cantonment Local Government Election Ordinance 2002 and the Cantonment Ordinance 2002) made it difficult to hold free and fair elections in the areas as required by the Constitution.\\" The Provincial governments are bound by law to announce a date for local elections in consultation with the Election Commission of Pakistan once the legal challenges have been resolved. Local government elections were held recently in 2015.

In this modest film, directed and produced by Don Hartman, Mitchum moved into a different genre, briefly departing from his typical roles in film noir, Western films and war films. It was based on the story Christmas Gift by John D. Weaver, also the film's working title. Set during the Christmas season, the film was not well received on its initial release. However, Turner Classic Movies airing the film over Christmas has led to it becoming a minor holiday classic. A made-for-television remake Holiday Affair was produced in 1996. Plot Steve Mason (Robert Mitchum), a veteran and drifter, is employed as a clerk during the Christmas season at Crowley's, a New York department store. He suspects customer Connie Ennis (Janet Leigh) of being a comparative shopper for a rival store when she buys an expensive toy train set without asking a single question about it. That night, her son Timmy (Gordon Gebert) becomes excited when he sneaks a peek at what he thinks is his present, only to be disappointed when his mother sets him straight. When Connie returns the train the next day, Steve tells her of his suspicions and that he should report her to the store detective, which would lead to her firing. After she explains that she is a war widow with a son to support, Steve refunds her money, a gesture that costs him his job. Steve becomes acquainted with Connie, her son, and her longtime steady suitor, lawyer Carl Davis (Wendell Corey). On Christmas morning, Timmy discovers the train set outside the apartment door and assumes that his mother got it for him after all. When Connie realizes who it must have come from, she finds the almost- broke Steve in Central Park, gives him a tie (originally intended for Carl), and offers to reimburse him for the expensive present. He refuses her money, saying that he wants to encourage Timmy's optimism. Connie then reveals she is marrying Carl on New Year's Day; Steve lets her know he thinks her decision is a mistake. Annoyed, Connie goes home. Later on, Steve is arrested on suspicion of theft of a pair of stolen sterling silver salt and pepper shakers, which a park bum (Frank Mills) had given to him as a gift (after Steve gave him his old tie). Carl does his best to secure his client's freedom, but only succeeds in annoying the police lieutenant (Harry Morgan). Connie explains about Steve and the bum, to the discomfort of Carl and the amusement of the lieutenant, and Steve is released, because her story corroborates in every detail the story Steve had already told the lieutenant. Timmy then invites Steve to have Christmas dinner with them. The meal is an uneasy affair, with Connie's former in-laws (Esther Dale and Griff Barnett) watching the two rivals for her affections. At the end, Steve stands up and announces that he is in love with Connie and that she should marry him. She tells him to leave. The next day, Timmy takes his train set back to Crowley's to get the money back for Steve because Timmy thinks Steve is somewhat destitute, and could use the money. One of the cars has gotten broken in the holiday rush-crush, and his request is refused. He eventually ends up tearfully telling his story to the store owner, Mr. Crowley (Henry O'Neill). Mr Crowley takes the boy home, where Carl is on the phone to the police; reporting him missing. Timmy tells them what he did. Connie and Carl drive to Steve's hotel to give him the money. When Connie asks Carl to see Steve by himself, the lawyer realizes he has no chance and gives up. Connie then sees Steve, but when he insists that she stop grieving for her dead husband, she leaves. Later, as she prepares to go alone to a New Year's Eve party, Timmy expresses his concern that she is going alone, and that when he gets married and moves away she will be all alone. She finally stops denying to herself that she has loved Steve for a while. Steve has sent her a farewell telegram letting her know he is leaving that night for California, so she takes Timmy, boards the train Steve is taking, and embraces him.

The successful lighthearted strip struck a balance between comedy and drama. It was adapted to a 400-page Little Big Book and was reprinted in several comic book series throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Publication history Distributed by the McNaught Syndicate, cartoonist Lank Leonard's Mickey Finn debuted as a daily strip on Monday, April 6, 1936. The Sunday strip, which eventually focused on the supporting character of Uncle Phil, began on May 17 of that same year. Leonard was assisted by Tony DiPreta (from 1945‚Äì50) and by Mart Bailey from 1950 in New York. In 1952, Bailey moved to Miami to help Leonard with the strip until July 1959. Morris Weiss, Leonard's assistant from 1936 to 1943 and again from 1960 on, took over following Leonard's illness in 1968, though under Leonard's byline. Weiss' first credited strip was November 30, 1970. Weiss continued through the final Sunday strip on December 21, 1975 and the daily strip's finale on July 31, 1976. Other 1940s assistants were Ray McGill, John Vita, Allie Vita and Larry Tullapano. Early in his career, DiPreta did the strip's lettering. The Sunday page included a topper strip called Nippie -- He's Often Wrong, which ran from May 17, 1936 to July 28, 1946. This strip featured a foolhardy young man who often ignored other people's advice. Comics historian Allan Holtz wrote, \\"This topper strip should win some sort of award as the most repetitive and unentertaining topper ever to be associated with a mainstream Sunday strip.\\" For several years, the Mickey Finn topper also included a one-panel factoid under several titles: Know Your Navy (Nov 1943 - Aug 26, 1945), Know Your Merchant Marine (Sept 9 - Dec 9, 1945) and Know Your Sports (Dec 16, 1945 - April 21, 1946). Characters and story The storyline centered on likable Irish-American police officer Michael Aloysius \\"Mickey\\" Finn in suburban Port Chester, New York. Leonard based the character on Port Chester policeman Mickey Brennan after watching Brennan helping children cross the street. Like other police strips, it surfaced in the wake of the blockbuster Dick Tracy, but Mickey Finn was more analogous to the popular 1970s television program Barney Miller, focusing on humor and character rather than on action or mystery. Historian Tom Whissen found it \\"one of the few comic strips ever to portray a city policeman in a manner that avoided either sentimentality or sensationalism.\\" When the strip began, Mickey worked at the Schultz Soap Company, but after he caught a runaway steer, he was given a chance to take a police physical exam. Mickey lived with his widowed mother and her cigar-smoking, derby-wearing, blarney-spieling brother, Uncle Phil, a member of the Goat Hill Lodge of the Ancient Order of American Grenadiers. Uncle Phil became a breakout character. Comics historian Don Markstein noted: With Mickey promoted to become a detective, Uncle Phil became an alderman and sheriff. Supporting characters included Mickey's girlfriend Kitty Kelly, Sergeant Halligan, baseball player Red Fedder and bartender Clancy. Leonard occasionally brought into the strip real-life sports figures, such as Joe Louis and Lou Gehrig. Reprints Mickey Finn (1940), a Little Big Book from Saalfield Publishing. Lank Leonard's Mickey Finn strip was reprinted in color in the first American comic book series, Eastern Color Printing's Famous Funnies, starting with issue #28 (Nov. 1936). Famous Funnies also reprinted Leonard's Nippie: He's Often Wrong topper strip. Mickey Finn appeared in most issues through #35 (June 1937). The strip then appeared in every issue of Quality Comics' Feature Funnies (retitled Feature Comics with issue #21) from #1-113 (Oct. 1937 - Aug. 1947). Concurrently for a few months, Mickey Finn also ran in Columbia Comic Corporation's Big Shot #74‚Äì104 (Feb. 1947 - Aug. 1949). The strip was also reprinted in its own comic book series, Eastern Color's Mickey Finn #1-4 (no cover dates; 1942-1943), which continued as Columbia's Mickey Finn #5-15 (no cover dates; 1944‚Äì1949). The strip's final comic-book reprints were Headline Comics' Mickey Finn vol. 3, #1‚Äì2) in 1952.\\"Mickey Finn\\" (feature) at the Grand Comics DatabaseMickey Finn (Eastern Color, 1942 Series) at the Grand Comics DatabaseMickey Finn (Columbia, 1943 Series) at the Grand Comics DatabaseMickey Finn Headline Comics, Inc, 1952 Series at the Grand Comics Database Additionally, an adaptation of the comic strip was published as a Little Big Book, Mickey Finn (1940).

Golden Years Publications reprinted the Mickey Finn strips from Big Shot #82 (Oct. 1947) in All-Amazing Comics #16 (Dec. 2001).

Following the intense activity in the 2005 season, forecasts had initially predicted that the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season would be only slightly less active. However, activity was slowed by a rapidly forming El Ni√±o event in 2006, the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic, and the steady presence of a robust secondary high-pressure area to the Azores high centered on Bermuda. The season officially began on June 1, 2006, and lasted until November 30, 2006, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The first storm in the calendar year was Tropical Storm Zeta, which arose in December 2005 and persisted until early January 2006, only the second event on record that a storm spanned two calendar years in the Atlantic. The first in-season storm to form was Tropical Storm Alberto on June 10; the last, Hurricane Isaac became a tropical storm on September 28, and dissipated on October 2. Altogether, 10 named tropical storms developed in the Atlantic during the 2006 season, of which five became hurricanes with two intensifying further into major hurricanes. It was the first season since the 2001 season in which no hurricanes made landfall in the United States, and the first since the 1994 season that no tropical cyclones formed during October; This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation.

A former member of the Avengers and a member of the Rangers, she exists in Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. Firebird is a notable Latina superhero.Multicultural Comics: From Zap to Blue Beetle, p.4A User's Guide to Postcolonial and Latino Borderland Fiction p.107-109Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture, Volume 1, p.182 Publication history In the story \\"You Get What You Need!\\" published in Incredible Hulk vol.1 #265 (November 1981), writer Bill Mantlo and penciller Sal Buscema created the superhero team the Rangers. The team consists of western characters Bonita Juarez / Firebird, Victoria Starvin / Shooting Star, Drew Daniels / Texas Twister, Hamilton Slade / Phantom Rider then called Night Rider, and William Talltrees, the contemporary Red Wolf. The two women of the team had not previously appeared in comics. Not long after her first appearance, Firebird appeared several times in the West Coast Avengers title. She has appeared in several Avengers- related storylines since then. Fictional character biography=Origins Bonita Juarez was born in Taos, New Mexico. She was a devout Roman Catholic, who, while walking in the deserts of Albuquerque, New Mexico, came into contact with a radioactive meteorite fragment. The radiation altered her DNA, and gave her the power to generate flames and heat, and even fly. Believing her gifts came from God, she assumed the mythical bird's name, and donned a costume. As Firebird, she received a distress call from the Avengers, and mistakenly battled the Hulk. She joined with other Southwestern heroes (forming a team called the Rangers) and fought the Corruptor, rescuing Rick Jones in the process, who had actually sent the signal. West Coast Avengers Firebird was alone when she fought against the man called Master Pandemonium. Exhausted from her battle, she fell to the ground near the new Avengers Compound on the West Coast, where she was found by the Thing. She enlisted the aid of the Avengers in battling against Master Pandemonium.West Coast Avengers #4-5 She assisted the Avengers during the following adventures, and desperately wanted to be invited to join, something to which chairman Hawkeye remained oblivious, since he was trying to recruit the Thing. Firebird accompanied the Avengers to the dimension of the Cat People.West Coast Avengers #6 She battled her former teammate in the Rangers, the possessed Shooting Star, alongside the Avengers.West Coast Avengers #8 She also battled Master Pandemonium again.West Coast Avengers #9 When Mockingbird eventually found out Firebird's wish, she tried to coax her husband into inviting her, but he was consistently holding out for the Thing (who did eventually decide to become a member, but backed out before making it official). Frustrated, Firebird left on a spiritual journey. Hawkeye would later change his mind and the Avengers sought out Firebird, but could not find her. La Espirita Eventually, she reappeared as La Espirita and arrived in the nick of time to stop Hank Pym's suicide attempt. With the help of Espirita, Hank re-invented himself as the adventurer Doctor Pym, and he was able to move on from his past troubles.West Coast Avengers #17-21 With Henry Pym and Moon Knight, she rescued the Avengers who were trapped in the past.West Coast Avengers #23 She aided the Avengers in battle with Dominus, and battled Sunstroke.West Coast Avengers #24 The two also shared a brief romance, but Bonita left the team again after she helped them out on a few short adventures, to stand by Hank. One of those adventures involved the death of both the East and West Coast Avengers. It was then that she found out that she was seemingly immortal, when all of the Avengers died thanks to a poison by the Elder of the Universe Collector, except her, something that the Collector found fascinating.West Coast Avengers Annual #2 Firebird again Later on Bonita was captured by a group of aliens from the planet Rus, who revealed that the meteorite that gave her amazing powers was allegedly waste material from a discarded alien experiment of a pupil named Yoof.Avengers Spotlight #24 Nonetheless Firebird (she had returned to that name after learning this information) herself believes that her powers are a gift from God. She was called in on various Avengers meetings since then, signifying that she had somewhere accepted their membership offer. At first, Bonita was not considered as an Avenger until she attended an all-membership meeting of the Avengers.Avengers #305 After that she was called in on various Avengers events. She assisted Hellcat, Monica Rambeau, Moondragon, and Black Widow in subduing the Awesome Android,Avengers Spotlight #27 and encountered a small platoon of Atlanteans in Mexico getting help from a few Avengers.Avengers West Coast Annual #5 Firebird largely acts as a reserve member, preferring to spend her time as a social worker. Avengers return After the return of the main Avengers from the pocket universe created by Franklin Richards most of them were trapped in a curse created by Morgan Le Fay where she served in a guard called Queen's Vengeance under the name FiremaidenAvengers vol. 3 #1-3 Her immunity to radiation later made her indispensable when a mysterious energy field engulfed a small Russian country and turned everyone into zombies during the first blows of the Kang War. Firebird was one of the few individuals who could travel into the energy field without harm. Fellow Avenger Thor also surmised that Firebird may be immortal.Avengers (vol.3) #44 When Captain America is briefly transformed into an energy zombie, Thor, briefly believing him dead, begins to fear that he has become too close to his mortal comrades despite his knowledge that he would outlive them when forced to face such vivid evidence of his allies' mortality, and contemplates leaving the Avengers after the war was over. Firebird helped him to see that the bonds between him and the Avengers were so valuable precisely because they wouldn't last forever, and he shouldn't neglect them just because he would outlive them. In recognition of her advice, Thor toasted her when he arranged for Asgardian cooks to prepare a feast for the Avengers to celebrate Kang's defeat, commenting that she had taught a god a lesson by treating him as the fool he was.Avengers (vol.3) #55 Beyond! Firebird reappears in the limited series Beyond! along with other Marvel characters. She is depicted as having changed to a somewhat more revealing costume that bares part of her midriff. She is also shown to have a romantic attraction to Henry Pym which manifests when she kisses him after he has an argument with the Wasp. Civil War After a vicious battle between Captain America's Secret Avengers and Iron Man's Pro-Registration forces during the Civil War, in which Bill Foster was killed by a clone of The Mighty Thor, Firebird, along with twenty other superheroes, joined the Secret Avengers in opposing the Superhuman Registration Act. Captain America's dialogue implies that the new members, including Firebird,Civil War #4 are registered heroes who have nonetheless turned against Iron Man's forces because of the Bill Foster debacle. Weeks after the conclusion to the Civil War, Firebird is seen as one of the members of the revived Rangers, as part of the 50 States Initiative Program.Civil War #7 Bonita has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book Avengers: The Initiative #1.Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map In Avengers: The Initiative #2 she is seen attacking HYDRA along with the Rangers.  Secret Invasion  During the Secret Invasion storyline, Firebird was with the Rangers when they, Delroy Garrett / 3-D Man, and Eric O'Grady / Ant-Man were fighting a Skrull that was posing as Lobo, Red Wolf's wolf. The Rangers come into conflict with Kaine, alias Scarlet Spider in Houston, then they joined forces with him to battle a monster made of pure energy. Powers and abilities Bonita Juarez gained superhuman powers due to bombardment by radiation from a meteorite containing energy waste from an alien's scientific equipment. As Firebird, she has the power of pyrokinesis, which enables her to mentally excite the atoms in an object until it spontaneously combusts. By using her powers to ignite the air around her, she can surround herself with an aura of flames that often takes the shape of a bird, and if she focuses her flames downwards in a tight stream, she can propel herself through the air like a rocket. She can channel her powers through her hands to seemingly project searing thermal blasts from her body (actually from her mind), capable of melting steel. She can fly by riding wind currents stirred up by the nimbus of fire with which she surrounds herself while flying. Although she can propel herself at superhuman speeds, she cannot breathe at those speeds without skin protection and an oxygen supply. Fatigue impairs her performance after approximately one hour of peak expenditure of power. She has also displayed a limited power of precognition, allowing her to have glimpses of the future. Firebird also seems to be immune to most forms of radiation and poison (and even demonic possession) as well as the physical effects of her mental powers, and has displayed the ability to survive in the vacuum of space. Firebird may be immortal, but the precise details of this are unclear beyond the fact that she has twice survived apparently fatal attacks that only Thor - himself an immortal - could withstand. Other versions=MC2 In the MC2 universe, Firebird was killed in the final mission of the original Avengers. Marvel Zombies In the Marvel Zombies universe, Firebird is one of the heroes changed into a zombie.

In November 2005 he was abducted from his home and murdered in a robbery that some commentators believed was also a homophobic hate crime. Harvey, an openly gay man, had worked for Jamaica AIDS Support for Life (JASL), since 1997 becoming the group's coordinator for Kingston. In this position, he focused on distributing information and services surrounding HIV/AIDS to the most marginalised sectors of Jamaican society, among them prisoners, sex workers, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. In 2005, he was selected as the Latin America and Caribbean Council of AIDS Service Organizations' project coordinator for Jamaica. In November 2005, three men carrying guns broke into his home, removing any valuables. They asked if he was gay, and when he refused to respond they kidnapped him, later shooting him dead and dumping the body elsewhere. The police subsequently arrested four individuals and charged them with murder in the furtherance of a robbery. The accused remained in police custody for almost ten years before the case came to court. At that point, the police dropped their murder charges against two of the accused. The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them to life in prison with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole. Background=Harvey's biography In 1997, Harvey became involved with Jamaica AIDS Support for Life (JASL), an organisation that was a partner of Christian Aid. He became the group's Kingston co-ordinator, and in this position primarily worked to ensure that the marginalised groups within the country - including prisoners, sex workers, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people - had access to information about the HIV virus. He was selected as Jamaica's representative at the Latin America and Caribbean Council of AIDS Service Organizations. He was also a registered delegate to the conference of the People's National Party. In the week preceding his death, Harvey led JASL's annual candle-lit vigil in memory of those who had died as a result of AIDS. Anti-LGBT sentiment in Jamaica In 2006, Time magazine asked whether Jamaica was \\"the most homophobic place on Earth\\", and answered that it \\"may be the worst offender\\". The country's laws criminalising same-sex activity between males were introduced in 1864, during the British colonial administration. According to the Sexual Offences Act of 2009, any man convicted under these laws must register as a sex offender. These laws have been cited as contributing to wider homophobic attitudes among the Jamaican populace, including the view that gay people are criminals regardless of whether or not they have committed any crime. Anti-LGBT perspectives have been furthered by the island's conservative Christian churches. Many reggae and dancehall songs, among them Buju Banton's \\"Boom Bye Bye\\", call for the killing of gays. Writing for the International Business Times in the summer of 2013, the journalist Palash Gosh noted that while Jamaica was \\"awash in crime and violence, gays and lesbians are particularly prominent targets of wanton brutality.\\" In the summer of 2013, Human Rights Watch carried out five weeks of fieldwork among Jamaica's LGBT community, reporting that over half of those interviewed had experienced violence as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity, sometimes on more than one occasion. Murder On the night of Wednesday 30 November 2005, three armed men broke into Harvey's home, confronting him and his two roommates and demanding money. The intruders said \\"We hear that you are gay\\" and while the two room mates denied this, Harvey - who was openly gay - remained silent. The two room mates were bound and gagged while Harvey was forced to carry valuables to the criminal's car. At gunpoint, they forced him into the car and abducted him. Two hours later, Harvey's corpse was found at Pinewood Terrace, a rural area far from his home; his body had gunshot wounds in the head and back. Harvey's clothes, suitcases, jewellery, cellphones, and watches were recovered by police. Reporter Gary Younge expressed the view that the killing \\"appears to have been a homophobic attack\\", while an editorial in The New York Times noted that \\"the Harvey killing has the earmarks of a hate crime\\". Arrest and trial Following investigations, in 2005 police arrested four individuals - Dwayne Owen, Andre West, Ryan Wilson, and Chevaughn Gibson - charging them all with committing murder in the furtherance of a robbery. The accused were from an area known as Vietnam in Grant's Pen. Defence lawyers repeatedly complained that the prosecution had been late in handing over relevant documents to them. The case was brought before the Home Circuit Court on April 24, 2014, however it could not proceed because important documents had not been served on the defence. The witnesses for the case, who included ten police officers and two civilians, were bound over. Senior Puisne Judge Gloria Smith stated that no further adjournments of the case would be permitted, ordering the Director of Public Prosecutions to make full disclosure to the defence, and insisting that the trial must start on May 19. In her words, \\"This case has been going on for far too long and has reached the point where something must happen.\\" However, on that date the trial was postponed again due to the unavailability of a courtroom, being rescheduled for June 1. At that date it was again postponed, this time due to a shortage of available jurors, with the new date being set for July 7. In early July 2014, the prosecution announced that they were dropping all charges against Wilson, who was declared free to go after over eight years in prison. They had determined that at the time of the murder he had been in custody at the Constant Spring Police Station. The prosecution also stated that it was dropping the murder charges against Gibson, who would instead be charged with misprision of felony. After a three-week trial, in late July a twelve-person jury unanimously found both Owen and West guilty of murder. The state prosecutors, Kathy Pryce and Karen Seymour Johnson, requested that Owen and West face the death penalty. However, in November Justice Lloyd Hibbert sentenced them to life in prison, stipulating that they must serve a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole. He stated that in sentencing the pair he took into account the fact that they had already spent a decade in custody. In December, both Owen and West launched appeals against their conviction. Independently of the Harvey case, West was also charged with being involved in the murder of Jamie Lue, a financial analyst at Alliance Capital Limited, who had been abducted, robbed and killed in December 2005. Reaction In December 2005, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) issued a statement expressing the view that \\"Harvey's death is a profound shock and loss not only to the AIDS movement in Jamaica and the Caribbean, but to the whole world\\", furthermore calling on the Jamaican government to ensure that Harvey's killers be found and convicted. Rebecca Schleifer, a researcher with Human Rights Watch's HIV/AIDS and Human Rights Program, stated that Harvey was \\"a person of extraordinary bravery and integrity, who worked tirelessly to ensure that some of Jamaica's most marginalized people had the tools and information to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS\\". According to Peter Tatchell of the British LGBT rights organisation OutRage!, \\"It is thanks to the efforts of Steve and his colleagues that many Jamaican men and women - both gay and straight - have not contracted HIV. They have helped save hundreds of lives.\\" The Guyanese Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination issued a press release condemning Harvey's killing and calling for the perpetrators to be convicted.

Synopsis Lawyer Kaisa Heller, just promoted, has no apparent emotional attachments, preferring nameless encounters with men. She is surprised to receive a call from Helen, her dying mother, with a final request to bring Kaisa's estranged father Tomas to see her at the hospital. The film is a bit of a road movie with encounters along the way, some confrontational, such as boozing louts who harass her father or angry stewardesses issuing ultimatums, while some are romantic, such as truck driver Clive whom Kaisa attempts to use, but instead finds herself attached to. What started as an unavoidable chore, perhaps the last she will have never been able to dodge, becomes a new starting point in her life.

Its powers and structure are set out in the provisions of the 1973 Constitution, in which 29 districts come under its authority and jurisdiction. The government includes the cabinet, selected from members the Sindh Assembly, and the non-political civil staff within each department. The province is governed by a unicameral legislature with the head of government known as the Chief Minister.

He joined the ranks of the Muslim army at age 19. After Muhammad's passing, he was ordered to collect the Quran into a single volume from various written and oral sources. He was a noted expert on the Quran and spent much time reciting it. Life When Zayd was 6 years old his father died in the Battle of Bu'ath. Zayd was 11 years old when he asked permission to participate in the Battle of Badr. Since he was younger than 15 years old, Muhammad did not allow him to do so and sent him back. He then decided to try to win favour with Muhammad by learning the Quran. He was later appointed to write letters to non-Muslims and to collect and keep a record of the Qur'anic verses. Zayd was among those chosen by Muhammad to write down the verses of the Quran. He used to spend most of his time reciting the Quran and continued to learn the Quranic verses as they were recited by Muhammad. Zayd later volunteered to fight when he was 19 years old. This time he was accepted in the ranks of the Muslim army. Zayd's time to fight had come nine years after the establishment of the Muslim community in Medina. Zayd had the role of writing down the Quranic verses that Muslims believe were sent to Muhammad from Allah through the Angel Jibrail. After Muhammad's death, Zayd, who by this time had become an expert in the Quran, was assigned the role of authenticating and collecting the oral and textual Quranic revelation into a single bounded volume. This initiative was high on the Caliph Abu Bakr's agenda, especially after the Ridda wars, and the Battle of Yamamah in particular, in which a large number of Quran memorizers perished. Umar convinced Abu Bakr that the Quran should be collected in one manuscript. During Abu Bakr's reign as caliph, he was given the task of collecting the Quranic verses from all over the Muslim communities. Zayd finally accepted the task and, according to him, started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men. When Zayd had completed his task, he left the prepared sheets with Abu Bakr. Before he died, Abu Bakr left the sheets with Umar who in turn left it with his daughter Hafsah. Hafsah, Umm Salamah and Aishah were wives of Muhammad who memorized the Quran. Zayd ibn Thabit thus became one of the foremost authorities on the Quran. Umar ibn al-Khattab once addressed the Muslims and said: \\"O people, whoever wants to ask about the Quran, let him go to Zayd ibn Thabit.\\" Muhammad's era: 610-632 Zayd had the role of writing down the Quranic verses that were sent to Muhammad from Allah through the Angel Jibra'il. Abu Bakr's era: 632-634 After Muhammad's death, Zayd who became a Quran expert, was assigned the role of authenticating and collecting the oral and textual Quranic revelation into a single bounded volume. This initiative was high on the Caliph Abu Bakr's agenda, especially after the Riddah Wars (wars of apostasy), and the Battle of Yamamah in particular, in which a large number of Quran memorizers (around 450) perished. Umar convinced Abu Bakr that the Quran should be collected in one manuscript. During Abu Bakr's reign as caliph, he was given the task of collecting the Quranic verses from all over Arabia. Zayd finally accepted the task and, according to him, \\"started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart)\\". When Zayd had completed his task, he left the prepared suhuf (sheets) with Abu Bakr. Before he died, Abu Bakr left the suhuf with Umar who in turn left it with his daughter Hafsah. Hafsah, Umm Salamah, and Aishah were wives of Muhammad who memorized the Qur'an. Umar's era: 634-644 Zayd ibn Thabit thus became one of the foremost authorities on the Quran. Umar ibn al-Khattab once addressed the Muslims and said: \\"O people, whoever wants to ask about the Quran, let him go to Zayd ibn Thabit.\\" Uthman's era: 644-656 During the time of Uthman, by which time Islam had spread far and wide, differences in reading the Quran in different dialects of Arabic language became obvious. A group of companions, headed by Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, who was then stationed in Iraq, came to Uthman and urged him to \\"save the Muslim ummah before they differ about the Quran\\". Uthman obtained the manuscript of the Quran from Hafsah and again summoned the leading authority, Zayd ibn Thabit, and some other companions to make copies of it.[Sahih Bukhari, #4987] Zayd was put in charge of the task. The style of Arabic dialect used was that of the Quraish tribe. Hence this style was emphasized over all others. Zaid and other Companions prepared five copies. One of these was sent to every Muslim province with the order that all other Quranic materials, whether fragmentary or complete copies, be burnt. When standard copies were made and were widely available to the Muslim community everywhere, then all other material was burnt voluntarily by Muslim communities themselves. This was important in order to eliminate variations or differences in the dialect from the standard text of the Quran. The Caliph Uthman kept a copy for himself and returned the original manuscript to Hafsah. Death Said Ibn Al-Musayyib stated: \\"I attended the funeral of Zaid bin Thabit. After he had been buried, ibn Abbas said, 'O you people! Whoever wishes to know how knowledge leaves us should know that it is like this that knowledge leaves. I swear by Allah that a great deal of knowledge has just left us today.\\" See also *Zayd (name) *Thabit (name) *Sunni view of the Sahaba *Muadh bin Jabal ReferencesExternal links *View Hadith collected by Bukhari from Zayd Ibn Thabit Category:610 births Category:660 deaths Category:7th-century Arabic writers Category:Ansar (Islam) ","title":"Zayd ibn Thabit"},{"id":"3584330","text":"Akhtar Colony () is a neighborhood in Karachi west district of Karachi, Pakistan.

After its successful tests, the Hatf-I entered in the service with Pakistan Army in 1990. It is deployed as an artillery rocket and has been replaced by the improved Hatf-IA and Hatf-IB, which have a maximum range of 100 km. Development and design In 1980s, the development on Hatf program began when the chief of army staff General Mirza Beg held a meeting with the Space Research Commission in an attempt to counter the Indian development of the Prithvi. The program was developed with the assistance from the KRL whose team hastily combined various available technologies to produce the first surface- to-surface missiles. The scientists at the Space Research Commission designed the Hatf-I as a highly mobile missile for tactical use. The design is said to have been derived from the second-stage of the French Eridan missile system.CSIS Missile Threat Its major use is as an unguided general bombardment weapon, to be fired across a battlefield or at a general target area. If properly aimed, it can hit within several hundred meters of the target area. The missile is low cost and easy to produce and maintain in large numbers. The Hatf I missile development program dates back to the 1980s. The Hatf-I was officially revealed by Pakistani officials in 1989 and it is believed to have entered service in 1992. The Hatf I has a range of approximately and can carry a 500 kg conventional or non-conventional warhead. As it is unguided, it should be considered a long-range artillery shell, with the location of the impact depending upon the proper direction, angle of launch and the ability of the missile to fly straight. The Hatf-I is deployed with high explosive or cluster munitions, although it can theoretically carry a tactical nuclear weapon. The missile has a diameter of 0.56 m and is 6 m in length. It uses a single-stage solid propellant rocket motor. The Hatf IA and Hatf IB are upgraded versions with improved range and accuracy. The Hatf IA increased maximum range to 100 km by using an improved rocket motor and lighter materials in the missile's construction. The dimensions and the payload capacity remain the same. Hatf-IA is believed to have entered service in 1995. The Hatf IB represents the final evolution of the Hatf I missile system. It includes an inertial guidance system that considerably improves the accuracy of the missile and is otherwise identical to the Hatf IA, retaining the maximum range of 100 km and payload of 500 kg. The inertial guidance system allows the missile to be used as an artillery rocket against enemy military encampments or storage depots etc. The missile system is designed to be used like an artillery system, with 5‚Äì6 missiles fired simultaneously at the target area. Being a ballistic missile the Hatf-IB would reach its target much quicker than an ordinary artillery shell giving the target little warning to take evasive action. Hatf-IB was first flight tested in February 2000. All current Hatf-I missiles have been upgraded to Hatf-IB standard as of 2001. The system is operational with Pakistan's armed forces.Federation of American Scientists (FAS) Variants * Hatf I ‚Äî Maximum range: Payload: , unguided. * Hatf IA ‚Äî Maximum range: Payload: , unguided. * Hatf IB ‚Äî Maximum range: Payload: * Hatf IV ‚Äî Maximum range: Payload: with inertial navigation system.

He grew up in Westchester County, New York and moved to Charlottesville, Virginia to attend the University of Virginia.Parsons, Laura (September 25, 2003). \\"Peter Griesar: Life in his own superfast lane\\", The Hook. Retrieved May 27, 2012. He met Dave Matthews, later joining his band. After leaving the band in 1993, he continued playing, releasing several solo albums. Dave Matthews Band While living in Charlottesville, he got a job at a bar called Miller's. Starting out as a waiter he became friends with a bartender, Dave Matthews. Griesar was recruited to join the band The Basics, by bassist Houston Ross. LeRoi Moore and Tim Reynolds were also in the group. As a result, he began recording his own music with Matthews. When Matthews quit bartending, they started playing shows at another bar called Eastern Standard. In August 1990, Miller's hosted practice sessions for Matthews, Moore, Carter Beauford, and Stefan Lessard, while they were closed for late summer cleaning. Before long, he was practising with them. By 1991, the band (entertaining using the name Dumela) became the Dave Matthews Band, and added violinist Boyd Tinsley, playing at fraternity houses and other bars. During the fall of 1992, as attendance was skyrocketing, the band began planning to cut an album. Departure from Dave Matthews Band Due to the almost constant touring with Dave Matthews Band for three years and, owing to his mother's failing health, Griesar left the band after the band's March 23, 1993 show, preferring to play at smaller venues and theatres, as opposed to arenas that the band began to play. Two years later, in 1995, he returned to music, working with artist Lauren Hoffman. In 1996, he joined The Ninth, which included Lessard. The band did not take off, so Griesar decided to record his own album for his relatives. Supertanker In 1998, he assembled Supertanker, and released a solo album, Disposable Love Songs. Two years later, he left the original Supertanker, and released an EP, From the Supertanker Dude with the Zero Obsession. In August 2000, he assembled the second incarnation of Supertanker, which toured briefly.

History  Cyril Lucaris (or Lucar), the Patriarch of Alexandria and later of Constantinople, used this Greek term to express the idea for which the Latin term is transsubstantiatio (transubstantiation), which likewise literally means a change of substantia (substance, inner reality), using, in the 1629 Latin text of his The Eastern Confession of the Orthodox Faith, the term transsubstantiatio, and, in the Greek translation published in 1633, the term '. To counter the teaching of Lucaris, who denied transsubstantiatio/, Metropolitan Petro Mohyla of Kiev (also called Peter Mogila) drew up in Latin an Orthodox Confession, defending transubstantiation. Translated into Greek, using \\"\\" for the Latin term \\"transubstantiation\\", this Confession was approved by all the Greek-speaking Patriarchs (those of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem) in 1643, and again by the Synod of Jerusalem (1672) (also referred to as the Council of Bethlehem). The declaration of the 1672 Orthodox Synod of Jerusalem is quoted by J.M. Neale (History of Eastern Church, Parker, Oxford and London, 1858) as follows: \\"When we use the word metousiosis, we by no means think it explains the mode by which the bread and wine are converted into the Body and Blood of Christ, for this is altogether incomprehensible ... but we mean that the bread and wine are changed into the Body and Blood of the Lord, not figuratively or symbolically, nor by any extraordinary grace attached to them ... but ... the bread becomes verily and indeed and essentially the very true Body of the Lord, and the wine the very Blood of the Lord.\\" The Catechism of the [Roman] Catholic Church similarly states that the change is real while averring that the means of change remain a mystery: \\"The signs of bread and wine become, in a way surpassing understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333  Theology and dogmatic status  Since the Eastern Orthodox Church accepts as dogma only the solemn teaching of seven Ecumenical Councils, this approval, though part of what the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica called \\"the most vital statement of faith made in the Greek Church during the past thousand years\\", was not equivalent to a dogmatic definition. However, the Protestant scholar Philip Schaff wrote in his Creeds of Christendom: \\"This Synod is the most important in the modern history of the Eastern Church, and may be compared to the Council of Trent. Both fixed the doctrinal status of the Churches they represent, and both condemned the evangelical doctrines of Protestantism ... the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation () is taught as strongly as words can make it.\\" The term metousiosis is, of course, not found in the text of the Eastern Orthodox Church's Divine Liturgy, just as the term transubstantiation is not found in the text of the Latin Eucharistic liturgy. The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity states: \\"The Greek term metousiosis, which is comparable to the Latin transsubstantiatio, does appear in Orthodox liturgical and theological texts ‚Äì though not as often as other vocabulary (e.g., metastoicheiosis, a \\"change of elements\\").John Anthony McGuckin (editor), The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity (John Wiley and Sons 2010), p. 232 A. Osipov states that the Orthodox use of the Greek word ŒºŒµœÑŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒÆ (metabole), meaning \\"change\\", and the Russian –ø—Ä–µ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ in relation to the Eucharist should not be taken as equivalent to the word \\"transubstantiation\\", which has been rendered as metousiosis.–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ. –ê. –û—Å–∏–ø–æ–≤. ŒúŒµœÑŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒÆ –∏–ª–∏ transsubstantiatio? Eastern theologians who use the word \\"transubstantiation\\" or \\"metousiosis\\" are careful to exclude the notion that it is an explanation of how the bread and wine of the sacrament are changed into the body and blood of Christ, instead of being a statement of what is changed. Both Orlov and Nikolaj Uspenksij appeal to Church Fathers who, when speaking of other doctrines, drew analogies from the Eucharist and spoke of it as bread and wine, but as having also a heavenly nature.–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –£—Å–ø–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π. –°–≤—è—Ç–æ–æ—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ —É—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ –Ω–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ç–∏–∂–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥—ã –µ–≤—Ö–∞—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∏. Some Eastern Orthodox theologians thus appear to deny transubstantiation/metousiosis, but in the view of Adrian Fortescue, what they object to is the associated theory of substance and accident, and they hold that there is a real change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ.Adrian Fortescue, The Orthodox Eastern Church (Gorgias Press 2001), pp. 25‚Äì26  Eastern Orthodox use of the term metousiosis  An English translation of the full, quite lengthy, declaration by the 1672 Orthodox Council of Jerusalem, convoked by Patriarch Dositheos II of Jerusalem, can be found at the website Chapter VI of Acts and Decrees of the Synod of Jerusalem. The first edition of The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church, known also as The Catechism of St. Philaret, did not include the term metousiosis; but it was added in the third edition: \\"In the exposition of the faith by the Eastern Patriarchs, it is said that the word transubstantiation is not to be taken to define the manner in which the bread and wine are changed into the Body and Blood of the Lord; for this none can understand but God; but only thus much is signified, that the bread truly, really, and substantially becomes the very true Body of the Lord, and the wine the very Blood of the Lord.\\" The official Greek version of this passage (question 340) uses the word \\"metousiosis\\". Writing in 1929, Metropolitan of Thyatira Germanos said that an obstacle to the request for union with the Eastern Orthodox Church presented in the 17th century by some Church of England bishops was that \\"the Patriarchs were adamant on the question of Transubstantiation\\", which, in view of the Thirty- Nine Articles, the Anglican bishops did not wish to accept.Progress Towards the Re-Union of the Orthodox and Anglican Churches.

Uninterested in the meeting, Fry and Dr. Zoidberg wander off in search of food. Fry finds his way into a support group meeting for cryogenic clients who have been defrosted, where he meets a sleazy 1980s businessman (referred to only as \\"That Guy\\" throughout the episode, though named in the script as Steve CastleFuture Stock commentary. Futurama. Twentieth Century Fox. 2003. DVD.). Resembling Gordon Gekko, That Guy arranged to have himself frozen to await a cure for his terminal \\"boneitis\\". Fry and That Guy return to the Planet Express stockholders' meeting, where a revolt against Professor Farnsworth is in progress. Fry nominates That Guy as new CEO, and That Guy beats out the Professor by one vote. That Guy names Fry his new Vice Chairman, and sets out to remake Planet Express by giving it an expensive image overhaul. That Guy spends tremendous amounts of money on lavish, pricey, flashy items such as flying chairs, expensive suits, and an enigmatic television commercial. Annoyed, Zoidberg sells his stock to That Guy for a sandwich, exclaiming, \\"Net gain for Zoidberg!\\". After draining the company's funds and its employees' morale, That Guy announces that he is selling Planet Express to Mom. The takeover begins at the orbiting Intergalactic Stock Exchange, and all the Planet Express employees vote against it. Unfortunately, the stock That Guy bought from Zoidberg gave him a controlling interest and That Guy outvotes them. Mom and her sons vote for the merger. However, before the final approval takes place, That Guy abruptly succumbs to a lethal attack of boneitis, causing his body to contort as his bones snap, twist and curl. In his death-throes, That Guy admits he was so busy \\"being an '80s guy\\", he had forgotten to cure the disease. Fry gains control of That Guy's shares, and he votes against the merger. The Planet Express staff initially tries to convince him to sell the company, because the sale of their stock will make them all rich. However, Fry has already given a speech that drove the stock's price through the floor. Since the staff will be poor no matter what he does, he votes against the merger. The staff leaves to spend the weekend in disappointment over the loss of their potential wealth. Cultural references The title is wordplay on Future Shock, a book written by the futurist Alvin Toffler in 1970. The Planet Express advert, in which a woman hurls a Planet Express box at a giant glass screen with Mom on it, is a parody of the famous 1984 television advert that introduced the Apple Macintosh. At 'The Big Ape Fight', Calculon uses a similar line from the original Planet of the Apes film in the style of Charlton Heston. The episode also references the 1987 film Wall Street and other 1980s films related to stockbroking.

(; April 9, 1726 ‚Äì October 16, 1755), was an Italian lay brother of the Congregation of the Redeemer, better known as the Redemptorists, who is honored as a saint by the Catholic Church. His intercession is sought for children, unborn children, women in childbirth, mothers, expectant mothers, motherhood, the falsely accused, good confessions, lay brothers and Muro Lucano, Italy. Life Majella was born in Muro Lucano, the youngest of five children. He was the son of Domenico Maiella, a tailor who died when Gerard was twelve, leaving the family in poverty. His mother, Benedetta Galella, then sent him to her brother so that he could teach Gerard to sew and follow in his father's footsteps. However, the foreman was abusive. The boy kept silent, but his uncle soon found out and the man who taught him resigned from the job. After four years of apprenticeship, he took a job as a servant to work for the local Bishop of Lacedonia. Upon the bishop's death, Gerard returned to his trade, working first as a journeyman and then on his own account. He divided his earnings between his mother and the poor and in offerings for the souls in Purgatory. He tried to join the Capuchin Order, but his health prevented it. In 1749, he joined the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, known as Redemptorists. The order was founded in 1732 by Saint Alphonsus Liguori (1696-1787) at Scala, near Naples. The essentially- missionary order is dedicated to \\"preaching the word of God to the poor.\\" Its apostolate is principally in giving of missions and retreats.Carr, John, \\"St. Gerard Majella\\", A Treasury of Catholic Reading, ed. John Chapin (New York: Farrar, Straus & Cudahy, 1957) During his life, he was very close to the peasants and other outsiders who lived in the Neapolitan countryside. In his work with the Redemptorist community, he was variously a gardener, sacristan, tailor, porter, cook, carpenter, and clerk of works on the new buildings at Caposele. At 27, the good-looking Majella became the subject of a malicious rumor. An acquaintance, Neria, accused him of having had relations with a young woman. When confronted by Alphonsus Liguori, the founder, on the accusations, the young lay brother remained silent. The girl later recanted and cleared his name. Some of Majella's reported miracles include restoring life to a boy who had fallen from a high cliff, blessing the scanty supply of wheat belonging to a poor family and making it last until the next harvest, and several times multiplying the bread that he was distributing to the poor. One day, he walked across the water to lead a boatload of fishermen through stormy waves to the safety of the shore. He was reputed to have had the gift of bilocation and the ability to read souls. His last will was a small note on the door of his cell: \\"Here the will of God is done, as God wills, and as long as God wills.\\" He died at 29 of tuberculosis. Patron of mothers One miracle in particular explains how Majella became known as the special patron of mothers. A few months before his death, he visited the Pirofalo family and accidentally dropped his handkerchief. One of the Pirofalo girls spotted the handkerchief moments after he had left the house, and she ran after Gerard to return it. \\"Keep it,\\" he said to her. \\"You may need it some day.\\" Years later when the girl, now a married woman, was on the verge of dying in childbirth, she remembered the words of the saintly lay brother. She asked for the handkerchief to be brought to her. Almost immediately, the pain disappeared and she gave birth to a healthy child. That was no small feat in an era when only one out of three pregnancies resulted in a live birth, and word of the miracle spread quickly. Because of the miracles that God worked through Gerard's prayers with mothers, the mothers of Italy took Gerard to their hearts and made him their patron. At the process of his beatification, one witness testified that he was known as \\"il santo dei felice parti,\\" the saint of happy childbirths. His devotion has become very popular in North America, both in the United States and Canada. Veneration Majella was beatified in Rome on January 29, 1893, by Pope Leo XIII. He was canonised less than twelve years later on December 11, 1904, by Pope Pius X. The feast day of Saint Gerard Majella is October 16. In 1977, St. Gerard's Chapel in St. Lucy's Church (Newark, New Jersey) was dedicated as a national shrine. Each year during the Feast days which include October 16, there are the traditional lights, music, food stands and the street procession. People come from all over to celebrate. Devotees visit the Shrine also throughout the year to petition the help of St. Gerard.St. Lucy's Church , Newark, NJ. The St. Gerard Majella Annual Novena takes place every year in St. Josephs Church, Dundalk, Ireland. This annual nine-day novena is the biggest festival of faith in Ireland. St. Joseph's sponsors the St. Gerard's Family League, an association of Christians united in prayer for their own and other families, to preserve Christian values in their home and family life. Legacy Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Trinity, Indiana St Gerard's Church in Wellington, New Zealand, built in 1908, was the first church to be dedicated to him. There are two churches dedicated to St. Gerard Majella one situated in Sapugahawatte - Dodangoda and another in Kirimatiyana, Lunuwila, Sri Lanka. The Sanctuary of San Gerardo Maiella is a basilica in Materdomini, Italy dedicated to him. In England, there is a church dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes and to St. Gerard Majella in Preston, Lancashire. There is also a church dedicated to him in Bristol. The Senior Coroner for Liverpool and Wirral sits at the Gerard Majella Courthouse in Liverpool. In Scotland, there is a church and primary school dedicated to St Gerard Majella in Bellshill, Lanarkshire, opened in 1971 & 1973 respectively. The maternity hospital, now a housing estate, was located close by, hence the choice of name of church and school. In Hollis (in the Borough of Queens), New York City, there is a Catholic parish dedicated to him. In Kirkwood, Missouri (a suburb of St. Louis), there is a Catholic parish dedicated to him; the includes a school from prekindergarten to Grade 8. In Port Jefferson Station town of Long Island, there is another Catholic parish dedicated to him. In the Del Rey section of Los Angeles, there is another Catholic parish dedicated to him. Two towns in Quebec, Canada, are named in his honour: one in the Mont√©r√©gie region and another in the Lanaudi√®re region. In Ghent (Belgium) a model school was named after Saint Gerard. This school was exhibited on the world exhibition of 1913 in Ghent as a model for Belgium's future school buildings. In 1914 it was rebuilt after the exhibition with the same stones. Nowadays the Saint Gerard School is used by a charity organisation \\"Geraarke\\" (local name) which supports poor people with clothes and food packages. In Nigeria, there is a shrine dedicated to St Gerard Majella at a place called Oba, in Anambra State. It was given to the Redemptorists of the Vice-Province of Nigeria by the Archbishop of Onitsha, Most Rev. Valerian Okeke. The Redemeptorists also built a school for the poor and most abandoned in the shrine site dedicated to St Gerard Majella.

The ship's 6-inch guns were converted to rapid- firing in 1902 and the torpedo tubes were removed at this time. In 1908-1911 San Francisco was converted to a minelayer, with all guns except the four 6-pounder (57 mm) weapons replaced by eight 5 inch (127 mm)/40 caliber guns and storage for 300 mines added. She was also reboilered with eight Babcock & Wilcox boilers. By 1918 her gun armament was further modernized with four 5 inch (127 mm)/51 caliber guns, four 6-pounder (57 mm) guns, two 3 inch (76 mm)/50 caliber anti-aircraft guns, and two machine guns (possibly the .30 caliber M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine gun). Service history=Pre- Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Assigned to the South Pacific Squadron, San Francisco moved south and became the squadron's flagship on 31 March 1891. Five months later, as an eight-month-old civil war drew to a close in Chile, she landed a force of sailors and Marines to protect the United States Consulate. September brought an end to the war, and San Francisco resumed her cruising off the South American coast. With the new year, 1892, she sailed north and west and arrived at Honolulu on 27 February as political differences deepened between monarchists and republicans. She departed Hawaii in August 1892, en route to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived in February 1893. San Francisco became the flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron on 31 May and cruised off the New England coast into the fall. In November, she sailed south, visited ports in the Caribbean; and, in late December, reached Rio de Janeiro and assumed flagship duties for the South Atlantic Squadron. She called at ports in Brazil, the Netherlands West Indies, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua during the next six months, then returned to the United States, anchoring at New York City on 29 July 1894. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War The year 1895 brought further overseas duty; and, in January, San Francisco crossed the Atlantic to cruise in the eastern Mediterranean Sea as political tension within the Ottoman Empire caused diplomatic uneasiness. Later shifted to other areas, she remained in European waters, serving as the flagship of Commodore Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr., commander of the European Squadron, until 1896. In March of that year, she returned to the U.S.; cruised off the east coast until the outbreak of war against Spain in April 1898; then took up patrol duties along the Florida coast and off Cuba. In July, Spain requested terms; and, in August, she returned to Hampton Roads. She was placed out of commission at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 25 October. Pre-World War I Cleaning a 6\\" gun on San Francisco Recommissioned on 2 January 1902, San Francisco was again assigned to the European Squadron. In September, she returned to the U.S. and commenced operations southward into the Caribbean. Another cruise to the Mediterranean, thence on to Asiatic ports, followed; and, in the fall of 1904, the protected cruiser again entered the Norfolk Navy Yard, where she was decommissioned on 31 December. In June 1908, San Francisco was ordered refitted as a minelaying vessel; and in 1910, she was rearmed with eight 5 inch (127 mm)/40 caliber guns and a capacity of 300 mines. On 21 August 1911, she was recommissioned but retained in reserve; and, after participation in the Fleet Review at New York, she was placed in full commission on 29 November. Designated a mine planter on 19 December 1912, she remained based at Norfolk and operated in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean into 1916, when she was again ordered inactivated. In 1914, she took part in the United States occupation of Veracruz. She was placed in reserve at Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 6 June 1916, but resumed full commissioned status again on 18 October. World War I With the April 1917 entry of the United States into World War I, San Francisco began laying anti-submarine nets in the Hampton Roads area. In June, she shifted to New York, where she conducted experimental deep water minelaying operations; and, during August, she underwent overhaul at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. In mid-September, she moved back down the coast to New London, Connecticut where she provided net laying services until ordered to Norfolk for training duty later in the fall. From December 1917-March 1918, she underwent an extensive overhaul; and, in April, she became flagship of Mine Squadron 1. In early May, the squadron assembled at Newport, Rhode Island. On the 12th, the ships sailed for England. On the 26th, units of the Royal Navy escorted the ships into Inverness. San Francisco joined the Allied effort of creating the North Sea Mine Barrage across the North Sea to restrict German U-boat traffic into the Atlantic. San Francisco laid a total of 9,102 mines: * planting 153 mines during the 1st minelaying excursion on 7 June, * planting 170 mines during the 3rd minelaying excursion on 14 July, * planting 170 mines during the 4th minelaying excursion on 29 July, * planting 170 mines during the 5th minelaying excursion on 8 August, * planting 166 mines on 12 August to field test sensitivity settings for the antenna fuze detonating relay of the Mk 6 mines, * planting 160 mines during the 6th minelaying excursion on 18 August, * planting 170 mines during the 7th minelaying excursion on 26 August, * planting 170 mines during the 8th minelaying excursion on 7 September, * planting 170 mines during the 9th minelaying excursion on 20 September, * planting 170 mines during the 10th minelaying excursion on 27 September, * planting 170 mines during the 11th minelaying excursion on 4 October, * planting 170 mines during the 12th minelaying excursion on 13 October, and * planting 170 mines during the final 13th minelaying excursion on 24 October.Belknap, p. 110 Inter-war period San Francisco conducted minelaying operations until the Armistice on 11 November. Minesweepers then moved in, and she prepared to return home. She departed Inverness on 2 December and arrived in Hampton Roads on 3 January 1919. Overhaul followed, after which she cruised in the western Atlantic and Caribbean through 1921. Designated CM-2 (cruiser minelayer) on 17 July 1920, she was ordered inactivated in 1921; and on 6 October, she arrived at Philadelphia where she was decommissioned on 24 December 1921. Remaining in reserve through the decade, CM-2 was renamed Tahoe, and then Yosemite, effective 1 January 1931, to allow the name San Francisco to be given to , then under construction. As Yosemite, she remained at Philadelphia for another eight years. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 June 1937, but she was retained at the Navy Yard until sold for scrapping to the Union Shipbuilding Company, Baltimore, Maryland on 20 April 1939.

Given its motivations and approach, generalized expected utility theory may properly be regarded as a subfield of behavioral economics, but it is more frequently located within mainstream economic theory. The expected utility model developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern dominated decision theory from its formulation in 1944 until the late 1970s, not only as a prescriptive, but also as a descriptive model, despite powerful criticism from Maurice Allais and Daniel Ellsberg who showed that, in certain choice problems, decisions were usually inconsistent with the axioms of expected utility theory. These problems are usually referred to as the Allais paradox and Ellsberg paradox. Beginning in 1979 with the publication of the prospect theory of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, a range of generalized expected utility models were developed with the aim of resolving the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes, while maintaining many of the attractive properties of expected utility theory. Important examples were anticipated utility theory, later referred to as rank-dependent utility theory, weighted utility (Chew 1982), and expected uncertain utility theory. A general representation, using the concept of the local utility function was presented by Mark J. Machina. Since then, generalizations of expected utility theory have proliferated, but the probably most frequently used model is nowadays cumulative prospect theory, a rank-dependent development of prospect theory, introduced in 1992 by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

It is a staple of Cuban-American cuisine and is traditionally the bread of choice when making an authentic Cuban sandwich. History Old Ferlita (La Joven Francesca) Bakery, now Ybor City Museum State Park in Tampa's Ybor City The origins of \\"real\\" Cuban bread are debated, with both Miami and Tampa, Florida claiming to be the home of the best. With regards to where it originated, the first commercial bakery in the U.S. to produce Cuban bread was most likely La Joven Francesca bakery, which was established by the Sicilian-born Francisco Ferlita in 1896 in Ybor City, a thriving Cuban- Spanish-Italian community in Tampa. The bakery originally sold bread for 3 to 5 cents per loaf, many of which were delivered every morning like milk. Houses in Ybor City often had a sturdy nail driven into the door frame on the front porch, and a bread deliveryman would impale the fresh loaf of bread onto the nail before dawn. Ferlita's bakery was destroyed by fire in 1922, leaving only the brick bread oven standing. It was rebuilt and expanded, and it soon became a major supplier of Cuban bread for the Tampa area. The bakery also added a dining area which became a place to congregate, drink a cup of Cuban coffee, and catch up on the local news. La Joven Francesca closed in 1973, but soon found new life when it was renovated and converted into the Ybor City State Museum. The original ovens where the original Cuban bread was baked are still viewable inside. La Segunda Bakery in Ybor City is currently the largest producer of Cuban bread in the world and ships the product all over Florida and beyond. It was co-founded by Juan Mor√®, who migrated to Tampa from Spain via Cuba and became a partner in a bakery co-op with three locations: \\"La Primera\\", \\"La Segunda\\", and \\"La Tercera\\" (literally, First, Second, and Third). Mor√® had been running La Primera, but when the other two bakeries closed in 1915, he bought the larger La Segunda building. His descendants have been running the bakery ever since, and it still uses Mor√®'s original Cuban bread recipe and many of the same bread-making techniques. Characteristics Simulated Cuban bread in traditional brick oven, Ybor City State Museum, Tampa > It is not amiss to say that the Latins in Ybor City make a very fine bread, > equal in all respects to the French article of that kind and unexcelled by > the Vienna product. :-Tampa Daily Journal, 1896Ingalls, Roberts and Louis > Perez, Jr. Tampa Cigar Workers. 2003. University Press of Florida, p. 49. A traditional loaf of Cuban bread is approximately three feet long and somewhat rectangular crossways (as compared to the rounder shape of Italian or French bread loaves). It has a hard, thin, almost papery toasted crust and a soft flaky center. In the early days, the dough was stretched thin to make it last, creating the bread's distinctive air pockets and long shape. As they have for over a century, La Segunda and a few other traditional Cuban bread producers lay a long, moist palmetto frond on top of the loaves before baking, creating a shallow trench in the upper crust, producing an effect similar to the slashing or scoring of a European-style loaf. (The frond is removed before eating.) Cuban bread is the necessary base for a \\"Cuban sandwich\\" (sometimes called a \\"sandwich mixto\\"). It can also be served as a simple breakfast, especially toasted and pressed with butter and served alongside (and perhaps dunked into) a hot mug of cafe con leche (strong dark-roasted Cuban coffee with scalded milk). Because the traditional recipe uses no preservatives, Cuban bread tends to go stale quickly and becomes hard and dry if not eaten soon after baking. However, it can be frozen for shipping or storage. In Tampa, stale Cuban bread became a key ingredient in other recipes, such as the breading of a deviled crab. Other uses Stale Cuban bread is the preferred \\"weapon of choice\\" in protests performed by the Conch Republic and in mock battles involving the \\"Ybor City Navy\\" during Tampa's Gasparilla Pirate Festival.

Lilly, the younger son and namesake of Josiah K. Lilly Sr., graduated from the University of Michigan's School of Pharmacy in 1914 and served in the U.S. Army in France during World War I. At Eli Lilly and Company, where his primary focus was marketing and human resources, he served as vice president of marketing, executive vice president of the company, and president of Eli Lilly International Corporation, before succeeded his older brother, Eli Jr., as company president in 1948 and as chairman of the board in 1953. During Lilly's five decades with the firm, it grew into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Lilly helped improve the company's business processes to increase its efficiency, laid the groundwork for its personnel guidelines, and formed its sales research department. He was the last Lilly family member to serve as company president. Lilly was also a philanthropist, as well as a collector. In 1937 Joe, his brother, and their father, founded the Lilly Endowment, which remains as one of the largest charitable foundations in the world. Lilly was also known for his significant collection of rare books and manuscripts, which he donated to Indiana University to form the core collection of the Lilly Library, located on the IU campus in Bloomington, Indiana. Oldfields, Lilly's estate home and grounds in Indianapolis, are part of the present-day Newfields. The Smithsonian Institution acquired Lilly's gold coin collection. Cape Cod's Heritage Museums and Gardens was established in his honor in Sandwich, Massachusetts, and holds some of Lilly's other collections. Early life and education Josiah Kirby Lilly Jr., known as \\"Joe\\" among friends and family, was the younger son of Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and Lilly (n√©e Ridgley) Lilly. He was born at the family's home on North Pennsylvania Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, on September 25, 1893. His only sibling, Eli Jr., was eight years older. Joe's mother suffered from pernicious anemia and died in 1934; his father died in 1948.Madison, pp. 83‚Äì84, 119‚Äì20. Lilly was the grandson of Colonel Eli Lilly, who founded Eli Lilly and Company, a pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in 1876. Joe's father was superintendent of the Lilly laboratory at the time of Joe's birth and succeeded Colonel Lilly as president of the company in 1898. Joe and Eli followed their father into the family business. Each son served as company president and chairman of the board, but Joe was the last family member to serve as its president.Madison, pp. 5‚Äì6, 23, 37, 91, 118‚Äì20. Lilly attended the Holderness School in Plymouth, New Hampshire, and graduated from The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, in 1912.Madison, p. 37. He continued his education with a two-year course at the University of Michigan's School of Pharmacy, which he completed in 1914, before returning to Indianapolis to join the family business. Marriage and family Joe married Ruth Marie Brinkmeyer of Indianapolis on October 15, 1914. The couple had two children, Ruth (1915‚Äì2009) and Josiah (Joe) III (1916‚Äì1995). Lilly's daughter became a philanthropist. His son joined the family business in 1939 and became superintendent of its Kentucky Avenue plant after serving in the military during World War II; however, he resigned from the company in 1948 and did not succeed his father as president. In 1954, after briefly serving as secretary of the Lilly Endowment, Josiah III resigned and moved to New England.Madison, pp. 118‚Äì19. Oldfields, Lilly's former home in Indianapolis In December 1932 Lilly purchased Oldfields, a French chateau-style home with landscaped gardens, from Hugh McKennan Landon, an Indianapolis businessman. Lewis Ketcham Davis designed the home, which was built circa 1909‚Äì13; Percival Gallagher, an associate of the Olmsted Brothers, designed its gardens. Lilly and his wife, Ruth, maintained the home as their primary residence. Oldfields and its landscaped grounds were donated to the Art Association of Indianapolis in 1967 and became a part the Indianapolis Museum of Art. In 1934 Lilly began acquiring additional land along Eagle Creek in Marion County's Pike Township, northwest of downtown Indianapolis, to create Eagle Crest, a private retreat on of land. The secluded property included an operating farm and timberland, as well as a nature preserve. In 1936 Lilly moved his collection of rare books and manuscripts from his home to the library he had built on the property, which also included a lodge. Lilly donated the property to Purdue University in 1958. The Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation acquired Eagle Crest from the university in 1966 to establish Eagle Creek Park and Nature Preserve.Brooks, \\"Oldfields: An American County Estate,\\" p. 38. See also In 1955 Lilly acquired the Indianapolis home of Lyman S. Ayres II, the grandson of Lyman S. Ayres, who founded the L. S. Ayres and Company department stores. Ayres had the Colonial-style home on Kessler Boulevard, West Drive, built in 1941. The Lilly family purchase adjoining property to expand the estate, known as Twin Oaks, to . Lilly's daughter, Ruth, lived there until her death in 2009, and it remains privately owned. He also maintained a summer home, called Red Oaks, at Falmouth, Massachusetts. Career=Eli Lilly and Company Lilly joined Eli Lilly and Company in November 1914 and became head of its newly formed Efficiency Division in 1916. He was responsible for the company's employee relations, payroll, and methods and standards departments. Following his enlistment in the U.S. Army during World War I, when he served in France as an officer in the medical supply service, Lilly returned to the family business in Indianapolis, where he spent the remainder of his career.Madison, pp. 37, 45. In the late 1920s Lilly and his brother, Eli, established a Planning Department and developed improvements to the company's hiring procedures, employee bonus incentives, working conditions, and efficiency efforts.Madison, p. 49. While Eli served as president of the company from 1932 to 1948, Joe's main interests were sales and marketing. During this period the company's growth was significant: \\"sales increased from $13 million to $115 million, and the number of employees grew from 1,675 to 6,912.\\"Madison, pp. 91‚Äì92. As part of a company reorganization in 1944, Joe became executive vice president, while continuing to maintain responsibilities for the company's marketing effort, including the sales research, marketing, and distribution functions.Madison, p. 112. The company's increasing size, the complexity of its business, and the resignation of Joe's son, Josiah III, in 1946, caused the company to consider a gradual leadership transition that would separate the company's ownership from its day-to-day management. Prior to his elevation to company president in 1948, Joe was president of Eli Lilly International Corporation. He remained at the helm until 1953 when Eugene Beesley succeeded him to become the first non-family member to serve as the company's president. Lilly was chairman of the board from 1953 until his death in 1966.Madison, p. 249. Later years Following his retirement as company president in 1953, Lilly devoted most of his time to various hobbies.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 912. He was known for his philanthropic activities, as well as his collections of rare books and manuscripts, gold coins, antique weaponry, stamps, works of art, and military miniatures. Philanthropy and collections=Lilly Endowment In 1937 Lilly, his father, J. K., and his older brother, Eli, founded the Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment Inc. Over the years Joe donated a total of $6 million in Eli Lilly and Company stock to the endowment and Eli contributed stock valued at $2.8 million; however, their father made the largest stock contribution, a total of $86.8 million. As the company's stock value increased, the Lilly Endowment became one of the largest private foundations in the United States.Madison, pp. 206‚Äì07. In addition to its other projects the Lilly Endowment funded some of Joe's special interests, such as Bibliography of American Literature, which published its first volume in 1955, and grants to the Lilly Library at IU Bloomington.Madison, p. 208. Rare book and manuscript collection Lilly was a prolific rare book collector and a member of the Grolier Club. He acquired a First Folio of the works of William Shakespeare, a Gutenberg Bible, a double-elephant folio of John James Audubon's Birds of America, the first printing of the American Declaration of Independence (the Dunlap Broadside), and a first edition of Edgar Allan Poe's Tamerlane. He also acquired ninety-four titles on the \\"Grolier Hundred,\\" a list of one hundred volumes that have been identified as important in the history of printed books. See also: Lilly owned \\"thousands\\" of first editions of significant books of literature, history, and science. His collection was especially strong in American and British literary classics, as well as the history of science and medicine and Americana. The manuscript collections ranged from Robert Burns's \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" to the original manuscript of James M. Barrie's Peter Pan.\\"J.K. Lilly Jr.\\" in See also: Silver, J.K. Lilly Jr., Bibliophile, pp. 33‚Äì35. On November 26, 1954, in a letter written to Herman B Wells, president of Indiana University, Lilly described his intention to donate his entire general collection of sixty-nine titles to the university. IU announced the donation, which the New York Times estimated its worth at $5 million, on January 8, 1956.Capshew, p. 246. Lilly eventually donated to IU more than 20,000 books and 17,000 manuscripts, in addition to more than fifty oil paintings and 300 prints. The collection is housed in the Lilly Library building on IU's main campus in Bloomington, Indiana.Capshew, p. 248. Lilly Library In the late 1950s, Lilly provided the funding for construction of a new special collections library on the IU Bloomington campus.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 12, 2003. The episode was written by Bill Odenkirk and directed by Wes Archer. The plot centers on Kif and Amy's relationship; Kif is suddenly impregnated so he returns to his homeworld to give birth. The episode was generally well received by critics. Plot Amy is unhappy with her long-distance relationship with Kif and wants to see him in person again. When the crew is sent to deliver a giant pill to a planet near where Kif is stationed, Amy stows away on board the Planet Express Ship. While the crew is asleep, Amy changes course to meet with Kif. When Zapp Brannigan sees the ship, the Planet Express crew joins him on the Nimbus. On the Nimbus, Kif implores Amy to move in with him and shows her the HoloShed to illustrate what life would be like with him. Soon, however, the shed malfunctions and the holograms that invade become real. When the holograms reach the rest of the crew, Zapp Brannigan accidentally blasts a hole in the ship, which sucks out the holograms. Everyone else on the ship is also sucked towards the hole, but they hang on to each other's hands until the moon from the Holoshed plugs the hole. Later, at the sickbay, the doctor reports that everyone survived with only minor injuries, and also reveals that Kif is pregnant. Kif explains to the crew that his race reproduces through touch, their skin being a semi-permeable membrane which can absorb genetic material. They become sexually fertile whenever they experience strong positive emotions for another being, as Kif did with Amy on the HoloShed. Fry points out that everyone on the ship touched Kif while he was trying to hang onto them to prevent being sucked through the hole and it is unclear who the mother is. Professor Farnsworth uses an invention of his, the Maternifuge, to determine the real mother. The machine filters out its occupants based on a DNA sample, revealing that the mother is Leela. Amy is instead only the \\"smizmar\\" of Kif's children, which nevertheless makes her the \\"real\\" mother by Kif's standards. Amy is dismayed at being cast in the role of a mother, however, her parents are surprisingly happy about having a grandchild and demand Amy and Kiff call Amy's Mum \\"Grandma\\" all the time, however, at Fry and Bender's apartment for the pre-birth celebrations, Amy runs away. With Kif's pregnancy nearing its end, the crew takes Kif to Amphibios 9, his homeworld. Kif encounters the Grand Midwife, who oversees the birthing ceremony, which traditionally involves the participation of the smizmar, further underscoring Kif's sadness at Amy's abandonment. Just as Kif is about to give birth, Amy arrives saying she wants to be with him despite not being ready for motherhood. After Kif gives birth, the babies, in a tadpole-like state, make it to the swampy water and are left to swim about until they are able to live out of water, which Kif reveals will not happen for twenty years, thus relieving Amy of any maternal duties. Production At the beginning of the episode, when Professor Farnsworth retreats to the angry dome, there was a debate amongst the writers about whether the viewers should be able to hear him or not. They envisioned the angry dome as being similar to the Cone of Silence from Get Smart, but ultimately it was decided that hearing the professor was funnier. The writers also had a debate about who the second parent of Kif's children should be. Writer Bill Odenkirk notes that they felt making Amy the true parent would make her character unlikable after she did not accept the children. In the scene in Kif's room, Bender is seen in Kif's closet with his head and body separated. No explanation for this is ever given in the episode. However, on the DVD commentary, it is revealed that it was originally going to be explained that the room was much too small to have everybody fit inside, and that Bender was in the closet out of necessity. The original script also contained a much longer series of events once the characters arrived at Kif's planet. The material that was eventually cut focused on the journey and a series of tasks Kif needed to complete before giving birth. The material was supposedly as long as an entire episode. Cultural references * The animation of the Planet Express Ship entering the Nimbus‚Äô cargo hold is a reference to the film You Only Live Twice, although on the DVD commentary, the creators mistake it for Moonraker. * The HoloShed (and its frequent malfunctions turning holograms \\"real\\") are parodies of the holodeck from Star Trek: The Next Generation. Among the HoloShed characters who run rampant are Professor Moriarty, Attila the Hun, Jack the Ripper, and an evil version of Abraham Lincoln. A holodeck incarnation of Professor Moriarty \\"came alive\\" in two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation ‚Äì \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" and \\"Ship in a Bottle\\" ‚Äì while Jack the Ripper and Lincoln appeared in Star Trek: The Original Series; \\"Evil Lincoln\\" is a specific reference to the episode \\"The Savage Curtain\\", where aliens pit some of Earth's most storied heroes (including Lincoln) against its most hated villains. *The HoloShed is programmed in BASIC because the writers were amused by the idea that in the Star Trek universe, any simulation one wants to experience has already been painstakingly programmed. * The sick bay scene is a parody of that from Star Trek: The Original Series, complete with sound effects. The sign references a creature from the series called a Horta. The sick bay's doctor is a parody of Dr. Leonard ‚ÄúBones‚Äù McCoy. * The maternifuge is based loosely on the amusement park ride, \\"The Rotor\\". * Kif, a male, being impregnated by Leela, a female, by only touching hands is a reference to Charles ‚ÄúTrip‚Äú Tucker III of Enterprise being impregnated by an alien species by only putting his hands into clear beads with an alien female to play a ‚Äúgame‚Äù. Reception Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying: \\"At the very least, it makes an effort to deal with Kif and Amy in a way that‚Äôs unexpected, surprisingly heartwarming, and more than a little disgusting. But it‚Äôs hampered by a structural choice which, while allowing for a big surprise in the final act, takes focus away from [Amy,] the one character who has anything resembling an arc in the story.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch at Yahoo!

It is the second instalment of the MediEvil series and a sequel to MediEvil. Taking place 500 years after the events of the first game, it follows series' protagonist Sir Daniel Fortesque's revival in Victorian-era London as he attempts to stop sorcerer Lord Palethorn and Jack the Ripper's plans to terrorise the city by raising the dead. Following the positive reception of the first game, Sony Computer Entertainment commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to make a sequel to MediEvil before the end of the PlayStation's lifespan. The original concepts for MediEvil 2 went through many transformations during development before the Cambridge team finally settled on making a sequel set during the Victorian Gothic revival, largely reminiscent of its predecessor. It was first released in April 2000 in Europe and North America. The game received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise including slight improvements over its predecessor, such as artificial intelligence and graphical enhancements, but was criticised for lack of innovation from the original. Gameplay A still image from the second level of the game. MediEvil 2 features various locations in Victorian-era London MediEvil 2 once again sees players in control of Sir Daniel Fortesque as he travels through several levels set in Victorian-era London to thwart the evil Palethorn and his undead army. Along with returning weapons and equipments such as swords and shields, Dan can now obtain more modern weaponry such as a pistol, a blunderbuss, and a gatling gun. MediEvil 2 adds a new feature that allows the player to select two weapons that Dan can toggle between in real-time. Like in the previous game, Dan can earn more weapons by finding the Chalice of Souls in each level, which is filled up by defeating enemies. Dan can also visit merchants known as Spivs for ammo and services, and speak with Winston the ghost to receive hints and save during longer levels. Collecting Life Bottles hidden in certain levels expands Dan's life meter, which can be replenished via Life Vials and Life Fountains. In the middle of the game, Dan unlocks the ability to place his head on a zombified hand to become Dan Hand, allowing him to explore areas that his normal body cannot while also being able to alternate control between them. Plot The game's plot takes place in 1886, 500 years after Sir Daniel Fortesque's battle against the evil sorcerer Zarok in the previous game. In Kensington, a wealthy industrialist and sorcerer named Lord Palethorn discovers Zarok's spellbook and casts its spell of raising the dead over the city of London. However, the pages of the book soon scatter across London, and Palethorn gains a demon-like appearance as a result. The spell Palethorn casts once again resurrects Dan, whose body had been on display in a nearby museum. He is recruited by a professor named Hamilton Kift and his ghostly sidekick Winston Chapelmount (a play on Winston Churchill) to recover the pages of Zarok's spellbook and put a stop to Palethorn's plans. Along the way, they end up being joined by an ancient mummy princess named Kiya, whom Dan falls in love with. When Kiya goes to Whitechapel alone to investigate psychic disturbances there, she is killed by Jack the Ripper. Broken-hearted, Dan abandons the quest against Palethorn and wanders into London's sewers, where he encounters the Mullocks, who worship a statue of Dan, and discovers a time machine that Kift had built years earlier. Collecting the parts to rebuild the time machine, Dan travels back in time to defeat Jack & save Kiya. Jack pleads with Dan to be spared, but he mercilessly shoots him dead. Dan then merges with his past self to gain golden \\"Super Armour\\", and returns to the battle. Dan collects the final pages and confronts Palethorn, who steals the page from him and offers Dan the choice of joining him, but Dan refuses, saying \\"I'll never join you!\\". Palethorn then assigns his two assistants, Mander and Dogman, to stop Dan from following him, but both are killed. Dan then goes after Palethorn. Palethorn uses the pages to summon a large blue demon. Dan manages to turn the demon against Palethorn, putting a stop to both of them. With his last breath, Palethorn drops a time bomb in a last-ditch effort to kill Dan, destroying his lair in the process. Dan escapes and decides to join Kiya in the afterlife as they return to their eternal rest. If the player has collected all the Chalices, Dan and Kiya instead go for a ride on the time machine which takes them back to the end of the first game, encountering Palethorn in a monstrous form similar to Zarok's. Development After the success of the first MediEvil, Sony Computer Entertainment commissioned SCE Cambridge to develop a sequel that would be released before the end of the PlayStation's lifespan. Chris Sorrell, who previously served as director of the first game, was not involved in development, so the project was handed over to James Shepherd instead. According to Shepherd, the original plot for MediEvil 2 had previous antagonist Zarok being held prisoner in the Tower of London and Sir Daniel Fortesque's objective would be to free him, but this idea was eventually dropped due it being considered identical to a \\"B-movie twist ending.\\" The Cambridge studio believed it would not be difficult to make a sequel to the first MediEvil, considering that the ending of its predecessor would give the team an opportunity to set the next game in a different time period. Shepherd settled on MediEvil 2 being set in the Victorian era, the birthplace of the Neo-Gothic revival. Shepherd considered the hardest part of the development was deciding how to make the game better than its predecessor by incorporating humorous elements in the game. To achieve this, the Cambridge studio re-coded a majority of its core technology, which Shepherd considered arguably similar to \\"starting from scratch.\\" Various features cut from the previous game were added into MediEvil 2, such as playable characters and levels that featured puzzles. By the time the game reached beta status the game offered larger levels, improved NPC logic, and additional moves for the protagonist. Reception MediEvil 2 received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release. The game was mostly praised for its rich detailed graphics but was criticised by many reviewers for its bad camera angles, easy difficulty, and similarity to the first game. The game received an aggregate score of 79% from GameRankings, slightly lower than its predecessor. At the 2000 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, MediEvil 2 won the best console game category. Doug Trueman reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Like a Hollywood film that opens one week and hits video the next, MediEvil II is a formulaic and agreeable way to pass the time.\\" IGN's Doug Perry praised the graphical advancements of the game, noting that the sharper details drew out a more \\"sophisticated feel\\" to the story. Perry noted that the new addition of cutscenes created a better sense of continuity and story, reconstructing the game into a more controlled, broader world. Shawn Sparks of Game Revolution similarly praised the improved graphics, noting that smooth frame rates and sharper graphics brought out the original PlayStation's power, despite nearing the end of its lifespan. Sparks hailed the graphics as \\"eye candy\\" and reported that the levels were \\"a joy to explore.\\" Perry noted the game's \\"plain wide confusion\\" in level layouts would cause frustration for players, and was several times found without direction in the larger levels. Sparks also described similar concerns with the confusing level layout. Perry disliked the fixed camera positioning throughout the game and outlined that the camera was \\"good, not great\\" and only a small improvement to its predecessor. Daily Radars Stephen Frost praised the game's improved artificial intelligence and harder difficulty in comparison to the first game, summarising that MediEvil 2 was \\"better, not perfect,\\" although thought that the game was still lacking in innovation.

The film features supporting performances by Vincent Price, Raymond Burr and Charles McGraw. The direction of the film, which was based on the unpublished story \\"Star Sapphie\\" by Gerald Drayson, is credited to John Farrow.. After Farrow had turned in what he thought was the finished film, RKO studio boss Howard Hughes intervened and caused extensive re-writes, re-casting, and re-shooting under the supervision of Richard Fleischer, whom Hughes coerced into cooperation by threatening not to release The Narrow Margin, a film that Fleischer had just finished for RKO. This post- production process took a great deal of time and money, costing about the same amount - $850,000 - as the film lost at the box office in its initial release. Plot Robert Mitchum with Jane Russell in a scene from the film Down on his luck, professional gambler Dan Milner accepts a mysterious job that will take him out of the country for a year but pays $50,000. He accepts a $5,000 advance and tickets that will take him to an isolated Mexican resort, Morro's Lodge, where he will receive further instructions. Milner is attracted to the only other passenger on his chartered flight to the resort, Lenore Brent. When he arrives, Milner finds that several guests at the luxurious Baja California resort have hidden agendas. He is disappointed to find that Lenore is the girlfriend of famous movie actor Mark Cardigan. Milner overhears two guests, self-proclaimed author Martin Krafft and a man named Thompson, planning something which he suspects involves him. When Milner confronts them, he is given $10,000 and told that someone is on his way to Baja to see him. Seemingly drunk Bill Lusk flies in, despite warnings of very dangerous storm conditions. Milner thinks he must be the contact but when the two are alone, Lusk says he is an undercover agent for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. He tells Milner that the U.S. government suspects that underworld boss Nick Ferraro, deported to Italy four years earlier, is scheming to get back into the country posing as Milner. The two men are a close physical match and Milner is a loner, so no one is likely to miss him. Krafft turns out to be a plastic surgeon. Cardigan's wife Helen and his personal manager Gerald Hobson show up. She had gone to Reno to get a divorce, though not really intending to go through with it, as she is still fond of her husband. Hobson also thinks it is a poor idea because Cardigan's film contract is expiring and the bad publicity would make it hard to get a new one. With her own plans ruined, Lenore confesses to Milner that she is really just a singer looking to hook a wealthy spouse. Milner shows his softer side when he helps unhappy newlywed Jennie Stone by cheating at poker to win back her husband's gambling losses from investment broker Myron Winton. Lusk sneaks into Thompson's room but is caught and killed. Milner and Lenore stumble upon his body dumped on the beach; Milner is convinced that the dead man must have been telling the truth. That night, Thompson and his men take Milner to a yacht, recently arrived in the bay. Milner is able to pass along a veiled plea for help to Lenore. She persuades Cardigan, who is tired of just pretending to be a hero, to help out. While the actor keeps the mobsters pinned down with his hunting rifle, Milner sneaks back onto the boat, knowing that the only way out of his mess is to deal with Ferraro once and for all. He is caught and brought to the crime lord. After killing two of the thugs and wounding and capturing Thompson, Cardigan mounts a rescue with the reluctant assistance of the Mexican police and a couple of the more adventurous guests. A gunfight breaks out aboard the boat, followed by a melee. Milner manages to break free and shoot Ferraro dead. Cardigan and his wife are reconciled. Milner and Lenore end the film in a clinch. Cast Cast notes: *Robert Mitchum, who referred to himself as \\"The Tall Dog\\", called Jane Russell \\"Hard John\\" because of her strict, straitlaced religious beliefs. When a reporter questioned these in light of her image, she told the man, \\"Christians can have big breasts too.\\" Despite whatever sexual chemistry that Mitchum and Russell had on the screen, the two performers were, in fact, nothing more than friends. *The film was a rare RKO role outside of Westerns for Tim Holt.Jewell, Richard & Harbin, Vernon. (1982) The RKO Story. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. p.259 *Vincent Price threw a party on the set celebrating his one-year anniversary on His Kind of Woman. Mitchum, on the other hand, snapped on the penultimate day of shooting during a fight scene, and started fighting for real with the stunt men who were manhandling him. He destroyed the set and all the lighting and sound equipment on the sound stage, all the while cursing out everyone involved with the production. One modern source claims that in Mitchum's fight scene with Raymond Burr, Burr actually knocked out Mitchum. Production The film - which was at one stage known as Star Sapphire, the title of the unpublished story by Gerald Drayson it was based onBrady, Thomas F. (December 23, 1949) \\"Deal as Director Made by Colbert\\" The New York Times - was announced in July 1949 with Jane Russell and Robert Mitchum already attached.Hopper, Hedda (July 21. 1949). \\"Looking at Hollywood\\" Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) For Howard Hughes, who owned RKO and acted as its executive producer, Mitchum and Russell were the epitome of sexual chemistry.Muller, Eddie (January 6, 2019) Intro to the Turner Classic Movie showing of His Kind of Woman Robert Sparks was to produce and John Farrow to direct. Farrow had directed Mitchum in Where Danger Lives the year before, and the two had gotten along well. They expected His Kind of Woman to be a similar experience, shooting a straightforward adventure thriller. However, Frank Fenton and Jack Leonard, who co-write the screenplay, intended the film to be a send-up of the dark film noir crime movies which were popular at the time. The primary conduit of the comedy of the film was the character of the ham Shakespearean actor Mark Cardigan, played by Vincent Price. Filming took place in November 1950.Staff (November 12, 1950) \\"Director and Players\\" Chicago Daily Tribune In December the production was doing retakes.Brady, Thomas F.

(May 24, 1951) \\"Phyllis Thaxter Gets Movie Lead\\" The New York Times Post-production Howard Hughes, the Texas billionaire who had bought RKO Pictures in 1948, loved Vincent Price's character, and demanded of director John Farrow that it be expanded. Farrow, however, had delivered a film he believed to be finished, and refused to make Hughes' changes, leaving the production. Hughes then asked Richard Fleischer to change and reshoot the ending, estimating that the reshoot would take ten days or two weeks. Fleischer had just finished making a B movie for RKO, The Narrow Margin, which Hughes and other RKO executives thought was something special, which was the reason that Hughes had approached Fleischer. When Fleischer turned down Hughes' request to reshoot the ending of His Kind of Woman, the producer attempted to persuade him by offering Fleischer the chance to remake The Narrow Margin as an \\"A\\" film with a million dollar budget and RKO's top stars. Satisfied with the film he had made, Fleischer again refused, so Hughes then coerced his acceptance by threatening not to release The Narrow Margin at all. With Hughes having played this trump card, Fleischer gave in. Fleischer ending up reshooting most of the film during post-production, which he describes in detail in chapter five of his book Just Tell Me When To Cry. Story conferences between Hughes, Fleischer and the writer Earl Felton, began on December 3, 1950,Muller, Eddie (January 6, 2019) Outro to the Turner Classic Movie showing of His Kind of Woman and took several months to complete. Because of Hughes' obsession with the film, especially its ending, the meetings lasted 7 or 8 hours each. Hughes demanded that the film have more slapstick comedy, more death and brutality, and more fighting. He also added the character of Martin Krafft, the sadistic German plastic surgeon. Hughes wrote all of Krafft's lines, tape recorded himself saying them, and then sent the recordings to the production to ensure that the part was played exactly as his envisaged it. The changes added new action scenes on the yacht, a set of the bridge of which had been built for the original production. As action sequences were added in the rewrite, this set was expanded bit by bit to a set for a full size 150-foot yacht, including interiors. The yacht set was in a very large water tank on Stage 22 of the RKO Culver City lot, the biggest sound stage in Hollywood. A new scene involved the sinking of a rowing boat; \\"After the boat reached a certain point, it had to sink fairly slowly, the water coming up to the chins of the smallest seated soldiers\\". This required that the tank with the yacht set be emptied, have a portion rebuilt to deepen it to accommodate the sinking as scripted and be refilled. Another new scene involved a massive brawl.Staff (June 10, 1951) \\"28 stunt men required for mass movie brawl\\" Chicago Daily Tribune After two months of shooting and a month of editing, an hour and 20 minutes of new material had been added to the film. When Hughes viewed the new material, he decided that he did not like the original actor playing the character Ferraro, Lee Van Cleef, and ordered the scenes reshot. Robert J. Wilke was chosen for the reshoot after a careful search and screen tests; this second reshoot involved nearly every scene of the new material and a number of scenes earlier in the picture. Three quarters of the way through this second reshoot, Hughes saw Raymond Burr in a film and ordered Ferraro's scenes reshot again, this time using Burr in the part. In total, the reshooting of the film cost about $850,000 to complete - which, coincidentally was approximately the amount of money which the film lost in its initial 1951 release. Promotion Hughes promoted the film with a giant firework-shooting billboard featuring Mitchum and Russell that spanned Wilshire Boulevard, proclaiming the two as \\"the hottest combination to ever hit the screen\\". The same image of the two actors later caused problems in London, as it was decided that too much of Russell's cleavage was showing. Release and reception His Kind of Woman was released a year after original director John Farrow had delivered the supposedly completed film. Box office The film recorded a loss of $825,000.Jewell, Richard B. (2016) Slow Fade to Black: The Decline of RKO Radio Pictures, Berkeley, California: University of California Press Critical response In a review of the film, the staff at Variety magazine lauded the pairing of Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell as the lead characters, writing, > \\"[The] two strike plenty of sparks in their meetings as each waits out plot > development ... Both Mitchum and Russell score strongly. Russell's full > charms are fetchingly displayed in smart costumes that offer the minimum of > protection.

Last accessed: > January 15, 2008. Critic Dennis Schwartz called the film, \\"An oddball tongue-in-cheek crime thriller, filled with ad-libs, from Howard Hughes' RKO studio that strays from its conventional film noir plot to try its hand at comedy\\". Schwartz also appreciated the acting, writing, \\"It's a part where Mitchum is perfectly at home with being a loner anti-hero and Russell is perfectly cast as the bouncy 'his kind of woman', who in the last shot kisses him while his pants are being scorched by the iron--a perfect metaphor to end on\\".Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, December 15, 2004. Last accessed: January 15, 2008. Linda Rasmussen liked Mitchum's performance but as a film noir proper gave the film a lackluster review, \\"As a serious film-noir thriller, it lacks suspense and depth. However, the film has its moments, and Robert Mitchum is in his element as the loner anti-hero\\".Rasmussen, Linda. . Last accessed: January 15, 2008. Jane Russell later said \\"It was a good film until they took John Farrow off and put in this nonsense at the end, the gore and [hypodermic] needles\\".

Before the forgery came out Tjerk Vermaning was a well-respected collector who in 1966 received the Cultural Prize of Drenthe for his contributions to furthering the understanding of the prehistoric heritage of the province. On 18 March 1975, however, he was arrested on a forgery charge. The accusations were made by the province of Drenthe, based on the findings of archeologists professor Tjalling Waterbolk and his associate Dick Stapert of the University of Groningen. An arduous court case followed, in which several well-known Dutch and European professional archaeologists (including German archaeologist ) supported the accusations. Several amateur archaeologists, on the other hand, were convinced of Vermaning's innocence and mounted their own campaign to get him acquitted. Vermaning was initially found guilty of fraud and was sentenced to one month in prison in 1977, but he appealed the verdict. In 1978 Vermaning was acquitted on appeal because it had not been proven, in the eyes of the judge, that he had himself forged the artefacts in question. Despite Vermaning's acquittal, consensus among professional archaeologists was and is that the artefacts are not authentic. Vermaning felt that as a result of the court case his integrity had been shattered, and he remained bitter about the affair and resentful toward academic archaeology for the rest of his life. For years or even decades the Vermaning affair strained the relations between Dutch amateur and professional archaeologists, especially in the northern region where Vermaning had been active.

The album combines traditional Swedish folk music with classical, pop und jazz influences. Out of the 14 tracks on the album, 12 are instrumentals and two (\\"V√•r sista dans\\" and \\"L√§tt som en sommarfj√§ril\\") feature vocals by Helen Sj√∂holm, who played the role of Kristina in the musical Kristina fr√•n Duvem√•la, written by Benny and former ABBA colleague Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus. Bj√∂rn is credited on this album as well, writing the lyrics for the two tracks mentioned above. All music is composed by Benny Andersson, who also produced the album himself. The album was recorded on two weekends in the spring of 2001 at Atlantis Studio in Stockholm. This studio, formerly known as Metronome Studio, was the location of many recording sessions for ABBA up until 1976. According to Benny (the \\"Kapellm√§staren\\", as he calls himself in the booklet), the recording of the album was \\"live\\", which means that all the instruments (including Helen Sj√∂holm's vocals) were recorded at the same time, in one session. Only slight changes were made afterwards, when the album was finally mixed at Benny's Mono Music Studios.\\"Benny Anderssons Orkester\\", booklet Various recordings from this album have also been included on movie soundtracks. The movie S√•nger fr√•n andra v√•ningen by Roy Andersson includes \\"S√•ng fr√•n andra v√•ningen\\", \\"Laureen\\" and \\"T√∂sabiten\\", and the movie Nu √§r pappa tr√∂tt igen by Marie-Louise Ekman features \\"Cirkus finemang\\" and \\"P.S.\\". The song \\"Briggens bl√•√∂gda blonda kapten\\" is a tribute to G√∂rel Hanser (the \\"blue-eyed, blonde captain\\", as the title puts it), who has worked together with Benny and ABBA since the 1970s. Until today she is responsible for the business aspects of a lot of Benny's productions. One of the biggest ones is the \\"Briggen Teaterproduktion\\",Briggen Teater, official website. http://www.briggenteater.se/ which is responsible for the three musical projects of Benny and Bj√∂rn: Kristina fr√•n Duvem√•la, Chess and Mamma Mia!. The album's opening number, \\"Hardangervidda\\", is named after the famous Hardangervidda mountain plateau in Norway. Both vocal tracks on the album were later re-recorded with English lyrics. Benny Anderssons Orkester themselves released an English version of their 2001 hit \\"V√•r sista dans\\" in 2009 on their compilation album Story of a Heart, entitled \\"(If This Is) Our Last Dance\\" (\\"our last dance\\" being the literal translation of \\"v√•rs sista dans\\"). Just like on the original version, Helen Sj√∂holm again contributed the vocals. The other song, \\"L√§tt som en sommarfj√§ril\\", was recorded by Swedish mezzo- soprano Anne Sofie von Otter and released in 2006 on her album I Let the Music Speak, her tribute to the compositions of Benny Andersson. The lyrics for both English language versions were again written by Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus.

For example, a crane with a design load of 20 tons is designed to be able to lift loads that weigh 20 tons or less. However, when a failure could be catastrophic, such as a crane dropping its load or collapsing entirely, a factor of safety is necessary. As a result, the crane should lift about 2 to 5 tons at the most. In structural design, a design load is greater than the load which the system is expected to support. This is because engineers incorporate a safety factor in their design, in order to ensure that the system will be able to support at least the expected loads (called specified loads, despite any problems with construction, materials, etc. that go unnoticed during construction.

This film was marketed as a sequel to Bruce Lee's last and only partially completed film Game of Death. Bruce Lee died some years before the production of Game of Death II and most of his scenes are taken from Lee's older films, mostly Enter the Dragon. Aside from the international English dub giving the \\"Bruce Lee\\" character the name Billy Lo, this movie appears to have no connection with Robert Clouse's 1978 version of Game of Death. Plot After a recent number of challenges, Billy Lo (Bruce Lee) and his friend Chin Ku (Huong Cheng Li) begin to suspect that someone wants them dead. Billy later visits his younger brother Bobby (Tong Lung), who is studying with Billy's former teacher, and leaves him a book on Jeet Kune Do. Chin is soon killed and Billy goes to Japan to find his stepdaughter, May. May tells him that Chin had visited just before his death, and left a film for her. They are suddenly attacked, but Billy manages to escape with the film. A few days later Billy attends Chin's funeral, where he is turned away from viewing the body. A helicopter arrives during the burial and steals the coffin away. Trying to prevent the theft, Billy is carried up with the casket but falls to his death. Bobby Lo is told of Billy's death by their father, who tells him to find a man named Sherman Lan and avenge his brother. Sherman gives him the film, which shows Chin Ku at the Palace of Death. The Palace of Death is run by a crazed martial arts expert by the name of Lewis (Roy Horan). Any challenger who fails to defeat Lewis is fed to his pack of lions. Bobby decides to meet Lewis, who is impressed with Bobby's abilities. While investigating the Palace, Bobby is attacked by a masked man. Then he informs Lewis that someone is trying to kill him. Later that night, a woman is sent to Bobby's room to seduce and assassinate him. When she fails, one of Lewis' lions attacks Bobby. During the fight, the masked man appears and kills Lewis. Suspecting Lewis' valet, Bobby seeks him out at the Fan Yu temple, where the underground Tower of Death is rumored to be. After defeating the valet, Bobby spies the secret entrance into the tower. Battling his way through the tower he eventually confronts the operator, Chin Ku. Chin is the head of a global drug trafficking organization and staged his own death to throw off Interpol investigators. He tried to frame Lewis for his death and arranged for the coffin to be stolen to prevent it from being searched. Realizing the only way to defeat Chin's sword skills is with Billy's Jeet Kune Do, Bobby cold-heartedly uses Chin's sword, impales Chin's bodyguard monk (Lee Hoi-San) and Chin together, finally killing Chin and stopping his drug operation. Deleted scenes Deleted scenes are available on DVD in both the international and English version as a special feature in Hong Kong Legends. One particular scene in the Chinese version of Game of Death, directed by Sammo Hung, was intended for his Asian audiences. In the Chinese version, Hung replaced the action scene in the opera house with another scene from the glasshouse at night with Casanova Wong in his karate clothes. The new fight scene, particularly the flips between Tong Lung and Yuen Biao, is reminiscent of Bruce Lee's fighting style. \\\\- Versions Much like the original Game of Death, there are several versions of Game of Death II. * The first main version is the original Hong Kong version, titled Tower of Death (Ê≠ª‰∫°Â°î). Most of this version's music was sourced from Les Baxter's score for The Dunwich Horror. This was approximately 86 minutes long, and is the version used in the U.K. Hong Kong Legends DVD. * The second main version is the international English-dubbed version, retitled as Game of Death II. This does not remove any footage, but instead uses Bruce Lee and Lee-related stock footage to create new scenes, the most prominent being the above-mentioned greenhouse fight with Casanova Wong. Other scenes include a childhood montage of Billy Lo, taken from Lee's childhood films, and a funeral dedication, which uses footage from Bruce Lee's real funeral. However, it is done more tastefully than its use in Game of Death, since it appears as more of a real tribute to Lee than a movie funeral. The international version also includes a proper end credits montage. This version is more widely available than the original version, even appearing in the Hong Kong Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection DVD set. * The third version is an extremely rare official South Korean print of the film. This uses more footage of the Korean actors Kim Tai-chung and Hwang Jang-lee (including an extended version of the sword demonstration with Hwang's character), while downplaying the Bruce Lee angle by cutting most of the stock footage of Lee.

K.,\\" was an American businessman, pharmaceutical industrialist, and philanthropist who became president and chairman of the board of Eli Lilly and Company, the pharmaceutical firm his father, Colonel Eli Lilly, founded in 1876. Josiah, the colonel's sole heir, began working at his father‚Äôs company at the age of fourteen. He graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science and became superintendent of the Lilly laboratories in 1882 and company president in 1898. Under his leadership, the company introduced standardized manufacturing processes, expanded its sales force, and increased its research efforts to develop new drugs. Eli Lilly and Company grew into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Lilly‚Äôs eldest son, Eli Jr., succeeded him as president in 1932. His younger son, Josiah Jr. (\\"Joe\\"), succeeded Eli as company president in 1948. J. K. served as chairman of the board from 1932 until his death in 1948. Lilly was also a philanthropist who supported the projects of charitable and civic organizations in Indianapolis and in Indiana. Lily and his two sons established the Lilly Endowment in 1937 with Eli Lilly and Company stock valued as $280,000. It became one of the largest charitable foundations in the world, and today continues the Lilly family's legacy of philanthropy. Lilly also amassed a significant collection of composer Stephen Foster's music and Foster memorabilia, which he donated to the University of Pittsburgh in 1937. Early life and education Josiah Kirby Lilly, the only son and heir of Eli Lilly, a pharmacist, and Emily (n√©e Lemen) Lilly, was born on November 18, 1861, in Greencastle, Indiana. Eli, who enlisted in the Union army in 1861 and was later promoted to colonel, was away at war at the time of his son's birth. Josiah's father returned home before reenlisting and first saw him in 1863. Josiah, later called \\"J. K.\\" had an \\"unsettled childhood.\\" Because of his father's business interests, he frequently moved. Colonel Lilly remained in the South after the American Civil War, relocating his family to a Mississippi cotton plantation in 1865. Josiah and his parents were stricken with a mosquito-born disease, probably malaria, in 1866. Josiah and his father recovered, but his mother died on August 20, 1866, eight months pregnant with a second son, who was stillborn. Josiah's devastated father abandoned the plantation and let it fall into disrepair. Colonel Lilly filed bankruptcy in 1868. In the meantime Josiah returned Greencastle and lived with his grandparents, Gustavus and Esther Lilly, while his father attempted to reverse his financial difficulties and find other employment. Josiah's father found work as a pharmacist and drugstore proprietor in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, before opening a pharmacy in Paris, Illinois. Colonel Lilly married Maria Cynthia Sloan in 1869, and young Josiah soon joined his father and stepmother in Illinois, where they remained until the family moved to Indianapolis in 1873.Madison, p. 6. On May 10, 1876, Colonel Lilly founded his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business, which became known as Eli Lilly and Company, at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis. Josiah, who was aged fourteen at the time was among its first employees. He had quit school to work in the laboratory of his father's company as an apprentice and errand boy. Within a few years Eli Lilly and Company became a very successful business that was known for manufacturing high-quality prescription drugs, especially gelatin- and sugar-coated pills and capsules and fruit-flavored elixirs. By 1879 company sales had grown to $48,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars).Price, Indiana Legends, p. 57. In 1880 Colonel Lilly sent Josiah to the Philadelphia School of Pharmacy (now known as the University of the Sciences) to increase his son's technical expertise so he could help develop the family business. Josiah graduated from the school in 1882, and returned to Indianapolis, where his father soon named him superintendent of the Lilly manufacturing laboratory, a position that J. K. held until in 1898 when he became company president. Marriage and family During his college years, J. K. met and became engaged to Lilly Ridgley of Lexington, Kentucky. The couple married on November 18, 1882. Their eldest son, Eli Jr., was born on April 1, 1885, at the family's home on North Tennessee Street (renamed Capitol Street on 1895). When Eli was about eight years old the family moved to a home on North Pennsylvania Street, where a second son, Josiah Jr. (Joe), was born on September 25, 1893. J. K. acquired of property north of Indianapolis in what became the Crows Nest neighborhood in 1928. His wife, Lilly, who suffered from pernicious anemia, eventually became an invalid and died on April 19, 1934. In 1935 seventy-three-year-old J. K. married Lila Allison Humes, a fifty-one- year-old widow. Lila was also the sister of Ruth Allison Lilly, Eli Jr.‚Äôs wife.Madison, pp. 6‚Äì7, 79, 83‚Äì84. J. K. and Lila had no children. She died in 1971. In addition to their main residence in Indianapolis, the Lilly family maintained a cottage at Lake Wawasee in Kosciusko County, Indiana. J. K.'s father had built one of the summer resort‚Äôs first cottages from 1886‚Äì87 and founded the Wawasee Golf Club in 1891. J. K. built his own family cottage, called Anchors Aweigh, on the Lilly‚Äôs lakeside estate across the road from the golf club from 1936‚Äì 38.Madison, p. 84. J. K. also established an apple orchard on property he purchased in 1896, north of downtown Indianapolis, at Seventy-First Street and College Avenue. In 1927 Lilly had a Tudor Revival- style, private performance hall built in the orchard and had a custom-built pipe organ installed. He initially named the building Melodeon Hall, but renamed it Foster Hall in the 1930s as a tribute to composer Stephen Foster. In the mid-1960s the Lilly family donated the property, including the music hall, to the Park School for boys. The present-day Park Tudor School is located on the property and continues to use the hall.\\"Historical Background and Significance\\" in From Career=Early career In the early 1880s, while J. K. was superintendent of Eli Lilly and Company's laboratory, it began manufacturing Succus Alterans, a treatment for venereal disease, types of rheumatism, and skin diseases that became the company's first widely successful product. The growing company rapidly expanded, adding new employees and relocating to larger quarters in a complex of buildings at McCarty and Alabama Streets, south of downtown Indianapolis, in 1881.Madison, p. 27. By 1890, when J. K. became de facto head of the company, it had grown into one of the largest in Indiana and had several hundred employees. Among Lilly's employees were his young sons, Eli and Joe, who ran errands and performed other odd jobs after school. Around 1890 J. K. assumed day-to-day management of the business and Colonel Lilly retired to focus on charitable and civic pursuits. Under J. K.'s leadership the company flourished, despite the tumultuous economic conditions of the 1890s. It survived an economic recession and continued to grow as it made several successful technological advances in its manufacturing processes, such as automation of its capsule production, and focused on research and mass production of high-quality, medicinal drugs.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 540. Company president After Colonel Lilly died in 1898, J. K became president of the family's pharmaceutical business and heir to the family fortune. J. K. continued to grow the business, which saw considerable growth during the 1910s. The company continued to advance production automation, while its research department made small advances.Madison, pp. 6, 30‚Äì32. During his tenure as president, the company introduced standardized manufacturing processes, expanded the company's sales force, and increased research efforts to develop new drugs.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 913. One of its most significant projects occurred in 1922 when he signed an agreement on behalf of the company to form a partnership with a Toronto firm, Connaught Anti-toxin Laboratories, that resulted in the first commercial, mass-production of insulin. The Lilly company's trademarked name for its new product was Iletin, which it began to distribute in 1923.Madison, pp. 57‚Äì62, 91. Lilly's two sons followed their father into the family business. His eldest son, Eli, succeeded him as president in 1932; J.K. continued as its chairman of the board and focused more of his time on philanthropy. Following J. K's death in 1948, Eli became chairman of the board (1948‚Äì53 and 1966‚Äì69) and honorary chairman (1953‚Äì66 and 1969‚Äì77); J. K.'s younger son and namesake, Josiah Jr. (Joe), served as president (1948‚Äì53) and chairman of the board (1953‚Äì66).Madison, pp.83, 91, 120, 208, 249‚Äì50. Later years In the 1930s, after his retirement from day- to-day operations of Eli Lilly and Company, J. K. pursued several personal and philanthropic interests. He became an orchid breeder and began collecting Stephen Foster music compositions and Foster memorabilia. He maintained his extensive collection at Melodeon Hall (renamed Foster Hall), his private performance hall and library in Indianapolis.Madison, p. 83. Philanthropist Lilly was \\"a lifelong benefactor\\" to Indianapolis and active in many philanthropic organizations, including the Indianapolis Commercial Club, the local YMCA, Crown Hill Cemetery, the Indiana Historical Society, and the James Whitcomb Riley Memorial Association. J. K. served as board chairman of the Indianapolis Foundation and supported the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, the city's Community Fund, Tuberculosis Association, Wheeler Rescue Mission, and the Red Cross. Lilly also served as a trustee of Purdue University and the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy. He was a member of the Orchid Society of California.Madison, pp. 189‚Äì90. Lilly Endowment In 1937 Lilly and his sons, Eli and Joe, founded the Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment with an initial contribution of Eli Lilly and Company stock valued at $280,000. J. K. served on the board and became its largest contributor, while his son, Eli, managed the private family endowment for its first twelve years. Over time J. K. made contributions of Eli and Lilly Company stock worth a total of $86.8 million, including a $30 million bequest following his death in 1948; his two sons contributed stock with a combined value of $6.8 million. In 1998 the Lilly Endowment became the largest philanthropic endowment in the world in terms of assets (estimated value of $15.4 billion) and charitable giving. Others have surpassed it, but it remains among the top five, as of 2014, in terms of total assets ($9.96 billion).Madison, pp. 206‚Äì07. Music collection Lilly was known for his extensive collection of composer Steven Foster's music. In December 1933, he published Foster Hall Reproductions, a collection of 224 facsimiles of Foster's sheet music. The publication has been described as the first Gesamtausgaben (\\"collected works\\") of an American musical artist.Whitmer, pp. 330‚Äì31. According to author Mariana Whitmer in American Music, Lilly's response to what he viewed as a \\"small and distorted\\" sample of Foster recordings, led to his commission of Foster Hall Recordings, a ninety-six-disc set that contained \\"the complete works of Stephen Foster as ... known in 1933.\\"Whitmer, p. 335. Lilly donated his Foster Hall collection to the University of Pittsburgh in 1937. Fletcher Hodges Jr., whom Lilly hired to help with the Foster collection, curated the university's Foster archive at its Stephen Foster Memorial for fifty-one years. The archival collection contained approximately 30,000 documents as of 2006. Death and legacy Lilly died on February 8, 1948, at the age of eighty-six. His estate was valued at $6.5 million at the time of his death.Madison, pp. 84, 119‚Äì20. He is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. Lilly's son, Eli, donated his father's home in Indianapolis's Crows Nest neighborhood, as well as his own to Indiana University. Eli also provided the university with a $1 million endowment to maintain the two properties.Madison, pp. 264‚Äì65. J. K.'s legacy at Eli Lilly and Company included the introduction of uniform standards for manufacturing products, a significant increase its sales staff (more than 500 percent), and establishing its first branch offices in New York and New Orleans. In 1905, during his tenure as president, the company reached $1 million in sales. Lilly's son, Eli, joined the family business in 1907, and succeeded J. K. as company president in 1932. Lilly's son, Joe, joined the firm in 1914 and succeeded his brother, Eli, as company president in 1948.Madison, pp. 21, 23, 37, 91, 208. In 1921, during J. K.'s tenure as president, Eli Lilly and Company obtained the rights to mass produce insulin, in cooperation with University of Toronto scientists, once the production methods were perfected and approved.Madison, pp. 56‚Äì57. The product's debut in 1923, while his son, Eli Jr. was company president, began an era of numerous new product introductions and manufacturing improvements that increased company profits and achieved the company national and international recognition.Madison, pp. 62‚Äì63. Eli Lilly and Company grew into one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Under J.K. Lilly's leadership, as well as his two sons and their successors, the company developed many new innovations, including advancements in the mass production of medicines, the pioneering development of insulin during the 1920s, mass production of penicillin during the 1940s, and polio vaccine in the 1950s.Madison, pp. 56‚Äì57, 106‚Äì08, 110, 253. In later years the company introduced innovations in antibiotics, such as Ceclor, and antidepressants, such as Prozac, and diversified into agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, and beauty products, among other product lines. According to Forbes, it ranked as the 243rd largest public company in the world in 2016, with sales of $20 billion and a market value of $86 billion (USD). J. K.'s legacy is also evident in his company‚Äôs charitable work. He established the Lilly tradition of providing aid to disaster victims. While he was company president, Eli Lilly and Company sent medicine and supplies to the victims of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. He also set a company precedent in 1919 that continued during the Great Depression. Instead of layoffs, which most companies did to cut expenses, Lilly's company reduced employee work hours, but increased wages to compensate for the loss of income. One of J.K.'s and his two sons' greatest legacies was the establishment of the Lilly Endowment in 1937. In 1998 the family's charitable foundation became the largest philanthropic endowment in the world in terms of assets and charitable giving. As of 2014, it ranked fifth on a list of the largest charitable foundations in total assets ($9.96 billion) and ranked twenty-first in total giving ($333.6 million). Honors and tributes Lilly was the recipient of the Remington medal in 1942, which was awarded to and individual who \\"contributed most during the year to the advancement of the profession of pharmacy or whose contributions over a period of years are worthy of recognition,\\" . Lilly is featured in the Indiana Historical Society exhibition, \\"You Are There: Eli Lilly at the Beginning,\\" at the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indianapolis. The exhibition (October 1, 2016, to January 20, 2018) includes a recreation of the first Lilly laboratory on Pearl Street in Indianapolis and a costumed interpreter portraying a teenaged J. K. Lilly.

Club history The club was originally formed by Ted & Maureen Riley after they viewed a Rugby league International game between Australia and New Zealand at Olympic Park in 1991 which left them wondering if Rugby League could take off in the Victorian township of Sunbury. They then placed an advertisement in the local paper looking for other interested parties and on 17 September 1991 the first meeting of the club was held with twenty-six members. The members originally applied to the Victorian Rugby League for membership in 1991 but couldn't afford the entry fee to begin a club so had to wait until 1992 when the club became officially formed. It commenced its playing in what was known as the Rebel league and in 1994 began with one senior reserve grade team in the VRL Competition. In 1995, the Club started its First Grade team and 6 junior teams. Since 1992 and including 2016, the club has gone on to register a total of 613 senior players. The club (Known then as the Sunbury Cougars) played in their first First Grade grand final in 2000. A defeat at the hands of St Kilda. Many Sunbury locals were members of that grand final side with the community really getting behind the club's sudden rise under coach, Richard Puke. The Tigers won their first premiership in 2009, beating Casey Sharks 48‚Äì18 in the VRL grand final. 2011 saw the Tigers win their 2nd premiership in 3 years against the North West Wolves in overtime 32‚Äì26. In 2013 they won their 3rd Grand final against Altona Roosters 36‚Äì16 and in 2014, they won their 4th against a revamped Casey Warriors 48‚Äì16. At this stage the Sunbury Tigers have won four of the last eight premierships and may claim to be the current powerhouse of Victorian rugby league, as Altona Roosters and St Kilda Saints were before them.http://www.melbournestorm.com.au/default.aspx?s=article- display&id;=381&vrl---grand-final-reports; Sunbury United Club History file This season,2016, the Junior and Senior Club's merged into one body again, retaining the name Sunbury United Rugby League Club Inc.

She flew a total of 277 sorties that included liaison, reconnaissance and ground-attack missions before she became a prisoner-of-war when her Il-2 was shot down. She was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union in 1965.  Early years  A postal stationery envelope issued to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Anna Yegorova (Timofeeva). Post of Russia, 2016. Anna Yegorova was born into a peasant family in the village Volodovo (now in Tver Oblast). Eight of her fifteen siblings died when they were infants. Her father, Aleksandr Yegorov, fought in the First World War as well as the Russian Civil War as a Bolshevist. Combat stress and other hardships deteriorated his health, and in 1925 he died at 49 years of age. After seven years of school, Yegorova joined Mosmetrostroy, where she worked as a steelman, and then as a tiler on the construction of Krasnye Vorota station. Her construction job allowed her to study at the Mosmetrostroy aeroclub. In 1938, she was recommended to attend the Ulyanovsk flight school, but was soon expelled due to her brother's arrest as an \\"enemy of the people\\". After her expulsion, Yegorova worked as a bookkeeper's assistant at a weaving factory in Smolensk, while tutoring members of the factory's aero club. She was then sent to attend the Kherson flight school, which she graduated from in 1939. Soon afterwards, Yegorova became a flight instructor for the Kalinin municipal aero club.  Military career  After the start of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the USSR by Germany, Yegorova volunteered for combat service. From 1941 to 1942, Yegorova flew 236 reconnaissance and delivery missions for the 130th Air Liaison Squadron in a Polikarpov Po-2, and was subsequently awarded the Order of the Red Banner for distinguished service. After an aircrash, which was determined to be pilot error, Yegorova was transferred to a training air regiment. In 1943, Yegorova was transferred to the 805th Attack Aviation Regiment and flew 41 missions in the Ilyushin Il-2. These missions included the battles above the Taman Peninsula, Crimea, and Poland. During a mission on 22 August 1944, while in an attack formation of ten aircraft over the Magnuszew bridgehead near Warsaw, Yegorova's plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire. Her gunner, Yevdokiya \\"Dusya\\" Alekseyevna Nazarkina was killed in the attack. With her gunner killed, and the plane heavily damaged, Yegorova exited the aircraft while the plane was inverted, and suffered serious thermal burns. Yegorova's parachute only partially opened, and was seriously wounded again upon landing. Yegorova was captured by the German Army and taken to a prisoner of war camp where her wounds were treated by Dr. Georgy Sinyakov. Back at her air base, Yegorova was presumed dead and was recommended for the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, but she did not receive the title until 1965. On 31 January 1945, Soviet forces overran the K√ºstrin prisoner camp where she was being held. Yegorova was interrogated as a potential traitor for eleven days at an NKVD filtration camp for returning Soviet prisoners. Eventually, she was released from custody, but was discharged into the reserve soon after.  Postwar  After being discharged from the armed forces she married Vyacheslav Timofeev, the commander of her air division, and bore two sons named Pyotr and Igor. She was the subject of a feature article in the Literaturnaya Gazeta in 1961, and in 1965, she was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

The song, performed by Helen Sj√∂holm and featuring vocals by Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus, has broken several Svensktoppen records. Du √§r min man entered the chart in early July 2004 and stayed there for a breathtaking 278 weeks, until December 2009. Moreover, it topped the charts on several occasions and in total stayed on top of Svensktoppen for 65 weeks.Svensktoppen, Archiv. http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2023&artikel;=454888. Retrieved on 6 June 2011. No other song, either before or after, has even come close to these records. Two English versions have been recorded of Du √§r min man, both being titled You Are My Man, which also is the literal translation of the Swedish title. The only differences between those two versions are the lyrics, which are varying at same places, but in total have the same concept. The first version of You Are My Man was recorded for promotional use, when Benny Anderssons orkester went to Minnesota to do some concerts in 2005. The second and official version was recorded in 2009 for the compilation album Story Of A Heart, which also includes three other tracks from \\"BAO!\\": \\"Glasgow Boogie\\", \\"Bed Of Roses\\" (\\"En dans p√• rosor\\") and \\"Jehu\\" (all of which being instrumentals). Besides performing three solo numbers on \\"BAO!\\", Helen Sj√∂holm can also be heard on two duets. The first one is called \\"Midnattsdans\\" and is performed together with Kalle Moraeus, member of Benny Anderssons orkester and folk-group Orsa Spelm√§n. The song was also released on single, but due to the ongoing popularity of Du √§r min man, which was still topping the charts by then, it fail to chart and was not even tested for Svensktoppen. Since 2004, the song gets performed on all tours of Benny Anderssons orkester in a funny and humorous way.

He was a pioneer in the area of technical thermodynamics and its applications and published his book Die Dampfturbine (the steam turbine) in 1903. In addition to the thermodynamic issues involved in turbine design the book discussed aspects of fluid flow, vibration, stress analysis of plates, shells and rotating discs and stress concentrations at holes and fillets.Rao, S., \\"Mechanical Vibrations\\", Addison-Wesley, Wokingham, England, Third Edition, 1995. Stodola was a professor of mechanical engineering at the Swiss Polytechnical Institute (now ETH) in Zurich. He maintained friendly contact with Albert Einstein. In 1892, Stodola founded the Laboratory for Energy Conversion.  Biography  The birthplace in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈° (Slovakia) Aurel Stodola was born in Vrbica-Hu≈°t√°k (now a part of Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°), in the Kingdom of Hungary (now in Slovakia) on 11 May 1859. His father Ondrej Stodola was a leather manufacturer. His mother was Anna (born Kov√°ƒçov√°). He was baptized as Aurel Bohuslav, but he used just name Aurel. He was baptized by the famous person of the Slovak emancipation movement, Protestant priest, poet, linguist, and representative of the Slovak national movement in 1840s Michal Miloslav Hod≈æa.  Education  He attended a local primary school in Vrbica, Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°. After first four years, he went to town called Str√°≈æe pod Tatrami (now Poprad) in order to improve his German. There was a strong German speaking community and this practice was very usual. He attended secondary education in Levoƒça, Ke≈æmarok and Ko≈°ice, where he completed his secondary schooling. He studied on his own, as well. Especially classics and other languages. In 1876, he moved to Budapest, where he studied two semesters at the Royal Jeseph University in Budapest. He was acknowledged as gifted student and he received a grant. In 1876, he transferred to the Eidgen√∂ssische Polytechnische Schule (Federal Polytechnic School), today known as the ETH. In 1881, he completed his degree in Mechanical Engineering. After graduation, he went to work in a factory in Budapest for seven months. In 1882/1883, he attended The TH Charlottenburg (Royal Technical Higher School of Charlottenburg) in Berlin. After this, he did volunteering in a technical studio in Paris. He wanted to improve his skills and French, as well. It was important for his future career in Switzerland. After this trip, he began to work in Prague as engineer. He improved his practical engineering and soon became a main engineer.  Z√ºrich  Aurel Stodola circa 1905 In 1892, he was appointed Professor of Machine Construction by the Polytechnikum in Z√ºrich. He worked and taught at Polytechnikum until his retirement in 1929. He gave his first lecture on 23 October 1892. Stodola provided stimuli in the development of the curriculum and the construction of the first machine laboratory (now Laboratory for Energy Conversion). It was opened in 1900. He was invited as evaluator to The Exposition Universelle in Paris, during the same year. He was awarded Swiss citizenship in 1905. In 1924 he endowed a foundation with the stated aim ‚Äòto promote the development of mechanical and electro-technical science in the ETH‚Äô. This foundation still exists today. He maintained friendly contact with academics in Switzerland and abroad, including Albert Einstein. Einstein wrote him an impressive letter for his anniversary. Einstein was not his student, as some sources say, because he studied physics and mathematics. Another prominent friend was theologian, organist, writer, humanitarian, philosopher, and physician Albert Schweizer. Stodola encouraged Swiss businessmen to support Schweitzer's hospital in Africa. Stodola retired at the age of 70. Then, he did not teach, but he carried on as expert and advisor. He was interested in Theoretical physics and philosophy, as well. In 1931, he published his book about philosophy of technology ‚ÄòGedanken zu einer Weltanschauung vom Standpunktedes Ingenieurs‚Äô (‚ÄòThoughts of a worldview from the standpoint of the engineer‚Äô). The title of the fourth and fifth edition was Die geheimnisvolle Naturweltanschauliche Betrachtung. It was his contribution to social, political and technological issues of his time. This book was reprinted several times and made a significant contribution to the technical philosophy in Europe. Stodola's farewell lecture is also included in this publication. In 1939, he led a team at Brown Boveri in the first test worldwide using a gas turbine to generate electricity. This machine is still exhibited today at the Alstom works in Birr and due to its importance is considered to be an ‚Äòhistorical milestone in mechanical engineering‚Äô. He died on December 25, 1942 in Zurich. His remains were moved to his birthplace in 1989 because the ETH denied paying for his grave. Steam and gas turbines Aurel Stodola and the first test worldwide using a gas turbine to generate electricity at Brown, Boveri. In 1903, one of his major textbooks ‚ÄòDie Dampfturbine‚Äô (the Steam Turbine) was first published. This was translated into several languages and formed a groundbreaking basis for the construction of thermal turbo-machinery. The Law of the Ellipse, or Stodola's cone law, provides a method for calculating the highly nonlinear dependence of extraction pressures with a flow for multistage turbine with high backpressure, when the turbine nozzles are not choked. It is important in turbine off-design calculations. Stodola's book Steam and Gas Turbines () was cited by Soviet rocket scientist Fridrikh Tsander in the 1920s. Published in English in 1927 and reprinted many times up to 1945, it was a basic reference for engineers working on the first generation of jet propulsion engines in the United States.Dawson, V.P., Engines and Innovation: Lewis Laboratory and American Propulsion Technology. NASA SP-4306, 1991. Stodola worked closely with industries on the development of the first practical gas turbines, in particular Brown, Boveri & Cie, who built the first gas turbine-powered electric generator in 1939.Early Gas Turbine History at web.mit.edu Medical equipment Stodola circa 1930 In 1915‚Äì1916 Stodola collaborated with Ferdinand Sauerbruch a German surgeon to develop an advanced mechanically driven prosthetic arm. This collaboration marked one of the first documented examples of a surgeon and engineer merging efforts.

The drink was first made by a bartender of Brooks's Club in London in 1861 to mourn the death of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's Prince Consort. It is supposed to symbolize the black or purple cloth armbands worn by mourners. It was said that ‚Äúeven the champagne should be in mourning.‚Äù Today, the drink is not exclusive to mourning. Preparation A Black Velvet is made by mixing equal parts of stout and Champagne or cider without ice. Traditionally, the Black Velvet is served in a beer tankard. Layered variation A Black Velvet can also be made by filling a champagne flute halfway with sparkling wine and floating the chilled stout beer on top of the wine. The differing densities of the liquids cause them to remain largely in separate layers (as in a pousse-caf√©). This gives the cocktail a unique two- coloured appearance. The effect is best achieved by pouring the stout over a spoon turned upside down over the top of the glass. This ensures that the liquid runs gently down the sides of the glass rather than mixing with the lower layer. Similar drinks *When cider or perry is used in place of the more expensive champagne, it is still known as a Black Velvet in its originating country (the UK). Outside of the UK, the cider version is sometimes referred to as a Poor Man's Black Velvet. *In Germany, a version of the drink made with Schwarzbier (a dark lager) and served in a beer stein or beer mug is called a \\"Bismarck.\\" According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the \\"Iron Chancellor\\" supposedly drank it by the gallon. *A variation called Velluto Italiano ‚Äì Italian Velvet ‚Äì substitutes two parts Birra Moretti La Rossa as the grain component and one part Prosecco as the grape component. The drink was developed to span the range between sweeter cider and dryer champagne variations while taking advantage of the increased interest in Prosecco in the United States. *The Champagne Velvet appeared in Jacob Grohusko's 1910 cocktail guide Jack's Manual, and called for equal parts cold porter and champagne, stirred slowly in a goblet. *In Quebec, Canada, similar to the Black Velvet but with an additional layer, the Bien Jojay is made of cider, white beer and Guinness.https://pubmccarold.com/en/drinks/ Bien JoJay References Category:Cocktails with beer Category:Cocktails with wine Category:Cocktails ","title":"Black Velvet (beer cocktail)"},{"id":"3584586","text":"American Caesar is the tenth studio album by American rock singer Iggy Pop, released in September 1993 by record label Virgin.

The canal had 109 locks along its length. Remains of several of the canal's former locks are visible along New York State Route 12 near Boonville. The Black River Canal Museum in Boonville is dedicated to the Black River Canal.  Description of the canal  In 1828, a survey for the Black River Canal Company proposed of traffic canal, of feeder canal, and of navigable river from Rome in Oneida County to Carthage in Jefferson County to allow the communities of northern New York access to an inexpensive mode of transportation for commerce. Originally the Canal Commission's intent was to complete a route that would terminate at the St. Lawrence River in Ogdensburg at the northern edge of St. Lawrence County. The canal when finished only went to Carthage and yet still possessed all of the traits proposed in 1828 and rose a modest . and slyty7.7 One hundred and nine locks were required to raise and lower the barges over this relatively short distance. Some of the locks were in consecutive series of four and five due to steep grades. The summit of the Black River Canal (\\"BRC\\") passed through Boonville in Oneida County, where it met with a feeder canal that originated in Forestport. The northern end of the canal proper terminated at Lyons Falls in Lewis County while canal boat traffic continued through to Carthage by way of improvements to the navigability of the Black River itself and the assistance of steamboats. Two additional locks and four dams on the river were needed to accomplish this feat. Brief history of construction and partial abandonment  Work commenced in 1837 after many years of planning and obtaining legislative support. Testing began in 1848 with the influx of a reduced quantity of water into the system to test for leakage and structural faults. By 1850, part of the canal north of Rome was in service, and the extension to Port Leyden was completed by the end of the year. In 1855, the entire planned length was finished. Damage from a burst dam in 1869 delayed the canal's opening for that year. By 1887 a repair program was instituted to correct damaged locks, worn by years of use. In 1900, the canal north of Boonville was determined to be uneconomic and was subsequently abandoned.  Legacy of the canal  This canal was the longest-surviving of the Erie Canal's feeder canal system, remaining in use in some segments until c. 1920. By 1925, the canal was declared an abandoned waterway. Parts of the canal are still visible, and part of the course was along the current NY Route 12. The name \\"headwaters\\" is still in current use in the Boonville area, referring to the source of the water and the reservoir to feed the canal with water. The Black River Canal Warehouse at Boonville was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. A museum opened in 2005 operating out of the Warehouse, with other buildings added to house canal artifacts.

The riot started after a Panamanian flag was torn and Panamanian students were killed during a conflict with Canal Zone Police officers and Canal Zone residents. It is also known as the Flag Incident or Flag Protests. U.S. Army units became involved in suppressing the violence after Canal Zone police were overwhelmed, and after three days of fighting, about 22 Panamanians and four U.S. soldiers were killed. The incident is considered to be a significant factor in the U.S. decision to transfer control of the Canal Zone to Panama through the 1977 Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties. Background After Panama gained independence from Colombia in 1903, with the assistance of the U.S., there was resentment amongst some Panamanians as a result of the Hay‚ÄìBunau-Varilla Treaty, which ceded control of the Panama Canal Zone to the U.S. \\"in perpetuity\\" in exchange for a 10 million dollar initial payment and yearly 250 thousand dollar payments thereafter. In addition, the United States Government purchased title to all the lands in the Canal Zone from the private owners. The Canal Zone, primarily consisting of the Panama Canal, was a strip of land running from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean and had its own police, schools, ports and post offices. The Canal Zone became U.S. territory (de facto if not de jure). In January 1963, U.S. President John F. Kennedy agreed to fly Panama's flag alongside the U.S. flag at all non-military sites in the Canal Zone where the U.S. flag was flown. However, Kennedy was assassinated before his orders were carried out. One month after Kennedy's death, Panama Canal Zone Governor Robert J. Fleming, Jr. issued a decree limiting Kennedy's order. The U.S. flag would no longer be flown outside Canal Zone schools, police stations, post offices or other civilian locations where it had been flown, but Panama's flag would not be flown either. The governor's order infuriated many Zonians, who interpreted it as a U.S. renunciation of sovereignty over the Canal Zone. In response, outraged Zonians began flying the U.S. flag anywhere they could. After the first U.S. flag to be raised at Balboa High School (a public high school in the Canal Zone) was taken down by school officials, the students walked out of class, raised another flag, and posted guards to prevent its removal. Most Zonian adults sympathized with the student demonstrators. In what was to prove a miscalculation of the volatility of the situation, Governor Fleming departed for a meeting in Washington, D.C. on the afternoon of January 9, 1964. For him and many others, the U.S.-Panama relationship was at its peak. The exploding situation caught up with the Governor while he was still en route to the U.S. over the Caribbean. The Flag Pole Incident While a Panamanian response to the flag raisings by the Zonians was expected, the crisis took most Americans by surprise. Several years later, Lyndon B. Johnson wrote in his memoirs that: \\"When I heard about the students' action, I was certain we were in for trouble.\\" The news of the actions of the Balboa High School reached the students at the Instituto Nacional, Panama's top public high school. Led by 17-year-old Guillermo Guevara Paz, 150 to 200 demonstrating students from the institute, crossed the street into the Canal Zone and marched through the neighborhoods to Balboa High School, carrying their school's Panamanian flag and a sign proclaiming their country's sovereignty over the U.S. Canal Zone. They had first informed their school principal and the Canal Zone authorities of their plans before setting out on their march. Their intention was to raise the Panamanian flag on the Balboa High School flagpole, alongside the U.S. flag. At Balboa High, the Panamanian students were met by Canal Zone police and a crowd of Zonian students and adults. After negotiations between the Panamanian students and the police, a small group was allowed to approach the flagpole, while police kept the main group back. A half-dozen Panamanian students, carrying their flag, approached the flagpole. In response, the Zonians surrounded the flagpole, sang \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" and rejected the deal between the police and the Panamanian students. Scuffling broke out. The Panamanians were driven back by the Zonian civilians and police. In the course of the scuffle, Panama's flag was torn. The flag in question had historical significance. In 1947, students from the Instituto Nacional had carried it in demonstrations opposing the Filos-Hines Treaty and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases. Independent investigators of the events of January 9, 1964 later noted that the flag was made of flimsy silk. There are conflicting claims about how the flag was torn. Canal Zone Police Captain Gaddis Wall, who was in charge of the police at the scene, denies any American culpability. He claims that the Panamanian students stumbled and accidentally tore their own flag. David M. White, an apprentice telephone technician with the Panama Canal Company, stated that \\"the police gripped the students, who were four or five abreast, under the shoulders in the armpits and edged them forward. One of the students fell or tripped and I believe when he went down the old flag was torn.\\" None of these accounts have been definitively proven. One of the Panamanian flag bearers, Eligio Carranza, said that \\"they started shoving us and trying to wrest the flag from us, all the while insulting us. A policeman wielded his club which ripped our flag. The captain tried to take us where the others Panamanian students were. On the way through the mob, pulled and tore our flag.\\" To this day, the issue remains highly contentious, with both sides saying the other instigated the conflict. Violence breaks out As word of the flag desecration incident spread, angry Panamanian crowds formed along and across the border between Panama City and the Canal Zone. At several points demonstrators stormed into the zone, planting Panamanian flags. Canal Zone police tear gassed them. Rocks were thrown, causing injuries to several of the police officers. The police responded by opening fire. Canal Zone authorities asked the Panama National Guard (Panama's Armed Forces) to suppress the disturbances. The National Guard stayed absent. Meanwhile, demonstrators began to tear down the \\"Fence of Shame\\" located in the Canal Zone, a safety feature alongside a busy highway. Panamanians were tear gassed, and then several were shot. One of the most famous photographs of what Panamanians know as Martyrs' Day shows two demonstrators, one bearing a Panamanian flag, climbing over Fence of Shame at Ancon. The opinion of most Panamanians, and most Latin Americans generally, about the fence in question was expressed a few days later by Colombia's ambassador to the Organization of American States: \\"In Panama there exists today another Berlin Wall.\\" The Panamanian crowds grew as nightfall came, and by 8 p.m. the Canal Zone Police was overwhelmed. Some 80 to 85 police officers faced a hostile crowd of at least 5,000, and estimated by some sources to be 30,000 or more, all along and across the border between Panama City and the Canal Zone. When the lieutenant governor came to survey the scene, the protestors stoned his car. At the request of Lieutenant Governor Parkers, General Andrew P. O'Meara, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, assumed authority over the Canal Zone. The U.S. Army's 193rd Infantry Brigade was deployed at about 8:35 p.m. American-owned businesses in Panama City were set afire. The recently dedicated Pan Am building (which, despite housing an American corporation, was Panamanian-owned) was completely gutted. The next morning, the bodies of six Panamanians were found in the wreckage. Some reporters alleged one giant communist plot, with Christian Democrats, Socialists, student government leaders and a host of others controlled by the hand of Fidel Castro. However, it seems that Panama's communists were caught by surprise by the outbreak of violence and commanded the allegiance of only a small minority of those who rioted on the Day of the Martyrs. A good indication of the relative communist strength came two weeks after the confrontations, when the Catholic Church sponsored a memorial rally for the fallen, which was attended by some 40,000 people. A rival communist commemoration on the same day drew only 300 participants. The US Embassy was ordered to burn all sensitive documents. A number of U.S. citizen residents of Panama City, particularly military personnel and their families who were unable to get housing on base, were forced to flee their homes. There were many instances in which Panamanians gave refuge to Americans who were endangered in Panama City and elsewhere. The confrontation was not contained in the Panama City area. Word of the fighting quickly spread all over Panama by radio, television and private telephone calls. The incomplete censorship had the side effect of contributing to wild rumors on all sides. One popular but inaccurate Zonian rumor, fueled in part by references to the \\"American Canal Zone\\" in U.S. news media, that the Panama Canal Zone had been renamed \\"United States Canal Zone\\" and would henceforth be an outright possession of the United States. News and rumor instantly traveled the 49 miles from Panama's south coast to its north coast. The country's second city, Col√≥n, which abuts the city of Crist√≥bal, then part of the Canal Zone, erupted within a few hours after the start of hostilities on the Pacific side. Intense fighting continued for the next two days. Unlike in Panama City, Panamanian authorities in Col√≥n had made early attempts to separate the combatants. Some incidents also happened in other cities all over Panama. Death toll As the angry Panamanian mob turned their wrath against targets in Panama City, a number of people were shot to death under controversial circumstances. The final death toll was 28 people. Ascanio Arosemena, a 19-year-old student, was shot from behind, through the shoulder and thorax. He became the first of Panama's \\"martyrs,\\" as those who fell on January 9, 1964, and the following few days were to become known. Witnesses say that Arosemena died while helping to evacuate wounded protesters from the danger zone. The witnesses appear to be corroborated by a photograph of Arosemena supporting an injured man, said to have been taken shortly before he was shot. The building where it all started, the former Balboa High School today bears his name, and is one of the buildings of the Panama Canal Authority, the Panamanian Government Agency created to run the Canal starting from mid-day December 31, 1999. A six-month- old girl, Maritza √Åvila Alabarca, died with respiratory problems while her neighborhood was gassed by the U.S. Army with CS tear gas. The U.S. denied that the infant's death was linked to the use of CS tear gas, in keeping with its claim that it is not a lethal agent. Various U.S. accounts claim that all Panamanians who were shot to death were either rioters or else shot by other Panamanians. Various Panamanian versions blame all Panamanian deaths on U.S. forces, though those who died in the Pan American Airlines building fire can not reasonably be said to have died at the hands of American forces. Some Panamanians may have been hit by bullets fired by Panamanians but intended for American targets. A definitive accounting of all deaths in the events of January 1964 has yet to be published, and may never be published. The official Canal Zone Police version is that the police did not shoot directly at anybody, but only fired over the heads or at the feet of rioters. The police version was disputed by independent investigators, who found that the police fired directly into the crowds and killed Arosemena and a number of other Panamanians. DENI ballistics experts claim that six Panamanians were killed by .38 caliber Smith & Wesson police revolvers fired by the Canal Zone Police. The list of Panama's martyrs can be found at the martyrs Memorial in the former Balboa High School in Panama City. The 21 as listed there include: Maritza √Åvila Alabarca, Ascanio Arosemena, Rodolfo S√°nchez Ben√≠tez, Luis Bonilla, Alberto Constance, Gonzalo Crance, Teofilo De La Torre, Jos√© Del Cid, Victor Garibaldo, Jos√© Gil, Ezequiel Gonz√°lez, Victor Iglesias, Rosa Landecho, Carlos Lara, Gustavo Lara, Ricardo Murgas, Estanislao Orobio, Jacinto Palacios, Ovidio Salda√±a, Alberto Tejada and Celestino Villarreta. Most U.S. accounts put the number of Americans killed in these events at four, though others put the death toll at three or five. Those who died on the American side include Staff Sergeant Luis Jimenez Cruz, Private David Haupt and First Sergeant Gerald Aubin who were all killed by sniper fire on the 9th and 10th in Colon and Specialist Michael W. Rowland, whose death was caused by an accidental fall into a ravine on the evening of the 10th. Another 30 U.S. military personnel were wounded in operations to separate the Panamanian and Canal Zone protesters. Most of the 17 injuries suffered by U.S. civilians resulted from thrown rocks or bottles. When the fighting was over, DENI investigators found over 600 bullets embedded in the Legislative Palace. Santo Tomas Hospital reported that it had treated 324 injuries and recorded 18 deaths from the fighting. Panama City's Social Security Hospital treated at least 16 others who were wounded on the first night of the fighting. Most of those killed and wounded had suffered gunshot wounds. Some of the more seriously injured were left with severe permanent brain damage or paralyzing spinal injuries from their bullet wounds. After the fighting, American investigators found over 400 bullets embedded in the Tivoli Hotel. Years after the events of January 1964, a number of U.S. Army historical documents were declassified, including Southcom's figures for ammunition expended. The official account has it that the U.S. Army fired 450 .30 caliber rifle rounds, five .45 caliber pistol bullets, 953 shells of birdshot and 7,193 grenades or projectiles containing tear gas. Also, the army claims to have used 340 pounds of bulk CN-1 chemical (weak tear gas) and 120 pounds of CS-1 chemical (strong tear gas). The same account said that the Canal Zone police fired 1,850 .38 caliber pistol bullets and 600 shotgun shells in the fighting, while using only 132 tear gas grenades. According to the Panamanian DENI, out of the 1,850 .38 caliber bullets that the Canal Zone Police allegedly fired directly into the crowd, only six Panamanians were fatally wounded. Of the remaining 2,008 bullets, shells and rounds, the 7,193 tear gas grenades or projectiles, the additional 460 pounds of tear gas, only 15 Panamanians were fatally wounded. International reactions and aftermath International reaction was largely unfavorable against the United States. The British and French governments, who had been criticized by U.S. administrations for their foreign policy and handling of their various colonies, accused the U.S. of hypocrisy and argued that their Zonian citizens were as obnoxious as any other group of colonial settlers. Egypt's Gamal Abdul Nasser suggested that Panama nationalize the Panama Canal as they had nationalized the Suez Canal. The People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union and Cuba denounced the U.S. in very strong terms. From the other end of the ideological spectrum, Spanish dictator Francisco Franco's right-wing Falangist Party accused the United States of aggression against Panama. Significantly, other governments in the western hemisphere which had long backed U.S. policies declined to back the American position. Venezuela led a chorus of Latin American criticism of the United States. The Organization of American States, on Brazil's motion, took jurisdiction over the dispute from the United Nations Security Council. The OAS in turn put the matter before its Inter-American Peace Committee. The committee held a week- long investigation in Panama which was greeted by a unanimous 15-minute Panamanian work stoppage to demonstrate Panama's united opinion. No action was taken on Panama's motion to brand the United States guilty of aggression, but the committee did accuse the Americans of using unnecessary force. The President of Panama at the time, Roberto Chiari, broke diplomatic relations with the United States on January 10. On January 15, President Chiari declared that Panama would not re-establish diplomatic ties with the U.S. until it agreed to open negotiations on a new treaty. The first steps in that direction were taken shortly thereafter on April 3, 1964, when both countries agreed to an immediate resumption of diplomatic relations and the United States agreed to adopt procedures for the \\"elimination of the causes of conflict between the two countries\\". A few weeks later, Robert B. Anderson, President Johnson's special representative, flew to Panama to pave the way for future talks. For these actions, President Chiari is regarded as \\"the president of dignity\\". The role played by the Panamanian ambassador to the United Nations, Miguel Moreno is also worth mentioning. Moreno is remembered for his strong speech against the United States at the UN General Assembly. This incident is considered to be the catalyst for the eventual U.S. abolition of the \\"in perpetuity\\" control of the Canal Zone and divestiture of its title to property there, with the 1977 signing of the Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties, which dissolved the Canal Zone in 1979, set a timetable for the closing of U.S. Armed Forces Bases and transferred full control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian Government at noon, December 31, 1999. Monuments Two monuments have been built in Panama City to commemorate these events. One was built where the flagpole incident happened, the former Balboa High School, today a Panama Canal Authority building that bears the name of Ascanio Arosemena, known as the first \\"martyr\\" and maybe the most famous one. It was built by the Panama Canal Authority and consists on a covered entryway containing the memorial, which has a name of a \\"martyr\\" on each column, and an eternal fire (not unlike the eternal fire for U.S. President John F. Kennedy) in the middle, and the Panamanian flag afterwards, in a sort of open-to-the-sky (i.e. no roof) \\"square\\", on a flagpole. Another monument, built in front of the Legislative Assembly, on the former Panama City-Canal Zone limits consists on a life-sized monument in the form of a lamppost, with three figures climbing it to raise their flag. The monument reflects the photograph that was on the cover of Life, in which three students scaled the 12 foot high safety fence and climbed a lamppost and the one in the top had a Panamanian flag.

In this episode, a man finds he has the ability to trade anything, even personal traits and conditions, with whoever agrees to the swap. Opening narrationPlot Salvadore Ross is a brash, insensitive, ambitious 26-year-old man who desires a lovely young social worker named Leah Maitland. Leah and Ross dated for a time, but she broke off the relationship because their personalities are incompatible. When Ross continues to bother her, Leah puts her foot down and finally ends things. He has been so loud that her father has come out to see if she is all right. After a curt exchange, they go inside and Ross slams his fist into the closed door, breaking his hand. This sends him to a local hospital, where he is forced to spend the evening. Ross' roommate is an elderly man with a respiratory infection. Ross sarcastically suggests that he would like to trade ailments with the old man, who jokingly accepts the trade and they go to sleep. Salvadore turns over quickly and hits his hand. He then realizes it no longer hurts and begins to unwrap it. As he unwraps it, he begins to cough. He gets out of the bed and checks the other man, whose hand has begun to hurt. He begs to change things back, but Salvadore tells him no and goes to get his clothes. Ross realizes he has a supernatural power to make trades with other people. In exchange for $1,000,000 and a penthouse apartment, Ross sells his youth to an elderly millionaire. As a result Ross is now very rich, but old. He offers a number of young men (beginning with a hotel bellboy) $1,000 for each year of their lives they trade to him. In short order, Ross is 26 again. Ross is now young, rich, and (thanks to a trade with a college student) well- spoken, so he goes to Leah's apartment. Her father is there and unimpressed with the superficial change in Ross, knowing that he does not love Leah, but simply wishes to possess her. Leah comes home and, after she sees Salvadore has changed his ways some, agrees to go to dinner with him. However, by the end of the date she is again repulsed by Ross's personality. She wants a man who is as caring and compassionate as her father. Frustrated, Ross approaches Mr. Maitland, who is kind to him despite his disrespectful and condescending demeanor, but does not think he would be a good husband for his daughter. Ross offers him $100,000 to make him and Leah financially secure in exchange for something from Mr. Maitland. When the father asks what he has, Ross says, \\"Well, it's a little hard to explain...\\" The next day, Ross has become warm, compassionate and has won Leah's heart. Ross meets with Mr. Maitland in private to apologize for his previous behavior and asks for his permission to marry Leah. Maitland refuses. Ross implores the older man to show compassion. Maitland coldly replies, \\"I sold that to you yesterday\\", and shoots Ross dead. Closing narrationReferences *DeVoe, Bill. (2008). Trivia from The Twilight Zone.

His family emigrated from the UK to Australia in 1925 as assisted immigrants. He was a cricket player until WWII when he enlisted and was sent to Meckering Western Australia, an embarkation point for troops leaving for overseas action. While cleaning a machine gun, he was ordered by a lieutenant to clean it in a way which Wykes knew to be wrong, but he had to obey orders. The gun exploded and Wykes was shot in the ankle and foot, shattering many bones in his foot. An operation removed several of his toes on the left foot and he thereafter had to wear an elevator shoe on it. This injury put paid to his cricket playing career and he then took up umpiring. He umpired one Test match between Australia and England at Brisbane on 30 November to 5 December 1962, a match drawn with England requiring 100 runs to win with 4 wickets in hand. Brian Booth scored a century and there were 13 other scores of at least 50. Wykes‚Äô partner in this match was Colin Egar. Wykes joined the NSW Cricket Umpires‚Äô Association in 1949, became a first-class umpire in 1956, and retired from first-class umpiring in 1972, after 85 appearances. He retained his involvement in umpiring, as President of the NSW Cricket Umpires‚Äô Association from 1967 to 1989, and was still Vice-president in 2000. He received an Order of Australia medal for his services to cricket in 1980, and became a Life Member of the NSW Cricket Association in 1982. He died on 22 November 2008 at Wollongong Australia. His ashes were buried with full honours at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 9 February 2009 in two locations near the Test Pitch. The Cricket Umpire's Association Medal, once restricted to umpires officiating in Sydney grade cricket, was renamed as the E F Wykes OAM Association Medal in Wykes' honour.

The romantic melodrama novel was widely popular, topping that year's list of bestselling novels in the United States. Plot Lucas Marsh (Robert Mitchum) is a brilliant and dedicated medical student who has aspired to be a doctor since childhood. His mother is dead and he is estranged from his alcoholic father, who has squandered the family's money, leaving Lucas unable to pay for medical school. In order to get the needed tuition money, Lucas marries an older nurse, Kristina \\"Kris\\" Hedvigson (Olivia de Havilland), who has substantial savings. Although Kris loves Lucas and helps him in a variety of ways, he is indifferent towards her and considers her \\"stupid\\" though she is an excellent nurse. Lucas cares only about doing excellent medical work, and frequently clashes with other doctors who he considers incompetent, including his wealthy best friend Alfred Boone (Frank Sinatra). Kris, Alfred, and Lucas' mentor Dr. Aarons (Broderick Crawford) try to humanize him and teach him that all doctors sometimes make mistakes. Lucas looks down on doctors who focus on making money, and after completing his internship, he accepts a position working with Dr. Dave Runkleman (Charles Bickford) in his busy practice in rural Greenville, where many patients lack the money to pay. Runkleman has a life-threatening heart condition, so he hired Lucas to help with the workload and perhaps take over the practice. Overworked and frustrated with the incompetent head of the local hospital, Lucas has an affair with rich widow Harriet Lang (Gloria Grahame), causing Kris, who is secretly pregnant, to finally leave him. When Runkleman's heart condition flares up, Lucas performs heart surgery to save his life, but makes a mistake during the surgery and Runkleman dies. Struggling to cope with his failure, Lucas begs Kris to help him, and the two reconcile.
