Members of this genus can be either annual or perennial. Annual members of this genus store sulfuric acid in intracellular vacuoles. When exposed to air they release the acid, thereby destroying themselves and nearby seaweeds in the process. They are found in shallow intertidal zones. Ingesting sulfuric acid can cause severe digestive problems. but since sulfuric acid tastes extremely sour, members of the genus are unlikely to be eaten in harmful quantities.

He died from lung cancer at the age of 68 on July 31, 2008.  Life  Yi Chong-jun was born in 1939. He graduated with a degree in German literature from Seoul National University. In 1965, he debuted with a short story titled Toewon (퇴원, lit. \\"Leaving the Hospital\\"). Two years later, he won a Dongin Literature Award for The Wounded (Byeongsingwa Meojeori, 병신과 머저리).  Work  Yi is one of the foremost writers of the 4.19 Generation and his literary output since has been both steady in pace and considerable in volume, and his subject matter has been varied. “The Wounded” (Byeongsin gwa mejeori, 1966) probes the spiritual malaise of the post-war Korean youth; This Paradise of Yours (Dangsindeurui cheonguk, 1976) explores the dialectics of charity and will to power, with the leper colony of Sorokdo Island as the backdrop; and The Fire Worshipers (Bihwa milgyo, 1985) meditates on the meaning of human rituals conducted in a Godless society when no ultimate guarantee of the absolute can be given. Lee Cheong-jun's fiction encompasses a broad range of political, existential and metaphysical concerns.\\"Lee Chong-jun\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: One of the recurrent themes in his fiction, however, has been the concern with language as a vehicle of truth. The Walls of Rumor (Somunui byeok, 1972) describes the ways in which freedom of speech was repressed in the ideologically charged atmosphere of Korean society in the era of national division. Stories contained in the collection In Search of Lost Words (Ireobeorin mareul chajaseo, 1981) continue the investigation of the effect of political violence on language. Because thought cannot be separate from the modes of its expression, distortions of language in a politically repressive society effect psychological damages as well. The tyranny of political and social systems as they become internalized in individual psyches?becomes inextricably bound to questions of language in?Lee Cheongjun's fiction.\\"Ma Jonggi\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Another favorite theme is the role of art in life. Such early stories as “The Falconer” (Maejabi) and “The Target” (Gwanyeok) feature artisans dedicated to the perfection of their craft, often at the cost of conventional happiness. In more recent years,?Lee Cheongjun has drawn on forms of traditional folk art and the Korean spirit embodied in them as a source of inspiration. For example, the fictional work “Seopyeonje” (1993) foregrounds the genre of pansori, a traditional Korean oral performance which features a singer of tales accompanied by a single drummer. Here, artistic expression becomes both a mode of reconciliation to life, in spite of its countless woes, and ultimately of its transcendence. Made into a blockbuster feature film, “Seopyeonje” also helped revive great popular interest in the art of pansori.\\"Ma Jonggi\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at:  Works in translation  * The Snowy Road and Other Stories (단편소설선 <눈길>) * Your Paradise (당신들의 천국) * The Prophet and Other Stories (이청준 소설선 <예언자> 외) * Seopyeonje (서편제) * The Cruel City and Other Korean Short Stories (한국대표단편선(2)) * Two Stories from Korea: \\"The Wounded\\" and \\"The Abject\\"Two Stories from Korea: \\"The Wounded\\" and \\"The Abject\\"  Works in Korean (partial)  Many of his works have been adapted into movies or drama series by leading directors.

The idea for the airport was originally included within the Thames Hub integrated infrastructure vision, and the idea of some kind of airport in the Thames Estuary has been discussed since the 1970s. The case for developing the airport as a solution to the question of how the United Kingdom can maintain its global hub aviation status was submitted, alongside many other solutions, to the UK’s Airports Commission in July 2013 by Foster+Partners. In December 2013 the Commission announced its shortlist of proposals for expanding Britain's airports. The Thames Estuary concept was not included on the initial shortlist, but the Commission said it would undertake further study of the Isle of Grain option in the first half of 2014. In September 2014 the Committee concluded that the Thames Hub proposal had \\"substantial disadvantages that collectively outweighed its potential benefits and that it therefore did not represent a credible option for shortlisting\\". They described it as \\"unfeasibly expensive, highly problematic in environmental terms and would be hugely disruptive for many businesses and communities\\". It remained off the shortlist. Background=Expansion of London’s airports Expanding the capacity of London's airports to meet growing demand is an issue that successive governments have failed to address since the 1950s. In recent years it has been widely claimed that, to provide the level of connectivity that the UK and London require to maintain their global hub status, the capital requires additional hub airport capacity. Proponents of this idea, such as business lobby groups and the aviation industry, believe that further expansion of London's point-to-point airports, such as Gatwick and Stansted, would not address London's claimed need for extra hub capacity. However, some transport experts and many politicians and organisations dispute the need for a single huge hub. London's largest and only hub airport, Heathrow, has been operating at almost full capacity since 1993. The two-runway airport is less than 20 miles west of Central London and is completely surrounded by urban development, leaving no room to build additional runways to cater for additional air passenger demand. Due to the UK's prevailing southwesterly winds, aircraft predominately approach Heathrow over Central London. As a result, over 750,000 people live within the 55 dB aircraft noise contour and suffer from aircraft noise pollution. Thames Estuary Airport A proposed solution to the need to expand London's hub airport capacity, which has been studied on a number of occasions, is to build a new hub airport in the Thames Estuary. Following the work of the Roskill Commission, in 1973 the Maplin Airport Development Act was passed to enable an airport to be built at Maplin Sands. However the project was cancelled in 1974. In 2009, London Mayor Boris Johnson announced his support for a proposed new offshore airport in the Thames Estuary at Shivering Sands that had been developed by former Crossrail chairman Doug Oakervee. At the time, the idea of an estuary airport was lampooned by the press. Thames Hub integrated infrastructure vision In November 2011 Lord Foster launched the concept of the Thames Hub integrated infrastructure vision – an integrated infrastructure development in the Thames Estuary which included a high-speed rail line, a combined Thames road and rail crossing and a flood protection barrier incorporating Renewable energy generation#Hydropower renewable energy generation, and a new 150 million passenger hub airport. Proposal The Thames Hub Airport would have been built on a platform, partly in the Thames Estuary but attached to the land, on the Isle of Grain in Kent. It would have had four runways, located as two parallel pairs, and would have had a handling capacity of 110 million passengers per annum (mppa), expandable to 150 mppa. Advantages *Significant reduction in the number of people impacted by noise because aircraft would predominantly approach the airport over water *24-hour operation (not possible at Heathrow) *Reduced air-pollution impacts - aircraft emissions disperse over water *Opportunity to redevelop the Heathrow site for housing and a new commercial centre Challenges *Bird strike: 300,000 birds that breed along the flight path. *Relocation of airport staff and businesses that are currently located around Heathrow *Dealing with the wreck of the SS Richard Montgomery with its 1,400 tonnes of explosives, just off the Nore *Working around the natural gas terminals that import and temporarily store 20% of the UK's natural gas *Fitting another airport in this crowded airspace. On 13 April 2012, Richard Deakin, the head of National Air Traffic Services, commented that \\"the very worst spot you could put an airport is just about here\\". He continued, \\"We’re a little surprised that none of the architects thought it worthwhile to have a little chat.\\" *Due to the proximity to water in a temperate climate, fog could be an issue which reduces the capacity for aircraft to land. The Met Office provided a study that stated there would be three times as much fog than at London Heathrow over the course of the year. Reaction Boris Johnson, the previous Mayor of London, was the main supporter of a new airport in the Thames Estuary. Farrells, another London architecture firm, advocates expanding Gatwick Airport instead, providing a second runway and reconstructing the passenger terminal. Sir Terry Farrell claims this could be \\"the world’s most efficient two-runway airport\\", a quicker and cheaper solution, and that it would \\"turbocharge\\" the economy of South London. Gatwick Airport set up a website called \\"Gatwick Obviously\\" to promote this idea, although a 1979 legal agreement with West Sussex County Council prohibits construction of a new runway before 2019.

In 2003, Larry Spier Jr.'s son, Mark Spier, assumed control of the company. In 2006, Scion Three Music (BMI) and Scion Four Music (ASCAP) were formed by Mark Spier as Memory Lane's contemporary division.

The IOC selected the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on July 31, 2015, which Beijing won. History Wangfujing Street during the 2008 Summer Olympics The Chinese Olympic Committee nominated Beijing as the candidate city for the 2022 Winter Olympics on November 3, 2013. In addition, Zhangjiakou is the joint city for the bidding. Zhangjiakou is located northwest of Beijing. Previous bids Beijing bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, but lost out to Sydney. Beijing went on to successfully bid for and host the 2008 Summer Olympics. Previous bids from other Chinese cities Harbin bid to host the 2010 Winter Olympics but failed to become a candidate city. Vancouver was ultimately awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics. Harbin also bid to host the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics but failed to become a candidate. Innsbruck ultimately won the right to host the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics. Nanjing successfully bid to host the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. Venues The Beijing Olympic Games Bidding Committee unveiled the gymnasium layout plan for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games on 20 February 2014: five ice events will be held at the Olympic center, the Capital Indoor Stadium and the Beijing Wukesong Sports Center. Competitions for luge, bobsleigh and alpine skiing will be held in Xiaohaituo Mountain area northwest of Beijing, 90 kilometers away from downtown. All other skiing events will be held in Taizicheng Area in Chongli District, Zhangjiakou, 220 kilometers away from downtown of Beijing and 130 kilometers away from Xiaohaituo Mountain Area. Beijing Cluster * Bird's Nest – opening and closing ceremony * Capital Indoor Stadium – figure skating, short track * Wukesong Sports Centre – main ice hockey venue * National Indoor Stadium – second ice hockey venue * Water Cube – curling * National Speed Skating Oval – speed skating Yanqing Cluster * Xiaohaituo Alpine Skiing Field – alpine skiing * Xiaohaituo Bobsleigh and Luge Track – bobsleigh, luge and skeleton Zhangjiakou Cluster * Kuyangshu Biathlon Field – cross-country skiing, Nordic combined * Kuyangshu Ski Jumping Field – ski jumping, Nordic combined * Hualindong Ski Resort – biathlon * Genting Ski Resort – snowboarding (slopestyle, halfpipe), freestyle skiing * Taiwu Ski Resort – snowboarding (cross), freestyle skiing * Wanlong Ski Resort – snowboarding (parallel slalom) Pollution issue The issue of air pollution, which was widely discussed during the 2008 Summer Olympics, was cited as a likely factor in Beijing's bid. Beijing and Zhangjiakou suffer from severe air pollution which is worse during the winter. As of February 26, 2014, Beijing hit a dangerous particulate concentration of 537. A rate of 301-500 is marked as hazardous. An anti-pollution body expressed a concern that Beijing companies failing to meet regulations were moving their factories to Tianjin and Hebei. Lack of snow issue The lack of snow is cited by the IOC as an issue in Beijing's bid. The average snow depth in Yangqing, where the ski competitions would be held, is five centimeters. Human rights issue A study at the University of Chicago analyzed the progress of the IOC's Agenda 2020 to demand that host countries have equitable labour laws. It concluded that the acceptance of Beijing's bid undermined this initiative.

The title of this team had little to do with the state of Pennsylvania, but it did have a close connection with the Pennsylvania Station in New York City. The designation of Red Caps derived from the fact that some of the team's players served as redcaps in the famed station. The team was formed in 1916 by manager and owner \\"Handsome Bill\\" Egan, who was the stationmaster of the Thirty-Third Street Terminal (one block East of Penn Street Station in Manhattan) in New York City.\\"St. Patrick - Penn Red Cap Battle\\" Jersey Journal, Jersey City, New Jersey, Friday, September 28, 1917, Page 11, Column 2 The Red Caps played intermittently and never operated in an official league, while playing from 1917 to 1918, in 1920, from 1925 through 1928, and finally from 1930 thru closing in 1934. Basically, this marginal team was composed of black college students who played baseball during the summer in order to earn money for tuition. One of their most prominent players was Dick Seay, who played shortstop alongside second baseman Chino Smith. Both Seay and Smith went to play professionally for the Baltimore Black Sox and the Brooklyn Royal Giants, respectively, while a number of their teammates became doctors and lawyers. In later years, the team played their games at Freeport Municipal Stadium in Long Island. Very little data and information were recorded regarding their win- loss record.

He was an ancestor of the Duke of Wellington in the female line. His second marriage to the heiress Marian Cruise inspired the ballad The Song of Mary Cruys. Family He was born in County Meath, the third of seven sons of Sir Christopher Plunket, who married in 1403 Janet Cusack, the heiress of Killeen Castle, Dunsany. Christopher was created 1st Baron Killeen about 1426, and founded a prominent Anglo-Irish dynasty.Lodge, John and Archdall, Mervyn Peerage of Ireland Dublin 1789 Vol.6 p. 174 It was said that Thomas was \\"bred to the law\\": he and his younger brother Robert were the first two of numerous lawyers and judges in the Plunket family. Killeen Castle, Co. Meath Career Thomas became Serjeant-at-law (Ireland), who at that time was the senior legal adviser to the Crown, in 1434. He was entrusted with levying subsidies in 1447, and with surveying the royal mines in 1450. He was made a justice of assize in County Meath, and was entrusted with the defence of the county in 1456.Ball, F.

He was reappointed in 1463 and confirmed in office in 1468 jointly with John Chevir.Ball p.182 Rathmore Church, Plunket's burial site. He died on 12 June 1471, bequeathing the sum of £100 to Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin.Lodge and Archdall p.183 He was buried in Rathmore Church, where an impressive tomb was erected to the memory of Thomas and his second wife Marian Cruise. Rathmore Church is now a ruin, but some traces of the tomb are said to still be visible. Marriages and children He married firstly Genet Cusack,it is unclear if she was a relative of his mother, who was also named Genet or Janet Cusack and by her had one son who probably predeceased him. He married secondly Marion Cruise (or Cruys), daughter and heiress of Sir Christopher Cruise of Rathmore, County Meath, and in her right became Lord of the Manor of Rathmore.Ball p.182 His second marriage, though advantageous, was said to be a love affair. There are several romantic stories about the marriage, and a celebrated ballad, \\"The Song of Mary Cruys\\", describing how Thomas as a young barrister in London restored Marion, then a penniless refugee in England, to her rightful inheritance.O'Flanagan, J. Roderick Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland London 1870 Vol.1 p.140 How much truth there is in the story that Marian and her mother were forced to flee from their home in fear of their lives after her father's murder is uncertain, but violence was endemic in fifteenth century Ireland, as it was in England, so the story may have some basis in fact. He and Marian had five children: *Edmund, who inherited Rathmore but died without issue *Sir Alexander Plunket, Lord Chancellor of Ireland *Ismay, who married Sir William Wellesley of Dangan: their children included Walter Wellesley, Bishop of Kildare, and Garett Wellesley, ancestor of the Duke of Wellington *Margaret, who married Barnaby Barnewall, judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) *Elizabeth, who married Christopher Barnewall, 2nd Baron Trimleston; their son John, 3rd Baron, was, like his uncle, Lord Chancellor of IrelandLodge and Archdall pp.182-185 He should not be confused with his nephew Sir Thomas Plunket of Dunsoghly Castle, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas.

It incorporates the effects of ionic strength mediated screening by evaluating the Poisson-Boltzmann equation at a finite number of points within a three- dimensional grid box. DelPhi is commonly used in protein science to visualize variations in electrostatics along a protein or other macromolecular surface and to calculate the electrostatic components of various energies.  Development  One of the main problems in modeling the electrostatic potential of biological macromolecules is that they exist in water at a given ionic strength and that they have an irregular shape. Analytical solutions of the corresponding Poisson-Boltzmann Equation (PBE) are not available for such cases and the distribution of the potential can be found only numerically. DelPhi, developed in Professor Barry Honig's lab in 1986, was the first PBE solver used by many researchers. The widespread popularity of DelPhi is due to its speed, accuracy (calculation of the electrostatic free energy is only slightly dependent on the resolution of the grid) and the ability to handle extremely high grid dimensions.  Features  Additional features such as assigning different dielectric constants to different regions of space, smooth Gaussian-based dielectric distribution function, modeling geometric objects and charge distributions, and treating systems containing mixed salt solutions also attracted many researchers. In addition to the typical potential map, DelPhi can generate and output the calculated distribution of either the dielectric constant or ion concentration, providing the biomedical community with extra tools for their research. Pdb files are typically used as input for DelPhi calculations. Other required inputs are an atomic radii file and a charge file . Binary Potential files as output from DelPhi can be viewed in most molecular viewers such as UCSF Chimera, Jmol, and VMD, and can either be mapped onto surfaces or visualized at a fixed cutoff.DelPhi manual  Versions  Delphi distribution comes as a sequential as well as parallelized codes, runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows systems and the source code is available in Fortran 95 and C++ programming languages. DELPHI is also implemented into an accessible web-server. DELPHI has also been utilized to build a server that predicts pKa's of biological macromolecules such as proteins, RNAs and DNAs which can be accessed via web. DelPhi v.7 is distributed in four versions: # IRIX version, compiled under IRIX 6.5 Operating System, 32bits, using f77 and cc compilers. # IRIX version, compiled under IRIX 6.5 Operating System, 64bits, using f77 and cc compilers. # LINUX version, compiled under Red Hat 7.1, kernel 2.4.2 Operating System, using GNU gfortran compilers, # PC version, compiled under Windows Operating System, using Microsoft Developer Studio C++ and Fortran compilers. Their way of working is very similar; however, unexpected differences may appear due to different numerical precision or to the porting of the software to different architectures. For example, the elapsed time in the PC version is not calculated at present. Each distribution contains one executable (named delphi or delphi.exe), the source codes (with corresponding makefile when needed), and some worked examples.

The circular footprint of the building, with a 97-foot diameter at its base, includes a ground level restaurant and a bank, among other amenities. Sixteen elevators serve the approximate 904,000 square feet of office space the building contains. The building is accompanied by 1500 car parking spaces housed within three levels of underground basement parking. Due to the hour glass shape of the building, the total rentable office space available on each floor varies from 13,560–25,800 square feet. This offers high flexibility in both the size of office space available and the layout of office space on each floor. The top three floors of the tower are luxury office space and are surrounded by terraces and balconies. The top level of the VIP floors has direct access to a helicopter landing pad. It is the tenth tallest building in the city of Doha.

Lou Barlow, Dale Crover, Bobb Bruno (of Best Coast) and others contributed to the first two studio albums. The band's roster for live shows fluctuates depending upon the touring schedule of members. Personnel who consistently appear onstage during Dumb Numbers shows include Harding, Murph (of Dinosaur Jr.), Bonnie Mercer, and Steve Patrick. They joined My Bloody Valentine as an opener to promote their debut record. David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks) did the cover art for the first LP and Malcolm Bucknall provided artwork for the second album. Lynch and Harding released a seven inch split together on Joyful Noise Recordings in 2015. David Yow (Jesus Lizard) directed a video for the debut album's single which appeared at Rolling Stone. Harding's native country is Australia. He began making music in the mid-90's. Prior to the debut of Dumb Numbers, Harding was better-known as a videographer (having directed music videos for DJ Shadow, Warpaint, Best Coast, Swervedriver, Sebadoh, Lou Barlow, and Magic Dirt). However, many of the albums contributors were already established as independent musicians. A genre-defying act, Dumb Numbers musical style has been described variously as doom, sludge, and \\"swooning feedback pop,\\" however there is general agreement that none of these labels are definitive. History Dumb Numbers Harding selects musicians for each Dumb Numbers project from a large group of friends and collaborators.” The self-titled Debut was released on Joyful Noise Recordings in August of 2013, with the single (\\"Redrum\\") premiering in the AV Club and in InSound's weekly mixtape. The video for \\"Redrum\\", directed by David Yow, premiered in Rolling Stone, and Spin the following month. Reviews of the album were generally positive, citing an atavistic and primal indie-rock sound. Since that time, Dumb Numbers II, the Stranger EP, and numerous other side-projects and singles have been released. In addition to his work on Dumb Numbers, Harding also plays in the super-group Kidbug. Personnel The list of personnel involved with Dumb Numbers include, but is not exclusive to: Adam Harding, Murph (of Dinosaur Jr.), Bonnie Mercer (Warpaint, Swans), Steve Patrick (Useless Children, Magic Dirt), Lou Barlow (of Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh, Folk Implosion et al), Dale Crover (of The Melvins, Altamont, Nirvana), Toshi Kasai (of Deaf Nephews Studio in Los Angeles), David Yow (of Scratch Acid, The Jesus Lizard, Qui, Flipper), Bobb Bruno (of Best Coast), Thor Harris (Swans, Thor & Friends), Jenny Lee Lindberg (Warpaint) and others. Touring Dumb Numbers toured with the Lemonheads, My Bloody Valentine, and Sebadoh during the latter half of 2013. Reports of the band's live performances on tour were positive.

Intended as training aircraft capable of aerobatics, the two variants differed only in their fuselages. Only one of each was built, but they were both successful in Italian competitions. Development The Caproni Vizzola 2 was a medium performance glider, intended primarily as a training aircraft but also to be capable of aerobatics. It was designed and built by a collaboration of staff from the Caproni Vizzola works at Vizzola Ticino and the Gliding Group of Varese. It was a high-wing monoplane, with its wing supported centrally on a fuselage pedestal and braced on each side with a faired wooden strut from the main spar at about quarter span to the lower fuselage. The wing had a rectangular plan central section which occupied about half the span and straight-tapered, round-tipped outer panels which carried the broad chord ailerons. Only the outer panels had dihedral. The inner section had airbrakes just behind the spar. The empennage of the glider was conventional, with its tapered and round-tipped tailplane and elevator ahead of the rudder The latter was broad, balanced and rounded, mounted on a small fin. Apart from having different cross-sections, the fuselages of the two models built differed only in cockpit and undercarriage details. The first seems to have been referred to as the Caproni Vizzola MF; the second was certainly the Caproni Vizzola 2. In both, the rear of the cockpit was under the wing leading edge with the pilot's head against the pedestal. On the MF the cockpit was open with just a small windscreen but the Caproni Vizzola 2 had a deeper and longer cockpit enclosed by a framed canopy and with three small transparencies in the nose. Behind the wing the pedestal fell away gently as the fuselage tapered to the tail. The first model had an hexagonal cross section fuselage but that of the Caparoni Vizzola 2 was smother externally and had a teardrop section. Both were plywood skinned. They shared the usual sprung skid undercarriage and tail bumper, though the skid on the later model was extended a little rearwards; both had a fixed monowheel below the wing. Both aircraft were successfully flown in a large number of Italian national competitions. After World War II the Vizzola 2 was flown by the SIAI Marchetta Gliding Club at Vergiate.

Although not formally articulated until 2001, the model has its origins in 19th century conservation movements, the near extinction of several species of wildlife (including the American Bison) and the rise of sportsmen with the middle class. Beginning in the 1860s sportsmen began to organize and advocate for the preservation of wilderness areas and wildlife. The North American Model of Wildlife Conservation rests on two basic principles – fish and wildlife are for the non-commercial use of citizens, and should be managed such that they are available at optimum population levels forever. Significance The North American model has no direct legal powers, but rather has become the basis for policies developed by the Boone and Crockett Club, the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, The Wildlife Society, and other conservation groups. The model has been widely accepted by wildlife professionals, incorporated into U.S. state agencies, and endorsed by professional organizations and teaching institutions. Tenets The core principles of the Model are elaborated upon in the seven major tenets: # Wildlife as Public Trust Resources # Elimination of Markets for Game # Allocation of Wildlife by Law # Wildlife Should Only be Killed for a Legitimate Purpose # Wildlife is Considered an International Resource # Science is the Proper Tool for Discharge of Wildlife Policy # Democracy of Hunting Wildlife as Public Trust Resources In the North American Model, wildlife is held in the public trust. This means that fish and wildlife are held by the public through state and federal governments. In other words, though an individual may own the land upon which wildlife resides, that individual does not own said wildlife. Instead, the wildlife is owned by all citizens. With origins in Roman times and English Common law, the public trust doctrine has at its heart the 1842 Supreme Court ruling Martin V. Waddell. Elimination of Markets for Game Commercial hunting and the sale of wildlife is prohibited to ensure the sustainability of wildlife population. This principle holds that unregulated economic markets for game and non-game wildlife are unacceptable because they privatize a common resource and lead to declines. The Lacey Act of 1900 effectively made market hunting illegal in the United States, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 provided international protections from the market. Allocation of Wildlife by Law Wildlife is allocated to the public by law, as opposed to market principles, land ownership, or other status. Democratic processes and public input into law-making help ensure access is equitable. Laws regulating access to wildlife include the 1940 Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Endangered Species Preservation Act and Fur Seal Act of 1966, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Wildlife Should Only be Killed for a Legitimate Purpose Under the North American Model, the killing of game must be done only for food, fur, self-defense, and the protection of property (including livestock). In other words, it is broadly regarded as unlawful and unethical to kill fish or wildlife (even with a license) without making all reasonable effort to retrieve and make reasonable use of the resource. Wildlife is Considered an International Resource As wildlife do not exist only within fixed political boundaries, effective management of these resources must be done internationally, through treaties and the cooperation of management agencies. Science is the Proper Tool for Discharge of Wildlife Policy The North American Model recognizes science as a basis for informed management and decision-making processes. This tenet draws from the writings of Aldo Leopold, who in the 1930s called for a wildlife conservation movement facilitated by trained wildlife biologists that made decisions based on facts, professional experience, and commitment to shared underlying principles, rather than strictly interests of hunting, stocking, or culling of predators. Science in wildlife policy includes studies of population dynamics, behavior, habitat, adaptive management, and national surveys of hunting and fishing. Democracy of Hunting This tenet is inspired by Theodore Roosevelt's idea that open access to hunting would result in many benefits to society. This tenet supports access to firearms and the hunting industry, of which much funding for conservation is derived. Criticism Some authors have questioned whether the North America Model is inclusive of all wildlife conservation interests or exclusively narrow in its application. The North American model has also been criticized as presenting an \\"inadequate history\\" and prescribing \\"inadequate ethics\\" of conservation, and in giving recreational hunting disproportionate credit for its role in conservation. Critics say some tenets are flawed or misguided, for example that the tenet Elimination of Markets for Game overlooks the conservation success of Europe- where wildlife is privatized and commercialized- and ignores the role of sustainable harvest strategies, or that some hunting activity may be inherently contradictory to the tenet Wildlife Should Only be Killed for a Legitimate Purpose. Much debate has occurred over the tenet Science is the Proper Tool for Discharge of Wildlife Policy. Some authors suggest that by and large the scientific foundation is missing from the process of managing wildlife. However, their interpretation of \\"science-based management\\" has been challenged as being too limiting to encompass the nuances of wildlife management in North America.

IWXXM includes XML/GML-based representations for products standardized in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex III and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) No. 49, Vol II, such as METAR/SPECI, TAF, SIGMET, AIRMET, Tropical Cyclone Advisory, Volcanic Ash Advisory and Space Weather Advisory. IWXXM products are used for operational exchanges of meteorological information for use in aviation. Unlike the traditional forms of the ICAO Annex III / WMO No. 49 products, IWXXM is not intended to be directly used by pilots. IWXXM is designed to be consumed by software acting on behalf of pilots, such as display software. History IWXXM Version 1 was introduced in October 2013, representing METAR, SPECI, TAF and SIGMET formats as specified in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex III, Amendment 76. IWXXM became an optional format for the bilateral exchange of weather reports in November 2013 when the amendment became applicable. The seventeenth WMO Congress approved IWXXM 1.1, a WMO standard data representation to be included in the new Volume I.3 of WMO-No. 306, Manual on Codes. IWXXM Version 2 was issued in August 2016 with the introduction of new products including AIRMET, Tropical Cyclone Advisory and Volcanic Ash Advisory, loads of improvements and bug fixes. Supported by the sixteenth session of the WMO Commission for Basic System in 2016, a slightly revised version IWXXM 2.1 has been approved by the sixty-ninth WMO Executive Council in May 2017. A patch (IWXXM Version 2.1.1) had been released and approved in Nov 2017 to fix minor issues on validation and examples. IWXXM Version 3 was first made available as version 3.0RC1 in July 2018. Major changes include restructuring and simplifying with the removal of Observations and Measurements model (O&M;), addition of the new Space Weather Advisory and other changes with regard to Amendment 78 to ICAO Annex 3, and numerous fixes and enhancements. IWXXM 3.0RC2 was released in October 2018 for further comments. Another release candidate IWXXM 3.0RC3 was released in April 2019. Approval was received in October 2019 and IWXXM 3.0RC4 was released before publishing of the finalized version on 7 November 2019. IWXXM Version 3.1 is being prepared to meet the new requirements in Amendments 79 to ICAO Annex 3. Approval to this version is expected to be obtained by mid-2021. Regulation IWXXM is regulated by WMO in association with ICAO. IWXXM is defined at the technical regulation level in WMO No.306 Volume I.3WMO No.306 Volume I.3, Manual on Codes Part D - Representations derived from data models to meet the regulatory requirements described in WMO Technical Regulation No. 49 Vol II or ICAO Annex III. Another document ICAO Doc 10003ICAO Doc 10003, Manual on the Digital Exchange of Aeronautical Meteorological Information is also available to provide a high level description of the model. Development The WMO Commission for Observation, Infrastructures and Information Systems (INFCOM) Task Team on Aviation Data or TT-AvData (previously Commission for Basic System (CBS) Task Team on Aviation XML or TT-AvXML) and ICAO Meteorological Panel (METP) Working Group on Meteorological Information Exchange (WG-MIE) are involved in the development of IWXXM. The Google group \\"CBS TT-AvXML\\" was created to collect feedback from users. A GitHub repository https://github.com/wmo-im/iwxxm has been created to engage community participation.

Biography Arnan \\"Sini\\" Azaryahu was an officer in the general staff of the Palmach, a leader in the Kibbutz Hameuchad movement, and later a senior aide and confidant to Minister Yisrael Galili. Sini was born in 1917 in Haifa to Sarah and Yosef Azaryahu, teachers and Zionists who were among the founders of Tel Aviv. In 1941, Sini was recruited by the Palmach, a Mandate-era Jewish fighting force. He was cultural and education officer just two years later, a position that he held until the Palmach's dissolution in 1949. Sini also served as Galili's adjutant officer while he was head of the national headquarters of the Haganah, a Jewish defense organization during the British Mandate that became the backbone of the Israeli Defense Force after independence. He held the same position under General Yigal Allon along the southern front of the War of 1948. After independence, Sini joined the secretariat of the Hakibbutz Hameuchad, a part of the Kibbutz Movement associated with the Achdut Ha'Avodah party. He became an envoy to the United States in this capacity in the late 1950s. Though Sini was not a member of the narrow group around Prime Minister Ben Gurion that had given birth to the nuclear project, his close relationship with many top Israeli security officials, especially Munya Mardor and Galili, gave him an inside look at some key junctions in Israel's nuclear history. In 1962 Sini prepared a memo for Galili for the first closed-door Israeli top- level strategic conference on the nuclear program that Ben Gurion conducted. The compromise policy that Ben Gurion ultimately adopted in the wake of that conference may have planted the seeds of Israel's nuclear opacity policy. Sini also often discussed nuclear issues in meetings with officials, such as his conversations with Munya Mardor, the director of RAFAEL, after the Six-Day War, and with Galili before and after the Yom Kippur War of 1973. After the Likud party gained power in 1977, Sini left his role in the government. Two years later, he founded the Galilee Center in Yad Tabenkin, which focused on security issues.

History=Establishment In the late 19th century, Mogadishu was under the joint control of the Somali Geledi Sultanate (which, also holding sway over the Shebelle region in the interior, was at the height of its power) and the Omani Sultan of Zanzibar.I. M. Lewis, A modern history of Somalia: nation and state in the Horn of Africa, (Westview Press: 1988), p.38 Mogadishu was thereafter made the capital of the newly established Italian Somaliland colony. On 5 April 1908, the Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops was established, after the Italians had captured the southern Benadir region from the Sultan of Zanzibar.Ben-Ghiat, Ruth, Italy and its colonies, in A historical companion to postcolonial literatures: continental Europe and Africa, Poddar, Prem, Patke, Rejeev S. and Jensen, Lars eds., Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2008, p. 310Olsen, James Stuart and Shadle, Robert, eds., Historical dictionary of European imperialism, Westport, Conn.: 1991, Greenwood Press, p. 567 The troops were originally referred to as \\"Guard Corps of Benadir\\" (Corpo della Guardia di Benadir in Italian). However, after the territory was renamed from Benadir Coast Italian Protectorate to Italian Somaliland, the troops officially became known as the Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops. In 1908, the Royal Corps assumed the final name 'Regio corpo truppe coloniali della Somalia italiana. This included a command, a department of Zaptie, 5 local companies, and a company of local cannon-gunners. In 1907, the rebels Bimal lost again at Dongab and Danane, defeated by 500 Somali troops and Eritrean Ascari under Captain Vitali. The forces were supported by the Royal ship N \\"Relay\\". Between 11 and 12 July 1908, troops led by mayor Antonino Di Giorgio conquereded the city of Merca, after clashing with rebels in Merére and occupying Afgooye. Following a series of Italian victories, the Sultan of Geledi and his 5,000 strong army were subdued. Somaliland Campaign The British became convinced of their need of Italian assistance in their campaign against the Dervish forces of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (called \\"The Mad Mullah\\" by the British). However, memories of the disastrous Battle of Adowa inhibited any Italian fervour for action in the Horn region. In 1903, the Italian Foreign Ministry permitted the British to land forces at Hobyo (Obbia). An Italian naval commander off Hobyo feared \\"that the expedition will end in a fiasco; the Mad Mullah will become a myth for the British, who will never come across him, and a serious worry for ... our sphere of influence.\\"Commander of the torpedo-gunboat Caprera on 14 March, quoted in Hess (1964), 421. The Sultanate of Hobyo's cavalry and fort. The relationship between the Sultanate of Hobyo and Italy soured when Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid refused the Italians' proposal to allow British troops to disembark in his Sultanate so that they might then pursue their battle against Hassan's Dervish forces. Viewed as too much of a threat by the Italians, Kenadid was exiled first to the British-controlled Aden Protectorate, and then to Italian Eritrea, as was his son Ali Yusuf, the heir apparent to his throne.Sheik-ʻAbdi (1993), 129 In May, the British Foreign Office realised the error, and had Kenadid's son appointed regent, just in time to forestall an attack in Mudug by the Sultan's army.Hess (1964), 421. The expedition ended in failure soon after. Hassan defeated a British detachment near Gumburru and then another near Daratoleh. With 1,200–1,500 rifles, 4,000 ponies and some spearmen, he occupied the Nugal Valley from Halin in the British protectorate to Ilig (or Illig) on the Italian-held coast. The main British force near Galad (Galadi) under General William Manning retreated north along the line Bohotleh–Burao–Sheekh. This \\"old-established line\\" had already been breached by Hassan when he invaded the Nugal.Cunliffe-Owen (1905), 169. By the end of June, the withdrawal was complete. In 1925, the Dubats were established. These irregular Somali troops initially served under major Camillo Bechis as guerrilla forces of the Royal Corps, sometimes using camels. The troops mainly operated in the Ogaden region. Second Italo-Ethiopian War & Italian East Africa Group of Zaptié in Italian Somaliland (1939). During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the Somali Colonial Troops served alongside soldiers from Italy and Eritrea in a second attempt by Italian troops to defeat the Ethiopian forces. In the Battle of the Ogaden, commanded by General Luigi Frusci who was to move forward to the pivotal point of the \\"Hindenburg Wall\\" of Ethiopian defenses under Wehib Pasha (a military advisor to the Ethiopian army), the Royal Corps of Somali Colonial troops in April 1936 fought bravely defeating the Ethiopian troops. They received an Italian \\"Military Gold Medal\\" award mainly for this victory. On 5 May 1936, Italian troops captured Addis Ababa after defeating Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. Benito Mussolini then proclaimed the establishment of Italian East Africa, which unified Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland with defeated Ethiopia. Addis Ababa was later made the capital city of Italian East Africa. The Somali Colonial Troops would then be merged with other Royal troops, creating even the Italian African Police and the Somali \\"Carabinieri\\" (ZaptieMuntaz (corporal) Unatù Endisciau of the LXXII Zaptié (I° Gruppo Carabinieri) Battalion was the only \\"soldier of colour\\" to be awarded personally the Italian Gold Medal of Military Valor - ( Article of Arnaldo Grilli on the first two years of World War II (in Italian))).

The land acquired within the boundaries of the Path Grant allowed Daniel Boone to develop the Wilderness Road free from attack or claims by the Cherokee. The Path Grant was recorded on November 15, 1794 by the Hawkins County, Tennessee registrar in Deed Book #1, pages 147-151 The Path Grant lands are located in North East Tennessee and South West Virginia  Notes on the Path Deed Elements and Structure  The Path Grant deed Hawkins County Tennessee Registrar of Deeds, \\"Book 1\\", pages 147-151 is an indenture conveying a tract of property in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia known as the Path Grant from/by the Cherokee people to nine individuals collectively known as Richard Henderson and company. The indenture was drawn on an unstated day in March 1775 and recorded on November 15, 1794. The document is said to be the Path Deed because it represents the sale of land that is a route to an even larger tract of ground known as the Great Grant or the Transylvania Purchase. Were it not for the Path, it would not be possible to travel to the Great Grant without passing or trespassing on Cherokee land. In the Hawkins County Office of the Registrar of Deeds, it is referred to as \\"The Indian Deed\\" The negotiations and transaction took place in March 1775 at the Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga river known as the Fort Watauga. The date of the signing and conveyance of the Great Grant is thought to be March 17, 1775. In addition to the Great Grant Deed, three other grants were made by the Cherokee to the Richard Henderson & company and other purchasers noted on the deeds. These are known as the Path Grant Deed, the Charles Robertson Grant Deed for the Watauga settlements and the Jacob Brown Grant Deeds for the Nolichucky settlements.Hamer,Philip M.

It was filled in as 17 by another hand at a later date. In the absence of the deeds for the Watauga and Nolichucky grants, the persons to whom the property was conveyed is not known. There is evidence Hamer, PhillipM. Phd Tennessee A History 1675-1932Italic text The American Historical Society 1935 Vol 1 page 71 that the three minor grants were made on days immediately subsequent to the Great Grant date. The 17th of March 1775 might be a day or so early. For record purposes, the actual date is now fixed as March 17. The drafter of the Path Deed structured the document by using elements or clauses as the building blocks. These clauses were part of deeds drafted at the time and are in use to the present. The clauses in conventional order are the parties clause, the recital, the testatum or consideration clause, The habenum or tenants in common clause, the parcels clause, the tenatum, the redendum clause, the warranty, the covenants and the testimonium.  The Parties Clause  The grantors, the conveying parties, were represented by three chiefs of the Cherokee's being Alla Cullocullah, Oconistoto, and Savanooko, being the representatives appointed by the warriors and other head men on behalf of the whole nation. The grantees were Richard Henderson, Thomas Hart, Nathan Hart, John Williams, John Lutterell, William Johnson, James Hagg (Hogg), David Hart and Leonard Bullock, all said to be of the province of North Carolina. These nine individuals are the same that are noted as being pardners in the Transylvania Co agreement dated January 1775.Henderson & Co. Covenants, Partnership Agreement , January 1775, Henderson County Historical and Genealogical Society  The Recital Clause  The grantors are said to be in accordance with current law, to hold the aboriginal title and sole owners since the beginning of time. That is, the Cherokee nation owns the property and has the right to sell it. The property owned is described as all that south of the Ohio River from the mouth of the Tennessee River north and east to the mouth of the Canaway River. The south eastern boundary is the treaty point that lies Holston River six miles east of the Long Island.  The Testatum or Consideration  The Cherokee received ten thousand pounds lawful money of Great Britain in consideration for the sale of the lands.  The Habenum or Tenants in Common clause  The afore mentioned Richard Henderson, Thomas Hart, Nathan Hart, John Williams, John Lutterell, William Johnson, James Hagg (Hogg), David Hart and Leonard Bullock are spelled out and their respective ownership shares are defined. They are Tenants in Common and not Joint Tenants. The joint tenancy title passes to heirs and assigns on the death of the person noted.  The Parcels Clause  The parcel being granted/conveyed is described in accordance with North Carolina law current at the timePrice, Henry R \\"Melungeons: The Vanishing Colony of Newman's Ridge\\" American Studies of Association 1966 citing Overton's Supreme Court records Volume II 1814, page 412 The South Eastern corner is the only corner point of the Path Grant that can be established with certainty. That point is on the Donaldson survey line on the Holston river six miles east of the Long Island. It can be positively located as being the point where the Holston River intersects with the parallel of latitude at 36° 30'.Tennessee Valley Authority \\"Navigation Map Fort Patrick Henry Reservoir South Fork Holston River 1953 \\" The parcel boundary then follows the treaty line northeasterly until it meets the line of Powell's Mountain curving easterly from the High Knob. The boundary then trends southwesterly until the end of the Powell's Mountain ridge line. The course then extends southerly to the south west corner on the Holston River. The point where it intersects the river is thought to be the current intersection of the Hawkins, Hamblen and Grainger, Tennessee county lines. The boundary then follows the Holston river northeasterly to the point where the river meets the Virginia line of 36° 30' and along that line to the starting point on the treaty line. The messuage includes not only the land described but all buildings and improvements. The word messauge is a term of art used by drafters of deeds to make note of the fact that all improvements, buildings and structures are conveyed along with the land. The Tenatum The Cherokee give up the right to the grant and all rights are transferred to have and to hold by Richard Henderson and Co.  The Redendum  Curiously the grant was in effect a sale of the described lands but the Cherokee were to receive a yearly rent of 4 pence. The deed format at the time provides for the redendum and the rent was apparently set at a very low amount.  The Warranty  The sale is made in fee simple with no conditions mortgage or limit on the use or water course.  The Covenants  The grantees shall have peaceable use of the grant with no molestation or hindrance by the Cherokee. The Cherokee will have no claims on the grant.  The Testimonium  The indenture states that the Cherokee have true and lawful attorneys being Joseph Martin and John Farror who are presumed to have approved the language of the deed. The deed was signed by Joseph Vann, Linquester, who was the Royal Interpreter for the crown.Jefferson Papers page 11,img 767 The document is signed, sealed and delivered as marked by the three chiefs noted as Alla Cullocullah, Oconistoto, and Savanooko otherwise Coronok. The marks are witnessed by Wm. Bailey Smith, George Lumpkin, Thos Houghton, Caselton Brooks, John Bacon, Tilman Dixon, Valentine Servy, and Thomas Price.  Analysis = The Description Of The Grant  To grasp the scope of the Path Grant, it can be considered as a five sided irregular polygon lying along the valleys of the Clinch and Holston Rivers. The graphic is a map of the property described in the Path Grant Deed The long southerly boundary is the Holston River. The long northerly boundary is Powell's Mountain ridge line that lies adjacent to a section of the Great Grant boundaryLibrary of Congress, American Memory , The Thomas Jefferson Papers Series 1 . General Correspondence 1657-1827 .Richard Henderson, et al To Virginia Convention page 11 ( 767) and the Powell's River valley leading to Cumberland Gap. That is to say, a portion of the Path Grant long Powell's mountain boundary is contiguous with the Great Grant boundary. The Wilderness Road envisioned by Daniel Boone began at the Holston River settlements at the present day Kingsport Tennessee, traversed up into Virginia through the Moccasin Gap of Clinch Mountain and thence across Powell's Mountain to the Powell's River valley. The Path Grant provided ownership transfer of the contested Holston River settlements and the Cherokee lands that must be crossed to reach the Powell's River valley and the Great Grant lands. When the description of the Path Grant is considered it seems somewhat vague except for one point specifically described. That point is on the Holston River six miles east of the Long Island, where Holston River crosses the Virginia line.The red line is the Latitude 36° 30\\" line NC/Va border extended west by the Donaldson Survey. The Blue line is the western Virginia border established by the Lochaber Treaty. That line extends northerly to the mouth of the Kanawa River at Point Pleasant on the Ohio River. The point of intersection in the middle of the Holston River is 6 miles upstream from the Long Island of the Holston. It is the corner of both the Path Grant and the Watauga Purchases of March 1775. The Treaty of Lochaber in 1771Treaty of Lochaber established the point in question and was made as part of the Donaldson survey establishing a revised western border for the Virginia Colony. A survey was made by Col. Donaldson including Cherokee members of the survey party, that established the survey line from the point on the North Carolina/ Virginia border to a point at Point Pleasant, West Virginia where the Kanawha river meets the Ohio river. That is the same set of points and the line noted in the Path deed recital. The point six miles from the Long Island is thus not dependent on how to measure six miles on a meandering river but is fixed by the river and the Latitude 36° 30'. Today that point is fixed as 36° 30' north latitude 82° 29' west longitude. The point is the center of the Holston River that is now Fort Patrick Henry Lake within the boundary of Warriors Path State Park.Tennessee Valley Authority \\"Navigation Map Fort Patrick Henry Reservoir South Fork Holston River\\" 1953 There is no structure or other man made feature marking the point. The present day Virginia/Tennessee line is north of this point and no longer 36° 30' north latitude. The Lochaber Treaty point shown is on the Holston River where it intersects the parallel of 36° 30' north latitude. The point is 6 miles upstream from the Long Island of the Holston and is within the current boundaries of Warrior's Path State Park near Kingsport, Tennessee. At this location, The Holston River is the Tennessee Valley Authority Fort Patrick Henry Reservoir. The point is approximately 200 yards upstream from the Hemlock Bridge. The Yellow Treaty Line extends to the Ohio River at the mouth of the Kanawah River at Point Pleasant West Virginia. The red line is looking due east along latitude 36° 30' Additionally, the Lochaber Treaty point is not to be confused with a second intersection of the Holston river and the parallel of latitude 36° 30' further down stream and also noted in the Path Grant. It is considered not possible to determine the polygon's short southwestern boundary line with certainty. A precise description was finessed by the negotiators with 14 words. \\"beginning on the Holston River where the courses of Powell Mountain crosses the same\\" The line is said to follow the course of Powell's mountain to the Holston river. The course of Powells mountain however does not intersect the Holston river. When considered with the boundary of the Great Grant, the south western boundary becomes apparent. The Path Grant short southwestern boundary is an extension of the Great Grant line extending from the southern end of Powell's Mountain to a point just west of Cumberland Gap. That point is the current intersection of the borders of Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee. The complete line for both grants thus extends from the intersection of the three counties on the Holston River as noted above northward to the point of intersection of three states on Cumberland Mountain just west of the Cumberland Gap.. A major route, referred to often as the Great War Path, traverses northeasterly through the Holston River Valley. At Bean Station, Tennessee junction, a trail extends northward across Clinch Mountain at Bean's Gap and onward to the Cumberland Gap.http://www.trigenweb.org/cessions/trans.app.gif It includes the important way point and junction Bean's Station. That route is an alternate Path into the Cumberland Gap and Great Grant lands. Similarly, the short Northern polygon boundary is not described with certainty. The line northward is on the Lochaber treaty line to the top ridge of Powell's Mountain. The top ridge is presumed to be the ridge line of High Knob that curves eastward over to the Lochaber Treaty line and the north east grant corner. Although some of the description is somewhat vague, some is quite specific. The course of Holston river as it meanders is the polygon's long southern line until it strikes the extension of the Lochaber Treaty survey line. The line then follows that 36° 30' Donaldson's survey line to the point 6 miles from Long Island (Tennessee). By ceasing to follow the Holston river to the treaty line point some land south of the river was included in the Path Grant. Until March 1775 deed date, land south of the Holston river in the vicinity was unsettled and was Cherokee. The most immediate land that comes to view on the map today is The Long Island of The Holston River. The Long Island was important, even sacred to the Cherokee. This very specific line included in a deed with other very long and nonspecific lines makes it a very important departure from the geographically defined borders. The Cherokee sold the Long Island as a part of the Path Grant. If that is the reason, then Dragging Canoe's opposition justification takes on merit. The long northern boundary of the polygon is the ridge line of Powell's Mountain from its beginning on the south end to the high point at High Knob. The Reason For The Path Grant The purpose of the 9 man syndicate that was Henderson and Co was to purchase the lands of the Great Grant known as the Transylvania Colony from the Cherokee. Those lands are located within what is now Kentucky and Middle Tennessee. The syndicate needed a way, a route, a path into those Transylvania Colony lands. At that time, in 1775, the western border of Virginia extended down the Holston River Valley to the noted point on the south fork of the Holston River that was 6 miles up stream from the Long Island. At that point the land to the west was owned by the Cherokee. The route down the Holston River valley was easily traversed. There were actually settlers, perhaps illegal settlers, living adjacent or nearby to the Long Island. What was needed was a route from this location to the Transylvania lands. That route was across Cherokee lands and subject to all sorts of possible problems with the Cherokee. There was a need to secure that route and the method was to purchase those lands in addition to the Great Grant Transylvania Colony lands. The syndicate hired Daniel Boone to survey and develop the route.Hamer, Philip M. PhD, Tennessee A History 1675- 1932 , The American Historical Society 1935, vol 1 page 71 The route is known presently as the Wilderness Road. That path began at what is now Kingsport Tennessee, north across the North Fork of the Holston into present day Virginia, through the Moccasin Gap of Clinch Mountain, across the Clinch River and thence to Powell's mountain where the Transylvania colony lands began. The result was the Path Grant that secured not only the route to Transylvania colony lands but the Holston River settlements and other settlements on the Clinch River.  Events at the Watauga Treaty Gathering  The parties, 1,200 Cherokee and more than 600 whites, gathered at Sycamore Shoals in March 1775 to negotiate the sale of much of the land that is now Kentucky and which is the subject of the Great Grant Deed. It was necessary to hold a second negotiation for land from the Holston River settlements to the Powell Valley to permit unmolested access to the Great Grant lands. That negotiation resulted in the Path Grant.Alderman,Pat , The Overmountain Men, , Erwin 1958 On March 19, 1775, after the negotiations with the Henderson Co, the lease holders for the Watauga settlements around Sycamore Shoals purchased forever from the Cherokee Nation their leaseholds and Jacob Brown purchased his leasehold for the Nolichucky settlements. John Carter and Robert Lucas purchased the recently acquired Carter's Valley from the Richard Henderson Co.Jefferson Papers page 31 (img 787)Alderman,Pat , The Overmountain Men, Erwin 1958 Others say the Carter property was awarded as payment for damages resulting from the Cherokee attack and burning of his Carter's valley store The result of this series of transactions transferred most of upper east Tennessee from Cherokee ownership to the settlers. A very good and detailed account of all events pertaining to the gathering at the Fort Watauga and the various grants may be found at web books The Conquest of the Old Southwest. Henderson, Archibald, \\"The Conquest Of The Old Southwest\\", http://www.web- books.com/Classics/ON/B0/B866/SouthwestC15.html  The Deed Map  The line of 36° 30' north latitude was established as the Virginia/Carolina border by the king of England in the Carolina Charter of 1655.TNGen Web Project \\"The Carolina Charter of 1655\\" http://www.tngenweb.org/cessions/colonial.html Generally, the Path Grant boundaries include the land laying between Powell's Mountain on the north and the Holston river on the south. The land includes the Clinch River valley and the Holston River Valley. The various corner points and lines can be easily located on Google Earth.  The Consideration For The Grant  Prior to the gathering and negotiations, \\"chief Atta kulla- kulla, a young Buck and a squaw\\" journeyed to North Carolina to view the goods. Their report was favorable and perhaps exaggerated the wealth to be gained from the sale.The Overmountain Men, Pat Alderman, Erwin 1958 page 24 The payment in valuation of 10,000 British Pounds was made in both silver and goods. The description of goods for the Path Grant is said to consist of \\"two thousand weight of leather in goods\\". The potential acquisition of such abundance of unavailable goods proved to be adequate motivation for the chiefs and their people to overcome the opposition of those opposed to the sale of their lands. There is thus some ambiguity between the language of Great Grant and Path Grant deeds and the historical record. The consideration in both the Great Grant and the Path Grant deeds is said to be 10,000 British pounds. The consideration for the Path Grant is said to be two thousand weight of leather in goods. It can be deduced that there was one payment for both grants totaling 10,000 pounds in money and goods and a separate sweetening of two thousand weight of leather. The research does not yield an unambiguous certainty for the total.  The Opposition of Dragging Canoe  When Dragging Canoe made his speech, it can be argued he was not especially opposed to the sale of the lands around what is now Frankfort or Louisville or even Nashville. Dragging Canoe was opposed to selling the lands along the Holston and Watauga and Nolichucky rivers of East Tennessee. He was opposed to the sale of the Long Island of the Holston. He was opposed to the sale of the lands that were the East Tennessee settlements. The basis for that argument is his subsequent action. Dragging Canoe did not lead a military campaign to settlements in Kentucky, he led his forces to the Island Flats of the Holston.Alderman,Pat The Overmountain Men, Erwin 1958 pg 31 Old Abram led a second force to attack the nearby Watauga settlement. One wonders if had they not split their force in a two pronged attack if history would have taken a different course. Had their combined forces prevailed in two engagements, there would have been no force to defeat Patrick Ferguson at Kings Mountain and change the course of the Revolution. On the day of the signing, Dragging Canoe pointed to the west and said \\" A dark cloud hangs over that land known as the bloody grounds\\"Alderman,Pat The Overmountain Men, Erwin 1958 pg 25) Dragging Canoe did not accept the Path Grant Covenants clause noted above.

The school's home zone, in which students residing are automatically entitled to be enrolled, covers much of the central Waimakariri District and the southern Hurunui District.. Searching for Rangiora High School, and then selecting \\"Show Enrolment Zone\\" will show the home zone. Students residing outside the zone are sometimes accepted, as roll places allow in accordance with the enrolment scheme order of preference. At the March 2012 Education Review Office (ERO) review of the school, the school had 1789 students enrolled, including 44 international students. The school roll's gender composition was 49% male and 51% female, and its ethnic composition was 85% New Zealand European (Pākehā), 10% Māori, 3% Asian and 2% other. The school has a socio-economic decile rating of 9 (step Q), meaning it draws its school community from areas of low to moderately-low socio-economic disadvantage when compared to other New Zealand schools. The current decile came into force in January 2015, after a nationwide review of deciles following the 2013 census. Previously, the school had a decile of 8 (step P). Curriculum Rangiora High School has developed a junior curriculum based on the New Zealand Curriculum. In Years 9 and 10 students study Ako, a connected curriculum model which includes English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and Health & Physical Education. Year 9 students also select four half-year elective subjects, which must include one Arts subject, one Technology subject and one Language subject (out of French, Japanese, and Te Reo Māori). Year 10 students also select four half-year electives. In Years 11 to 13, students complete the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), the main secondary school qualification in New Zealand. Levels 1, 2 and 3 of NCEA are usually completed in Years 11, 12 and 13 respectively, although students can choose subjects from different levels depending on their progress through the NCEA level system. In Year 11, students study English, Mathematics, Science or Agricultural Science, and three full-year elective subjects. Students in Year 12 study six full-year elective subjects. Students in Year 13 study five full- year elective subjects, with study for an additional four periods per week. Because the 25-period-per-week school timetable is not evenly divisible into six subject lines, students in Years 11 to 13 spend the last period on Wednesdays either in supervised study or sport practice. Rangiora High School has a school farm, which is used to teach land-based studies. Set up in 1910, it started out running stock and growing crops, before being officially opened in November 1930 by Lord Bledisloe, the then Governor-General. In 2013, 89.0 percent of students leaving Rangiora High held at least NCEA Level 1, 81.4 percent held at least NCEA Level 2, and 49.9 percent held at least University Entrance. This is compared to 85.2%, 74.2%, and 49.0% respectively for all students nationally. Co-curricular=School houses Rangiora High School is divided into six houses, each containing approximately 300 students and 25 staff. Houses also provide a basis for inter-house competition in sport and cultural activities. The houses are named for New Zealanders who have achieved distinction in their respective areas.

Life=Early life in Europe - 1898–1928 Dienes was born Sarolta Maria Anna Chylinska on 8 October 1898, in Debreczen, Austria-Hungary. Her father, Lovag Gyorgy Chylinski (b.1861), was descended from Irish and Polish nobility. Her mother, Etelka Stegmüller (1870–1932), was of Swiss and German parentage and was a relative of the celebrated opera singer Etelka Gerster (1855–1920). As a child she studied piano, before turning to dance, training in Budapest with Valéria Dienes (1879–1978), a disciple of Raymond Duncan. In 1919 she became romantically involved with Valéria Dienes’ husband Paul Dienes (1882–1952), a mathematician and poet, who headed a commission to reform university education during Béla Kun’s short- lived Hungarian Soviet Republic. Following the collapse of the revolutionary government, Paul fled to Vienna in 1920, where Sari joined him before moving to Paris. They married in July 1922 and moved to Aberystwyth in Wales, where Paul Dienes was appointed a lecturer in mathematics at Aberystwyth University. In the following year the couple moved to Swansea and then, in 1929, to London, where Paul Dienes headed the mathematics department at Birkbeck College. London and Paris - 1928–1939 Between c.1928 and c.1935 Dienes studied fine art in Paris with Fernand Léger and Amédée Ozenfant at the Académie Moderne, with André Lhote, and with Ozenfant at the Académie Ozenfant. She was appointed assistant director of the Ozenfant Academy of Fine Arts London in 1936. Dienes recruited the school’s first students, Leonora Carrington and Stella Snead, and employed Henry Moore to teach a course in modeling in clay at the school in 1938. New York and Japan - 1939–1960 In September 1939 Dienes travelled to New York for a brief visit but was prevented from returning to Europe by the outbreak of the Second World War. She helped Ozenfant establish his new art school at 208 East 20th Street in New York, where she taught until 1941. With Ozenfant's help, Dienes attempted to find a teaching position for her husband at an American university but was unsuccessful; Paul Dienes remained in England, where he died in 1952. Dienes later taught drawing and composition at the Parsons School of Design and the Brooklyn Museum Art School. Around this time she befriended abstract painters Mark Rothko and Theodoros Stamos, the composer John Cage and choreographer Merce Cunningham. From the mid-1950s Dienes attended D.T. Suzuki’s weekly afternoon lectures on Zen Buddhism at Columbia University together with composers Earle Brown, John Cage and Morton Feldman and Jackson Mac Low, artists Ray Johnson, and Isamu Noguchi, often followed by a soirée at her 57th Street studio. From 1949 through 1952 she created prints at the Atelier 17 studio. From the spring of 1957 until December 1958 Dienes lived in Japan, where she studied ceramics with master potter Teruo Hara. Through Noguchi, she befriended the industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi, who wrote that, \\"Her work has great vision, grandeur rather than beauty: overwhelming by the vigorous power flowing forth from within ... poetry wrung from the body.'Kenmochi quoted in the invitation to Dienes' exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery, Sept-Oct 1959, Betty Parsons Gallery Papers, Archives of American Art, Washington, D.C. She had solo exhibitions in Kyoto and Tokyo. Stony Point/NYC 1961–1992 In 1961 Dienes moved to the Gate Hill Cooperative at Stony Point, New York, a rural community established in 1954 by Paul and Vera Williams. Her neighbors there included John Cage, the writer and potter M.C. Richards, the pianist David Tudor, the ceramicist Karen Karnes, the sculptor David Weinrib, the filmmaker Stan VanDerBeek, and the early music champion LaNoue Davenport. Dienes was a founding member of the woman-owned and operated A.I.R. Gallery founded in 1972, and in 1976 was presented with the International Women’s Year Award for her contributions to the art world. In 1977 Dienes helped establish the downtown pub, The Ear Inn with Rip Hayman and Paco Underhill, which became her New York City home base. Dienes lived at Stony Point until her death in 1992. Career=Pioneer of assemblage A three-month trip to Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah in 1947 had a profound effect on Dienes' aesthetic, as she later recalled: 'Experiencing the natural formations as pieces of sculpture changed my whole attitude to life, to art.'Dienes quoted in: Joan Arbeiter, 'Chance and Change in the Art of Sari Dienes’, Women’s Art Journal, vol. 7. no. 2, (Fall/Winter 1986-7), pp. 27-31. The stark beauty of the desert landscape, together with her studies of Zen Buddhism, allowed her to see the artistic potential in her surroundings, inspiring her to assemble works of art from found materials. The New York Times review of her show at the Carlebach Gallery in April 1948 noted the inclusion of ‘ingenious surrealist shock objects composed of driftwood and sea shell fragments’.'A Group and Singly', The New York Times, 18 April 1948. She was soon using all manner of natural and man-made detritus in her works. Reviewing her exhibition Found Objects and Constructions at Mills College in The Village Voice in February 1956 John Wilcock listed some of the components of her sculptures: ‘a rusty garbage-can lid, considerably battered; chips off a pine cone which look like ducks on a pond, a mannequin’s leg in a whiskey bottle topped with a seashell; about one-third of a shovel, which looks like a bird; an automobile hubcap, dented by passing trucks; innumerable pieces of well-rounded charred driftwood, burned orange crates, and scorched easels; and an enormous sheet of rusted metal (“we had to cart it home in a taxi”) which resembles a map of ancient Egypt.’John Wilcock, ‘Boulevard Beachcomber’, The Village Voice, 15 February 1956, p. 2. In 1956 Dienes began to construct complex assemblages of glass bottles held together with epoxy resin, which she called 'Bottle Gardens'. The writer and ceramicist M.C. Richards wrote that Dienes' 'bottle sculptures rehearse for us that radiant void of which the sages speak. Forms press forth invisibly. The glass captures their reflections, and we think we see multiple dwellings for a genie, quiet seas for small ships, messengers from floating islands of light and color.\\"M.C. Richards, ‘The Bottle Gardens of Sari Dienes’, Craft Horizons, no. 22 (1962), pp. 24-25. Dienes' pioneering role in assemblage was acknowledged by her inclusion in the American Federation of Arts touring exhibition Art and the Found Object in 1959 and The Art of Assemblage at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1961. In 1964 Dienes created an assemblage on a grand scale in her mixed-media installation A Surrounding at the Smolin Gallery, New York, a labyrinth of plastic sheeting, netting, charred wood, ropes, lighting elements and a zebra skin. Dienes continued to work with found materials throughout her career, using driftwood, shells, bones, seed pods, bottles and mirrored glass, tin cans and other scrap metal, and impermanent materials such as flower petals and tumble-dryer lint. Her large-scale installation Bone Fall of 1973, comprising a cascade of animal bones collected over a twenty-five-year period, was later followed by Glass Fall and Shell Fall. Sidewalk Rubbings At a residency at Yaddo artists’ retreat at Saratoga Springs in the spring of 1953, Dienes made a large number of monoprints by taking rubbings from textured surfaces using a printmaker’s brayer. Back in New York in the summer of 1953 she began taking rubbings of the sidewalks, subway gratings and other urban features on very large sheets of paper or Webril. As she told The Village Voice in 1956: ‘About 5 o’clock on Sunday mornings is the best time because there aren’t as many hecklers, and traffic is light. I take those big sheets of paper that photographers use but I have to keep a firm hold or they blow away. Sometimes I take rubbings of cracks in the sidewalk and sometimes I take rubbings of rubbings.’Dienes quoted in: John Wilcock, ‘Boulevard Beachcomber’, The Village Voice, 15 February 1956, p. 2. Dienes sometimes enlisted the aid of younger artists Rachel Rosenthal, Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.Rachel Rosenthal, interviewed by Gerard Forde, Los Angeles, 12 October 2012. Cited in Natalie McKinney Metzger, Closer To Life: The Work of Sari Dienes, Master’s Research Paper, Faculty of the School of Art and Art History, University of Denver, 2013. Johns later recalled assisting Dienes: ‘After finishing my work at a bookstore on 57th Street, I used to visit Sari, who lived nearby. After midnight we would go out on 6th Avenue and she would work over the cracked street and various cast-iron manhole covers. I was responsible for keeping the sometimes enormous sheets of fabric or paper that she used from blowing away.’Jasper Johns, letter to Barbara Pollitt, 1 June 2011. ‘She was very uninhibited, I thought. People would come up and ask what was going on, and she would talk as she continued to work, in the middle of the street.’Jasper Johns, quoted in: Barbaralee Diamonstein Spielvogel, Inside the Art World: Conversations with Barbaralee Diamonstein (New York: Rizzoli, 1994), reprinted in Kirk Varnedoe (ed.), Jasper Johns: Writings, Sketchbook Notes, Interviews (New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1996), p. 294. Dienes’ ‘Sidewalk Rubbings’ were featured in solo exhibitions at the Betty Parsons Gallery in April–May 1954 and November–December 1955, in the windows of the New York department store Bonwit Teller in July 1955, and at the Contemporaries Gallery in New York in 1959. Reviewing an exhibition of Dienes' work at Gump's Gallery in San Francisco in 1957, noted critic Alfred Frankenstein described her rubbings as follows: 'A circular saw and various spiky forms lead to a sunflower as eloquent as any of Van Gogh's, but most of the pictures are not as specifically representational as that. Manhole covers, perforated steel plates, boards, sidewalk grilles and other surfaces have been drawn upon for a series of designs laying stress on the movement of rectilinear and circular forms and on exquisitely sensitive resonances of color and tone.Alfred Frankenstein, San Francisco Chronicle, 1957. Textile designs Dienes’ rubbings technique was well suited to surface printing techniques and in the 1950s she enjoyed a successful career as a textile designer, producing designs for L. Anton Maix Fabrics, the Associated American Artists Galleries and Jack Lenor Larsen. Her designs Tree Saw and Circles, the latter created by the imprint of egg cartons, were included in the exhibition Design by the Yard: Textile Printing from 800 to 1956 at the Cooper Union in New York in 1956. Fluxus and performances Dienes was closely associated with many of the artists around Fluxus, including Yoko Ono and Nam June Paik, and collaborated on numerous musical performances and theatrical events. In 1964 she performed in Hruslk an opera by Dick Higgins and Philip Corner at the Café Au Go Go in New York. Throughout the 1970s she contributed works to the Annual Avant Garde Festivals of New York organized by Charlotte Moorman, and collaborated with Charlie Morrow, Simone Forti, Rip Hayman, Jackson MacLow, Pauline Oliveros and Alison Knowles. Ceaseless experimentation Dienes continued to experiment with materials into her seventies and eighties, exploring such divergent paths as the emergent colour Xerox technology and painting on snow. Interviewed in 1980, she expressed a completely open attitude to the creative process: ‘In the 1930s, all I cared about was technique. I studied drawing every day from 9 to 5. I've completely changed. My art is very much like having a baby. You can't plan how big it will be or what color eyes it will have. It is what it is. Technique can be taught, but knowing the human anatomy will not make you a better artist.’Dienes quoted in: Michael Heaton, ‘Like Any Other Masterpiece, Sari Dienes Seems to Improve with Age’, People magazine, vol. 13, no. 22, 2 June 1980. In the 1980s she used Styrofoam packaging elements as printings blocks or sprayed them with metallic paint, delighting in the sounds and smells as the chemical reaction caused the Styrofoam to sputter and melt. She believed that even the humblest of materials could be transformed into a work of art: ‘Spirit lives in everything. It has no age, no color, no sex.’Dienes quoted in: Susan Manso, ‘Toward Greater Visibility: The New York Professional Women Artists’, The Feminist Art Journal (January 1975), p. 22.

He is credited with restoring stability in the Maltese church following the dispute between the Malta Labour Party and his predecessor Mikiel Gonzi, the then Archbishop of Malta. Biography Archbishop Mercieca was born in Victoria on the island of Gozo in Malta. He was baptised on 14 November 1928 and received the other sacraments at the parish church of St George in Victoria. He entered the Gozo seminary to study for the priesthood but continued his studies in Rome at the Gregorian university and the Lateran university. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1952 by His Excellency Joseph Monsignor Pace, Bishop of Gozo, at St James's Church in Victoria, Gozo. In 1958, he was chosen to be the rector of the Gozo Major Seminary. In 1969, the then Father Mercieca was appointed, by Pope Paul VI, to judge the Roman Rota. Five years later Pope Paul VI appointed him Auxiliary Bishop of Malta to assist Archbishop Gonzi. He was consecrated bishop by His Excellency Sir Mikiel Monsignor Count Gonzi, Archbishop of Malta, on the feast of St Michael in St. John's Co-Cathedral, Valletta. After Archbishop Gonzi retired in 1976, Bishop Mercieca succeeded him. He spent the next thirty years as the spiritual shepherd of the Archdiocese of Malta. Archbishop Mecieca is credited with restoring stability in the Maltese church following Count Gonzi's dispute with the Malta Labour Party in the 1950s and 1960s. A new dispute between the church and the Labour government arose in the 1980s over church schools and property, but this was resolved without creating long-lasting divisions. Mercieca was appointed a member of the Xirka Ġieħ ir-Repubblika in 1995. Archbishop Mercieca offered his resignation to Pope John Paul II on 11 November 2003. He remained Archbishop until 2 December 2006, and was succeeded by Paul Monsignor Cremona in January 2007. Archbishop Mercieca had a brother who is also a priest serving in his home parish of St. George in Victoria. Death Archbishop Mercieca's health began to deteriorate, and he was unable to attend Charles Scicluna's appointment as Archbishop in February 2015. On 20 March 2016, it was reported that he was in critical condition. He died at 7:20 am the following day in a house in Żejtun. Archbishop Charles Scicluna announced the death via Twitter. President Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and Leader of the Opposition Simon Busuttil also expressed their sadness on Twitter. Flags on government buildings were flown at half-mast for three days to mourn Mercieca. Gravestone in St. Paul's Cathedral Mercieca's funeral was held on 23 March at St. John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta, and he was buried at St. Paul's Cathedral in Mdina. The funeral was attended by the highest authorities of Malta, including President Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, Evarist Bartolo on behalf of Prime Minister Muscat, and Simon Busuttil.

He has been a member of the House of Representatives since 2003. Early life Tarawneh was born in Khalidiyah, Karak Governorate in 1954. He went to primary school in Khalidiyah and Moab. He followed his secondary education in Al-Karak. He studied civil engineering in Greece. From 1981 to 1983 he worked as an engineer in Saudi Arabia. Tarawneh then returned to Jordan and worked as engineering director of the municipalities of Ma'an, Zarqa and Balqa before having that position in Amman from 1984 to 1994. Tarawneh then turned to private business. Political career Tarawneh was first elected in the 2003 Jordanian general election. He was subsequently part of the 14th, 15th, and 16th Parliaments, serving in the House of Representatives. He also served as Deputy Speaker of the House at one point. In February 2011, while he was Deputy Speaker, he criticized the government's decision to strip Jordanian citizenship from some Jordanians with Palestinian origin on claims that it supported the Palestinian people and their goal of a state. The idea behind the government policy was said to be to protect the Palestinian identity. Tarawneh revealed that several high-ranking Palestinian leaders and negotiators had received Jordanian citizenship during the same period. He claimed that the policy was contradictory and that it undermined national unity. Tarawneh led the party Nation List in the Jordanian general election in 2013. The list comprised native Jordanians and Jordanians of Palestinian descent. The list, referred to as Watan or Homeland, received 94682 votes in the election and thereby earned two seats, which went to Tarawneh and Khamis Atiyeh. Tarawneh ran in the November 2013 Speaker elections, which were held at the start of the regular session of the 17th parliament. On 20 October, out of a total of six candidates, his main competitor was seen as incumbent Speaker Saad Hayel Srour. Tarawneh had the support of his Homeland bloc in parliament, consisting of 20 Representatives, and he could count on another 39 votes by forming a coalition with two other blocs. On 3 November the first round of voting started, with only three candidates remaining. Tarawneh gained 60 votes, Abdul Karim Dughmi gained 43 votes and Srour gained 37 votes. In the second round Tarawneh was to compete against Dughmi, Dughmi however withdrew his candidacy just before the start of the voting. Tarawneh was therefore declared winner. He was re-elected as Speaker on 2 November 2014. And once more on 15 November 2015. His fourth re-election took place on 7 November 2016. On 14 October 2018 he was re-elected for a fifth term. In June 2020 two of his brothers were being investigated for abuse of power and corruption charges. Tarawneh subsequently stated that the government was targeting him and his family. 85 members of the House condemned Tarawneh's statement. Personal life He is married and has four children.

The most profitable trade was in opium, shipped from India to Hong Kong and the Pearl River. The Apcar Line also carried Indian and Chinese laborers for work in Malaya and Singapore. The line was sold to the British-India Steam Navigation Company in 1912. Origins Arratoon Apcar was an ethnic Armenian born in 1779 at New Julfa in Isfahan, Persia. He was the second son of Apcar, the ancestor of the family. He came to Bombay when he was sixteen and found employment with an Armenian merchant there, trading with China and Manila. After his patron died, he continued in this trade in his own right. His brother Gregory Apcar came to India in 1808 and joined Arratoon in Bombay. The trading company of Apcar & Co. was founded in 1819 by Arratoon Apcar. Growth Arratoon Apcar moved his company to Calcutta around the end of 1830. In Calcutta the company moved into shipping, carrying both passengers and freight. The most profitable cargo was opium. Until P&O; began shipping opium from Calcutta in 1851, the trade was divided between Jardine Skinner and the Apcar Line. Even then, P&O; had limited shipping capacity. While Jardines carried opium for the larger suppliers, the Apcars with their Arratoon Apcar and Catherine Apcar sailing boats catered to many smaller local dealers. With slower boats, they charged much lower rates than Jardine Skinner, ranging from Rs8 to Rs10 per chest compared to upward of Rs28 per chest charged by Jardine Skinner. However, the Apcars may have had private arrangements with the dealers that locked them into using Apcar services. The Apcar Line's fleet became well-respected, efficiently carrying both cargo and Chinese coolies, mostly between Singapore, Hong Kong and Amoy, but also making regular voyages to Japan. From 1855 Apcar & Co. started to convert their fleet to steam. The Apcar Line was providing regular service to Singapore from 1856. The Apcar clippers dominated the opium trade until the 1870s, carrying their cargoes from Bombay or Calcutta, with a stop in Singapore, on to Hong Kong or the Canton River. 43 voyages of opium ships to China were listed in 1865, of which 17 were Apcar ships. The Apcars and Jardine Skinner exported opium to Singapore for use by the Chinese in the Malay Peninsula or for distribution to other locations in southeast Asia. Eventually the Apcars were forced out of the Dutch East Indies by protectionist measures. Between 1875 and 1880 Captain Chapman James Clare (1853-1940) served on Apcar & Co. opium steamers trading between Hong Kong and Calcutta. In the 1880s the Apcar Line was sailing monthly from Calcutta to Hong Kong via Penang and Singapore. On 22 May 1888 the steamship Arratoon Apcar collided with the steamship Hebe in the Strait of Malacca, with both ships suffering considerable damage. Both vessels were held to have been at fault. In 1901 the firm of David Sassoon, Sons & Co. were still the agents in Hong Kong of the Apcar Line. They maintained this agency after the purchase of the Apcar Line by the British India Steam Navigation Company. Family interests In 1843 Arratoon Apcar founded the Armenian Patriotic School in his home town of New Julfa in Isfahan, Persia. The school was entirely funded by Apcar & Co. The Apcars also owned collieries. Sitarampur Colliery was opened by Apcar & Company around 1846. In 1865 Apcar was working a seam of coal deep near Charanpur. They had another mine at Sitarampur, a seam said to be deep and excellent in quality. Gregory Apcar worked for Apcar & Co. until his death on 23 June 1847 at the age of 52. Arratoon Apcar died on 16 May 1863 at the age of 85. Apcar Alexander Apcar (1850-1913), grandson of Arratoon Apcar, became head of the family firm after the death of his three elder brothers, Apcar, Seth and Thomas. He continued the family trading business, living at their home in Russell Street, where he entertained many people. He was vice-president of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce in 1903, and its president from 1904 to 1907. He represented the Chamber of Commerce in the Viceregal Legislative Council from 1900 to 1909, in the Bengal Legislative Council and in the Port Trust. In 1903 he was made a C.S.I., and later that year was knighted at a Royal Durbar in Delhi. On 27 February 1912 Apcar & Co, ships, workshops and mines, were sold to the British-India Steam Navigation Company for Rs 800,000. Fleet S.S. Catherine Apcar (1893) The Arratoon Apcar, a 275-ton brig, began making regular voyages in the mid-1840s between Calcutta, Penang, Singapore and China, taking about two months each way. After a few years the company added the Ararat and the 400-ton Catherine Apcar, which was named after the wife of Arratoon Apcar. In 1846 Apcar and Company had three of the eleven tugs operating at Calcutta, one of 120hp and two of 150hp. The first steam clippers added to the fleet were the 315-ton (673grt) Lightning in 1855 and 593-ton (947grt) Thunder. These were followed by the 938-ton Arratoon Apcar and the Armenia in 1858. In 1861 the 204-ton Thunder, a screw-driven steam ship, made the journey from Hong Kong to Singapore in just five days. A great cyclone hit Calcutta on 4 October 1864. It caused great damage to the shipping in the harbor. Apcar & Co.'s Thunder was driven onto the Strand at the foot of Hastings Street. SS Arratoon Apcar was an iron- hulled steamship with a 1,480 ton displacement built in Renfrew, Scotland, 1861. She was sold in 1872 to H.F. Swan Company. Passenger Steamers Hindostan and China, by Thomas Goldsworthy Dutton The 1019-ton steam ship Catherine Apcar was built in 1865, and soon after the 1476-ton Hindustan and 1471-ton China were added. The Japan was commissioned in 1872. In 1873 the 2153-ton Arratoon Apcar was built. In 1891 the Apcar Line acquired the new 3,250-ton steam ship Lightning. Cabin passengers were accommodated in the poop. The ship carried Indian and Chinese laborers to Singapore and Penang as deck passengers. In July 1893 the Japan was retired, replaced by the 2,715-ton Catherine Apcar. The Hyson passenger/cargo liner, built in Belfast and launched in 1895, was purchased by the Apcars and renamed Arratoon Apcar in 1899. She was taken over by the British-India Steam Navigation Company in 1912 when they purchased the Apcar Line, retaining her name. Eventually she was demolished in 1932. The 4,563-ton Gregory Apcar joined the fleet in 1902, and the new Japan in 1906. Until well into the 20th century the ships had to be prepared for attack by Chinese pirates, and were armed and sandbagged for defense.

The plebs followed his advice, and seceded.

Her death in the final days of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 is mired in controversy with allegations that she was captured by the Sri Lankan military before being raped, tortured and murdered.A biopic about her Porkalathil Oru Poo was banned in India as it would harm friendly relations with Sri Lanka. Early life and family Shoba was born in 1982 and hailed from Delft Island. She was educated at the Memorial School and Vembadi Girls' High School. Her family moved to the Vanni in 1995 after being displaced from their home by Operation Riviresa - the Sri Lankan military's operation aimed at recapturing the Jaffna Peninsula. Shoba continued her education in Vanni before joining the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Shoba married a LTTE cadre in 2007 and had an infant daughter. Her daughter Akal was killed by Sri Lanka Air Force bombing on 15 March 2009. Her husband was also killed in the final months of the civil war in 2009. Career According to the TamilNet website and Shoba's friends she suffered from rheumatic valvular heart disease and as such didn't provide any military service for the LTTE. Instead Shoba worked, under the stage name Isaipriya, as journalist and broadcaster for the LTTE's Oliveechchu television station in Kilinochchi. She was also an actress, singer and dancer. Death According to the Sri Lankan military, Isaipriya, whom it describes as \\"Lieutenant Colonel Issei Piriya\\", was killed in battle by the 53 Division on 18 May 2009. However, according to TamilNet, Isaipriya had been a volunteer at the makeshift hospital in Mullivaikkal until 8 May 2009 and had ended up at the internment camps in Vavuniya District. TamilNet claims that Isaipriya and another woman were taken away from the camps by the Sri Lankan Army on 23/24 May 2009. On 30 November 2010 Channel 4 News broadcast video footage which allegedly showed Sri Lankan soldiers summarily executing captured Tamils in the final phase of the civil war. The video showed a number of dead bodies including a naked woman with her hands behind her back. This woman was later identified as Isaipriya by several sources. A witness found by Human Rights Watch claims to have seen Isaipriya 15 May 2009 wearing the same clothes that were next to her on in the Channel 4 News video. There were signs that she may have been sexually assaulted. On 31 October 2013 Channel 4 News broadcast new video footage which allegedly showed Isaipriya alive and in the custody of the Sri Lankan military. She is shown half naked and disorientated, and the Sri Lankan soldiers initially believe her to be Dwarka, daughter of the LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran. Photographs are also shown of Isaipriya lying in a ditch, possibly dead, with a gash across her face and clear signs of sexual assault. According to lawyers Isaipriya's \\"murder\\" by the Sri Lankan military constitutes a war crime. Isaipriya's family were unaware of her capture and murder until the Channel 4 News broadcast. Her mother told Channel 4 News that she had always thought that Isaipriya had been killed by shelling.

The hotel, named for the Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion, was built by local investors at a cost of $1.5 million from plans by noted New York architect William Lee Stoddart. The hotel was built in 1924 by the Marion Square Realty Co., a group headed by former mayor of Charleston T.T. Hyde. The original ownership group formed on March 13, 1920. When the hotel opened on February 7, 1924, the Francis Marion was the largest and grandest hotel in the Carolinas. In 1952, the hotel became the first fully air-conditioned hotel in Charleston. The Jack Tar Hotels Corp. bought the hotel in 1954. The hotel underwent a major renovation in 1955-1956 which included the creation of the Swamp Fox Room, a ground-floor restaurant named for the nickname of Francis Marion. During that work, the ground floor of the exterior was changed to red granite. In 1961, the hotel announced plans to build a three-story parking deck to the north of the hotel on King Street according to plans drawn by Augustus Constantine. The plans were never completed. Starting upon his retirement as the president of The Citadel in 1965 until 1975, Gen. Mark W. Clark lived with his wife in the penthouse of the hotel. In 1976, the hotel was doing poorly, and its owners were considering whether to sell out. At the time, the hotel accounted for about 25% of all of the hotel rooms on the peninsula. In 1975, the owners had considered converting the hotel into a home for the elderly. In 1977, a group of investors considered buying the hotel from Jack Tar Hotels, Inc. The owners at that time had considered renovating the hotel, and the City of Charleston had considered building a parking garage next to the hotel as part of a deal. However, the cost of restoring the buildings as a first-class destination, about $3 million, was too high. In December 1984, Hospitality Associates of Charleston bought the hotel for $8.5 million. The hotel operated first as the Francis Marion Ramada Hotel and then as the Radisson Francis Marion Hotel. Hospitality Associates borrowed heavily from Prudential Insurance Corp. and also from early owner Dr. Julian Youmans who had acquired the hotel in 1981. Starting in April 1986, Hospitality Associates of Charleston began falling behind in payments on its debt. In 1988, Prudential Insurance Corp. bought the hotel at a public sale for $6 million. Hospitality Associates of Charleston, the previous owner, had been unable to stay current on its payments to the successful bidder. In 1989, shortly after Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, a group of investors bought the hotel for $3.2 million. The new owners had a $12 million restoration plan, but a downturn in the economy prevented them from financing the plans. Mayor Joseph P. Riley intended to use the hotel as a landmark to prompt the renovation of upper King St. (the area between Calhoun St. and Cannon St.). He lobbied local banks to finance the plans, and the banks eventually contributed $5.5 million in financing; the city itself ponied up more than $4 million. In 1991, the City of Charleston considered buying the hotel for $3,420,000 and leasing it to the College of Charleston for student housing. The hotel was meticulously restored in 1996 with a $12 million National Trust for Historic Preservation award winning restoration. It reopened as The Francis Marion Hotel - A Clarion Hotel. The hotel went through a second round of renovations in 1997, costing $2 million, and it was renamed The Westin Francis Marion on June 18, 1998.https://www.hotel- online.com/News/PressReleases1998_3rd/Aug98_WestinCharleston.html The hotel left Westin on January 1, 2003http://www.hotel- online.com/News/PR2002_4th/Nov02_FrancisMarion.html and has operated independently since then. The hotel currently has 226 guest rooms and suites. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, in a boundary increase amendment to the Charleston Historic District. With Presumably this was to make it eligible for tax credit subsidy of renovations.

Life and work  Louise Japha grew up in Hamburg, where she learned to play the piano from Fritz Warendorf and composition from Georg August Groß and Friedrich Wilhelm Grund. Her first concert was on 10 February 1838 in the local Apollo Hall. To practice the piano she went to the piano factory of Baumgarten und Heins, where she met the young Johannes Brahms. They practised and played together and discussed his first compositions.Max Kalbeck: Johannes Brahms . 4th Edition, Berlin. Deutsche Brahms-Gesellschaft (\\"German Brahms Society\\"), 1921. A long-lasting friendly relationship developed between Louise Japha and Brahms, who was seven years younger than her. Brahms dedicated one of his earliest works (Op. 6, six songs) to Louise and her sister Minna to express his gratitude. At the invitation of Clara Schumann, Louise Japha moved to Düsseldorf with her sister in 1853 to complete her musical studies with the Schumanns. There she met Johannes Brahms again. In 1858, Louise Japha married the composer and music writer Wilhelm Langhans; they performed together. In particular, she was a celebrated pianist in Paris from 1863 to 1869. In 1868, she performed at the premiere of Brahms' Piano Quintet in F minor, Op. 34.Paul Joseph Bishop: The Viola in Brahms' Chamber Music, Dissertation for Master of Music, Department of Theory, Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester, August 1947.

Foundation  The company was founded in 1995 by Duncan Revie, CEO until his death in 2016, son of the Leeds and England manager Don Revie, COO Rita Revie and chairman Tony Martin. The event was conceived in the Midland Hotel, Manchester, while Duncan and Rita were attending a business event for the music industry and noted a gap in the market for football business.  Football business events  The first event was held at Wembley Stadium in 1996. Soccerex returned to Wembley in 1997 before going on to host events in Paris in 1998, Los Angeles in 1999 and Old Trafford, Manchester, held the 5th edition in 2000. Following this period, the event settled in Dubai from 2001 to 2006 where it grew its customer base and began to attract greater attention, with appearances from leading figures of the game including the then FIFA President Sepp Blatter, David Dein, Peter Kenyon, David Gill and Umberto Gandini as well as football legends including Diego Maradona, Ronaldo, Sir Bobby Robson, Xavi Hernandez, Deco, Michael Owen, Juan Sebastian Veron, Gary Lineker, Landon Donovan and Raul Gonzalez. In 2005, the company launched a regional sub-event concept, starting with the London Forum head the Institute of Directors, to cater for local markets for organisations who could not attend the event in Dubai. Following the launch of the Forums the main Soccerex event was rebranded as a Global Convention. In 2007 the Global Convention moved to Johannesburg in advance of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in partnership with the Gauteng Provincial Government and would remain there until 2009, when the event transferred to Rio de Janeiro in a tenure contracted to stretch until 2013 ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The cancellation of its 18th annual industry conference, scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in November 2013, by caused concern that there might be problems with the 2014 FIFA World Cup, due to be held in Brazil in June and July of the following year. In 2014 the event returned to Manchester, a tenure which lasted until 2017. Alongside the Global Convention, the organisation has also held its Forum level events in London (2005–2009), Dubai (2008), Brasília (2009), Singapore (2010), Manchester (2010–2013), Durban (2012–2014), Barbados (2014), Jordan (2014–2015), Mexico (2016) and Qatar (2016) as well as a seminar event in Lagos (2012) and a roadshow in Belém (2012). In 2018, Soccerex held events in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China and in Miami, Florida, USA, and received strategic investment from the US-based company GACP Sports. They continued with these two events in 2019 with Soccerex China in Haikou, Hainan Province, China in May and Soccerex USA in Miami, Florida, USA, adding Soccerex Europe to their portfolio in Oeiras, Portugal in September. These events were supported by key football stakeholders including the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and Concacaf. In 2020, the company announced their 2020 event plans, including Soccerex Europe returning in September to Oeiras, Portugal whilst Soccerex Americas will be based in Miami in November.  Public events  In addition to corporate networking and exhibition functions, Soccerex has run Football Festivals alongside the Global Convention to promote community engagement. First held on the beach in Dubai, it grew to include youth tournaments, musical and dance acts and a legends tournament for ex-professional footballers. It has been hosted in Dubai (2005–6), Johannesburg (2007–2009), Rio de Janeiro (2010–2013) and Manchester (2014–17). The event was free to attend and has attracted stars including Eric Cantona, Cafu, Lucas Moura, Marcel Desailly, Gaizka Mendieta and Jay Jay Okocha and world-renowned freestylers such as Séan Garnier and Liv Cooke. In 2016, the World's First International Street Soccer Tournament, World Street 3s was launched at Soccerex Football Festival. Eight teams, from Belgium, Denmark, England, Croatia, France, Netherlands, Italy and USA, took part in the inaugural competition. The Dutch winning team of Edward Van Gils, Mohamed Attaibi, Issy ‘The Hitman’ Hamdoui and Sofian El Adel, demonstrated the unique footballing skills needed for the fast-paced action of street soccer, scoring over 25 goals throughout the tournament.http://www.worldstreet3s.com/netherlands-win-the-first-world- street-3s-championship/  SoccerexPro  In addition to the events it runs, Soccerex has a media suite managed in conjunction with SportsPro Media under the name SoccerexPro. The content is centred on football business news, analysis and interviews, with editorial pieces on global and regional football business issues as well as sections related to commercial deals which have been done. SoccerexPro products are available online on the Soccerex website, multiple social media platforms and in a daily e-newsletter sent out via email.  Market reports  In addition to the SoccerexPro series of publications, Soccerex produces annual football market reports such as the Soccerex Football Finance 100, a list of the world's most powerful clubs in financial terms, and the 20 Under 21s Report, a list with of the world's most valuable young players.  Duncan Revie Award  In memory of Soccerex's Co- Founder Duncan Revie, who passed away in 2016, the company bestows an award with his name to global football industry figures that have made a great contribution to the development of football. Richard Tims of Sheffield FC, the world's oldest football club, was the first recipient; in 2017, the award was presented to the belated football player and coach legend Johan Cruyff; in 2018, former US Soccer Federation president, Alan Rothenberg collected the award at the Soccerex event in Miami; and in 2019, the award was presented to Major League Soccer commissioner, Don Garber.

Its vertical homogeneity is caused by the deep vertical convection in winter. The first term to describe this phenomenon is 18° water, which is used by L.V. Worthington to describe the isothermal layer in the northern Sargasso Sea cool to a temperature of about 18 °C each winter. Then Masuzawa introduced the subtropical mode water concept to describe the thick layer of temperature 16–18 °C in the northwestern North Pacific subtropical gyre, on the southern side of the Kuroshio Extension. The terminology mode water was extended to the thick near-surface layer north of the Subantarctic Front by McCartney, who identified and mapped the properties of the Subantarctic mode water (SAMW). After that, McCartney and Talley then applied the term subpolar mode water (SPMW) to the thick near-surface mixed layers in the North Atlantic’s subpolar gyre. Water mass bodies of the Southern Ocean  Formation and erosion  Different mode waters have different formation and erosion mechanisms. The subtropical mode water (STMW) is formed mainly by subduction, the SPMW is formed mainly by other processes. SAMW is due to the combination of subduction and other processes. erosion mechanism of SPMW is a combination of turbulent mixing and air-sea flux. The erosion mechanism of STMW is likely air-sea flux. For SAMW erosion turbulent mixing may be the main factor.  Geographical distribution  Mode water distribution according to Talley (2000) Mode water formation areas are generally characterized by wintertime mixed layers that are relatively thick compared with other mixed layers in the same geographical region. North Atlantic, Southern eastern Indian Oceans and Ocean in the Pacific have the thickest mixed layers, so these thick layers are associated with the North Atlantic’s subpolar mode water and the Southern Ocean’s subantarctic mode water. Relatively thick mixed layers are also found in the subtropical mode water areas near the separated western boundary currents. Temporal variability  One prominent feature of mode waters is they are stable in properties and locations, so that researchers can use data set from all decades to map the approximate core properties. The stability of properties is linked to the largest spatial-scale, longest time-scale wind and buoyancy forcing. It is not to say there is no variation in properties of the mode water. These variations in these near-surface water masses, in temperature, salinity, density and thickness, are linked to surface forcing changes, although in some cases the connection is not yet obvious. For example, Suga and Hanawa show as the seasons progress, mode water moves away from the formation area and sometimes becomes permanently capped.  Detection  To detect the mode water we can use the minimum value in the vertical gradient of potential density, or equivalently in the Brunt–Väisälä frequency. Since temperature profiles are more abundant and both salinity and temperature are relatively homogeneous in mode water, vertical temperature gradients are sometimes used instead of potential vorticity or the vertical gradient of potential density to identify the core of the mode water. There is no specific values of those gradients to define the boundaries of a given mode water. Importance Mode waters have a big impact on nutrients distribution as they prevent deep-ocean nutrients from upwelling to the euphotic zone. Further more, they will control the biological pump, which plays an important role in carbon dioxide uptake. Dynamically, mode waters also control potential vorticity and baroclinic in the subtropical North Atlantic.

If the baby is male, Bert would name it Jerpa, and refers to the plan as Jerpa-projektet (\\"The Jerpa Project\\"). Bert's class will collect money for a 9th grade school trip to London. Åke proposes to open a sex club where the girls will undress themselves for men, but the proposal is rejected and instead it's voted for Åke stripping at the next school dance. Åke proposes selling nuclear weapons to the Sami people and use them against the Swedish government, which he believes oppresses them. In February, 14-year old Åke illegally rides a souped-up moped without a helmet. Åke crashes into a streetlight and is taken to a hospital. Lill-Erik gets a moped from a lady named Harriet, and together they go on a holiday trip. Harriet also helps Åke, and takes care of him after the moped crash. Rumors also say Emilia has shown interest for being a friend with Harriet. By February, Emilia begins acting strangely. She starts coughing when she hears Bert calling her over the telephone, thinks Bert is silly, and expresses positive opinions about Åke. While Jörgen Karlsson and Dödgrävarn in class 8 B fight and run away from the headmaster at the schoolyard, Bert's class has family and consumer science. Bert perceives everything as a form of humor from Emilia's side, and when Lill-Erik tells Bert that Ake encounters his girl, Bert first sees this as humor. When Emilia says she has to do French homework despite studying German, Bert even believes that French is taught during those German lessons. When a bicycle similar to Åke's is parked at the garage driveway of Emilia's parents house, Bert assumes it belongs to Emilia's father. Bert turns 15 on 21 February, and gets a moped for present. Emilia refuses cake during Bert's birthday party, but gives Bert a bouquet of white carnations. Bert joins a moped gang with three guys in class 8 C, Jan (called \\"Jaffa\\"), Thomas (called \\"Tomas\\") and Holgersson. On March 1, Emilia breaks up with Bert, while Åke hides inside her wardrobe. She says Bert is ugly and a poor singer. Although, Bert first suspects her to be joking, he develops low self-esteem. Some days later he notices Åke carrying Emilia on a bicycle. When confronted, Åke claims he and Emilia aren't together and that he just thought Bert and Emilia met too often and sabotaged their relationship. Feeling down, Bert goes to church, where he meets a girl who tells him she had the same problems when she was fourteen. Emilia later returns to pick up her things from Bert's and gets bitten in her elbow by Bert's pet turtle, Ove. Although she doesn't contract sepsis, Bert hopes she will get forced to amputate her arm anyway or at least be forced to take a tetanus shot. Bert is soon confirmed, with priest Abdon Rehnberg. The priests from the Church of Sweden who first present themselves are Staffan and Maria. Bert thinks Maria looks nice, while Emilia thinks Staffan looks nice. The confirmands sleep overnight in a haunted house, located at a deserted farm. Bert's grandmother turns 70, and Bert's class participate in a soccer tournament at school, losing 3–4 to class 8 F when Lill-Erik can't decide which foot to use when shooting at 3-3, before class 8 F counter-attacks winning the game. Åke states that he and Emilia only talk over a \\"child born on Christmas\\" and hold hands, but Bert doesn't believe that. In May, Bert, Åke and Lill-Erik sleep overnight in a haunted house. Later during the same month, Bert, Åke and Lill-Erik sleep overnight at Ekeboskogen, where according to rumors a UFO is said to have been seen. Bert, Åke and Lill-Erik also babysit a family where a 4 years old threatens to hit Lill-Erik, and chases him with a knife through the apartment. In May, Bert also falls in love with Gabriella, in class 6 at Blåsjöskolan. Gabriella is called \\"Gabby\\", and her sister is called Amanda. The book ends on 7 June, with Bert planning for the upcoming summer, where he will travel to Spain and hold a summer job at a cracker factory. Trivia *Emilia breaks up with Bert at Emilia's home on 1 March in the 8th grade, which is exactly the same date two years after Bert breaks up with Nadja in the 6th grade. *The book features lyrics from the Heman Hunters songs Heaven and Panncake and Svenska kannibaler, the first of them was also recorded at the May cassette tape recording of \\"Berts vidare betraktelser\\" (replacing \\"Take the Night\\" from the book version).Bert *The opening lines for the chapter \\"Lill-Erik och skäggväxten\\" (30/5), who are \\"Tjing, tjing - rymdling\\", was even used as closing lines for the TV series episode \\"Närkontakt i sjätte klassen\\".

History A house had stood on the Rolleston site, owned by the Rolleston family, since the early 13th century. In 1622 the estate was purchased by Sir Edward Mosley (or Mosely), Attorney-General of the Duchy of Lancaster. He replaced a wooden house with a stone-built one and died unmarried in 1638, after which the property passed to his nephew Sir Edward Mosley, 1st Baronet and in turn to his son, Sir Edward Mosley, 2nd Baronet. It later devolved to Oswald Mosley, (High Sheriff of Staffordshire for 1715), who was created a baronet (the second creation of the title) in 1720. The property then passed down to John Parker Mosley, who was also created a baronet (the third creation of the title) in 1781. Sir Oswald Mosley, 4th Baronet During the ownership of Sir Tonman Mosley, 3rd Baronet in 1871 the hall was devastated by fire and subsequently rebuilt to a higher standard. The last Mosley to be connected with Rolleston Hall was Sir Oswald Mosley, the 6th Baronet and well-known founder of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). He was the Labour M.P. for Harrow from 1918 to 1924 and for Smethwick from 1926 to 1931. The estate however was sold in his father's lifetime in 1923 and after unsuccessful efforts to sell the hall it was largely demolished in 1928. Some remnants were converted into flats.

The villa was designed and built to construct the Jan Hus Memorial but it was also a meeting place for the Czech intelligentsia. Today the building has been restored and it is used for education. History Ladislav Šaloun had the studio built when he won the commission for the gigantic Jan Hus Memorial as he needed a large space to create the asymmetrical memorial that now stands in Old Town Square in Prague.Saloun's Villa, Svoboda Williams, retrieved 6 November 2013 The memorial that became a symbol of Czech self-government was dedicated to Jan Hus who was burned as a heretic in 1415 after refusing to recant his independent views.Jan Hus Monument in the middle of the Old Town Square, prague.cz, retrieved 7 November 2013 Šaloun part designed the Art Nouveau villa and there he enjoyed visits from the Czech intelligensia.

Description The Art Nouveau design was developed by Saloun and includes the inscription \\"'The Sea! the Sea!\\" which is thought to be a reference to the statement reported by the historian Xenophon of an army whose retreat from Persia took them to the security of the Black Sea coast. Another inscription on the villa is a verse by Saloun's friend Otokar Brezina who also suggested the villa's wall relief entitled \\"Greeting to the Sun\\". There is another design which is based on the signs of the zodiac. (Saloun's friend, the print maker Josef Vachal, said in his many writings said that there were \\"occult practices\\" that took place in the villa's basement.Saloun's Villa, Prague-Stay.com, retrieved 7 November 2013) The villa stands out from its surrounding buildings because the design is seen as \\"modern\\" even though the design is about a hundred years old.

Pali graduated with a BFA from the Institute of Arts in Tirana, Albania in 1980. He did not remain in his native country for long, fleeing in January 1988 due to political reasons and to escape the restrictions the authorities placed on artistic freedom. Pali emigrated that same year to the U.S. In America, he enrolled in the MFA degree at the Michigan State University. He graduated in 1991. Currently resides in Stamford, where his studio is. Exhibitions Pali first exhibited his works as part of a group exhibition in Albania in 1980. He participated in group exhibitions regularly in Albania throughout the 1980s, until he fled the country. His first solo exhibition was in Michigan, at the Kresge Art Center, in 1991. He had exhibited at numerous American galleries, including Gallery 444, Design Domain Gallery, Coconut Grove Gallery, Art Essex Gallery, and Ward-Nasse Gallery. Awards George Pali is the winner of the 2012 Leone'd'Oro dell'Arte (Golden Lion of Arts), Monte Carlo (Monaco).

Life Helena was one of the younger daughters of Matthew Kantakouzenos and Irene Palaiologina. She was known to be living with her mother and sister Maria in Gratianopolis (modern Gratini), when Emperor John V Palaiologos moved the women to Tenedos. In 1361 she went with her father Matthew to live in the Morea, where she afterwards married Louis Fadrique, Count of Salona, lord of Zetouni and lord of Aegina. When he died in 1382, she continued to reign as Dowager Countess of Salona. When Helena was threatened by the alliance of her cousin Theodore I Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea, and Nerio I Acciaioli, Duke of Athens, she sought the help of Stephen of Pharsalos, the younger son of Simeon Uroš, Despot of Epirus. In April 1388, King John I of Aragon offered her the rights of castellan over Athens on the condition she would defend the city. She had only one child, Maria Fadrique Kantakouzene, by her husband Louis Fadrique, who was born around 1370. Maria, whom Laonikos Chalkokondyles describes as very beautiful, was much sought after in marriage. Her first betrothal, around 1382, was to Bernaduch, a son of Philip Dalmau, Viscount of Rocaberti, and next to an unidentified son of Simeon Uroš, whom Donald Nicol suggests was Stephen of Pharsalos. This arrangement came close to being consummated with a marriage, for King Peter IV of Aragon wrote to Helena on 17 August 1386 and reproached her for marrying her daughter to a foreigner. In any case, negotiations for her marriage to Bernaduch of Rocaberti resumed in 1387. Nerio Acciaioli is said to have sought her hand for his brother-in-law Pietro Saraceno, but in 1390 arrangements appear to have been made for Maria to marry Matthew of Moncada, son of William Raymond of Montcada, Count of Augusta. Chalkokondyles tells how Salona was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, and that afterwards both Helena and her daughter Maria entered the Sultan's harem. According to a letter from Nerio Acciaioli to his brother Donato dated 20 February 1394, the capture of Salona can be dated either at the end of 1393 or the beginning of 1394.

University Ave. in Champaign, Illinois, was the headquarters of the Illinois Traction System, an interurban railroad serving Central Illinois. Built in 1913, the building held the railway's offices and served as the Champaign interurban station until 1936; it later housed the offices of the Illinois Power Company, which descended from the Illinois Traction System. Architect Joseph Royer planned the building in a contemporary commercial design. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 20, 2006. History The Illinois Traction System was established by William B. McKinley in the 1890s and 1900s. McKinley began his system by purchasing and electrifying local streetcar lines. In 1902, the system opened its first interurban line between Champaign and St. Joseph, and by 1911 it linked most major cities in Central Illinois, as well as St. Louis, Missouri. The company built the Illinois Traction Building in 1913 to replace its previous Champaign station; the new building had a central location and office space for the company. In 1928, the Illinois Traction System became part of the Illinois Terminal Railroad; its utility division became the Illinois Power and Light Company and maintained offices in the Traction Building. Streetcar service to the building ended in 1936, when a new owner replaced the lines with bus service; while interurban trains continued to serve Champaign, they stopped at a different station. The building continued to house the utility company, which became known as the Illinois Power Company, until it moved to a different building in 1985. Architecture Architect Joseph Royer designed the Illinois Traction Building in a contemporary commercial style. The building was a departure from Royer's previous work, which was primarily done in rustic or massive styles such as Romanesque. The three-story building is built from red brick and has terra cotta detailing. Four piers divide the three-bay front facade; the two side bays are slightly bowed. Terra cotta medallions top each pier, and scrolled shields on the piers mark the top of the first floor. The windows on each floor feature terra cotta sills and lintels. The building's original terra cotta cornice has been replaced by a white brick pediment.

After having appeared in The Great Air Robbery (1919), a film that showcased his aerial talents, Locklear, considered the foremost \\"aviation stunt man in the world\\", was reluctant to return to the air show circuit.Farmer 1984, pp. 10, 16. During the production, Locklear and his co-pilot Milton \\"Skeets\\" Elliot died after crashing during a night scene. The Skywayman was subsequently released shortly after, capitalizing on their deaths.Pendo 1985, pp. 5–6. No footage of The Skywayman is known to exist, and the film is now considered lost. Plot Captain Norman Craig (Ormer Locklear) returns from the Lafayette Escadrille as a shell-shocked veteran, suffering from amnesia. Seeing him wandering around San Francisco, his girlfriend Virginia Ames (Louise Lovely), with the help of Dr. Wayne Leveridge (Sam De Grasse), devises a plan to help him restore his memory. Her family hires Craig to pursue a pair of supposed Russian thieves after the Ames jewels. The doctor, however, has plans to steal the jewels and wants Virginia for himself. An aerial chase ending with a tailspin and crash brings Craig back to his senses. He is able to thwart the doctor's schemes and finally remembers his girlfriend.

After The Great Air Robbery, which was a commercial success for Universal Pictures, studio head Carl Laemmle did not take up the option for a second film starring Locklear, prompting Locklear's $25,000 lawsuit against Universal. Unwilling to go back to the air show circuit, Locklear wanted to continue his Hollywood career and in April 1920, he was signed to star in The Skywayman.Farmer 1984, p. 20. Principal photography on The Skywayman began on June 11, 1920 with DeMille Field 2 in Los Angeles as the main base of operations, although scenes were also shot in and around San Francisco.Pendo 1985, p. 5. Despite Locklear's public claim that new stunts \\"more daring ever filmed\\" would be involved, the production would rely heavily on models and less on actual stunt flying.Farmer 1984, pp. 20–21. Two stunts, a church steeple being toppled by Locklear's aircraft and an aircraft-to-train transfer were both problematic and nearly ended in disaster. The last stunt scheduled for filming was a nighttime spin, initially to take place in daylight with cameras fitted with red filters to simulate darkness. Locklear, under a lot of pressure, with not only his family life being in upheaval but also learning that studio head William Fox was not going to extend his contract beyond one film, demanded that he be allowed to fly at night.Farmer 1984, p. 23. The studio relented and on August 2, 1920, publicity surrounding the stunt led to a large crowd gathering to witness the filming of the unusual stunt.Pendo 1985, p. 6. Large studio arc lights were set up on DeMille Field 2 to illuminate the Curtiss \\"Jenny\\", to be doused as the aircraft entered its final spin, to be turned off when the plane dropped to a certain altitude to inform Locklear about his position. The arc lights were never turned off though,\\"Hollywood\\", Ep. 5 - \\"Hazards of the Game\\" and to shocked spectators and film crew, Locklear and his long-time flying partner Milton \\"Skeets\\" Elliotfindagrave.com; Milton Elliott crashed heavily into the sludge pool of an oil well, never pulling out of the spin. Both occupants died instantly at the scene.Wynne 1987, p. 24. With the entire film already \\"in the can\\" except for the night scene, Fox made the decision to capitalize on the crash and deaths of Locklear and Elliot, by rushing The Skywayman into production and release.Paris 1995, p. 56. Reception With the lurid notices of The Skywayman proclaiming: \\"Every Inch Of Film Showing Locklear's Spectacular (And Fatal) Last Flight. His Death-Defying Feats And A Close Up Of His Spectacular Crash To Earth,\\" the film was premiered in Los Angeles. The advertising campaign that accompanied the film was very similar to that of his earlier feature film, focusing on Locklear's earlier exploits, and combining model displays, and exhibition flights across North America to coincide with the film's release.Pendo 1984, pp. 6–7. Fox Film Corporation claimed that 10% of the studio profits would go to the families of Locklear and Elliot.Farmer 1984, p. 24. The review in the Los Angeles Times noted: \\"The greatest monument that could be built to any man – the privilege of living on after all else has gone – is what 'The Skywayman' showing will do. What is gone in the flesh will live on forevermore on the screen.\\" In Hollywood (1980), a television series on the silent era, actresses Leatrice Joy and Viola Dana recalled Locklear and the making of The Skywayman.

The book is based on the latest research in biology, evolutionary psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience and anthropology. The authors question what factors allow us to move up taking into account the culture codes proposed by Dr. Rapaille, and their congruence with human biology, and Roemer's economic and biological precepts. Furthermore, the authors propose a new paradigm for understanding human needs and wants, contrasting Maslow's Pyramid of Needs with the Four S's: Survival, Sex, Security, and Success. These four S's express man's needs and wants whereby it is not necessary for one to be satisfied in order for the other to exist. The Four S's carry equal importance. Based on these Four S's and the move up culture codes, the authors developed the R^2 Mobility Index.  Content  Move UP originated five years prior to its publishing from concerns the authors had at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, relating to what makes people move up and why some societies move up while others don't. The explanation can be found within the interaction between biology and culture. Move UP has seven philosophical assumptions: 1\\\\. Life is a choice, 2\\\\. Life is movement, 3\\\\. The movement of life is UP, 4\\\\. The evolution of species corresponds to the evolution of societies, 5\\\\. UP is not a choice, 6\\\\. Our “universe” is not universal, and 7\\\\. Evolution is not a moral judgment. Furthermore, as in the case of biology, evolution dictates that cultures must also compete for resources, territory, populations and the construction of a defense system; in short the survival of a culture. The movement of population is also a good indicator of which culture is moving up and which culture is moving down. The books key points are: 1\\\\. The creation of the R^2 Mobility Index through the sum of the culture codes (C^2) with the Bio-Logical value (the sum of the Four S's), divided by two: R^2 = \\\\frac{C^2+Bio-logical}{2} 2\\\\. The Reptilian complex always wins. 3\\\\. Time, space and energy of the Triune Brain model: the Reptilian, the Limbic system and the Neocortex. 4\\\\. The ideal scenario allows upward mobility. 5\\\\. The methodology, the Five Critical Moves, analyze 71 countries. 6\\\\. The third unconscious is cultural. 7\\\\. A map that illustrates the R^2 Mobility Index results for the 71 countries, as well as the mobility index. 8\\\\. A conclusion, voting with your feet, whereby feet are a metaphor for moving, migrating, making a choice to move UP.  Reception  The book has received mostly negative reviews.

As a busy reviewer, one does tend to read a lot of mediocre books. But it’s been a long time since I’ve seen such a manifestly risible work put out by a reputable publishing house.\\" —Steven Poole. \\"This book debases the intellectual currency. It is, as I say, a pure marketing project, aimed at the most conventionally minded people on the planet, those who are possessed of the most unchallenging, unthinking, unreal, self- congratulatory conception of human progress. Allen Lane, distinguished science publishers, should be ashamed.\\" —Bryan Appleyard. The work has been specially singled out for offering broad stereotypes regarding nationalities and the difference between men and women. However, promotional material for Move UP includes a series of positive blurbs from various thinkers around the world: “Not since The Naked Ape have I seen a book that so gleefully revels in tweaking the nose of conventional sensitivities. Whether you love it or hate it, this quirkily perceptive –or insouciantly provocative– book will enliven dinner party conversations, and will delight and infuriate in equal measure.” —Richard Dawkins. “An entertaining and important counterweight to the ideology and cynicism that surrounds discussions of world problems today.” —Steven Pinker. “This is the question for the ages: why are some nations and people rich and successful, while others are poor and a failure? Why do some soar to great heights in a single generation, while others are mired forever in discord, war, and poverty? Many have tried to address small pieces of this great puzzle, but Rapaille and Roemer are the first to attempt a comprehensive answer to this eternal question. Because the stakes are so high, their work deserves serious study and attention. The destiny of nations may depend on ideas like theirs.” —Michio Kaku. “Choices, movements, evolution, requirements for survival of the species. Why do some of us strive for more? How are culture, surroundings and education helping some societies move up more than others? These are some of the questions the authors engage by studying the paradigm between social and biological sciences. Move UP portrays the cultural and biological dimensions behind the desire of humans to ascend socially, intellectually or economically. Surprisingly being logical about our biology seems to be the key!” —Mario J. Molina. “Move UP is a splendid book, totally engaging from start to finish. It showcases the human drive to strive for betterment within a complex matrix of our biology and culture. It challenges the reader to think about fresh ideas about ways to ascend, as well as highlighting the impediments that must be overcome to progress toward improvement. Move UP is by far the best book I've read this year.” —David Buss. “Move UP provides a provocative and entertaining look at interactions between culture and biology that impact the progress of societies. The authors raise big questions and challenge the reader to think about them in novel ways.” —Daniel Schacter. “Move UP considers a critical question in our globalized world ̶what sorts of countries foster social mobility in their citizens? This is a question long pondered by social scientists, but Rapaille and Roemer bring a fresh perspective to the question, viewing the subject from the standpoints of evolutionary biology, anthropology and zoology. The result is a superb book ̶provocative, smart, fun to read and very important ̶ . I recommend it highly.” —Robert Sapolsky. “You have just been elected head of your country. You want to lead your people to new heights of happiness, prosperity, security, and freedom never enjoyed before. What should you do? The first thing you should do is read Move UP by Clotaire Rapaille and Andrés Roemer, and follow their data-driven recommendations for determining how best to achieve your goals using science, technology, and the wisdom of the greatest thinkers in history revealed in this remarkable book. Move UP is not utopian; it outlines a realistic plan for how more people in more places more of the time can lead more fulfilling and successful lives anywhere in the world.” —Michael Shermer. “Andrés Roemer has been a leader in bringing important scientific ideas to public attention, as well as promoting human rights and effective democracy; Clotaire Rapaille has been a leader in the psychology of generating effective marketing strategies. Now, in Move UP, Drs. Roemer and Rapaille combine their talents as scientists, communicators, motivators and activists ̶with a little help from a uniquely diverse cast including Charles Darwin, Albert Camus, Sigmund Freud, Dr. Seuss and Napoleon Bonaparte ̶ to show how individuals as well as societies can move: which way? UP, of course! If you value ‘survival, sex, security and success’ (and who doesn't?) then get ready for a potentially life-altering trip!” —David P. Barash. “Rapaille and Roemer fix their gazes on a question of great importance and intimidating complexity: how can we prosper? With inviting style, they bring to bear an array of ideas and an abundance of evidence, looking closely at the issue from a host of different vantage points. Ranging widely, the authors will delight, provoke, and very possibly inspire readers who want to know how nations can Move UP.” —Robert Kurzban. “I think this book is terrific...In Move UP, Clotaire Rapaille and Andrés Roemer have written a book that is engaging, stimulating, and challenges us to think in new ways. Though the book is theoretically broad and ambitious, it is full of practical suggestions that can make life better. It will change the way you look at almost everything.” —Joseph Barry Schwartz. “What are the parallels between brains and cultures? Running the gamut from stimulating to provocative, heady to poignant, this book gives you plenty to think about for moving lives and societies in the only useful direction.” —David Eagleman. “I love the ideas put forth by my good friends, Roemer and Rapaille! The Culture Code of your home country is absolutely critical for a successful future...Cultures matters, A LOT! The good news is we can change, one by one, we can change our mindset. It's up to us. You must decide to MOVE UP, and maybe away from your home. Read the book and find out why and how.” —Ricardo Salinas Pliego. “When does a nation's culture hold them back, and when does it fuel their progress? It is extremely hard to answer this question comprehensively enough to help guide policy change ̶whether this be economic policy, social policy or even foreign policy. ̶Roemer and Rapaille offer a cogent and coherent network of guidelines, describing not only what has worked and not worked in the past but also a set of persuasive arguments and theories as to why. Those who would tend to challenge these guidelines on the basis that they are too ‘Western,’ or in some other way parochial, would do well to ask themselves how long other paradigms need to fail before they should be abandoned.” —Aubrey de Grey. “Clotaire Rapaille and Andrés Roemer are great storytellers and natural provocateurs, and Move UP is a treat—a clearly written and very creative exploration of the conditions that lead to happiness, freedom, and flourishing.” —Paul Bloom. “This is the best book I have ever read about sex, success, survival, security, and the reptilian brain. Roemer and Rapaille have done an amazing job explaining difficult concepts about the human condition and life in the modern world in a fascinating, humorous, entertaining and elucidating way. I recommend this book very highly to anyone interested in learning about what life is about ̶and about what it can be.” —Amir Aczel. “Move UP by Andrés Roemer and Clotaire Rapaille is a tour de force presenting a muscular new formula for individuals and countries to assess—and perhaps fix—their barriers to upward mobility, creativity and talent. A deep and entertaining read.” —Louann Brizendine. “How can we explain some societies are successful while others are not? How can we engineer societies that best satisfy fundamental human needs? Over two thousand years ago, Plato compared the well-functioning society to a well-functioning soul—a soul with three parts all working in harmony. In this highly engaging and accessible book, Andres Roemer and Clotaire Rapaille update Plato’s project using Maclean’s model of three brain systems to draw out what it is that makes the difference between societies that progress ̶that Move UP ̶ and those that stagnate and fail. This is a stimulating and thought-provoking book that is full of practical wisdom. I greatly enjoyed reading it, and I think that you will to.” —David Livingstone Smith. “An ambitious and provocative book that tackles head-on the really Big Questions: What does it mean to be human? And what can we all do to become better people, leading better lives in a better world? A book that will stir controversy, tweak sacred cows and foment the best kind of debate.” —Carl Honoré. “A revolutionary take on cultural mobility, elegantly composed yet easy to understand. Move UP serves as a whirlwind tour through history and science, exploring what drives success for individuals and societies. Bravo to Rapaille and Roemer for introducing a novel way to quantify the human condition. This interdisciplinary and thought provoking book may reshape the way readers think about our world.” —Sheril Kirshenbaum.  See also  * Andrés Roemer * Clotaire Rapaille * Paul D.

They formed in 1984, broke up in 1992. The band comprised guitarist/singer-songwriter Paul Grogan, bass player/vocalist Guy Mansfield and drummer/producer, Lord Mike McCann. Evan Clarry, now a feature filmmaker, was rhythm guitarist and occasional vocalist from 1984 to 1987. The Mungabeans - or The ‘Beans, as their fans called them - were known for an eclectic repertoire and bizarre stage show, which was comedy, high art or menace, depending on the audience’s perception. The band moved to Sydney in 1986, after becoming the only performers to be banned from Brisbane’s then alternative radio station, Four Triple Z. The 'Beans circa 1987, from left Mansfield, Grogan and McCann History, name The ‘Beans began as an impromptu fill-in at Jabbo’s Jazz and Blues Club (situated in what is now a Roma Street carpark) in 1983, when regular Saturday night act, The Headstones, took breaks. A series of drummers joined childhood friends Grogan and Mansfield on stage, until Jabbo’s regular Mike McCann was permanently recruited. Clarry, who was Mansfield’s classmate at Church of England Grammar School, joined from the first official gig. The Headstones' leader, Chris Flynn (later of The Dubrovniks), suggested the act name themselves after things called \\"mungabeans\\" (sic) that he'd seen at a health food shop. Bean sprouts were uncommon in Brisbane; no-one recognised the error in the name, nor the association with hippies, so posters were printed with the erroneous name which stuck. The ‘Beans performed regularly at Brisbane’s \\"underground\\" venues throughout 1985 and ’86, progressing from support to headline act largely on the strength of a bizarre stage show and repertoire. As a film student, guitarist Evan Clarry had access to elaborate cinematic props, which embellished the simulated sex and violence characterising Beans’ gigs. And, while the theatre was often tongue-in-cheek, perceptions of subversiveness in a conservative, heavily policed Brisbane led to undercover police often infiltrating Mungabeans’ gigs. The band’s early repertoire was dominated by covers of kitsch glam and Australian rock songs of the early 1970s, largely to irritate elements of the self-conscious underground music set who reviled the material. Over time, Grogan’s compositions replaced the covers, as the band became more ambitious. Interest in Sydney led to the band moving there in 1986 (as had The Headstones, Screaming Tribesmen, Ups & Downs and others). Like many Australian independent acts of the 1980s, The Mungabeans gained more popularity overseas than in their own backyard. In their case Germany and England took to the band, however the 'Beans never toured outside Australia. They split in 1990, reforming in 1991 as Undermine, before splitting for good in 1992. High points of recognition in Australia were multiple appearances on Rage and regular airplay in 1988 of The Beans' song Too Late (to Turn Back Now) from their debut EP, A Much Sweeter Gag. Legacy The 'Beans were considered instrumental in introducing a less self-conscious culture among the so-called Brisbane \\"underground\\". In a 1986 article published in RAM (Rock Australia Magazine), the band was cited as influential on a wave of ex-Brisbane performers who succeeded internationally as independent and mainstream music markets merged in the late 1980s. The 'Beans paved the way for a new wave of young bands, who eschewed taking themselves seriously. Grogan and Mansfield, as professional musicians with experience in working covers bands, also helped bridge a cultural divide between proficient suburban cabaret bands and the raw, three-chord approach of \\"indie\\" acts. This contributed to a mark-up in musical skill among original bands emerging in Brisbane from the early 1990s. The 'Beans' records sales were highest in Europe. Grogan and McCann formed World Dog in 1994, recording a CD produced by Skyhooks songwriter Greg Macainsh. McCann and Grogan now develop music for Asian markets through their production company, GroMic, while Clarry is a director with two feature films to his name, Blurred (film) and Under the Radar (film).

Tim Lambrinos is the organization's director. The Exotic Dancers' Alliance (EDA), a collective that was founded in 1995 to bring together both former and current strippers and their supporters, sought to establish minimum employment standards for strippers in Ontario by contending with the AEAC, but the EDA ceased to exist in 2004. Also in 2004, Ottawa instituted a law against lap dancing, and the AEAC unsuccessfully attempted to have the law overturned in 2007. Starting in 2004, the AEAC and the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada became embroiled in a long-standing controversy about work permits for foreign workers to be hired for the purpose of striptease. In 2008, when Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Diane Finley allegedly received threats from sex industry officials in relation to her support of Bill C-17, which sought to allow immigration officers to deny temporary visas to prospective strippers if they were suspected to be sex trafficking victims, Lambrinos said that \\"it's not plausible\\" that any of the AEAC strip clubs were responsible for the threats. In 2009, the AEAC invited Toronto City Council members to attend a free lunch at a strip club in the city, and three councillors accepted the invitation. The AEAC released a statement in 2010 that the government's crackdown on sex industry worker visas had resulted in a stripper shortage, and Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews responded by saying that the strip clubs that were short on strippers because of the crackdown were engaging in human trafficking. Toews then ordered the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate the relevant strip clubs in order to determine whether or not the strippers working there were illegal immigrants or sex trafficking victims, and the AEAC launched a campaign to deny these allegations.

In 1979, he became a faculty member at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he was a contemporary of Preston Cloud. Stromatolites Awramik is known for his long standing expertise on stromatolites. His 1971 discovery of a link between a loss in stromatolitic diversity and the appearance of the first metazoans was published in Science. In 1974, he and Lynn Margulis gave an often-used definition of \\"stromatolite\\". Origin of life In 1983, he discovered what was then considered to be the oldest evidence of life on earth, located in Western Australia. His and others' work provided credence to the notion that life was likely as old as 3.5 Ga. Recent research Awramik remains a faculty member at UCSB, where he continues to teach. He continues to study stromatolites. Recently, he has begun studying Neoproterozoic deposits in eastern California. In 2003, he, Frank Corsetti and David Pierce published evidence in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of fossilized microbiota in Cryogenian rocks, a revelation which has cast doubt on the notion of the near elimination of life during potential equatorial glaciation during that period (commonly referred to as Snowball Earth).

According to its mission statement, Voiceless's vision is for a world in which animals are treated with respect and compassion. Voiceless was founded by father-daughter team Brian Sherman AM and Ondine Sherman in 2004 with the goal of making animal protection the next great social justice movement. Voiceless keeps a mainstream focus by taking a measured and factual approach to animal protection, focussing on animal protection and animal law education. Patrons: Brian Sherman AM, J. M.

History Voiceless was founded by father-daughter team Brian Sherman AM and Ondine Sherman in 2004. Ondine Sherman first became interested in animal welfare when served a dish of tongue cooked by her grandmother at age 8, an experience which resulted in her adopting a vegetarian lifestyle. After retiring in 2003, Brian Sherman attended an animal rights conference with Ondine in the United States. They were both shocked by the extent of animal suffering caused by institutionalised farming and felt compelled to challenge the cruel treatment of animals raised for food. After being exposed to a number of animal welfare and animal rights issues, Ondine and Brian decided to focus their time on raising awareness of animal suffering in Australia. Brian admits that attending the conference was difficult: \\"I have always felt a kinship with animals, but my experience there can only be described as traumatic. We established Voiceless less than 12 months after, and have not looked back since.\\" Brian has published a history of Voiceless in his autobiography The Lives of Brian. Animal Protection Voiceless identifies itself as an animal protection institute. For Voiceless, animal protection is a term which encompasses animal welfare, and animal rights, in an attempt to unify those two movements. Animal welfare is a philosophy which is concerned with regulating the use of animals to reduce unnecessary pain and suffering. Animal welfare holds that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that adverse effects on animal welfare are minimised as far as possible, short of not using the animals at allGlasgow, D (2008). \\"The Law of the Jungle: Advocating for Animals in Australia\\". Deakin Law Review (13): 181–186.. Animal rights is the idea that non-human animals are entitled to the possession of their own lives. In this way, animal rights law seeks to question animals’ well-entrenched status as property, with a view to securing fundamental rights for (at least some) animals. While welfare and rights often fall on the same side of an issue, they are fundamentally different concepts. By unifying them, Voiceless seeks to shift focus away from the theoretical discourse and towards practical approaches to achieving greater animal protection in Australia. Work areas Voiceless focusses on youth education, encouraging critical-thinking on animal protection issues and growing the field of animal law. Voiceless is equipping today's youth to become tomorrow's decision-makers. Voiceless's Animal Law Education (ALE) program provides animal law teachers with the resources they need to encourage law students to think critically about the relationship between animals and the law. Voiceless's Animal Protection Education (APE) program provides high school teachers with the resources they need to encourage students to think critically about animal protection.  Advocacy work (2004–2017)  From 2004-2017, Voiceless focussed its advocacy work on two areas – factory farming and the commercial kangaroo industry. Founder Ondine Sherman has explained that the reason for this focus is that these issues cause the most suffering to the largest number of Australian animals, yet often receive little attention. These objectives were realised through writing law reform submissions, running campaigns, creating research publications and hosting the Voiceless Animal Law Lecture Series, the Voiceless Grants Program and the Voiceless Media Prizes.  Factory farming  Factory farming is the process of raising livestock in industrial systems in which animals are confined at high stocking density to produce the highest output at the lowest cost.Factory farming Factory farms remove domesticated farmed animals from open pastures, forcing them to live in confined and crowded environments. These close conditions require the use of antibiotics to stop the spread of disease and housing systems often prevent animals from exhibiting many of their natural behaviours. Farmed animals are often subjected to artificial feeding and lighting regimes, selective breeding, and intensive confinement, often in cages and at extreme stocking densities, to produce the greatest possible output of meat, milk and eggs in the shortest amount of time at the lowest cost. According to Voiceless, the intensification of farming processes has resulted in large multinational companies dominating the global meat and dairy trade. Globally, more than 70 billion animals are slaughtered each year for human consumption, with the vast majority coming from factory farms. Australians now eat more than ten times the amount of chicken meat than in 1960, but the number of chicken farms in Australia has plummeted and over 70% of the market is now supplied by just two corporations. Similarly, since the early 1970s pig meat production has increased by around 50%, while the number of pig producers has dropped from 40,000 to just over 1,500 in 2014. This concentration means that individual corporations can be responsible for more than a million animals at any one time. Voiceless states that this intensification of agricultural practices has led to the widespread use of cruel and inhumane meat production practices, such as the debeaking of chickens, tail docking and teeth clipping of pigs, and mulesing of sheep, often undertaken without pain relief. Voiceless’s advocacy work on factory farming focused on raising awareness of the practice in order to change the laws which allow it. Voiceless claims that factory farming corporations engage in legalised cruelty in the name of higher profit and cheaper animal products. Voiceless founder Brian Sherman has stated that \\"Australians need to see what goes on inside factory farms, to see how cruelly animals are treated for the sake of cheap chicken breast and bacon.\\"  The commercial kangaroo industry  The commercial kangaroo industry is a multimillion-dollar meat and skin industry, responsible for the killing of almost 90 million kangaroos and wallabies in the last 20 years. Voiceless claims that kangaroos are hunted in the largest commercial slaughter of land-based wildlife on the planet, primarily because they are perceived to be overpopulated in Australia and considered a pest. According to a 2011 report by THINKK, the think tank for kangaroos, the notion of kangaroos as costly pests to Australian farmers has been significantly overstated. While shooters are required by the relevant Codes of Practice to aim to shoot a kangaroo in the brain and therefore cause instantaneous death, it is Voiceless's view that non-fatal body shots are unavoidable and cause horrific and painful injuries. Voiceless also claims that the death of joeys is ‘collateral damage’ to the killing of female kangaroos, with young joeys killed or left to die when the mother is shot. The kangaroo industry code allows joeys to be killed by a single blow to the head (usually with a steel pipe or against the tow bar of the shooter's truck) or through decapitation. On average, approximately 855,000 dependent joeys are killed as collateral damage of the kangaroo industry.  Law reform submissions  Voiceless has made submissions in regards to a range of law and policy reform issues over the past fifteen years.  Campaigns and publications  From 2004-2017, Voiceless ran numerous advocacy campaigns addressing a range of animal protection issues, including the use of battery cage systems for egg production and the use of sow-stalls in pig meat production. These campaigns involved the release of a number of key publications, including: * Unscrambled: The Hidden Truth of Hen Welfare (2017) * The Life of the Dairy Cow (2015) * Science and Sense: The Case for Abolishing Sow Stalls (2013) * From Nest to Nugget: An Exposé of Australia's Chicken Factories (2008) * From Label to Liable: Labelling Report (2007) * From Paddocks to Prisons (2005)  Voiceless Animal Law Lecture Series  From 2007–2017, the Voiceless Animal Law Lecture Series was held across eight Australian cities, featuring nine international keynote speakers and animal law academics from across Australia. The Lecture Series addressed a range of topics, including factory farming, ag-gag legislation, hunting and animals in politics. The Series featured a number of high profile lawyers and public figures including The Honourable Michael Kirby AC CMG, Her Excellency Professor Marie R Bashir AD CVO and Emeritus Professor Gillian Triggs, President of the Australian Human Rights Commission.  Voiceless Grants Program  From 2004-2017, the Voiceless Grants Program awarded over $1.5 million to organisations working at the forefront of animal protection. The Grants provided financial support to non-profit organisations, councils and universities for independently conceived and operated projects. Voiceless Grants funded research projects, public awareness campaigns, television and print advertisements and the publication of books and magazines. The Grants enabled over 150 projects, each contributing towards the alleviation of animal suffering in Australian factory farms and the commercial kangaroo industry.  Voiceless Media Prizes  The Voiceless Media Prizes recognised the most accurate and influential reports on factory farming, kangaroo hunting, animal law, live export and other important issues that affect animals in Australia. In 2016, the Prizes were sponsored by Hunter Hall International Limited, and included $5,000 first prizes and $2,500 runner up prizes in each of the 3 categories: Journalism in written form (published in print media); Journalism in written form (published online) and Journalism in video form (broadcast on TV or digital platforms). The successful nominees were stories which: * Addressed factory farming, food labelling and certification, live export, animal law including enforcement and governance, hunting, animal experimentation, animals in entertainment, animals killed for fashion; or * Built public understanding of animal sentience; or * Examined the ethical relationship between human and non-human animals. The winners were selected by a returning panel of judges, which included Professor J. M. Coetzee, winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize for Literature and Voiceless Patron.  Eureka Prizes  From 2005 to 2012, Voiceless supported the Australian Museum's Eureka Prizes for outstanding achievements by the scientific community. The Voiceless Eureka Prize awarded $10,000 annually to an individual or research team whose work had contributed or had the potential to contribute, to animal protection.  Education work (2017-present) = Animal Protection Education (APE)  Voiceless's Animal Protection Education (APE) program encourages students to think critically about animal protection by providing teachers with the information and tools they need to deliver complete lessons in the classroom. APEs are aligned with the year 7-10 Australian Curriculum and developed in collaboration with experienced high-school teachers. Each APE contains free and professionally developed educational resources, including videos, infographics, podcasts, quizzes and fact sheets. Accompanying classroom activities and lesson plans cover a broad range of subject areas, including English, Geography, History, Civics & Citizenship, Arts and Science. APEs ask questions without providing answers, encouraging students to think critically by questioning, considering and discussing the issues for themselves. To date, Voiceless has produced seven APEs: * Broiler Chicken Welfare (2017); * Dolphins in Captivity (2018); * Legal Personhood (2018); * Lives of Animals (2018); * Animal Allies Series (2019); * Facts and Fishes (2019); * Navigating Naplan (2020). Voiceless states on its site that it is ‘Australia’s only comprehensive animal protection education program’. Voiceless partners with the global Humane Education Coalition.  Animal Cruelty Index  The Voiceless Animal Cruelty Index (VACI) https://vaci.voiceless.org.au/ tracks the animal welfare performance of fifty countries selected among the largest producers of farmed animal products. Voiceless, together with a team of international animal welfare advocates joined together to produce the first ever Voiceless Animal Cruelty Index focusing on farmed animals. The VACI aims to provide an interactive index that evaluates and ranks countries based on the nature, extent and intensity of cruelty associated with farmed animal production and consumption in a sample of fifty countries that together account for almost 80 per cent of the world’s farmed animal population. The new index complements and makes use of the World Animal Protection Index (API). While the API focuses on the quality of animal welfare legislation across countries, the VACI seeks to measure actual farmed animal cruelty. The VACI focuses on the same 50 countries included in the API. The VACI seeks to assess the suffering caused by producers and consumers of farmed animal products, as well as the countervailing effects of the animal protection legislative and regulatory environment, as follows: * Producing Cruelty assesses country performance based on the number of farmed animals slaughtered for food every year (on a per capita basis), whilst taking explicit account of the fact that animals are treated and protected differently in each country. * Consuming Cruelty assesses country performance based on the consumption of farmed animals, by looking at the ratio of plant-based protein to farm-animal protein consumed and the number of animals consumed in each country (on a per capita basis). * Sanctioning Cruelty assesses country performance based on the societal and cultural attitudes to farmed animals, as reflected in the quality of the regulatory frameworks that protect, or fail to protect, farmed animals.  Podcast series  Voiceless produces two educational podcast series – Voiceless Animal Law Talk for animal law students, and Talking APEs for high school students.

The island is located in the Sunnfjord district of the county. The island lies just to the west of the mainland, in the mouth of the Førdefjorden. The Brufjorden runs along the north and east sides of the island and the Stavfjorden runs along the south side of the island. The island of Askrova lies about northwest of Svanøy. The island of Svanøy is heavily forested with many hills and small mountains. On Svanøy, there are plants and trees that usually are not found on the west coast of Norway, such as holly. The tall mountain Vågsfjellet is the highest mountain on the island. The boat to Florø runs several times every day from Svanøybukt. Cross of St. Olaf (in 1912) History A stone cross was erected at Brandsøy on the mainland in honor of St. Olaf, and later it was moved to the island. There is a sacrificial place from the Viking Age on the north-east side of the island. The Viking, Eirik Bloodaxe, was allegedly born on the island. The island was historically called Brulandet, and it is now called Svanøy. The name comes from the Bishop Hans Svane who owned the main farm and manor on the island from 1662--1685\\\\. Since that time, it has been known as Svanøy (lit. \\"the island of Svane\\"), although Brulandet is still one of the official names of the island. Bru Church was located on the island from the 12th century until the 1872, serving the Bru parish (named after the old name for the island). In 1872, the church was torn down and the new Stavang Church was built on the mainland to serve the parish.

William of Tyre describes him as \\"a military man, very magnificent and generous, a great favourite of the common people and with those of knightly birth.\\" Early life and election Born at the fortress of Domfront in southern Normandy, Ralph received his early education in the military arts. He eventually took holy orders and was consecrated archbishop of Mamistra. The records of this church are few and Ralph only appears as archbishop in two documents late in the pontificate of his predecessor at Antioch, Bernard of Valence, the first Latin patriarch. William of Tyre, who wrote a chronicle of the Latin East, was a child when he met Ralph, but he wrote a description of his appearance and character: > The lord Ralph was a tall, handsome man. He squinted a little, but not > excessively. He was not very well-educated, but was a fluent speaker and a > cheerful companion and had good manners. Because he was very generous he > gained the favour of the knights and of the burgesses. He was not good at > keeping agreements and promises which he had made, and would say first one > thing and then another. His was a complex character, cunning, cautious and > discerning. . . He was called arrogant and conceited and this was true. Bernard died in the late summer of 1135. The reigning Princess of Antioch was Constance, a child of seven, and so the incumbent bishops of the principality gathered uncanonically in Antioch to choose Bernard's successor. While they were meeting, the people of Antioch chose Ralph, who happened to be in the city although he was not attending the council. Although William of Tyre presents Ralph's election as the spontaneous action of the people, it was probably orchestrated by Ralph and some of his Norman compatriots. The king's bailiff, Rainald I Masoir, and the party that favored a marriage between Constance and Raymond of Poitiers have often been suspected by historians. At this enthronement, Ralph took Bernard's pallium from the altar and put it on. He explicitly rejected the supremacy of the Pope, saying that both Rome and Antioch were \\"the see of Peter and Antioch was the firstborn.\\" Pope Innocent II took no action against Ralph out of fear that the latter would choose to recognise the Antipope Anacletus II instead. Marriage of Constance and Raymond In the winter of 1135–36, Ralph supported the regency of Constance's mother, Alice. He could not, however, support her attempt at an alliance with the Byzantine Empire, since the Treaty of Devol of 1108 forbade the patriarch of Antioch from being a non-Greek Christian and the Byzantines would not recognise him as legitimate. When Raymond of Poitiers arrived before Antioch, Ralph forced him to sign an agreement whereby he would do homage to Ralph for the principality and in turn Ralph would marry him to Constance. Ralph then convinced Alice that Raymond was to marry her, whereupon she allowed him to enter Antioch and the patriarch married him to Constance. Alice then left the city, now under the control of Raymond and Ralph. Ralph's precedent for making the prince do homage to him as patriarch was the case of the first prince, Bohemond I, who in 1099 did homage to the papal legate, Dagobert of Pisa. According to William of Tyre, the power-sharing arrangement in Antioch did not succeed: > the lord patriarch in his customary way behaved more arrogantly, believing > himself superiro to the lord prince, and he was, indeed, deceived; for the > prince thought it most shameul that he had exacted an oath of fealty from > him and ... began to behave hostilely towards him and, dispensing with the > oath he had taken, allied with his enemies. Only open war with the Byzantine empire, whose efforts at alliance with Alice had been ruined by Ralph and Raymond's joint action, prevented the situation from devolving into civil war. Conflict with Byzantium In the spring of 1137, the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus attacked Prince Leo I of Cilicia, defeated him and in the summer invaded Antioch. In August, Raymond did homage to the emperor. Ralph, knowing how the emperor had expelled the Latin churchmen from Cilicia, appealed to Innocent II for help. Raymond responded by putting him in prison and, according to a Muslim source, Ibn al-Qalanisi, plundering his house. In March 1138 Innocent published an encyclical directed at Latin Christians serving in the Byzantine army, threatening them with damnation if they participated in an attack on Antioch. In May 1138, John II returned to Antioch, where Ralph, released from prison, presided over the ceremony in the cathedral that marked the end of the Byzantine campaign. His change of fortune was probably the result of the papal encyclical, since John required Innocent's assistance in building up an anti-Sicilian alliance. Before John left, Count Joscelin II of Edessa incited a riot of Franks in the city, but full warfare between Frank and Byzantine was avoided. Dispute over revenues Early in his episcopate, Ralph entered into conflict with an archdeacon named Lambert and another canon, Arnulf, over the apportionment of revenues. Ralph accused them both of conspiring to kill him, removed them from their benefices and imprisoned them. William of Tyre contrasts Lambert, \\"a learned man of upright life with little or no experience in worldly affairs\\", with Arnulf, \\"learned and worldly-wise\\", who was a nobleman from Calabria with connexions to the king of Sicily. After Raymond's marriage to Constance, he released the imprisoned priests. In the summer of 1138 he encouraged them to appeal to Rome and forced Ralph to go also and defend himself. When Ralph landed at Brindisi, he was immediately arrested by men sent by King Roger II of Sicily, and placed in the custody of Arnulf's family while awaiting a summons. In the end he was able to convince Roger that he was at odds with Raymond—Roger's real enemy—and allowed to go on to Rome. At Rome, Ralph received the pallium from Innocent II. The consistory found the evidence insufficient to proceed and sent a legate to Antioch to resolve the dispute. On his return journey, Ralph visited the Sicilian court and was accompanied by a Sicilian fleet on his return to Antioch in the fall of 1138. Raymond refused him entry and he had to stay in one of the monasteries on the Black Mountain outside Antioch. Joscelin of Edessa, who had started the riot in Antioch after Raymond and the emperor made peace, then invited Ralph to Edessa, where he spent the winter of 1138–39. In the spring, Raymond invited Ralph back, and the latter returned accompanied by the three archbishops of the county of Edessa. The papal legate, the archbishop Peter, arrived soon after, but on 25 May, before reaching Antioch, he died at Acre. With the death of the legate and the victory of Roger II over Innocent II at the battle of Mignano on 22 July the balance of power had swung in Ralph's favour. Lambert made his peace and was re-instated, but Arnulf returned to Rome to seek a new legate. In the fall, Innocent appointed Alberic of Ostia to hear the case. Deposition Although Ralph was permitted to stay in Antioch while awaiting the arrival of Alberic, it appears that Raymond was exercising some of the juridical authority of the patriarchate contrary to canon law. In February 1140, the prince and the Antiochene Haut Cour (high court) heard a claim launched by the prior and seneschal of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on some property which had been held by the monastery of Saint Paul's in Antioch since the First Crusade. Abbot Robert disputed the jurisdiction of the court, which found in favour of the Sepulchre. Alberic arrived in the East in June 1140. After accompanying Raymond on the summer military campaign, he summoned all the bishops of the patriarchates of Antioch and Jerusalem to a synod at Antioch on 30 November. The meeting lasted until 2 December and was attended by the patriarch of Jerusalem, the archbishops of Apamea, Caesarea, Cyrrhus, Hierapolis, Nazareth, Tarsus and Tyre, and the bishops of Beirut, Bethlehem, Jabala, Latakia and Sidon. The clergy of the County of Tripoli did not show, probably forbidden by their count, and only the Edessan archbishops (Hierapolis and Cyrrhus) and that of Apamea sided with Ralph. Ralph was charged with an uncanonical election, simony and fornication. He refused to attend the synod, and Archbishop Serlo of Apamea questioned its authority to proceed in the absence of the defendant, perhaps on the grounds that he had not been duly summoned. Serlo was deposed and defrocked for his audacity. The people of Antioch, according to William of Tyre, supported the patriarch and would have expelled the legate had they not feared the Raymond's power. After his deposition, Ralph was placed in irons and incarcerated in the monastery of Saint Symeon on the Black Mountain. Escape and death According to William of Tyre, Ralph eventually escaped his prison and made his way to Rome. There he appealed his deposition (probably to Lucius II) and was re-instated as patriarch. As he was preparing to return, he was poisoned. These events probably occurred around 1144. Bishop Otto of Freising records how, when he visited Rome in 1145, he met the bishop of Jabala, Hugh, a long-time opponent of Ralph's, who was there to complain about the patriarch. Since the only patriarch about whom Hugh would have had a complaint is Ralph, it is likely that he was in Rome to protest the latter's re-instatement. Ralph's death must have occurred by 1149, when his successor, Aimery of Limoges, who had exercised the patriarchate since at least 1143, was finally recognised as the legal patriarch. Summing up Ralph's life, William of Tyre remarks, \\"He was like Marius: he experienced in his own life the extremes of good and ill fortune.\\" NotesSources * * Category:1140s deaths Category:Latin Patriarchs of Antioch Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Ralph of Domfront"},{"id":"40985809","text":"is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiri Kaji.

Perhaps the earliest account of the ALL was written by French surgeon Paul Segond in 1879, in which he described a ligamentous structure between the lateral femur and tibia.Segond P (1879) Recherches cliniques et expérimentales sur les épanchements sanguins du genou par entorse. Progrès Médical (Paris) (accessible from ), 1-85. Claes and Bellemans (2013) found that the ALL originates at the lateral epicondyle of the femur, and inserts at the anterolateral aspect of the proximal tibia. However, Vincent et al. (2012) reported the origin to be the lateral femoral condyle. Clinical relevance The ALL, which has been suggested to occur in 33-97% of the human population, seems to stabilize medial rotation of the knee. However, the anterior cruciate ligament is the most important contributor to rotatory knee stability. It is uncertain if an isolated anterolateral ligament injury with an intact anterior cruciate ligament injury leads to knee instability. This topic is being hotly debated and researched. The \\"pivot shift\\" phenomenon in anterior cruciate ligament injury patients may be ascribed to additional trauma to the ALL or other structures in the anterolateral knee. The Segond fracture is probably an avulsion of the anterolateral ligament. In such injuries, fragments of the lateral tibial condyle of the knee are torn from the bone by the soft tissue structures of the anterolateral knee.

Songs of Innocence was written by William Blake in 1789 as part of his Illuminated Books. Blake's aim for his Songs was to depict the two contrary states of human existence: innocence and experience. The Songs speak upon the \\"innocence\\" of being a child and the \\"experience\\" gained over a lifetime. The Songs are separated into ten different objects, with each object offering a different situation and how it is viewed from a child's perspective. Background Blake was a non-conformist. He opposed the British monarchy and aligned his thoughts with Thomas Paine and Mary Wollstonecraft. Blake was an advocate for using the imagination over natural observations. He believed ideal forms should arise from inner visions. Blake's Songs of Innocence is an illuminated anthology first printed in 1789. Each poem contains an etched illustration by Blake, combining his poetry with intricate drawings. Songs of Innocence is a lyric collection that depicts an idyllic world before adulthood, where the spirit of children is still religiously pure. In some of the poems in this work, such as \\"The Chimney Sweeper\\" and \\"The Little Black Boy\\", Blake uses irony and rhetoric to portray the corruption of innocence in youth. Songs of Innocence were later combined with Blake's Songs of Experience, becoming Songs of Innocence and Experience and bringing the total number of poems in the work to thirty-one. The two collections were printed combined as well as separately from 1794. Summary Night is a poem that describes two contrasting places: Earth, where nature runs wild, and Heaven, where predation and violence are nonexistent. It is influenced by a passage from the Old Testament: Isaiah 11:6-8 \\"The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.\\" In the poem, the first stanza describes a landscape with \\"the sun descending,\\" when the world is settling quietly into night. Night has a positive connotation in this poem because the moon \\"sits and smiles on the night,\\" showing how night is silent and peaceful. This is continued in stanza two, where angels tread where lambs had grazed, \\"pour[ing] blessing.\\" The angels' duties are described in stanza three. Angels \\"visit caves\\" and \\"look in...nest[s],\\" keeping the animals safe and giving them sleep when the animals are mournful. Although the angels aim to keep all those under their care from harm, \\"wolves and tigers howl for prey\\" and threaten to ruin the angels' efforts. When these predators successfully attack their prey, the prey is received by the angels in Heaven, greeted with a better life. In Heaven, the lion is not a predator any more, but a guardian that is dedicated to serving God. He will lie down with the lamb, \\"pitying the tender,\\" and worship the Lord Poem Copy AA of William Blake's hand painted print of \\"Night\\". This copy, printed and painted in 1826, is currently held by the Fitzwilliam Museum. The second page of night from the same copy as the previous image. Themes An interpretation of Blake's \\"Night\\" is offered in D. G. Gillham's book William Blake published in 1966. Gillham explains how this poem gives divine beings a clear identity, unlike other poems in Songs of Innocence. The identity and actions of the angels show how all will be cared for after death. Gillham discusses the eternity described in the poem, where the lamb \\"can lie down and sleep\\" next to the lion. The eternity described is one in which man and animal will be cared for by a divine being. Gillham also points out how the divine eternity is an extension of the pleasures of the earthly world. He mentions how the lion still guards the lamb in \\"Heaven,\\" showing that there is still some \\"unspecified disaster\\" that has not yet come to pass. This \\"new world\\" is similar to the earthly world and all its virtues. Zachary Leader offers another interpretation in his book Reading Blake's Songs. Leader recognises that the poem does not try to \\"explain away\\" any of the suffering that those in the poem endure, suffering that does not sway the faith of the speaker. Leader argues that the poem suggests that earth contains \\"our angels and heavens,\\" not a divine world. He claims that Blake uses the lion to show that heaven is earthly. The ruddy and crying eyes of the lion depict heaven as \\"a place of tears,\\" showing that the world need not be transcended to achieve innocence. Leader's view is similar to Gillham's in that it argues Blake is showing that Heaven is more like earth than a different, new world. In the book The Problematic Vision of Innocence: A View from Night, Norma Greco argues that the poem is not a \\"celebration of the ... harmony ... of Innocence.\\" The speaker does not realise what redemption truly is, and experiences spiritual loss in his misconception of redemption. The apparent earth-like qualities of Heaven shows the misconceptions of Heaven by the speaker. The contrast between the poem and its illustrations show the \\"spiritual error\\" of the speaker. The first illustration is a large tree enveloping the words, while the second has five women at the bottom of the plate. This inclusion of people in the second drawing depicts the symbolic shift of the speaker towards a spiritual loss. Night is not celebrating innocence but is showing the ignorant misconceptions of Christian redemption. Heather Glen's Vision and Disenchantment: Blake's Songs and Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads argues that \\"Night\\" is an exploration of social anxiety. Society has \\"mutual reassurances,\\" which provide comfort in worldly things and not Heaven or God. The wolves and tigers that appear at night threaten to disrupt the norms of society and create panic. She also mentions the concept of night being associated with faith. Blake was familiar with this concept, and she believes Blake used it in order to further emphasise the strong faith symbols and themes in the poem. Glen also discusses \\"Night\\" in relation to the other poems included in Blake's Songs of Innocence. She claims that the poem is written with other elements of various poems within Songs of Innocence. The use of these other elements provides a \\"formal resolution\\" for the works as a whole. Edward Larrissy also mentions social anxiety in his book William Blake. He claims that \\"Night\\" focuses on \\"illusory comfort,\\" which is closely aligned with the \\"mutual reassurances\\" mentioned by Glen. Although society may be comforted with material things, there is no comfort like that of Heaven. Larrissy states that the poem shows how looking for comfort in society, in worldly things, is \\"enslaving.\\" Having this false sense of comfort leads to an unfulfilled life and a complete loss of innocence. The end of \\"Night\\" shifts its focus to God, showing that true comfort and salvation can only come from the supernatural. The complexity of \\"Night\\" is addressed in Hazard Adams' William Blake: A Reading of the Shorter Poems. Adams claims that the poem is complex because of the speaker's push to join the natural and supernatural world together. These are two concepts that \\"to [a] child have never been apart,\\" but for an adult, are much more difficult to join together. The speaker wants to achieve a state of innocence that joins the natural and supernatural, one that is natural for a child, but unnatural of an adult who has lost his innocence. The speaker's frustration creates a tone of melancholy in the poem as he attempts to attain a higher state of innocence. In Harold Bloom's interpretation of \\"Night,\\" Bloom notes the melancholy tone of the poem Adams also mentioned in his interpretation of the poem. Bloom believes this melancholy is caused by the speaker's awareness of the delicate balance of innocence. The speaker realizes that the harmony of innocence can be easily corrupted. Bloom also acknowledges a \\"gentle irony\\" in the poem. In order to attain a higher state of innocence, you must separate the supernatural and the natural. In some literature, a natural state is argued to bring one closer to God or the supernatural. Instead of using nature as a way to grow closer to the supernatural or a higher being, Blake severs the natural and supernatural to show that one cannot be attached to both the natural and supernatural worlds. Criticism Many poets have offered their criticism of Blake and his works. T. S. Eliot, a Nobel Prize–winning poet, had this to say about Blake and his Songs of Innocence: \\"The Songs of Innocence and of Experience, and the poems from the Rossetti manuscript, are the poems of a man with a profound interest in human emotions, and a profound knowledge of them. The emotions are presented in an extremely simplified, abstract form. This form is one illustration of the eternal struggle of art against education, of the literary artist against the continuous deterioration of language.\\" The poet Krystyna Kapitulka criticises \\"Night\\": \\"We have here, as it were, a reconcilitation of day and night...\\" She also says that the images portrayed in the poem seems to \\"match nicely the atmosphere of a child's dream.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Comparison of extant versions of Blake's original copies of \\"Night\\" available at the William Blake Archive Category:Songs of Innocence and of Experience Category:1789 poems ","title":"Night (Blake)"},{"id":"40986552","text":"William Allan McInnes Green or W.

Enrico Mosconi returned to Buenos Aires that year with the two youngest children, leaving the older children in a prestigious school located in the Alpes-Maritimes region. His second wife was María Luisa Matti, born in Buenos Aires, the daughter of Guillermo Matti and Hermenegilda Pagani, natives of Switzerland. His father-in-law was an entrepreneur, linked to the construction of the Buenos Aires Campana railway). In Buenos Aires he maintained friendly ties with distinguished members of the local aristocracy, including Roque Sáenz Peña, Adolfo Alsina, godfather of María Mosconi Canavery, and Carlos Pellegrini, godfather of Guillermo Mosconi Matti. He also had excellent relations with the British and Irish community of Argentina. His niece Sara Mosconi was married to Juan Bird Guillon, belonging to a family of Galway. In 1888 Enrico Mosconi acquired land in the town Los Algarrobos (San Martín Department), belonging to Agustín Hamilton Johnston, born in Newcastle. Mosconi suggested the change of the denomination of the town in honor of his friend Carlos Pellegrini, whose mother Mary Bevans Brigh was originally from London, England.

Medical use  It can be inferred from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that all persons have the right to refuse medication, and this right is often enshrined in national law. In some situations, patients may lack capacity to make decisions about accepting or refusing medication. In these situations, it may be appropriate to covertly administer medication, after other measures have been attempted. Medication is only likely to be administered covertly where: * The patient actively refuses their medicine * It is determined to be essential to the patient's mental or physical health, and therefore in their best interest * The patient is deemed to lack capacity to understand the repercussions of refusing the medication. Covert administration of medication is practised in a range of medical specialities and across a variety of care settings including psychiatry, paediatrics, geriatric medicine and care homes. In the care of paediatric patients, young children may be unwilling to take medication with an unpleasant taste or smell, or due to fear of the unfamiliar. In these cases, the medication is mixed with food or drink to make it more acceptable. In dementia, patients suffer from memory loss and can have impaired decision making skills. As a result their capacity to consent to medication is impaired. In these cases medication may need to be covertly administered, as is the case in nursing homes. Impaired capacity is also seen in patients with intellectual disability. These patients may exhibit behaviours that challenge or symptoms of mental ill health, for which medication is needed to reduce risk of harm to self or others. Medication is covertly given with respect to best interest when these patients refuse treatment. Patients with mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, may lack insight into their mental health symptoms. They refuse medication due to the belief it is not needed.  Medicolegal implications  Covert medication has many medicolegal and ethical aspects to it. Human Rights Act in the United Kingdom The Human Rights Act, part of UK law, incorporates the European Convention of Human Rights and has several implications for mental health patients. Relevant articles concerning mental health and covert medicine administration in the Human Rights Act are listed below: Article 3 \\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment\\" Article 5 \\"Right to liberty and security\\" 5(1) \\"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person save ... (e)the lawful detention...of persons of unsound mind...\\" 5(2) \\"Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest...\\" 5(4) \\"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty...shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\\" Article 8 \\"Right to respect for private and family life\\" Mental Health Act The Mental Health Act is an Act passed through Parliament in the United Kingdom which applies to people in England and Wales. In specific circumstances, this overrides certain fundamental human rights mentioned above. For example, those with mental health problems can be sectioned under the Mental Health Act to be kept in hospital, possibly against their wishes, particularly if they are at risk of harm to themselves, harm to others and harm from others. The Mental Health Act is limited to treatments of a patient's mental health. Under the Mental Health Act, it is not appropriate to give medicines covertly to treat physical health, only mental health. Mental Capacity Act 2005 Generally, to receive any kind of health treatment, you need to give consent. In England and Wales, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 sets out legislation criteria and procedure for patients who do not have the capacity to make decisions for themselves. In this situation, a management plan is agreed in the best interests of the patient. This involves a meeting with healthcare professionals, care home staff and an independent reviewer, such as a family member, friend or independent mental capacity advocate. Capacity should be assessed each time a new medical decision is made, as the ability to give valid consent can fluctuate, particularly in those with mental health disorders. Covert administration is only necessary and appropriate where: * A person actively refuses a medicine. * It is safe to do so * The medication is deemed essential to their health and wellbeing. * The person is judged not to have the capacity to understand the consequences of their refusal, determined by the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The Mental Capacity Act applies to the administration of medication and treatment for any condition covertly. This is in contrast to the Mental Health Act, which applies to mental health, as above.  Application  In the UK, NHS trusts may publish guidelines concerning administration of covert medication. Guidelines often include flowcharts to aid decision making. \\"Covert administration should be: A last resort – only implemented when there is no viable alternative; Medicine specific – the need must be identified for each medicine prescribed; Time limited – it should be used for as short a time as possible, and the need should be reviewed regularly.\\" The decision making process should be in the best interests of the patient, transparent and inclusive. NICE recommends care home providers have a care home medicines policy that includes guidance on covert administration of medications by care home staff.  Pharmacology  Covert administration of medication typically involves mixing the medication with food or drink. This can have an impact on the absorption of the drug. Absorption of some medicines, such as antibiotics, can be reduced when mixed with food, particularly dairy products. Some medicines are incompatible with various minerals including calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc, all of which may reduce absorption. Crushing slow- releasing tablets or enteric coated medicines may also reduce absorption of the medicines. Mixing medications with food or drink may also affect the metabolism of the drug. For example, grapefruit juice changes the bioavailability of many medicines by decreasing the rate of elimination. This alters drug levels in the blood which may cause side effects or make the drug less effective.

Although Peale introduced many innovations to the Mint of the United States, he was eventually dismissed amid allegations he had used his position for personal gain. Peale was the son of painter Charles Willson Peale, and was born in the museum of curiosities that his father ran in Philadelphia. For the most part, Franklin Peale's education was informal, though he took some classes at the University of Pennsylvania. He became adept in machine making. In 1820, he became an assistant to his father at the museum, and managed it after Charles Peale's death in 1827. In 1833, Peale was hired by the Mint, and was sent for two years to Europe to study and report back on coining techniques. He returned with plans for improvement, and designed the first steam-powered coinage press in the United States, installed in 1836. Peale was made Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint that year, and Chief Coiner three years later upon the retirement of the incumbent, Adam Eckfeldt, who continued in his work without pay. Eckfeldt's labor allowed Peale to run a medal business using Mint property. This sideline eventually caused Peale's downfall: conflicts with Engraver James B. Longacre and Melter and Refiner Richard Sears McCulloh led to Peale being accused of misconduct, and he was dismissed by President Franklin Pierce in 1854. In retirement, Peale continued his involvement in and leadership of many civic organizations; he died in 1870. Numismatic author Q. David Bowers suggests that the facts of Peale's career allow writers to draw very different conclusions about him.  Early life and career  Benjamin Franklin Peale was born October 15, 1795, to painter Charles Willson Peale and his second wife, the former Elizabeth de Peyster. As well as pursuing his art, Charles Peale ran a museum of curiosities housed in Philosophical Hall in Philadelphia, home of the American Philosophical Society. The boy was born in the family quarters in the museum. He was given the name Aldrovand, after the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi. Charles Peale recorded family births on the flyleaf of a copy of Matthew Pilkington's Dictionary of Painters, rather than in a Bible, and after recording \\"Aldrovand\\" added the notation, \\"if he likes that name when he comes of age\\". The father was a member of the American Philosophical Society, and in February 1796 brought his young son to a meeting, and asked the members to select another name for the child. They decided on Benjamin Franklin Peale, naming the boy after the Society's founder, Benjamin Franklin. Society legend holds that the boy was given the name while placed in the chair of the president of the Society, which had been donated by Franklin. Elizabeth de Peyster Peale, by her husband Charles, who is seen in miniature Franklin Peale was one of sixteen children his father would have by his three wives. Elizabeth Peale died when Franklin was eight years old, but his father soon remarried, and the child was thereafter cared for by his stepmother. He was given little classroom education, though he did spend some time at a local school in nearby Bucks County, as well as at Germantown Academy and the University of Pennsylvania. For the most part, his education was informal, as was usual in the Peale family, with the student given the means to study what interested him, or what he appeared to be good at. In Franklin Peale's case, he made toys as a boy, and surveyed his father's farm near Germantown. Although he lacked the artistic talent of some of his brothers, such as Titian Peale, he proved mechanically inclined. At age 17, Peale began to work for the Delaware cotton factory of William Young, on the Brandywine River, learning the making of machines. He was an apt student, becoming adept as a turner, founder, and draftsman. He was tolerated in his desire for a mechanical career by his father, who considered it a foolish whim. Within a year, one of the Hodgson brothers, who ran a nearby machine shop, described Peale as highly capable with tools. At age 19 Peale returned to Germantown, where, having designed and supervised the installation of the machinery for a cotton factory there, he was put in charge, and continued to manage the factory for several years. He then moved to nearby Philadelphia, and worked for the firm of John & Coleman Sellers,Coleman Sellers was married to Peale's half-sister Sophonisba. which made machinery for card sticking. Charles Willson Peale, self portrait, The Artist in His Museum (1822) On April 24, 1815, Peale, still a minor at age 19, married Eliza Greatrake without his father's consent. Almost immediately, it became evident she had mental problems. Although Eliza bore Peale a child within the first year of the marriage (a daughter, Anna), she thereafter left him, returning to live with her mother, who had her committed to Pennsylvania Hospital as a \\"lunatic\\". The Peale family began a lengthy effort to show that Eliza Peale was mad when she married Franklin, a ground for annulment. With aid from the testimony of Captain Allen McLane, they were successful, and the annulment was granted on March 22, 1820. Franklin Peale was required to post assets as security for the support of his former wife; his sister Sophy lent him some of her stock in the museum for that purpose. In 1820, Peale left factory management to assist his aging father in running the museum, and remained there for over a decade. When Charles Willson Peale died in 1827, Franklin became the manager of the museum, and like his siblings, inherited stock in it. He not only maintained the exhibits, but added to them, contributing a \\"curious speaking toy\\" as well as the model for an early locomotive, which was used to draw two small cars in the museum, with seating for four people. At the time, the museum was located in the Old State House (today, Independence Hall), and Peale worked out a system for using the State House bell to inform fire companies of the location of a blaze. Admission token to the Peale Museum, 1821 Peale was one of the founders of The Franklin Institute in 1824, one of several mechanics' institutes that came into being in the early 1820s to provide working men with technical education. It quickly became important and influential, organizing an exhibition of American manufactured goods that October, one of at least 26 such shows that it put on in the first 34 years of its existence. Peale taught natural history, mechanics (illustrating his lectures with models and drawings), and chemistry, livening the talks with experiments. He was for many years actively involved with The Franklin Institute, writing articles for its Journal and serving on key committees.  Mint employee and officer (1833–1854) = Hiring and Europe mission  The second building to house the Philadelphia Mint opened in 1833, with up-to-date technology except in the coining process. For this, it used the transplanted machinery of its predecessor, using human muscle power to strike coins. Although the Mint wanted all coins to be identical to others of the same denomination, the use of the screw press was an impediment to this, as the force used to impress the design on the coins was not uniform. Additionally, the coinage dies were made by hand, leading to differences between coins of the same year struck from different dies. This state of affairs was unsatisfactory to the director, Samuel Moore, who had for several years contemplated purchasing a modern set of steam machinery for the production of coins from the Soho Mint in Birmingham, England, founded by coining pioneer Matthew Boulton. Moore instead decided to engage a new employee and send him on a special tour of European mints and refineries, in order to learn the best features of each and bring the knowledge home for use at the Philadelphia facility. The individual would be given the title of Assistant to the Assayer, Jacob R. Eckfeldt. Moore obtained the approval of Treasury Secretary Louis McLane and an appropriation of $7,000 for the purpose. Moore, in a letter to McLane, noted that sending an agent to Europe to gather technology had been discussed in the past, but proposals had foundered over the difficulty of finding a person both competent enough to undertake the trip successfully and not too busy to spend a year or more in Europe. At the recommendation of the director's first cousin, Robert M. Patterson, Moore hired Peale for the position. According to Patterson, \\"I do not know any man more likely to succeed in such a mission. His skill, his perseverance, his address all fit him for the errand.\\" Peale was willing to go, writing, \\"a variety of circumstances render me very desirous of vacating the situation that I have held for many years as Manager of the Phila Museum, it will therefore be agreeable to change even at a pecuniary sacrifice.\\" Peale departed from New York for Le Havre on May 8, 1833, arriving in Paris late in the month. At this time, it was only certain that Peale would visit Paris—a visit to England, with instruction at local mints and refineries, was still under discussion. Peale had been instructed to learn \\"parting,\\" a newly developed method for separating gold and silver. This process, also dubbed refining, is necessary because nuggets that contain gold also contain some silver, and the latter metal must be removed before the gold can be alloyed with copper for coining. The older method of removing silver involved the use of nitric and sulphuric acids, and was dangerous and expensive. Director Moore also instructed Peale to gain the method of assaying silver by the \\"humid process\\" (titration), and to learn everything he could of coining technology and how it was powered by steam. Moore warned, \\"a very material object of your mission is to be regarded as unaccomplished, until you have become familiar with everything requisite for directing the formation of an establishment de novo [from nothing] ... and until you shall have acquired a good share of adroitness in the actual manipulations ... Whatever can be added to our information in regard to the treatment of the precious metals, and Mint processes and machinery is within the scope of your inquiries.\\" Moore asked that, if Peale had any time remaining, to look into other technologies that might be useful to the United States, such as the gas illumination of cities. With the aid of the United States Minister to France, Edward Livingston, Peale gained permission to study closely the workings of the Monnaie de Paris. The staff there was cooperative, and Peale was able to learn the \\"humid\\" method from watching the assayer as he verified the silver content of the coins from the French branch mints. Peale's notes were supplemented by detailed engravings of all the fixtures used in the process, published and sold by the Paris mint at an expense of 98 francs 50 centimes, which Peale deemed worth the purchase on the US government's behalf. Peale also purchased a set of the apparatus for the humid method, made and sold by the mint; Peale paid 500 francs for this. Some of the machinery that would be installed on Peale's return to Philadelphia was based on what he saw in Paris. He sketched the Monnaie de Paris's Thonnelier model coin presses. He also copied the Paris facility's Tour á portrait reducing lathe. He could not learn parting there as the facility contracted the process to private refineries; attempts to gain permission to learn the process at these facilities failed when their owners demanded huge sums, believing that Peale, as a government agent, was flush with money. Peale journeyed to London, hoping that Moore's connections could get him instruction in the parting process. Although he visited the Royal Mint, he found officials there unhelpful and unwilling to teach him. In England, Peale studied the method of assaying via the humid process at Percival N. Johnson's refinery, and in 1835 introduced it to the Philadelphia Mint, replacing assaying by cupellation. Peale wrote that he \\"cannot speak in too high terms of Mr. Percival Johnson ... I have derived much useful information in his refinery particularly his method of separating silver, gold and paladium [palladium] by a shortened process\\". While in London, Peale ordered a delicate balance scale from his friend, expatriate American Joseph Saxton, and later induced Saxton to return to the United States and work for the Philadelphia Mint. Peale returned to France where, as the refiners wanted payment for teaching him the French method of parting, he learned it by observing the assayer at the branch mint in Rouen. He was not completely happy with this, as he was not allowed to practice it himself, or to experiment, but felt that he could reproduce what he had seen on his return to Philadelphia. Peale also visited the German mints of Dresden, Stuttgart, and Karlsruhe. In Germany, parting was done in iron vessels; although Peale noted these were cheaper than platinum ones, he preferred the latter, writing in December 1834 that use of iron \\"sometimes leads to losses that are embarrassing.\\" He also visited Freiberg, in Saxony, observing the smelting and refining of lead ore.  Return and results  Peale's sketch of the steam engine he designed for the Philadelphia Mint On June 17, 1835, Peale submitted his report to Moore, 276 pages of his observations at the various European mints he had visited, and his comments and recommendations. He warned, \\"in the organization of Mints in both France and England that there are offices and incumbents, that are useless, and who render no services of importance for their appointment\\". He recommended favorably the French practice of not appointing a coin designer, but having competitions judged jointly by Mint officers and by artists. Peale also urged the passage of a single, comprehensive Mint Act, to replace the scattered bits of legislation passed over the years; this was done in 1837. One recommendation submitted by Peale, but not adopted, was to have the Mint set up a guaranty department, to hallmark items made of gold or silver by the private sector as public assurance of their quality, as done by the Goldsmiths Company in London. He also recommended that the Philadelphia Mint strike medals, as did its French counterpart. He suggested that the Mint establish a museum of coins and coining, as the Paris facility had. The first steam- powered press at a US mint, designed by Peale (photographed in 2015) Peale returned from Europe with plans he had drawn for a steam-powered coinage press, borrowing the steam machinery design from English mints and the toggle joint technology from French ones. In September, Patterson, by then Mint Director in place of the retired Moore, wrote to Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury, \\"we have just completed under the superintendence of Mr. Peale, a model of a coining press from plans which he saw in successful operation in France and in Germany, and possessing many very manifest advantages over the Screw press now applied at the Mint. Among these one of the most important is that [it] admits the immediate and easy application of steam power.\\" Director Patterson called March 23, 1836 \\"an epoch in our coinage\\". To take advantage of the new press's increased production capacity, Peale designed a new machine to cut planchets, or blanks, from metal strips. This machine remained in use, almost unmodified, until 1902. Another of the steam-powered machines Peale had installed on his return was a milling machine, which was used to \\"upset\\" the coin—to form a rim around it. A Contamin portrait lathe was imported from France and installed at the Philadelphia Mint in 1837. Prior to this time, all coin dies for American coins had to be made individually, by hand at Philadelphia. Once the lathe was installed, they could be reproduced mechanically by the pantograph-like device. Medal struck for the first US steam coinage, 1836. Designed by Christian Gobrecht. The first pieces produced by steam power at the Philadelphia Mint, commemorative medals, were struck on March 23, 1836. The first steam press there then began minting cents, with silver and gold coinage first struck there by steam towards the end of the year. Built by the Philadelphia firm of Merrick, Agnew, and Taylor to Peale's design, the press was able to coin 100 pieces per minute. After being retired from government service, the press was used at The Franklin Institute to strike miniature medals for many years, and in 2000 was moved to the American Numismatic Association's Money Museum in Colorado Springs. Patterson wrote, Numismatist Roger Burdette notes, \\"in most respects, Peale seems to have selected the best from European examples, and discarded all unnecessary complexity and ineffective motion.\\" Although minor improvements were made from time to time, these machines struck the nation's coinage for the remainder of Peale's life. According to numismatist David Lange, \\"the fact-finding journey of [future] Philadelphia Mint Melter and Refiner Franklin Peale through the mints of Europe from 1833 to 1835 assured that United States coins would be second to none in terms of technology.\\" Lange, in his history of the Mint, notes that though Peale ended his career by being fired amid accusations of impropriety, upon his return from Europe, \\"he was the bearer of many innovations devised in the mints of Europe and now made available to the United States Mint at Philadelphia\\". Robert Patterson III, son of the Mint Director under whom Peale served for many years, wrote that through Peale's report, \\"our Mint was placed in full possession of all that was then worthy to be known\\" from foreign mints and refineries. Patterson indicated that he had often thought, as he passed through the Philadelphia Mint's coining department, that a plaque should be set up to Peale reproducing the tribute to Sir Christopher Wren in London's St. Paul's Cathedral, Si Monumentum Requiris, Circumspice (if you seek his monument, look around you).  Melter and Refiner  Joseph Cloud had held the position of Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint since 1797. The Washington administration appointee resigned, effective at the start of 1836. Peale was nominated as Cloud's replacement by President Andrew Jackson on December 21, 1835, and was confirmed by the Senate on January 5, 1836. A Philadelphia Mint counting board, invented by Peale On taking office as Melter and Refiner, Peale implemented the changes he had recommended based on what he had seen in Europe. He also wanted additional mechanization in the mint's Coining Department, headed by Chief Coiner Adam Eckfeldt, whose son Jacob was the Philadelphia Mint's Assayer. Adam Eckfeldt had helped strike some of the first federal coins in 1792 and had been in his office since 1814. Eckfeldt was reluctant to adopt all Peale's recommendations, telling Peale's nephew, engineer George Sellers, \\"If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down ... he wants something better and no doubt he would have it if we were starting anew.\\" As improvements crept in despite Eckfeldt's caution, the Chief Coiner saw their value and became more enthusiastic, noting the savings in working time afforded by the Contamin lathe, which had been imported from France after being seen by Peale there. To help deal with the increased output from the Philadelphia Mint, Peale invented a piling-box, allowing planchets or coins to be quickly stacked, and a counting board, speeding the work of the clerks. The counting board remained in use until the mints installed mechanical counters in 1934. One of the innovations that Peale introduced as Melter and Refiner was the use of salt in parting, using it to recover the silver dissolved in nitric acid when gold bullion was being purified. Previously, this could only be done by using copper, a process that generated dangerous and offensive fumes. Table salt (sodium chloride), dissolved in nitric acid, caused silver chloride to precipitate, which could be recovered as metallic silver through the use of zinc and sulfuric acid. This was a further refinement of the parting process; the director of the Monnaie de Paris, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, had first used a salt solution as an easy, accurate means of assaying silver. A Senate report in 1873 stated that Peale's advancement of this process \\"attests to his genius, enterprise, and high attainments\\". When there were calls in Congress in 1836 for a two-cent piece to be made of debased silver, or billon, Patterson had Peale, working with Second Engraver Christian Gobrecht, strike pattern coins to show that the coins would be easily counterfeited using base metals. In 1835, Congress had authorized branch mints at Charlotte, North Carolina, Dahlonega, Georgia, and New Orleans, Louisiana, to strike into American coin the gold being mined in or entering the country through the South. Despite the rich gold deposits nearby, both Charlotte and Dahlonega were in areas lacking men with technical training; accordingly trained personnel would have to be sent from Philadelphia. New buildings were to be constructed. In August 1837, Mint Director Patterson received word of problems at both sites, including a partial collapse of the Dahlonega building. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury, proposing \\"to send, to both the Gold mints, a confidential & skillful person, who may ... give instructions as to correcting the errors, that have been committed ... I know of no one competent to this task, except our Melter & Refiner, Mr. Peale.\\" Woodbury agreed, informing Patterson, \\"you are authorized to send Mr. Peak.\\" Peale, accompanied by his daughter Anna, arrived in Charlotte on September 23, 1837. He found that necessary equipment had not yet arrived, and without it he could do little. Peale ordered a search made, and reported to Patterson that he was \\"in a trap\\" in \\"this fag end of creation\\" in a town where \\"the only active beings are the hogs\\". Peale spent time visiting the mines on which the Charlotte Mint would rely for bullion. He proposed to Patterson that he continue to New Orleans after Dahlonega, to which the Mint Director replied that he would \\"exercise my veto upon your proposed long delay\\" and \\"your presence [in Philadelphia] cannot be dispensed with\\". On October 27, much of the missing equipment arrived in Charlotte, and Peale was able to complete his mission there and leave for Dahlonega on November 10. Following a difficult journey over primitive mountain roads, Franklin and Anna Peale arrived there on November 15. After assessing the problems at the nascent Dahlonega Mint, Peale reported to Patterson, Nevertheless, Peale recommended that construction on the building continue, as he deemed Congress unlikely to pass another appropriation for construction. The Peales left Dahlonega at the end of November. On their way north, Anna was slightly injured when the train in which they were riding through Virginia derailed. Peale was back at his desk at the Philadelphia Mint on December 23, 1837. Roger Burdette discusses the influence Peale had on the Mint in the 1830s:  Chief Coiner  Appointment and early years = Reverse of Adam Eckfeldt retirement medal, attributed to Peale or to Moritz Fuerst When Adam Eckfeldt retired in 1839, he recommended Peale as his successor. As the Senate was not sitting, Peale was given a recess appointment as Chief Coiner of the Philadelphia Mint by President Martin Van Buren on March 27, 1839. On January 23, 1840, after the Senate reconvened, Van Buren nominated Peale; the Senate gave its approval on February 17. Despite his retirement, Eckfeldt continued to come to the mint every day until shortly before his death in February 1852, performing the function of Chief Coiner and leaving Peale with time on his hands. Soon after his appointment, Peale began to engage in a private business on the Mint's premises. He did this by designing, striking and selling medals for private commission, using government property and labor, and the Philadelphia Mint's facilities. Peale's enterprise was very profitable, as his expenses were minimal. This activity took place with the knowledge of the other officers of the Philadelphia Mint, most of whom were Peale's friends and relatives. Clients included corporations as well as one couple celebrating a 50th wedding anniversary. According to Robert E. Wright in his history of Philadelphia as an early financial center, the legality of Peale's business was unclear, but \\"the uncertainty of the situation made it almost inevitable that someone would make a stink on [Philadelphia's] Chestnut Street.\\" This activity has been variously characterized by numismatic writers. According to coin dealer and numismatic author Q. David Bowers, \\"Peale started to abuse his position and privileges, in effect stealing services from the government\\". Burdette notes, \\"Overall, it appears that Peale used mint equipment and employees to make medals as instructed by Congress and the mint director, and to produce copies from private and official dies for sale to anyone who was interested. In the case of private sales, Peale seems to have used government metal, then reimbursed the bullion accounts when he collected for the medal. Profits were not accounted for in mint ledgers and it is unknown how much went to Peale, others at the mint or into the mint's Cabinet of Coins. The total amount was probably not large.\\" After scalemaker Saxton left the Mint Service in 1844, much of the work of maintaining and modifying the sensitive balances for which Saxton was responsible fell to Peale. The Chief Coiner made a number of improvements to the scales, which he wrote up for an article in the Journal of The Franklin Institute in 1847. These balances, sensitive to , were protected by plate glass from air currents and dust. = Conflict with Longacre = In 1844, Engraver Gobrecht died, and was replaced by James B. Longacre. The new incumbent had obtained his appointment through the influence of South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. He had no relationship to the families that dominated the Philadelphia Mint, such as the Pattersons and Eckfeldts, and the connection with the Southerner Calhoun was objectionable to Peale, Patterson, and their associates. They would have preferred no replacement for Gobrecht, with the New York engraver Charles Cushing White or others they knew and trusted brought in on contract as necessary. This would ensure Peale's highly profitable medal business was not threatened. Additionally, Longacre had no training, prior to his appointment, in coin or medal design, being a successful plate engraver, and Lange states that the Mint officers were \\"understandably\\" prejudiced against him. Peale designed the Indian Peace Medal for President Zachary Taylor in 1849. Peale sometimes worked on medals for the government, taking care to exclude Longacre from the process. During the Mexican–American War, Congress voted a gold medal to Major General Zachary Taylor for his victories at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. Peale engraved the design from a portrait by William Carl Brown and a model by John T. Battin. After Taylor became president, Peale designed his Indian Peace Medal; Peale also engraved Indian Peace Medals for presidents John Tyler and James Polk, working from designs or models by other men. In 1846, Peale designed and engraved the Coast Survey Medal (also called the George M. Bache medal). Peale believed that all national commemorative medals, those authorized by Congress, should have their dies lodged at the Philadelphia Mint, and be struck there, and with Patterson's support urged the issuance of medals for presidents for whom no Indian Peace Medal had been designed, such as John Adams and William Henry Harrison. This was done, but not in Peale's time—for example, the William Henry Harrison medal was designed by later Assistant and Chief Engraver George T. Morgan. These works, like Peale's Indian Peace Medals, form part of the Mint's Presidential series, which continues to the present day. Peale's improvements had made it possible for dies to be reproduced mechanically, relieving the Mint's Engraver of much of his routine duties. In the absence of a need for new designs or denominations, Longacre had little to do but add the dates to dies. Some of these insertions were blundered, and modern-day numismatic scholars, such as R. W. Julian, have wondered if, as Peale and those who worked under him also sometimes inserted dates into dies, these mistakes were done intentionally in an attempt to bring discredit on Longacre. Nevertheless, Longacre's first few years at the Philadelphia Mint passed without serious conflict with Peale. All this changed in 1849, when Congress authorized a gold dollar and a double eagle ($20 piece). This made Longacre the center of attention at the mint, as he would be responsible for producing the new designs and dies. It also brought him into direct conflict with Peale: the Engraver would need to use the Contamin lathe, which was necessary to Peale's medal business. Peale sought to sabotage Longacre's attempts, with the goal of having him dismissed, and such work contracted for outside the government, allowing the medal business to continue undisturbed. In this, Peale had the support of Director Patterson. As Longacre worked to complete the two new coins, he had to deal with interference from Peale. In early 1849, according to a letter written by Longacre the following year, the Engraver was approached by a member of the Mint staff, warning him that another officer (plainly Peale) sought to have the engraving work done outside the Mint, making Longacre redundant. Longacre's response to the information was to spend much of March 1849 preparing the dies for the gold dollar, at some cost to his health, as he later related. Longacre proceeded with work on the double eagle through late 1849, and described the obstacles set in his path by Peale: Pattern coin struck to Peale's design for the three-cent piece in silver According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, \\"under the circumstances, Peale's adoption of a process not normally used at the Mint, together with its catastrophic failure, seems more than coincidental.\\" When Longacre completed the double eagle dies, they were rejected by Peale, who stated that the design was engraved too deeply to fully impress the coin, and the pieces would not stack properly. Taxay, however, noted that the one surviving 1849 double eagle displays no such problems, and by appearance would be level in a stack. Peale complained to Patterson, who wrote to Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith asking for Longacre's removal on December 25, 1849, on the ground he could not make proper dies. Meredith was apparently willing to have Longacre fired, but relented after the Engraver journeyed to Washington and met with him personally. Beginning in 1849, there were calls for a silver three-cent piece, and pattern coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint. Longacre's design featured a shield within a six-pointed star on one side. Peale offered a competing design, showing a Liberty cap, very similar to one Gobrecht had made in 1836 when a gold dollar had been proposed. Patterson preferred Peale's design, but reluctantly endorsed Longacre's, since it was in lower relief and could be struck more easily, and Treasury Secretary Thomas Corwin approved the Engraver's work. The three-cent piece went into circulation in 1851. In 1850, with the Mint faced with a vast increase in gold deposits due to the California Gold Rush, Peale suggested that the Mint hire women to supplement the staff assigned to weigh and adjust gold planchets, or coin blanks, describing the work as \\"being entirely suited to their capacity\\". The Mint did hire 40 women, who were (as of 1860) paid $1.10 per ten-hour day, a sum considered generous. The Mint's hiring of women was the first time the American government had employed women to fill specific jobs at regular wages. In 1851, Peale designed a new steam engine for the Philadelphia Mint, using a \\"steeple\\" design without exterior pipes. Although designed to generate 100 horsepower, wear soon reduced its capacity. American journals of engineering mentioned Peale's latest work without comment; British journals pointed out the defects and suggested that time had passed Peale by. = Downfall = Not all of Peale's innovations were successful. He caused the Mint to purchase a large lathe for turning heavy metal rolls, which cost the government at least $2,000 and that Peale conceded had never worked and likely never would. He bought from his nephew, George Sellers, a set of molds for casting ingots and accompanying equipment, which proved unusable as they were not adapted to the Mint's machinery. A drawbench made by Peale at the cost of at least $1,500 proved dangerous as the piston would drive with tremendous force against the end of its cylinder, causing a concussion and endangering those nearby. \\"Peale's machine gun\\" was put aside by Mint staff as useless soon after its introduction. An 1853 attempt by Peale to convert the Philadelphia Mint's wood-burning annealing furnaces to use anthracite coal destroyed the furnaces, cost the government several thousand dollars, and led to Peale being ordered to undertake no more such projects. One invention that worked well was the \\"noisy sofa\\"—sitting on it set off a trumpet blast. Constructed at the cost of about $200 in government funds, it graced in turn the offices of Peale and Patterson. The pressing and milling room of the Philadelphia Mint, 1852 These activities were financed through a provision of the Mint Act of 1837 that Patterson interpreted to allow the Mint to decline to give credit for small amounts of silver in gold deposits. This practice was twice approved by the then-Secretary of the Treasury, in 1837 and 1849. Small deposits of bullion were rounded down to be divisible by $5, with the surplus kept and used at the discretion of Mint officials. This, and similar practices whereby officials financed activities without an appropriation from Congress, were brought to an end after Peale proposed a $20,800 renovation of part of the Philadelphia Mint building in 1850, and ran over budget by $12,000. To pay this, Patterson used the profits, or seignorage, projected to be made from the new three-cent pieces. When Congress heard of this, it passed the Act of February 21, 1853, requiring the Mint Director to regularly pay the seignorage into the Treasury. One flaw in Peale's medal business was his need to acquire gold and silver bullion within the Mint. This was paid for once the medal sold, and there was no problem while the Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint was Peale's friend Jonas R. McClintock. But in 1846, McClintock resigned and was replaced by Richard Sears McCulloh. At first, McCulloh gave Peale whatever gold and silver he needed without question, but came to object to doing so. Peale and McCulloh made a deal whereby the struck medal would remain in McCulloh's custody until Peale had replaced the bullion, but Peale objected that the procedure was \\"inconvenient\\". Beginning in August 1849, McCulloh refused further requests from Peale for bullion, and Peale instead gained it from the Mint's Treasurer. Peale did his best to make McCulloh's position difficult, such as refusing to accept bullion for coins except from McCulloh personally. In 1850, McCulloh resigned. In November of that year, the former official published an article in the New York Evening Express alleging that those employed at the Mint had transformed \\"it into a workshop for their gain\\". President Millard Fillmore sent the article to Secretary of the Treasury Corwin for an explanation; Corwin forwarded it to Patterson, who confirmed that Peale was running a private medal business on the premises, but stated that there was no interference with the performance of Peale's duties as Chief Coiner. Taxay noted that this was only true because the retired Adam Eckfeldt was still performing the duties of that office without salary, and this ceased in February 1852 when Eckfeldt died after a brief illness. The death of his predecessor caused Peale to write \\"a frantic letter\\" to the new Mint Director (Patterson had retired), George N. Eckert, stating that he urgently needed an assistant. McCulloh's campaign had continued; on August 1, 1851, he wrote directly to President Fillmore, accusing Peale of \\"lavish and unnecessary expenditure of public money\\", and stating that Peale was unfit to hold office. He alleged that Mint workmen had been detailed to make repairs to Peale's house while being paid for their time by the government. One man subsequently stated that he and another Mint employee spent two days working on Peale's house; another alleged that whenever the archery club of which Peale was a member met, Mint employees were sent to help with the arrangements. McCulloh also accused Peale of having Mint workers make furniture for his use when they would otherwise be idle. Corwin ordered an investigation, which dragged on for the next year and a half. Peale entered a statement in April 1852, alleging that McCulloh was accusing the Director and the accounting staff of \\"gross neglect of duty\\", and that McCulloh's attack on Peale's medal business was a slight on \\"the late venerable and much loved Adam Eckfeldt\\", whose precedent Peale stated he was following. Peale wrote in his defense, \\"I boldly claim to have done for the Mint and my country, much that will entitle me gratitude.\\" Eckert was friendly towards Peale, and worked to discredit the accusations. McCulloh urged Corwin to review the correspondence himself, and the Secretary agreed, but both Corwin and Eckert left office in early 1853 with no action having been taken against Peale. McCulloh that summer published a pamphlet, The Proceedings of the Late Director of the Mint in Relation to the Official Misconduct of Franklin Peale Esq., Chief Coiner and Other Abuses in the Mint, printing much of the correspondence. This tract was reviewed by the new Mint Director, James Ross Snowden; he and the new Treasury Secretary, James Guthrie, decided to forbid private enterprises on the Mint's property. In August 1854, Guthrie issued regulations banning the practice. Taxay recorded that the new policy \\"seem[s] to have been ill-received in certain quarters of the Mint\\" but that as not all records are extant, the specifics are uncertain. According to Taxay, The reasons for Peale's firing were not publicly announced, and his friends and allies, such as William DuBois (Adam Eckfeldt's son-in-law and the Assistant Assayer (later Assayer) of the Philadelphia Mint) stated that it was so President Pierce could have the position to fill from the Democratic Party. Taxay noted that this explanation ignored the fact that Martin Van Buren, under whose administration Peale had been appointed Chief Coiner, was also a Democrat as president. Nevertheless, an 1873 Senate report on Peale's request for compensation after being dismissed stated, \\"why such a valuable officer was displaced does not appear\\".  Later years, death, and assessment  After his departure from the Philadelphia Mint, Peale initially retired from all employment. In 1864, he returned to the private sector as president of the Hazelton Coal and Rail Road Company, in which he had long been involved, remaining in that position through 1867. Civic organizations of which he was president included the Musical Fund Society of Pennsylvania and the Institution for Instruction to the Blind. He had been elected a manager of the latter organization in 1839, served on many important committees, and was elected its president in 1863, still holding the office at his death in 1870. A member of the American Philosophical Society since 1833, he served as one of its curators from 1838 to 1845 and from 1847 until 1870. A longtime member of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, which his father had helped to found, he served as one of its directors through much of his retirement. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1865.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In his later years, Peale spent some of his autumns at the Delaware Water Gap north of Philadelphia, searching for Stone Age artifacts and amassing a major collection. Peale catalogued his finds and added narrative descriptions, bequeathing the collection to the American Philosophical Society. An adept archer, he helped found the United Bowmen club, members of whom carried his casket to his grave, at his instructions. He was also, at his death, president of the Skater's Club. He was a lifelong skater, and developed a method for extracting a skater who broke through the ice that saved many lives. Peale was among those consulted in 1870 by Treasury Secretary George Boutwell in preparing the legislation to reform the Mint that became the Coinage Act of 1873. Peale advocated for the office of the Mint Director to be moved from Philadelphia to Washington; this was enacted. He supported the abolition of the gold dollar and the three- dollar piece, but these coins were not ended by Congress until 1890. He denigrated recent coin issues (many designed by Longacre, who had died in 1869), saying that their designs have, \\"hitherto been lamentably, if not disgracefully deficient\\". Peale married twice; his first marriage to Eliza Greatrake, contracted in 1815 while he was still a minor, produced one daughter, Anna, who survived him. His second, childless, marriage was to Caroline Girard Haslam, a widow, and the niece of the wealthy Stephen Girard; it lasted from 1839 to his death. He enjoyed the company of children, making toys by his own hand for them. Peale was in declining health in his final months, but was still able to continue his activities, and only a short illness preceded his death at his home at 1131 Girard Street in Philadelphia, on May 5, 1870. His final words were, \\"If this is death, it is as I wished, perfect peace, perfect comfort, perfect joy.\\" Mint Director Henry Linderman stated in 1873 of Peale, \\"Although Mr. Peale undoubtedly received the cooperation of [Patterson and others], the inventions and improvements were peculiarly Mr. Peale's. I have no doubt whatever on that point. They were of almost incalculable value to the public service.\\" George G. Evans, in his late 19th century history of the Mint, described Peale, \\"his mildness, integrity, gentlemanly bearing and high moral and mental culture constituted him a model officer\\". Walter Breen deemed Peale, \\"brilliant but unscrupulous\\". Burdette writes of Peale and his effect on the Mint, \\"during the generation from about 1830 to 1855, the greatest influence to operations and production came from one man: Benjamin Franklin Peale. He was the consummate 'machinist' of the day at a time when this term encompassed imaginative design, planning, construction and improvement of working processes ... While he had the complete support of mint directors Moore and Patterson, he was also held in high esteem by the common mint workers and Philadelphia's scientific elite. Results of many of his ideas lasted a century or more, until growth in population made nineteenth century engineering insufficient for modern coinage needs.\\" According to Bowers, \\"today Peale is one of several Mint people who can be viewed from many different angles, each perspective sometimes leading certain writers to draw widely differing conclusions.\\" After his dismissal, Peale petitioned Congress for $30,000 as payment for improvements and inventions he had made for the government. The Senate twice, in 1858 and 1860, passed legislation to pay Peale $10,000, but the House of Representatives declined to vote on it. In 1870, it was introduced in the Senate again, but did not pass. Legislation to compensate Peale in the amount of $10,000 was enacted on March 3, 1873, after his death—the act was, according to its title, in relief of Anna E. Peale, Franklin Peale's daughter. The following month, Caroline Peale, Franklin's widow, gave the Mint a marble bust of her late husband, \\"to be set upon a pedestal, in some position, where it may be open to the inspection of visitors and preserve his memory to future generations.\\" Taxay, writing in 1966, stated that he had been unable to ascertain the bust's whereabouts.
