It has reddish flowering stems, oblong to linear leaves of 2‚Äì4¬Ω cm (0.8‚Äì1.8 in) long and 2‚Äì5 mm (0.08‚Äì0.20 in) wide, with one or three teeth. The initially yellow, later orange flower heads of 2¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (1.0‚Äì1.2 in) in diameter are flat-topped. The flower heads occur from July to October. From the flowers occur long styles with a slightly thicker tip, which together give the impression of a pincushion. It is called Hermanus pincushion in English. It naturally occurs in fynbos in the southern mountains of the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Leucospermum gracile is a low spreading shrub of 30‚Äì40.0 cm (1‚Äì1‚Öì ft) high that develops from a trunk at the base and forms open mats of 1¬Ω m (5 ft) in diameter. The reddish flowering stems are slender, 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) thick, felty and sometimes later hairless, that trail across the ground. The thinly felty or powdery leaves are oblong to linear, 2‚Äì4¬Ω cm (0.8‚Äì1.8 in) long and 2‚Äì5 mm (0.08‚Äì0.20 in) wide, the far end blunt, entire or split in three lobes ending in a thick, bony tooth, and with a blunt or cut-off base. The leaves are mostly spaced widely and directed straight upwards, sometimes at a more relaxed angle. The flower heads have a whorl shape (or are turbinate), are 2¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (1.0‚Äì1.2 in) in diameter, seated or with a stalk of up to 2 cm long, usually at a right angle with to stem. The common base of the flowers in the same head is flat and about ¬Ω cm (0.2 in) wide. The bracts that subtend the head are very narrowly lance-shaped to linear 8‚àí10 mm (0.32‚Äì0.40 in) long and 1‚Äì1¬Ω mm (0.04‚Äì0.06 in) wide with a pointy tip the ends in a small tuft of short hairs and some hairs rimming the edge, the surface softly hairy, cartilaginous in consistency and the bracts overlapping each other. The bract that subtends each flower individually is inverted lance- shaped, suddenly pointy or pointed 5‚àí6.0 mm (0.20‚àí0.24 in)long and about 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) wide, cartilaginous in consistency, and the surface very thickly woolly. The 4-merous perianth is 2‚Äì2¬Ω cm long, greenish at the base and yellow higher up. The lowest, fully merged, part of the perianth, called tube is funnel-shaped, 8 mm (0.32 in) long, hairless, but minutely powdery near the top. The middle part (or claws), where the perianth is split lengthwise are thread-shaped (or filiform), tightly rolling back near the top, the lobe facing the edge of the head hairless, the other roughly hairy. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, consists of four 1 mm (0.04 in) long, pointy, narrowly lance-shaped lobes that are difficult to distinguish from the perianth claws. From the perianth emerges a straight, thread-shaped style of 2¬Ω‚Äì3 mm (0.10‚Äì0.12 in) long, that tapers towards the tip, and is initially yellow, later becoming pale green. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is 1.0 mm long, cylinder-shaped with a pointy tip, hardly differentiated from the style, with a groove that functions as the stigma across the very tip. The ovary is subtended by four opaque, hoof-shaped scales of about 3 mm long. The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus Leucospermum has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24). = Differences with related species = Leucospermum gracile differs from its closest relatives by its spreading habit, the narrow leaves (less than ¬Ω cm wide), bitten-off at its base, the abruptly pointy inverted lance-shaped bracteoles and the yellow colour of the perianth. It may occur alongside Leucospermum prostratum and shares yellow flower heads that fade to orange, but in Leucospermum gracile these are larger and flat-topped, while the smaller flower heads of Leucospermum prostratum are domed when viewed from the side.  Taxonomy  Trailing stem with leaves and flower headAs far as we know, James Niven was the first who collected the Hermanus pincushion, at Fernkloof in the foothills of the Kleinrivier Mountains. In 1809, Joseph Knight published a book titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, that contained an extensive revision of the Proteaceae attributed to Richard Anthony Salisbury. Salisbury assigned Niven's specimen to his new genus Leucadendrum and called it Leucadendrum gracile. It is assumed that Salisbury had committed plagiarism by making use of a draft he had seen of a paper called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae that Robert Brown was to publish in 1810. The genus name Leucadendrum was therefore ignored by other botanists. In 1900 Brown's Leucospermum was officially conserved priority over Leucadendrum, that was suppressed. This however does not apply to Salisbury's species names, and in addition, Brown did not describe the Hermanus pincushion. Rudolf Schlechter described Leucospermum stenanthum in 1900. John Patrick Rourke in 1967, regards both names as synonymous, and recognised that the new combination Leucospermum gracile needed to be created. L. gracile has been assigned to the section Crinitae. The species name gracile means graceful.  Distribution, habit and ecology  Leucospermum gracile can be found on Shaw's Mountain between Caledon in the north and Hermanus and through the Onrus Mountains and Kleinrivier Mountains, eastwards to the hillsides near Napier, usually at 100‚Äì300 m (300‚Äì1000 ft) altitude, sometimes reaching 900 m (3000 ft). It always grows in very well drained locations, particularly in the sandy surface layers of weathered and crumbling Table Mountain Sandstone. The location further to the north near Bot River where Schlechter collected, probably went extinct as a result of agricultural introduction. The species is pollinated by birds. The ripened fruit falls to the ground approximately two months after flowering. Native ants carry them to their underground nests to eat the elaiosome. The seed remains dormant until a fire has destroyed the above- ground biomass. Conservation  The Hermanus pincushion is considered a near threatened species, because its population has decreased by about 30% due to competition of invasive species and urban expansion.

The mansion is located at the bank of the Vantaa river. Currently, it is used as a state guest house by the Finnish Government. It regularly serves as a venue for various meetings, negotiations and receptions.  History  The manor is first mentioned in 1511, when Olav Nilsson, the governor of Helsinki is the owner. Under captain Johan K√∂hn, who was raised to nobility under the name of K√∂hnningstedt, the mansion received its name. Counsellor of State Jacob Wilhem Hisinger constructed the present house in 1816. According tradition Carl Ludvig Engel is the architect, although some presume it is his assistant Pehr Granstedt who did the design. In the 20th century there were many owners such as Robert Mattson, Colonel Mikael Gripenberg, and Baron Gustaf Wrede. The Finnish Government purchased the manor from Baroness Asta Wrede in 1961. The Aceh peace talks between the Free Aceh Movement and the Indonesian Government, hosted by Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari were held at the manor in 2005. Meetings between North Korean, South Korean and American delegations took place at the mansion in 2018 as preparation for the 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit.  Architecture and Design  The exterior of the manor is designed in neoclassical style and received its yellow/ white colours in 1825. The interior is in Empire style and is coloured in grey scales combined with stronger tones. The main rooms are the Entrance Hall, the Library, Dining Room, Yellow Reception Room, Green Salon and Blue Coffee salon. The furniture is a mix of Empire, Gustavian style and neo-rococo. The manor has been repaired various times. During the first restoration, a veranda with Ionic columns was added to the mansion. Further restorations were in the 1930s, when the columns facing the garden were erected, the 1950s when central heating was included and in 1997. The house is surrounded by a park. The estate surrounding the manor covers 35 hectares, primarily used for farming and horse and livestock raising. In addition, there apple orchard, a site of glassworks and a chapel.

Since 1936, it has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in the Hague. This is a genre painting that demonstrates Steen's more intricate style and use of domestic settings. It also shows Steen's use of symbolism with oysters to create a theme of earthly lust.  Visual Analysis  = Subject Matter = The main subject of the painting is a young woman salting oysters while making direct eye contact with the viewer. Her expression is flirtatious and communicates to viewers that she is salting the oysters for them. = Composition = In The Oyster Eater, Steen uses framing to create a very complicated yet skillful composition. He uses the vertical and horizontal lines of the door frame, bed curtains, and the edge of the table to create an imaginary border around the young woman. The arched top of the painting reflects the curvature of the girl's head and left shoulder. The placement of objects such as the oyster point in a specific direction, allowing the viewer's eye to focus on the figures in the back room. The placement of the background figures in a separate room is common in Dutch paintings and is referred to as doorsien (view through a doorway). This technique also allows the viewer's eye to plunge into the background of a painting. Artists like Steen added doorsien to paintings to create an atmosphere of diligence and desire among the subjects. The use of doorsien also adds a sense of balance between the men in the background and the young woman in the foreground. = Symbolism = In the context of this painting, the oysters convey an erotic meaning. Oysters are thought to be an aphrodisiac, the most seductive being the ones that are rich and full. Empty oyster shells or oysters placed alongside other partially eaten items like in The Oyster Eater imply the temporariness of earthly pleasures, a commonly repeated theme in Dutch art. During the seventeenth century, shells started to make appearances in several Dutch genre paintings or merry company paintings. They were objects of scientific interest to the Dutch who were interested in science and history. Oysters also held an exotic connotation as many featured in Dutch paintings were from different continents, and they were used because they were seen as ancient souvenirs of the past. In paintings that specifically included oysters, they were depicted as oyster meals. Merry company paintings are thought to have originated from early sixteenth-century Flemish mythological paintings. Oysters were a reminder of ancient times and symbolized Aphrodite, the goddess of love, fertility, pleasure, and sex throughout antiquity and all the way into Baroque art. Oysters typically appeared in mythological paintings where Aphrodite and Dionysus were the main deities depicted. The use of the oyster meal in Dutch genre paintings has been separated into two time periods. The first time period lasted approximately from 1610 to 1635. During this time, oysters were shown being consumed in merry company paintings. Before the second time period, the Dutch government acquired control of pearl fisheries in Indian waters in 1658. This happened as a result of conquering the Portuguese. The pearl fisheries led to the development of oyster fisheries, which led to a new interest in the depiction of oysters in genre paintings. In the second time period, which went from 1660 to 1680, oyster paintings were painted in more private settings. Oyster meal paintings of the second time period were all set indoors and displayed some sort of a domestic interior. Unlike the earlier merry company paintings that portrayed feasts, these later oyster paintings usually portrayed some kind of private, romantic meeting.  Style  = Influences = Frans van Mieris the Elder, The Oyster Meal, 1661, oil on panel The style of Steen's The Oyster Eater comes close to the elegant style of Frans van Mieris the Elder. Particularly, the arched top, small size, and extreme care of every small detail resemble the works of Gerrit Dou. He was the great master of \\"fine painting\\" in Leiden and Mieris' teacher.  Historical Context  = Artist Background = Steen's The Oyster Eater is one of his many genre paintings that he made during the seventeenth century. Steen's genre paintings generally included earthy humor, sometimes with satirical overtones. They expressed the Dutch whim for portraiture, love of the home and family, and for moralistic messages, all typically found in domestic settings. Steen typically depicted his subjects in a favorable or gratifying manner. However, he would also make fun of his subjects by exposing their foolishness or strangeness.  Themes  = Love = Jan Steen, The Physician's Visit, 1660-1662, oil on canvas Steen had an interest in the theme of love: contemporary or ancient. He used love to expose the passion and vulnerability that overcomes humans when they are in love. His use of humor in genre paintings helped to convey the follies of love in a relatable way. Genre paintings of his that show a love theme include subjects such as marriage, brothel scenes, and the treatment of lovesickness (The Physician's Visit). Steen also depicts two different kinds of love in his genre paintings: sacred love and profane love. Steen's paintings of sacred love such as The Marriage of Tobias and Sarah show a young, innocent love that is internal and makes the subjects oblivious to everything else in the world. In Steen's works depicting profane love, he tried to show all sides of love and desire. To viewers of Steen's profane love paintings, the subjects were more exciting and taught more about the follies of the world. These paintings demonstrate concepts of lust, incest, and mass abduction. One example of Steen's profane love images is Easy Come, Easy Go which also uses oysters as a symbol of lust.  Provenance  The whereabouts of The Oyster Eater before 1783 are unknown. The painting is known to have been owned by Pieter Locquet who sold it to Pieter van Winter in Amsterdam in September of 1783. Van Winter passed it along to his daughter, Lucretia Johanna van Winter, in 1822. The painting was in her possession all throughout her marriage to Hendrik Six van Hillegom. Then, it was inherited and kept by Jan Pieter and Pieter Hendrik Six van Vromade until 1905. The Oyster Eater was left to Jan Pieter's son, Professor Jan Six, who owned it until the 1920s. In 1928, it was sold again to Beets of Deterding. The painting was gifted to the Mauritshuis by Sir Henri W.A. Deterding in 1936. *  Notes  category:1658 paintings category:1659 paintings category:1660 paintings category:Paintings of the Mauritshuis category:Paintings by Jan Steen Category:Food and drink paintings Category:Seashells in art  References  * Cloutier-Blazzard, Kimberlee A. \\"The Elephant in the Living Room: Jan Steen's Fantasy Interior as Parodic Portrait of the Schouten Family.\\" Aurora, The Journal of the History of Art 11 (2010): 91. * Liana De Girolami Cheney. \\"The Oyster in Dutch Genre Paintings: Moral or Erotic Symbolism.\\" Artibus Et Historiae 8, no. 15 (1987): 135-58. doi:10.2307/1483275. * Khar, Madlyn Milner. ‚ÄúDutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century.‚Äù New York: Harper and Row. 1978. * Kirschenbaum, Baruch David, and Jan Steen.

CPA can be applied at the individual customer level (more time consuming, but providing a better understanding of business situation) or at the level of customer aggregates / groups (e.g. grouped by number of transactions, revenues, average transaction size, time since starting business with the customer, distribution channels, etc.). CPA is a \\"retrospective\\" method, which means it analyses past events of different customers, in order to calculate customer profitability for each customer. Equally, research suggests that that credit score does not necessarily impact the lenders' profitability.  Reasons for introducing CPA  Management accounting systems often focus on products, departments, or geographic regions, but not on customers. As a result, companies are often unable to produce reliable per-customer profitability figures, which leads to keeping unprofitable customers, decreasing company's potential to make profits. The \\"why?\\" of Customer Profitability Analysis can be reduced to the simple statement that each dollar of revenue does not contribute equally to profit. Differences in customer profitability can arise from either differences in revenues and/or differences in costs. In other words, customer profitability depends not only on the revenue resulting from sold units of a product or service, but also on the 'back end' services provided, including marketing, distribution, and customer service. Once costs are matched with customer revenues, segments of differing profitability can be discovered. Whale curve - cumulative customer profitability According to Harvard Professors: Robert Kaplan (who is co-developer of activity-based costing) and V.G. Narayanan, the 20-80 Pareto rule does not apply to customer profitability for organizations. The whale curve for cumulative profitability (see picture) usually reveals that the most profitable 20 percent of customers generate between 150 percent and 300 percent of total profits. The middle 60-70 percent of customers break even and the least profitable 10-20 percent of customers lose from 50 to 200 percent of total profits, leaving the company with its 100 percent of total profits. On the profitability whale curve, the difference between the highest point of the chart and current company profitability (100% profitability) represents unrealized profit potential for the company. Typically companies have both: customers having positive impact on company profitability, and simultaneously those who erode potential profits of a company, by generating less revenue than costs - thus having a negative impact on company profitability. Often even managers who understand the issue are not able to easily distinct between customers belonging to these 2 groups. The size of customer is not a valid premise that the customer is automatically profitable, in fact the evidence suggests that even the largest customers may turn out to be the most unprofitable.  Objective  The main purpose of CPA is to provide to organization management with the understanding of each customer profitability. Grouping this information into customer profitability segments, allows the companies to take different, targeted actions and strategies against different profitability segments, having as a target increasing the company‚Äôs total profitability. Those companies that understand which customers are more profitable and which are not are ‚Äúarmed with valuable information needed to make successful managerial decision to improve overall organizational profitability‚Äù. CPA allows businesses to take the following key strategic decisions: * Identify customers‚Äô profiles; * Differentiate customer service activities depending on customer profile (e.g. highly-profitable customers could receive more attention, to ensure high-level satisfaction and loyalty, in order to protect continued business relations); * Differentiate marketing strategy, depending on customer profile (e.g. implement more aggressive and expensive marketing strategies to high-spenders, while limiting the marketing costs against customers, who spend little and show few signs of spending more in the future); * Take actions, to maintain or increase customers profitability, including turning unprofitable customers into profitable ones (e.g. decreasing cost to serve, of looking for ways to increase revenue, up to ceasing business relations with unprofitable customers to cut the costs).  Input information  Calculation of customer profitability takes into account both revenue associated to each customer, as well as all costs which can be attributed to the customer. = Revenue associated to the customer = Revenue differences across customers may differ due to various reasons, including: * Differences in price charged for a unit a product or service to different customers; * Differences in volumes sold to different customers; * Differences in product or service specification delivered to different customers; *Other one-time events, such as bonus events, not directly related to a particular sale transaction. CPA requires a company to associate all company's revenue to different customers (sources of revenue), in order to find out revenue associated to each customer. Companies most typically have no trouble finding out the amount of revenue attributed to a particular customer, thus article will not cover this aspect. = Costs associated to the customer = Customers differ in costs they generate by using company's resources in a different way. These reasons may include: * Different amounts of marketing costs may be necessary to strike a deal with different customers * Differences in used distribution channels / logistics by different customers * Differences in customer service required by different customers * Differences in volume of products purchased (production of large volume of a product for a single order can be cheaper that production of the same amount, divided into many orders, requested by many customers) * CPA requires the company to associate _all company's costs_ to different customers, even if the costs are not directly related to any particular customer. Some costs can be easily associated with a particular customer (i.e. direct costs associated to all products sold to the customer), while other costs (indirect costs / overhead, such as electricity bills for running a production plant) are not easy to be associated to a particular customer. There are several cost accounting methods, which can be used for this purpose, one commonly used method is activity based costing. In order to provide the best input to further management optimization activities, it's recommended to divide the costs assigned to each customer, to different cost pools. These cost pools should be defined depending on company's business, and can include product creation, processing purchase orders, shipping, invoicing, product samples, marketing, customer service, etc.  CPA results  = Customer profitability check = Possessing information defined above in \\"Input\\" chapter, management / accounting team can execute various different calculations, rankings, and comparisons between different customers / customer segments, necessary to reaching further conclusions and taking action. Few examples are displayed below, but the scope of calculations should be aligned to the company's business model. * Calculate operating income associated to the customer - if the results is above 0, customer is bringing positive effect on the company, while if it is negative, company is currently losing money by conducting business with this customer; * Calculate operating income / revenue associated to the customer - this metric gives understanding, which part of revenue becomes operating income; * Compare customer particular cost pool ratio to average customer ratio - e.g. if 20% of total costs of Customer A is applicable to customer service, while on average, for entire customer base, customer service costs are 10% of total costs, company if given interesting information allowing to take action (look for ways to reduce Customer A customer service costs); * other. As a result of above, company becomes empowered to take targeted action / strategies against particular customers, or overall strategies against selected customer aggregates or whole customer base. CPA therefore allows the company to uncover groups of customers that will likely respond best to profit improvement programs. Once the profit contribution of each customer group is known, further analysis is possible. For example, the Stobachoff curve can be used to illustrate the distribution of profitability graphically: The bigger the area under the curve, the greater the subsidization of unprofitable customer accounts by those that are profitable. Literature suggests different strategies towards customers, depending on their profitability. Below are few examples from available literature, nonetheless each company may apply another strategy, better fitting into this particular organization business model, by either modifying below mentioned methods, or employing completely new ones. = Customer Classification Matrix (cost to serve / revenue) = Customer Classification Matrix The Customer Classification Matrix (matrix of customer revenue and cost to serve) method was suggested by several literature positions. This categorization shows there are several different ways companies can serve profitable customers. Most valuable customers are in the passive category, generating high revenue at little costs. These are the most profitable customers, which company should pay special attention to. Some customers generating high revenue, could at the same time be expensive (carriage trade quadrant) ‚Äì these may be profitable, if revenue exceeds the costs to serve. There could be customers who are easy to serve, but also bring little profits (bargain basement quadrant). Finally, the last quadrant (aggressive) is listing customers generating high costs and bringing low revenue. By performing CPA, companies could assign their customer to above quadrants and apply different strategies towards each of the quadrants. For example: * Aggressive - company could renegotiate with these customers their delivery terms / pricing / scope of services (to increase revenue), or reconsider internal processes to decrease costs of serving to those customers. Finally, a company could request an increased price for their services, ultimately losing unprofitable customers. * Bargain basement - company could focus on increasing revenue for these customers, starting with conducting research whether these customers are expecting different services, their price sensitivity, etc. * Passive - since passive customers generate most profit the company, company should consider investing their capital into better serving these customers, increasing their satisfaction and loyalty. * Carriage trade - company should focus on reducing the cost to serve, investigating cost factors and looking for ways to streamline internal processes. = 4 boxes (profitability / strategy alignment) = 4 boxes - Strategy alignment and Customer Profitability This 4-boxes (matrix of customer profitability and strategy alignment) method was suggested by several literature positions. The foundation of the method is ability to decide, which customers are Target customers of a company (aligned to company's business strategy), and which are not. Given additionally the results of CPA (customer profitability), all customers are segmented into 4 segments, each having a different strategy to be applied to the customers: * Profitable customers in \\"Target\\" group are associated to the action \\"RETAIN\\" - company should look into the possibility of increasing business relations with those customers, as long as business model will not significantly change; * Profitable customers in \\"Non-target\\" group are associated to the action \\"MONITOR\\" - these customers need to be closely monitored, to make sure they don't fall into \\"Non-target\\" and unprofitable segment; * Unprofitable customers in \\"Target\\" group as associated to the action \\"TRANSFORM\\" - company should employ different strategies to make these customers into profitable segment, or at the very least, to bring them into break-even point. The strategies to be used will differ, depending on the company-customer business circumstances. * Unprofitable customers in \\"Non- target\\" group are associated to the action \\"REPLACE\\" - company should cease efforts into developing these customers. Suggested solution is to increase product or service selling prices up to the point, where the customer would either fall into \\"MONITOR\\" segment, or take their business to another provider. If that happens, company could refocus freed resources into serving the most desirable (profitable) customers.  Limitations / implementation barriers  Using CPA is associated with some difficulties & limitations: * Most importantly, CPA is a backward-looking tool, meaning it analyses past events, providing results, based on which companies are making their strategic choices. Past however may not always be the determinant of the future, and decisions made based on past events only, could be incorrect if market conditions, or business strategy change; * The cost of acquisition and customer service may be difficult to measure; * Performing ABC or other methods of attributing costs to customers, CPA calculations, outlining distinct strategies towards different groups of customers, communicating internally and implementing those strategies can be a large undertaking for an organization in terms of the resources used and the costs to complete the initiative, requiring specialized knowledge and appropriately developed accounting systems; * People often feel threatened by change, do not understand it, and are opposed to it within a company (e.g. Commission salespersons will try to protect customers even though they may not be profitable to the company). = Overcoming limitations = There are various strategies which could be used to minimize limitations / implementation barriers to introduce CPA, including the following ones: * Management needs to be sensitive to required change within the organization and be sure that employees are included in the decision and change processes. Management should seek to ensure employee buy-in, to minimize resistance towards change; *Management needs to properly set internal incentive model, e.g. rewarding salespeople on the basis of customer profitability, as opposed to revenue generated by the customer; * To minimize the limitation resulting from the fact, that CPA is a backwards-looking tool, a company could additionally consider implementation of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). CLV is a forward- looking customer profitability estimator, taking CPA as a starting point for calculation. CLV could be used for forecasting of future customer profitability (based not only on historical events, but also proposed marketing strategy, trends in customer behavior, etc.).

The painting is a celebratory holiday scene that depicts three generations of a Dutch family, and serves as an allegory about parental examples, vice, and influence. This subject has been painted thirteen times by Jan Steen and has also been known as The Cat Family, or Jan Steen's Family. Of the many renditions, the Mauritshuis version is considered to be the exemplar of the series.  Subject matter  Jacob Jordaens, As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young, 1640, oil on canvas The holiday scene depicts the proverb of \\"As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young\\" and deliberately alludes to the fact the elders in a family have certain traits that recur in subsequent generations. Inherited traits were viewed by the Dutch people at the time as being a two-sided coin, where a child would inherit genetic traits from their parents, but would also learn to emulate the behaviors that they witnessed. This is also referred to as nature versus nurture. The depiction of three generations of family members in this scene is a direct allusion to this idea, with the parents providing seemingly poor examples to their children by drinking alcoholic beverages and encouraging the children to smoke. The title can also be interpreted as \\"Like father, like son.\\" Such proverbs were popular in Dutch painting and are represented by many paintings by Steen and other artists. This painting has been linked to Steen's work titled The Twelfth Night Feast, the two paintings forming a diptych of the same theme. The theme is thought to be inspired by Jacob Jordaens, a contemporary Flemish painter. Jordaen's version preceded Steen's, having been painted in the year 1683 . Like Jordaens, Steen paired proverbs with merry company paintings, which was popular and served a didactic purpose for the viewer.  Description  As a genre scene, the painting contains many iconographic elements that are open to the viewer's interpretation and ideas that relate to Dutch popular culture of the time. The painting consists of a gathering of family members (parents, children, grandparents) around a table that is draped with a carpet typical of Dutch scenes. Though the subject has been painted by Steen an estimated thirteen times, each one was depicted in a household setting as the theme for child rearing and parental interaction. Like most of Steen's paintings As the Old Sing... is of the merry company genre and depicts family life as a part of popular culture during the 17th century. Paintings of this particular period are commonly festive scenes in Dutch domestic settings. The large canvas displays Steen's mastery of painting light on surfaces, as can be seen in the treatment of light from the window reflected onto the surfaces of the models' clothing and furniture accents. The facial features of the subjects are painted in a realistic style with attention to light and shadow. The overall scene of the merry atmosphere is thought to be open and inviting with the figures situated in an open arrangement, with warm colors of orange, pink, purple, and brown; while casually enjoying themselves. The old lady in the foreground, thought to be Steen's mother, is holding a sheet of music that is open and can be easily read by the viewer. Steen is distinguished as a skilled comic painter and for depicting himself in his paintings, as well as members of his own family. Here he has depicted himself as the father seen in the right side of the canvas who is teaching his younger son to smoke a pipe. Such a painting was thought by the artist to have universal appeal and understanding, but of course, it would have had more resonance with a well- read person familiar with the proverbs, symbolism, and culture of the seventeenth century. Ironically, Steen's knowledge of such readings and traditions is considered to be rather sophisticated. = Symbolism = The figures in the scene are Steen at the right wearing a black hat and teaching his younger son to smoke, his older son playing a bagpipe, a young girl at the far right edge of the canvas, Steen's mother in the right-side foreground, and an unknown female family member holding a baby. There is also a male servant at the rear center who is pouring an alcoholic drink into the glass of Steen's wife, who is pictured at the left of the canvas wearing a green coat and lavender skirt with her glass outstretched. There is a dog in the foreground. At the center of the table is an oyster which has been a popular symbol in Dutch genre painting. The oyster has been known as a symbol of Aphrodite, love, fertility, and sexual pleasure. The symbol is befitting of such as scene as it is associated with foods served at a feast of the gods. The oyster was commonly depicted in Dutch genre paintings up until the year 1635 when it became less common. After the year 1660 the symbol again became a common theme as it is here in Steen's 1668‚Äì1670 painting. In the painting the woman in the lavender skirt sitting at the left is a depiction of Steen's wife. She and Steen both wear a pink ribbon, she in her hair, and he on his hat. This ribbon is a unifying element between the two and represents their being cut from the same spool of ribbon. The parrot situated at the top left of the painting is a symbol of mimicry. To the left of the parrot is a pair of birds in a small birdcage which symbolizes two parents in a small abode. The pipe in the scene may have multiple meanings referring to a clay smoking pipe, the act of singing, or to a drinking vessel. According to the Dutch, the bagpipe was not an esteemed instrument as it was thought to be lowly and obnoxious. Such a symbol here represents bawdiness and low class, which is being encouraged by the parents. The young man playing the bagpipe is an older son of Steen. The laughing face of Jan Steen is commonly depicted by the artist in his paintings and is considered to be his iconography while laughter is also thought to be a symbol of foolishness and or fault. A reader might interpret the many laughing faces as gained wisdom, human fault, or lessons learned. Steen's iconographic grin has become somewhat of a folk character to museum patrons who delight in seeing his face in paintings.  Culture  Steen has been detailed by historians as being from a middle-class, Catholic family of Leiden, who was also preoccupied with drinking and imprudent of his finances. Historical accounts state that Steen's father owned a brewery but also suggest that the brewery business became less profitable due to economic demands and competition. As a result, Steen was encouraged by his parents to pursue a career in painting, which was a respected profession of the time. From his experience as a painter Steen endured constant fluctuations of financial difficulty. As a painter he often depicted himself within his comical scenes to show himself immersed in the culture he depicted and is also as an allusion to the idea that art imitates life. Steen was a resident of The Hague where he married Margariet or Grietje, and also became a member of The Hague Guild. As a member of the guild Steen is thought to have pursued comic painting as the path to a chosen specialization.  Patronage  Steen is considered to have been a fixture in Leiden, with most of his commissions coming from familial connections and recommendations. Historical records indicate patrons numbering above one hundred, with some owners directly inheriting the works. Patrons tended to be members of respectable professions including doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, manufacturers, and an innkeeper. The presence of Steen's likeness in his paintings has been a dealbreaker for some patrons and it has also functioned as a signature. Notes  References  * Crenshaw, Paul., Rebecca.

He was a 1940 graduate of the University of Michigan and its law school in 1942.The Michigan Alumnus, Volumes 75-76 During World War II he served in the United States Marine Corps in the South Pacific until 1945. He started his business career as a corporate attorney with the New York law firm of Gould & Wilkie, where he was general counsel for Central Hudson Gas and Electric in Poughkeepsie, New York. He later rose to become Central Hudson's president, and its chief executive in 1964. Forsaking law, he remained in the utilities industry, joining Northeast Utilities, a utility holding company, as president in 1968. Two years later he was named chairman and chief executive. At the time he took charge of Northeast, the New England region's electricity prices were higher than the national average, and Sillin viewed nuclear power as the least expensive, most efficient, and cleanest energy option.Northeast Utilities Company History at Funding Universe Skyrocketing petroleum prices due to 1970s energy crises just reinforced this view. In addition to four \\"Yankee\\" nuclear plants already built by the individual firms that joined to become Northeast Utilities in 1966 - \\"Connecticut\\", \\"Maine\\", \\"Vermont\\", and \\"Rowe\\" - the firm added two \\"Millstone\\" plants to its generation capacity during that decade. Stillin's middle years with the company did not go easily. In addition to the Middle East oil embargoes of 1973 and 1979, escalating inflation, rising construction costs, annual tussles with the regulatory boards of the two most important states Northeast served - Connecticut and Massachusetts, and heavy borrowing, began eroding Northeast Utility's financial viability. Company fortunes did not begin to recover until Sillin recruited and hired his own replacement, William B. Ellis, and retired as chairman and chief executive in 1983. A number of factors, including resetting expectations by downsizing company growth predictions and annual return projections, a more amicable relationship with regulators, improved operating margins, and the third \\"Millstone\\" plant coming online, all contributed to the turnaround. Legacy Sillin was regarded by friend and foe \\"as frank and forthright and someone who held a genuine concern for the customers he served.\\" Shortly into his role at the top of Northeast Utilities Sillin was granted the honor of delivering the 1970 installment of the prestigious Charles P. Steinmetz Memorial Lecture at Union College. Dr. Charles Proteus Steinmetz Memorial Lecture Series Although Sillin helped make Northeast Utilities the most nuclear-powered utility in the nation during his tenure, he saw himself as an energy pragmatist. In a 1979 interview he bristled: \\"I don't like being classed as a nuclear proponent. I'm a utility man. As soon as we find a better technology, we'll go with it.\\" Sillin was an early advocate of nuclear power but criticized some nuclear operators for complacency. In a 1986 analysis on the nuclear power industry called the \\"Sillin Report,\\" he chided utilities that simply met regulatory requirements \\"instead of striving for excellence.\\" Personal life Sillin was married to Joan Outhwaite Sillin, with whom he had four sons, Lelan 3d of Syracuse, New York; John, of Potomac, Maryland; Andrew, of New Paltz, New York, and William of Sunderland, Massachusetts. Mr. Sillin was a trustee at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, and served on the board of the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme. He died in a traffic accident in Old Lyme at 78 on January 3, 1997.

Hell's Bells is a 1929 animated short film which was directed by Walt Disney and was distributed into cinemas by the film company Columbia Pictures, who would also distribute other Walt Disney films, such as Winter. The film, which was drawn by Ub Iwerks, follows Satan and the other devils' happenings in Hell. One of these devils revolts against Satan, and end up kicking him off the cliff of Hell at the end of the film. The title means that the events in this film represent a degree of music, as bells is a musical instrument. The name also as serves as a rhyming couplet, as the word \\"Bells\\", rhymes with \\"Hell's\\". The film also has a variety of musical compositions, one of such is \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\", which was written by the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. This composition is used near the end of the film, as Satan gets kicked off the cliff by one of his demons. Another is \\"Funeral March of a Marionette\\" by French composer Charles Gounod, which is familiar also as the theme tune to the television series \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\". Copyrighted on February 7, 1930, but released on October 30 the year before, the film is part of the short film series Silly Symphonies. This series is the same that released other Disney films, such as Cannibal Capers, and El Terrible Toreador.  Plot  Satan getting entertained by his little devils with music. The film begins with fire consuming the screen and leaving behind Hell. Several bats fly through the sky and a spider descends from a web. This spider swings back and forward multiple times, swallowing the camera several times as well. The spider does this until fire from below swallows him and drags him down. After that, an alligator snares at the camera and climbs into the hole which the spider was dragged down by the fire. A three-headed dog, then approaches the camera and the heads snare at the camera. After that, a bat flies into a section where a large snake occupies. The bat intimidates the snake, by blowing a raspberry at the snake. This results in the snake eating the bat. However, after he does this, the snake comically grows wings and comically flies away. An orchestra then plays some music, to entertain Satan. The orchestra is a mix between traditional instruments and nonsensical ones, as one of the creatures is playing a saxophone, whilst another one is comically playing a rib cage in place of a cello. A demon then begins to dance to the music, occasionally flying to it as well. Then, other devils begin to dance to the music. They do this until they cease naturally and walk away. However, one of the creatures walks into a piece of crumbling rock, and comically becomes crooked as a result. He dances some more in order to cease his crooked state. However, once he ceases to be crooked and begins to walk back, he comically walks into the same rock again, which results in him comically becoming crooked again. Satan laughs at the occurrence, and rings a bell, to signal his lack of food and his desire to be fed. Upon hearing the bell, three creatures comically milk a cow- like creature for some milk which is as comically hot as fire, which they bring to Satan. He finds the milk pleasing, as he gulps it down in quick succession. After that, Satan picks up one of the little demons and feeds him to the three-headed dog seen earlier. Satan laughs and proceeds to try to grab another little demon. The demon, not wanting to gain the same fate as the other little demon, refuses and tries to step away from Satan. This angers Satan, who leaps from his throne and begins to chase him through Hell in order to attempt to catch the little demon. The chase leads them to a cliff, where the little demon hides in a section of the cliff. Satan attempts to look from him. However, when he attempts this, Satan is kicked off the cliff by the little demon. Satan then tumbles down the cliff. During this, Satan tries to grab onto a ledge. This makes his body comically stretch out like an accordion. The fire below then comically tug at his tail and also comically spank him. The fire then drag Satan down, ultimately killing him. The film ends with the fire consuming the screen, and leaving behind a 'The End' card.  Characters  In this film, there a variety of characters. One of these is Satan. He is enthroned of Hell and rules it. He commands the other creatures and demons on their doings. He ultimately dies at the end of the film, as he is kicked off a cliff by one of his servants. Another character is the demons. They entertain Satan during the film with music. They also serve him meals, such as fire milk. Another character is the three headed dog. It breaks the fourth wall at the start of the cartoon, by snaring at the camera and the audience. It also eats one of the demons, as Satan gives him it near the end of the film.  Reception  Hell's Bells received mixed reviews by the cinema magazines at that time. The Film Daily (November 17, 1929): \\"Ace Cartoon: Another of the Silly Symphony series, with the cartoon work outdoing previous efforts in its ingenuity. With Hades as the scene of action and a set of grotesque animals of all sizes as the performers, the reel is continuously amusing as well as fascinating. The graceful contortions and rhythmic gyrations of the dumb caricatures evoke both laughter and wonder.\\" Variety (November 20, 1929): \\"Moving cartoon picturing Hades as the weirdest of places with its inhabitants in odd animal forms. All comedy of the ghost-story type. Such as one musician using the backbone and hips of a human as his cello. Another instrument in this band is a pool of bubbling lava, one of the devils piercing the bubbles with his spiked tail to make music. While Satan drinks his white-hot milk direct from the udder of a dragon cow. Lot of laughs from the unnatural comedy effects a cartoonist can create and a peach filler.\\" The Film Daily (November 23, 1929): \\"Few Laughs: Hell's Bells is evidently a follow-up on the success of The Skeleton Dance, but it does not approach that offering in laugh possibilities. It is pretentious as cartoons go. Full of fire and brimstone with a sort of a Jack-and-the-Beanstalk finish that is the best thing in it.\\"  Home media  The short was released on the 2006 Walt Disney Treasures DVD box set More Silly Symphonies.

His dismembered remains were discovered buried on the property of a home in Puyallup, Washington in June 2007. His murder has been the subject of various television documentaries, such as the Oxygen series Buried in the Backyard, as well as being written on extensively by true crime writer Ann Rule in her 2011 book Don't Look Behind You. Background Joseph Tarricone was born January 7, 1925 in Brooklyn, New York City, the first child of Catholic Italian-American parents. In the early 1940s, he met and married his wife, Rose, with whom he had seven children. Tarricone served in World War II and the Korean War before relocating to Seattle, Washington. While there, he began operating his own meat business, Alaska Meat Provisions, based in Anchorage, Alaska, and would divide time between there and Washington. Murder After divorcing his wife in the early 1970s, Tarricone began dating Renee Curtiss (born August 1, 1953), a 25-year-old secretary who worked for his company. Tarricone's daughter alleged that the age difference was mitigated by the fact that Tarricone lavished her in gifts. In mid-1978, Curtiss broke off the relationship and relocated to live with her mother, Florence Geraldine Hess, in a rented home on Canyon Road in Puyallup, Washington. In the late summer of 1978, Tarricone visited his ex-wife, Rose, and his children in New Mexico, where they were living at the time. On September 29, 1978, while Tarricone was visiting Seattle en route back to Alaska, Curtiss and her adopted brother, 30-year-old Nicholas Notaro (who had previously been charged with manslaughter and served time for a killing committed in Alaska the previous decade) shot him to death in the home Curtiss shared with her mother in Puyallup. Curtiss had lured Tarricone to the home under the pretext of him repairing the washing machine. In the basement, while Tarricone inspected the washing machine, Notaro shot him twice in the head, killing him. After, Curtiss and Notaro dismembered his remains with a chainsaw before burying them in the home's backyard. Discovery and conviction In June 2007, excavators digging up the property for new construction uncovered Tarricone's skeletal remains in a bag. Tarricone's daughter, Gypsy, had previously visited the home in late 1978 inquiring about her missing father, but Curtiss and her mother had relocated. The home's owner was able to refer law enforcement to Gypsy, and the remains were confirmed to be those of Tarricone after a DNA test was performed using her DNA for comparison. Pierce County law enforcement interviewed then-60-year-old Nicholas Notaro about Tarricone's murder; he denied Curtiss's involvement, claiming he and his now- deceased mother, Hess, had murdered Tarricone, claiming he had been abusive toward Curtiss. Notaro claimed he and his mother stored Tarricone's body in a freezer prior to dismembering him. Police were skeptical of his version of events given that Tarricone was over tall and weighed over , which would have made it unlikely that Notaro's elderly mother could have assisted in storing the body. Detectives were able to track Curtiss's previous residences over the ensuing 29 years, which included several in San Francisco and Seattle. In 2007, they found her residing in a condominium in Seattle, and interviewed her under the guise of discussing the murder of which her brother had been convicted in the early 1970s. Curtiss and Notaro were both formally charged with first-degree murder, and Curtiss testified in court that she had helped Notaro dismember Tarricone's body after he had shot him to death in the basement of her home. In April 2009, both Curtiss and Notaro were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The painting depicts a disorderly household given up to licentious or improper behaviour. In this context the word luxury in the title implies excess or self-indulgence. The individuals, mostly up to no good, are assembled in the composition in a roughly triangular formation fronted by the obviously loose-living young woman smiling flirtatiously at the viewer. The canvas is a humorous illustration of a Dutch saying of those more ascetic times - \\"\\"In weelde siet toe...\\" - which in full loosely translates as \\"In good times beware the consequences\\". In this case the lady of the house has fallen asleep, allowing the other members of the family to take full advantage. Her husband in the foreground is carrying on a dalliance with the provocative young woman, who is holding a glass of wine between his legs. He is himself laughing off the admonitions of a nun or beguine. A younger child is helping herself to something from a cabinet and her young brother is trying out a pipe. The youngest child is playing with a string of pearls, the eldest son is playing a violin, the dog is on the table finishing off the meal and a pig has wandered into the room. Warnings of the consequences include the Quaker with a duck on his shoulder reading out pious texts and a basket of instruments of punishment hanging from the ceiling. The moral of the picture is clear - sinners guilty of the deadly sin of lust (an uncontrolled desire for earthly pleasure) must expect some penalty. Some of the themes of the painting are also to be found in Steen's humorous but moralizing painting The Effects of Intemperance.

The work depicts a issue which Steen addressed several times, that of the unfortunate consequences of excessive drinking. As keeper of a tavern himself he was well acquainted with the problem but chose to portray it in a light-hearted manner. In this case a wife and mother has fallen into a drunken sleep and the rest of the family has taken advantage of the fact to misbehave. One is trying to persuade the parrot to drink wine, others are giving their food to the cat and roses to the pig, a young boy is trying to steal from his mother's purse and the woman's husband is in the garden engaged in a dalliance with the maid. Several of these themes can also be found in Steen's 1663 painting Beware of Luxury, which also portrays an out of control household.

Its subject is similar to his The Lovesick Maiden in the Metropolitan Museum of Art from the same era. The painting is a representation of how women were treated when treated by doctors in the 1600s. The painting features several small details and disguised symbolism that may go unnoticed to the common eye, but nevertheless contribute to the painting's meaning.  Visual Analysis  This painting is a visual representation of medical practices that were performed on women in the 1660s. Jan Steen uses very direct facial expressions to show what the people in this painting were feeling. Women in paintings such as this and The Lovesick Maiden are usually young, pretty and well dressed, while being positioned upward in a chair. The facial expressions in these paintings often had a vacant and senseless look while the doctor takes the woman's pulse. In other similar examples, the doctor may also be looking at the urine sample that an assistant holds up to the light. The backgrounds of these paintings tend to have elegant paintings on the walls..The woman sitting down on the right is suffering from illness, which during the time was not only hard to identify, but also extremely difficult to treat. Paintings consistently represent women in a fragile, passive, housebound way which was much more of a male wish, rather than a female reality. Women in these paintings are often presented to be weak, and surrounded by concerned family members.  Historical Background  There is a connection between art and medicine and that is very much so represented in these paintings. However many art historians have not widely recognized this connection. Some of the themes that are represented in medical paintings are often created by the artist in regards to ancient medical theories that were still believed in during the seventeenth century. Contemporary medical information was referenced in the paintings by Dutch painters and their patrons in the 1600s. Often this was the only information they had; however sometimes they had access to medical knowledge in other languages. These paintings often had many similarities that represented the practice of medicine during the 1600s. Not every doctor's room that was used to treat their clients was the same; however in these paintings almost everyone has three similar objects. The consistent objects tend to be a pan of urine, a chair, and a doctor's assistant.

Leonetti and starring Kiernan Shipka, Stanley Tucci, Miranda Otto, and John Corbett. The screenplay by Carey and Shane Van Dyke adapts the 2015 horror novel of the same name by Tim Lebbon. The film depicts a world under attack by creatures who hunt by sound. Shipka plays a late-deafened teenager who seeks shelter with her family, and a cult seeks to take advantage of her fertility. Netflix released The Silence on April 10, 2019. It was also released in theaters in seven markets in the rest of 2019, grossing $2.3 million.  Plot  A cave research team unearths an unknown species of pterosaur-like creature, referred to as \\"vesps\\", from a mine. The vesps violently kill the researchers, fly out of the mine, and seek the noisiest areas. Ally, a teenage girl who lost her hearing in a car accident, lives with her parents Hugh and Kelly Andrews; her maternal grandmother Lynn, who has terminal lung cancer; her brother Jude; and a pet dog. As the news of the vesp outbreak spreads, the US government declares a state of emergency and asks people to stay indoors and quiet. Ally suggests they head to the countryside, which is likely to be quieter. Glenn, Hugh's best friend, joins them and brings his guns. They set out in two cars, but a man tries to hijack Hugh's car while refueling. Glenn shoots the man in the leg, and they drive away. The group hits a massive traffic jam, blocking all the interstates, and Glenn goes off-road. Speeding through the countryside, Glenn's car hits a herd of fleeing deer and tumbles down the embankment. He survives but is trapped in the car. Hugh and Kelly fail to free him, and Glenn asks Hugh to leave with his family. As the Andrews family returns to their car, their dog barks, attracting the vesps, who attack the car. Glenn fires his gun, leading them away from the Andrews' car, sacrificing himself. To keep his family safe, Hugh is forced to let their dog out of the car; Kelly consoles Ally and Jude. Ally says they all have the skill to survive in silence, due to her deafness. Hugh leads his family on foot after setting Glenn's car on fire as a decoy. Lynn struggles to keep up, and her coughing puts the whole family at risk. Jude spots a house in the countryside. The family heads towards it and finds a high fence with a locked gate. Their arrival alerts the homeowner, who, unaware of the situation, speaks. Vesps attack and kill her. The family uses a storm drain to enter the house. A rattlesnake in the drain scares Jude, and he yells. Attracted vesps bite Kelly's leg. Hugh distracts them by turning on a woodchipper, crushing the vesps flying into it, and the family enters the house. While the others rest, Ally contacts her boyfriend, Rob, who tells her that his parents are dead. She also learns that religious cults have sprung up in the wake of the disaster. By morning, Kelly's wound is infected, so Hugh and Ally leave to find antibiotics. While at the store, Ally discovers vesp eggs growing inside corpses. Leaving the store, the tongueless reverend of a cult tries to recruit them, but Hugh and Ally walk away. They return with the antibiotics, and Kelly recovers. Ally learns from the internet that vesps can not survive in the cold. The reverend finds the family's hide-out and shows up with a group of his followers, asking for Hugh's family to join them. Hugh politely asks them to leave, at which point the reverend reveals that he intends to recruit Ally. Hugh brings out his gun, forcing the cultists to leave. Rob briefly contacts Ally, letting her know he is headed north to \\"the refuge\\". Hugh and Kelly wake up in the night and find a little girl at the door. After letting her in, they find she is a member of the tongueless cult. Phones strapped to her and placed around the house go off, attracting vesps. The cult members abduct Ally, but Grandma Lynn runs outside to help her. Lynn holds Ally's captors down and screams; vesps attack and kill her and the captors while Ally escapes. Other cult members take Ally at knife-point, but Hugh, Kelly and Jude fight back and kill most of the cult. Several weeks later, the remaining Andrews family treks across America and eventually arrives at the refuge. Ally finds Rob, and together they hunt the vesps with arrows. Ally wonders whether the vesps will adapt to the cold, and whether humans will adapt to a soundless lifestyle, like she did when she lost her hearing. Cast * Stanley Tucci as Hugh Andrews * Kiernan Shipka as Ally Andrews * Miranda Otto as Kelly Andrews * Kate Trotter as Lynn * John Corbett as Glenn * Kyle Harrison Breitkopf as Jude Andrews * Dempsey Bryk as Rob * Billy MacLellan as The Reverend Production The Silence is based on the 2015 horror novel of the same name by Tim Lebbon. The film is directed by John R. Leonetti based on an adapted screenplay by Carey Van Dyke and Shane Van Dyke. Actors Kiernan Shipka and Stanley Tucci were cast in the film in May 2017. * In the following August, additional cast members were hired. Principal photography began in Toronto in September 2017. The Vesp creature, with translucent skin and other similarities to cave creatures According to the film's production notes, the creatures are named \\"Vesps\\" after the Spanish avispa, meaning wasps. Director John R. Leonetti said that research was done into other cave creatures in order to design the Vesps. \\"Their skin is translucent, they have wings and they fly, but they also crawl and lay eggs like reptiles ... A lot of scientific research went into the design, the creation, and the computer animation of the creatures, right down to the detail of every joint, every vessel, and every move they make.\\" Release Netflix released The Silence on April 10, 2019. Global Road Entertainment originally acquired in December 2017 the U.S. distribution rights to the film. The distributor had financial troubles, and in a failed attempt to avoid bankruptcy, Global Road sold distribution rights to various films, including The Silence, to Netflix. The film was also released in seven markets around the world: Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Bolivia, Singapore, South Korea, and China, grossing over $2.3 million. Critical reception Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 30% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 4.12/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"The Silence has nothing new to say with a derivative premise and placid pacing -- even a wasted Stanley Tucci is unable to elevate the stodgy material a decibel above dreadful.\\" Metacritic assigned the film a score of 25 out of 100 from 4 critics, reflecting \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Scott Tobias, reviewing for The New York Times, called The Silence \\"niche-targeted dreck\\" where \\"only a quality cast and more generous production values can cover up the shoddy stitching\\". Tobias said despite the film's depiction of \\"a grand evolutionary struggle... every moment feels like regression\\". RogerEbert.coms Brian Tallerico said that The Silence was \\"a dull retread of ideas explored more interestingly in other films and TV shows\\", and went on to say, \\"'The Silence' is barely a horror movie, and that's its biggest problem. A horror movie needs stakes, and you just never feel them here.\\" Social commentary =Deaf portrayal= Hearing actress Kiernan Shipka plays the lead character, a deaf teenager who battles monsters. Shipka learned some parts of American Sign Language for the role, and director John R. Leonetti said in an interview, \\"She learned to sign for the film, and now she's flawless, like she's been signing her entire life. She seems to have an almost innate sense of what it's like being a deaf person.\\" Deaf celebrities Nyle DiMarco and Marlee Matlin and other members of the deaf community criticized Leonetti for saying that Shipka learning to sign was synonymous with knowing the culturally deaf experience and for undermining deaf representation by casting a hearing actor. * DiMarco also criticized Shipka's ASL grammar, and others pointed out plot holes related to her character being deaf. =Comparison to A Quiet Place= The Silence was compared to A Quiet Place, a 2018 horror film with a similar premise. The novel The Silence was published in 2015, and filming of the adaptation took place in 2017, at the same time as A Quiet Place. While The Silence was acquired by a distributor, it was not released in theaters and was later picked up by Netflix. Quartzs Adam Epstein said while the parallel productions were coincidental, he compared The Silence to mockbusters (low-budget films that exploit blockbusters), highlighting that one of its screenwriters, Shane Van Dyke, wrote several scripts for The Asylum, a studio that specializes in mockbusters. The novel's author Tim Lebbon admitted that the two films' similarities are \\"a little troubling\\" and defended the film adaptation of his novel, \\"There are similarities, of course, but I'm confident that the movie of The Silence will stand on its own.\\" The Guardians Charles Bramesco called The Silence \\"a shoddy remix\\" of A Quiet Place and said, \\"The Silence exists for the sole purpose of being digitally sorted into a list of recommendations For Viewers Who Liked Bird Box, though that classification would be more accurately clocked as For Viewers Who Liked A Quiet Place... the demographic they're really after would be something closer to Viewers Who Have Trouble Telling Similar Things Apart.\\" Deciders Anna Menta compared the films, \\"The Silence is much darker and gorier than A Quiet Place,\\" and found The Silence to look low-budget in production values. Menta said The Silence was started before the invasion while A Quiet Place was set fully after the invasion. She noted the criticism of The Silence for having a hearing actor as a deaf character and highlighted its additional elements, a teen romance and a religious cult. Writing for Comic Book Resources, Renaldo Matadeen contrasted The Silence from A Quiet Place, writing, \\"There are quite a few plot threads which make it clear the Netflix movie is far from a rip-off and is, in fact, it's [sic] own thing.\\" Matadeen said The Silences deaf teenage girl can read lips and speak, \\"After a while, you almost forget Ally is deaf, resulting in the film lacking some of the genuine tension of A Quiet Place. He found the creatures \\"totally different\\" as well as the times compared to the creature invasion. While both films have \\"a somewhat similar format\\" in families trying to survive the creatures, \\"In The Silence, we get interference from external segments of mankind via the Hushed.\\" See also *List of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing References External links Category:2019 films Category:2019 horror films Category:2010s monster movies Category:American monster movies Category:German horror films Category:American films Category:German films Category:Films about cults Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films directed by John R.

Career  Make Do and Mend pamphlet cover designed by Jill Greenwood Jill attended art school in Chelsea and then joined the fashion brand Jaeger in 1931, where she known as \\"Crawshay\\". Initially employed in retail at their flagship Regent Street store, Jill's artistic flair was recognised and she was put in charge of display. During WWII, Jill wrote and illustrated Make Do and Mend pamphlets for the Ministry of Information. These iconic publications provided tips to housewives on harsh rationing, giving advice on how to stay frugal yet chic by reusing old clothing, creating ‚Äòdecorative patches‚Äô to cover holes in worn garments; unpicking and re-knitting old jumpers, and protecting one's garments against the ‚Äòmoth menace‚Äô. She remained at Jaeger for almost 30 years, playing a role in the design of their distinctive criss-crossed 'J' logo, and developing a reputation for her innovative and whimsical window dressings: > \\"Post-war at a time of shortage she famously designed an enormous pair of > scales for the window of Jaeger's Regent Street shop balancing sheep, > representing cashmere sweaters available only for export, against vital > imports such as tea, coffee and New Zealand butter.

She devised the Regent Street decorations for the Festival of Britain in 1951, and in 1954 was the designer of Regent Street's first Christmas lights. In 1959 she arranged the decoration of Oxford Street's lampposts between Tottenham Court Road and Marble Arch for the first Christmas display. Eventually she was put in charge of Jaeger's window displays across the country, before retiring in 1960.  Personal life  Jill married German-born illustrator and cartoonist Walter Goetz in 1938. They divorced shortly afterward but they and their families remained good friends. In 1940 she married British Labour Party politician Tony Greenwood (1911 ‚Äì 1982), who entered Parliament as member for Heywood and Radcliffe in a by-election in February 1946, becoming a prominent Cabinet Minister in the 1950s and 1960s. They had two daughters, Susanna and Dinah. Tony Greenwood died in 1982.  Politics  A committed socialist and pacifist, Jill was an important early member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmanent (CND). As a male and prominent politician, her husband Tony was more visible, but Jill was the driving force behind their involvement. Overcoming Tony's initial caution, they were both familiar figures at the head of Aldermaston marches in the early 1960s, while their daughter Susanna helped to found CND's youth wing.

Both schools were charter members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1933. History The two southern schools first met in 1895 in Columbus, Georgia. Georgia defeated Alabama by a score of 30‚Äì6. The teams did not meet again until 1901, another Georgia win, then continued to meet on a regular basis for the next several decades. The teams played each other in every season from 1944 to 1965. Highlights of that era included two separate five-game winning streaks by Alabama (tied for the longest streaks in the series) and the first-ever college football game to be televised by the ABC network, Alabama's 21-6 win in 1960 in Birmingham. In 1963, The Saturday Evening Post magazine reported that Alabama coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant and Georgia athletic director and former coach Wally Butts had conspired to fix the 1962 game, which Alabama won 35-0. After the story broke, Butts resigned as athletic director, though Butts and Bryant denied the allegations. The two sued the magazine's publisher for libel, and the case reached the United States Supreme Court as Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts (1967). The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Butts, with the publisher eventually being ordered to pay more than $3 million in damages. The lawsuit has been credited with leading to the end of the magazine. Following the scandal, the schools decided to end their annual series after the 1965 meeting. They have played only sporadically since, including just four meetings from 1971 to 1982, an era in which the Tide or Bulldogs won at least a share of every SEC title. = Divisional era (1992 to present) = When the SEC expanded to twelve teams and split into two divisions in 1992, Alabama was placed in the West Division, while Georgia was in the East. Each team in the league was matched with two \\"permanent\\" cross-division rivals. Because Alabama and Georgia were not paired as permanent rivals, they would play only on a rotating basis (twice in an eight-year cycle) or in the newly created SEC Championship Game. Later scheduling modifications, as well as the SEC's expansion to 14 teams, have resulted in just one permanent cross-division rival for each team, with Alabama playing Tennessee and Georgia facing off against Auburn. The Crimson Tide and Bulldogs now see each other in the regular season only twice per 12-year cycle. Since 1992, Alabama holds a 7‚Äì3 record over Georgia, which includes three post-season contests, all Tide victories. The teams squared off in the 2012 SEC Championship Game on December 1, 2012 in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia, with the winner likely to play for the national championship. Alabama defeated Georgia, 32‚Äì28, after Georgia's final play fell five yards short of a winning score.  Saban-Smart rivalry (2016-present)  Following the 2015 season, Georgia hired longtime Alabama assistant and former Georgia player Kirby Smart as head coach. Smart has since led Georgia to two post-season games against the Tide and his former boss, head coach Nick Saban. The first Saban-Smart match-up came following the 2017 season. In the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Alabama overcame a 13-point deficit to defeat Georgia by a score of 26‚Äì23 in overtime, to clinch its 17th national championship. The following season, the teams played in the 2018 SEC Championship Game, also played in Atlanta. Georgia led 28‚Äì14 with just over three minutes remaining in the third quarter, only to see Alabama once again rally to win, 35‚Äì28.

Raised in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area during August 1864, the regiment initially guarded the Manassas Gap Railroad and detachment elements on provost duty in Virginia. The regiment then moved to Alexandria in November, where it performed guard and escort duty. After the end of the war the main body of the regiment garrisoned Fort Delaware before mustering out in mid-1865.  History  Colonel F. Asbury Awl, regimental commander The 201st Pennsylvania was raised in the Harrisburg area during August 1864 for a one-year term in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 500,000 men. Within 30 days of the start of recruitment, it reached its required membership strength, and became the first of ten regiments to fulfill the state's assigned enrollment quota. Although the majority of its members were residents of Dauphin County, others came from Duncannon and Fairview, in Perry and Cumberland Counties while part of Company K was composed of men from Franklin County. The regiment concentrated at Camp Curtin and was organized there on 29 August, under the command of Colonel F. Asbury Awl. Many of the 201st Pennsylvania's officers and enlisted men had served previously with other regiments from the state, including the entire group of field and staff officers who had fought with the 127th Pennsylvania Infantry at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. A newspaper reward notice for returning deserters from a company of the regiment Shortly after its organization, the regiment moved to Chambersburg, where it encamped five miles from the town near the Black Creek crossing of the Chambersburg turnpike. After training at the camp, the 201st went on a three- day march for exercise on 12 September. Company H was sent to York for duty at the army hospital there on 17 September, while Companies F and G were sent to Bloody Run on the same day to join the Juniata District under General Orris S. Ferry. Company F soon transferred to McConnellsburg, and Companies F and G spent the northern hemisphere fall and winter arresting deserters, ultimately detaining nearly 500. Following the relief of Ferry in December, Major John T. Morgan of the regiment became district commander. Company E was moved to Scranton on 18 September, where it served on provost duty. The six remaining companies went on a three-day exercise march alongside artillery on 22 September. The regiment began moving to Pittsburgh on 28 September, but when it reached Huntingdon the order was changed. The regiment instead entrained aboard the Washington and Alexandria Railroad to Manassas Junction, serving along the Manassas Gap Railroad with its headquarters at Gainesville. It later moved to Thoroughfare Gap, remaining there until the rail was broken up. This duty was to protect railroad work crews from being attacked by the Confederate partisan rangers of John Mosby. The 201st moved to Alexandria on 13 November, where it was stationed at Camp Slough. For the rest of the war, the regiment served on guard duty in the city, in the defenses south of the Potomac, on railroad trains, and escorted recruits and stragglers towards the front. Many officers served on court martial boards, and Lieutenant Colonel J. Wesley Awl was appointed commander of the Alexandria Soldiers' Rest distribution camp in early May. Company G was sent to Pittsburgh on 24 May, where it served on provost duty. The main body of the regiment was ordered transferred to Fort Delaware on 26 May, and served there for the rest of its term. It was stationed at the fort alongside the 215th Pennsylvania Infantry, and helped to process Confederate prisoners of war for release. In mid-June the regiment concentrated at Harrisburg, where it mustered out on 21 June. During its service, the regiment suffered a total of sixteen deaths: one enlisted man killed and fifteen died of disease.

Her initial claim to fame was that the Pat Benatar hit \\"Heartbreaker\\" was written for her. Known for her huge bluesy rock voice, on such tracks as \\"Ladykiller\\", and the Buk single classic, \\"Slay me like a lady\\". Darren has released eleven albums to date, plus she has been featured on various other albums and compilations. Although never having had a hit record, her style is unique, being one of the few female Classic Rock vocalists in the world. Early career Darren was born Jennifer Harley in Birmingham, Warwickshire, England, the adopted and only child of Maud Phillips (n√©e Smith) and Leslie Phillips. She was raised in Dudley (which was originally in the county of Worcestershire) and attended The Sir Gilbert Claughton Grammar School. Writing her first song \\"Why does it have to be with me\\", at the age of eleven, then joining her first band (her cousin George's ) \\"Johnny Dark and The Rocking Phantoms\\", at the age of thirteen. During senior school, she gigged locally with a Blackheath group called \\"The Roving Saracens\\" as one of four singers, two other girls, and one boy, (Darren being the youngest by far) At this time she met Manchester Evening News journalist Richard Jaffa, who became her manager for the next three years, before he was called to the Bar to undertake his Barrister Law degree. She was fourteen years old when she signed a two singles deal with Nathan Joseph's folk label-\\" Transatlantic Records\\", who had notables such as \\"Long John Baldry\\". Darren was working a minimum of two nights per week with alternating pop and jazz outfits, after which she became a backing vocalist for \\"Clifford T. Ward\\", a Kidderminster singer-songwriter. With all this given experience, she soon learned her trade. Darren was also taken to see jazz artists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Dakota Staton and Oscar Peterson, when they were appearing in the UK in concert. After leaving school at the end of her fifth form year, Darren went professional and joined alternative cabaret group \\"The Second City Sound\\", for a period of four years. Darren recorded the Love is Blue album, plus two singles, one being a remake of Ike and Tina Turner's \\"River deep, mountain high\\", with the B side \\"Julie\\", penned by the group's bassist Bill Gilbert. The other single was a piano and string spectacular of the classical piece, \\"The Dream of Olwyn\\", with a vocal harmony song on the B side \\"A touch of velvet, a sting of brass\\". At the time the group were managed by Harry Gunn, a Manchester agent. At the end of the four-year stint, London agents Phil and Dorothy Solomons came on board, subsequently to manage Darren's solo career. Two years went by treading the boards, then her rock career beckoned. Firstly, with the Lancashire rock band \\"Stoney End\\" (who went on to become \\"Shabby Tiger\\") then in stepped \\"Hot Chocolate's\\" manager, Peter Walsh, a London impresario who pursued a recording deal with Decca Records for Darren. Walsh then went on to ask pianist and arranger, Mike Moran, to produce a remake of the Ronette's track \\"Be my baby\\",with the B side \\"How soon hello becomes goodbye\\" (from the Italian film \\"ill Silencioux\\" - \\"The Silent Ones\\")  Residencies  At the time in the UK, there was a \\"Mecca Band Residency\\" in most towns (which later became the Mecca Bingo Halls) therefore, a lot of professional musicians skipped from one location to another, Darren being no exception. Darren was resident at Manchester (Oxford Street-Tiffany's) then Rotherham, then Stafford. Later on, her London residencies were at Tiffany's Oxford Street, then subsequently Tottenham Mayfair, and Wimbledon Tiffany's. In the 1980s (in her drop out Rock years) Darren worked at both Reading, and Brighton, Top Rank residencies, drifting from residency to residency. Later she joined The Dave White Band twice over the years at various Norfolk and Nottingham venues. At the same time, Darren joined forces with Dave White's guitarist Lee Vasey (The Lee Vasey Band) playing jazz/rock on their one night and one lunchtime off each week.  Strawberry Studios  Darren met up with songwriter-producers Geoff Gill and Cliff Wade, who worked at Strawberry (10 CC's studios) in Stockport, Cheshire. Darren was pulled in to do backing vocals on some tracks that they had written. This was the beginning of the rock career that was to take off with a jolt! The next four years were spent touring the UK and Europe. Along the way, there were three \\"Jenny Darren Bands\\" over this period. TV slots and tours followed; AC/DC, plus a \\"Sight and Sound in Concert\\" appearance supporting the band Be Bop de Luxe. Reading, Glastonbury, and Knebworth, Festivals amongst many others soon followed.  Dick James Music (DJM)  After four years, Darren signed directly to DJM; with Father and son - Dick and Stephen James, who in turn became her joint Managers and Music Publishers. A new Band was to follow. They were: Ex England prog keyboard player Robert Webb, Andy Richards on second keyboard (Frankie goes to Hollywood), Chas Kronk (The Strawbs) on bass, Chris West (Stomu Yomashta) on guitar, Luis Jardim on percussion, and Nicko McBrain on drums (Iron Maiden) k The Band recorded one album only (Jenny Darren 2, later to become The pink album) produced by Tony Sadler. Due to internal problems, the band played two gigs only. A live \\"off the desk\\" recording still survives from The Fulcrum Hall, Slough. After which, Darren came off the road and also halted her recording career. Rock was no longer an option. After a passage of time away from it, she embarked upon a jazz career. Working at Ronnie Scott's club in Soho, London, the 606 Club Chelsea, plus various other jazz clubs around the country. Although live jazz recordings have been completed along the way, little has been released in the jazz vein. Two unreleased albums have not (so far) seen the light of day. In the twilight years, Darren also pursued a career as a vocal coach in colleges and involved herself in other areas of music pop, blues, Celtic, musical theatre, and classical.  Painted Lady (Helen Mirren)  In early 1997 Darren received a phone call from jazz pianist John Donaldson, regarding a two-part mini-series he was working on, featuring actress Helen Mirren as Maggie Sheridan. Maggie was portraying in the film, as a washed-up blues vocalist from the 1960s, who had long since stopped performing. The writers of the two-part mini-series (Peter Salem and Alan Cubitt) heard Darren sing (on the recommendation of Donaldson) and then offered her the singing role of Maggie. Some wonderful musicians played on the mini-series, music tracks, including Rock Drummer Cozy Powell, who also hailed from Darren's more recent neck of the woods. The miniseries was released firstly on video, then DVD. Consequently, it has proved to be a big hit in the U.S. Canada and the UK. Darren is also credited within the film credits. Interpreting songs veering from light pop, to heavy blues, with Celtic overtones at times. This is largely down to the fact of Maggie Sheridan's changing singing voice over the years, from a young teenager to middle age. The pure clarity of a youthful voice, leading into a more bluesy, rasping, mature sound. There has been some talk over the years regarding the making of ‚Äò'Painted Lady 2. However, this has never come into fruition.  Jazz duo  For a short period in mid-2000 onwards, Darren rehearsed and recorded with jazz pianist Max Turnbull. Recording songs along the way which were initially meant to be an experiment for a new studio in Hampshire, eventually leading to making an album, entitled Song for New York, the title track written by Darren and Turnbull. The songs were never released, however, they were a perfect soiree into her mainstream jazz song programme. Sadly, so far the songs in the main, have not been heard. Although it is thought that the original recordings still exist.  Paidarion  One Saturday Darren went to Balham, in London to see a retro keyboard workshop by Robert Webb. There she met Finnish record Producer and drummer - Kimmo Porsti, who asked her if she would like to record with his band Paidarion, to which Darren replied a resounding, \\"Yes!\\". Darren recorded her vocals in the UK. The musicians recorded their own separate musical parts from around the world. They were: √Åkos Bokor Bogarti (electric acoustic guitars,backing vocals), Jan-Olof Strandberg (fretless and fretted bass), Otso Pakarinen (Keyboards, synth), Robert Webb (England - keys, acoustic guitar, vocals), Kev Moore (vocals). The album entitled Two Worlds Encounter -The Finlandia project, was released in November 2016.  The Ladykillers (Studio band 1 ‚Äì late 2014)  Have taken three forms since the first recording of the 2017 Ladykillers album. The first being the very first studio band. The hard core members being: Andy Hawkins - drums: Clive Poole - guitar (younger brother of drummer Mac Poole from '70s rock band Warhorse) and Kev Moore (Witchcross/BCSweet/Christie). upright=1.35 The album itself was initiated by Moore, taking up on the idea made to Darren by a friend of hers, fellow musician (Gordon Milton) who suggested that she should re-record and then re-release \\"Heartbreaker\\". Moore was instrumental from the first in bringing the project into being. He initially brought in fellow guest musicians Graham Oliver (Saxon-guitarist) Tom Leary (Fiddle-Lindisfarne) Andrew Hawkins (Drums - BC Sweet). Then Darren brought in Tony Williams (Guitar-Jaki Graham), Robin George (Guitar-Roy Wood/The Move/ Magnum); then Pete Way (Bass-UFO) and Chris Slade (Drums-AC/DC) by courtesy of Robin George. Nicko McBrain (Drums-Iron Maiden) who was the drummer in Darren's Band when the song \\"Ode to Billy Joe\\" was recorded. As also were Robert Webb (England- Keys) Andy Richards (Keys-Frankie Goes to Hollywood) Chas Kronk (Strawbs-Bass) Chris West (Guitar-Stomu Yamashta) and Luis Jardim (percussion-The Buggles). As well as two versions of \\"Heartbreaker\\" being featured on the disc, there is also an updated version of \\"Ladykiller\\", taken from the Jenny Darren (1977 album) plus some original songs by Moore, and Witchcross guitarist Mike Koch, Darren and keyboardist/ MD re Cindy Lauper) Jan Pulsford. The album backtracks were initially recorded with the band, at The Two Rivers Studios. The vocals were recorded at Soundshack in Cheltenham. The project also came further into being when a promo video was undertaken. Moore had by this time dropped out of the project, only to return (briefly) a few months later. Darren then brought in Wishbone Ash musicians Bob Skeat (bass) as a replacement for Moore, plus Muddy Manninen (guitar) together with Bill Hunt (keyboards-Roy Wood-ELO) (on drums on the video - Martin Magic Johnson - Jo Harman Band) plus Ian Horley (second guitar) videod by Greg Wilson-Copp from Soundshack.  Draco Angelis  thumb Draco were initially an acoustic Celtic rock duo formed by Kev Moore and Darren herself. With Moore on acoustic guitar, plus Darren on vocals. Moore brought in electric violin and fiddle player Tom Leary, and Darren, guitarist Muddy Manninen for an initial recording. Draco wrote over thirty songs in total. However, only one song at present has been recorded to studio quality ‚Äì the ballad \\"Queen Arachnid\\"; the rest of the songs being demoed to be recorded at some future date. Darren and Moore performed at a charity concert in North London in 2016 for the Legacy Project (ex-members of pre Iron Maiden)  Ladykillers 2 (Live and recording band)  upright=1.35 The third and final phase was organised in January 2017, after Moore finally left the project for good, and went back to live in Spain. Darren happened to spot drummer Rupert James Irving playing locally with a Gloucestershire band. After contacting him, he, in turn, introduced her to other local musicians. The new Ladykillers Band members being Rupert James Irving (drums), J Evans (guitar), Jo Ward (keys) Alun Roberts (bass). The new Ladykiller album being finally scheduled for its release in May 2017, and its album launch on the 31 August 2017. In September 2017, ex-Wishbone Ash guitarist Muddy Manninen joined The Ladykillers for a short time, as an additional member to the lineup. Manninen also wrote and recorded with Darren until March 2018. In August of the same year, bassist Alun Roberts, and keys player Jo Ward left the band for personal reasons. Then Birmingham bassist David Brown (brother in law of Robin George) joined The Ladykillers, together with (also from Birmingham) guitarist Ben Bartlett. Ben was a temporary addition to the band and was later replaced by a further Birmingham member, guitarist - Nigel Jones. Britain's Got Talent Darren took part in the 12th season of the Britain's Got Talent TV show at the age of 68. Initially head hunted for the show late in 2017, she debated on whether it was a good career move; finally agreeing to do so, she started her BGT audition dressed as a granny, before stripping down to rock chick the black outfit underneath, and rocking out to AC/DC's \\"Highway to Hell\\". The entire audience, including all four judges, gave Darren a standing ovation when she finished singing. Following her appearance, there was an initial, unsubstantiated, negative tabloid newspaper report regarding her, which resulted in Darren no longer appearing in the show. However, the video itself has received over 200 million views worldwide, on various collated sites. During an appearance on Good Morning Britain, Darren revealed how she had missed out on her big chance with the hit song \\"Heartbreaker\\". Her record company released it on a previous album of hers ‚Äì Queen of Fools in 1978. As they were also a publishing house, in 1979 the song was given to rising U.S. singer Pat Benatar who went on to record it and made it into a huge international hit.  Personal life  Darren married in her mid-twenties, when she lived in Manchester. She divorced some years later, and moved to London to pursue her career in the late '70s. During the end of the DJM years (re: the Jenny Darren -2 Album) she lived and worked with the England Prog rock band virtuoso keyboard player Robert Webb. Their songwriting relationship carried on and off for some years after the album was written and released. Much later, Darren resided in Essex in her college teaching years. From 2014, she wrote her song material in collusion with (Danish Band Witchcross - bass player) Kev Moore. This was to end when Moore left Draco Angelis.  Discography  Darren's first album Love is blue with Second City Sound was released on the Columbia label in 1968, with her name listed as Jenny Phillips. Releasing her first solo album entitled City Lights, on the DJM label in 1977. Followed closely by the \\"Jenny Darren\\" (1-album) in late 77. The album Queen of Fools (which included the song \\"Heartbreaker\\", was written for her and which U.S. vocalist Pat Benatar covered and released later) was released in 1978. Her last of the four DJM albums \\"Jenny Darren\\" (2) later known as The Pink Album, was released in 1980. There was a musical hiatus for many years until 2014. On 6 November 2015 Heartbreaker - The Best Of, was released on the Angel Air label. This was followed on by a guest appearance on an album recorded with the Finnish band Paidarion (The Finlandia Project - Two Worlds Encounter - 2016). Then Ladykillers a collection of originals and covers by Jenny Darren and The Ladykillers, which was released in 2017 on the Seacrest Oy label, and features two versions of \\"Heartbreaker\\". Following on from this a compilation of songs that Darren wrote with Robert Webb (England band) released on Green-Tree Nu Music Records, in the summer of 2018. Then, the re-release (on download only) of Jenny Darren - 2 re-titled \\"The Pink Album\\", in the late Summer of 2018 on CD Baby.

The building is run for the state by an independent organization of the same name, to promote literacy, reading, publishing and for conferences, symposia, training courses and exhibitions pertaining to these. History The building opened in 1913, and was originally built with money donated by Willem Hiddingh and Donald Currie and was to be the headquarters of the then University of the Cape of Good Hope, today known as the University of South Africa, as an examination centre for colleges such as Victoria College, Stellenbosch, South African College and others, who are today universities in their own right. In 1932, University of South Africa moved to rented premises in Pretoria. The building was sold to the state, to be the home of the National Archives of South Africa, and an elevator and fire detection system was installed. In 1987, the building was offered to the South African Library, which planned to house some of its special collections there, as the Archives planned to relocate to new premises. In February 1990, the Archives moved to out and by this time the building was in a state of serious disrepair with crumbling stonework and major damage to the roofs. During this year the building was proclaimed a National Monument. A leading restoration consultant, John Rennie, was appointed to tend to the building with a very limited budget. The elevator is a custom design, has unique finishes, and opens into three directions with three separate doors as necessitated by the design of the building. Architecture The building is built in the Edwardian style. Two British architects, W. Hawke and W.N. McKinlay, won a competition for its design and moved to South Africa to oversee its construction. The architects moved on to contribute to the design of the Union Buildings.

The initiative proposed to reduce pollution by levying a fee on greenhouse gas emissions generated within the state of Washington, and using that revenue to support air quality and energy projects, as well as water quality and forest health initiatives. The measure failed with 56.3% of voters rejecting it. Ballot Title The ballot title was as follows: Measure Design The measure stated that, beginning on January 1, 2020, a fee of $15 would be enacted on each metric ton of carbon emitted in the state of Washington. The fee would increase by $2 every year until the state's greenhouse gas emissions target for 2035 is met, and the state's emissions target for 2050 is on track to be met. These goals had previously been set by the Washington State Legislature, which passed a law in 2008 that required the state to reduce its emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, 25% below 1990 levels by 2035, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. As of 2018, the state is not on track to achieve those goals. Background Environmental advocates in Washington had previously attempted to pass carbon pricing measures. Washington Initiative 732, a \\"tax swap\\" proposal to levy a tax on carbon emissions and simultaneously reduce the state's sales tax, had appeared on the ballot in the 2016 election, but failed to pass. Initiative 1631 differed in that it proposed to use revenue from carbon fees to invest in projects to reduce pollution. These include projects related to transportation, energy efficiency, carbon sequestrations in farms and forests, and clean energy. The initiative also proposed to invest over $250 million in climate adaptation in the areas of forestry and water conservation. The particular projects funded would be determined by a board appointed by the governor that would be directed to invest 70% of the revenue in clean energy. Support The initiative was drafted by a broad coalition of labor, faith, social justice, health, tribal, and environmental justice groups, such as Front and Centered, a community of color and low-income coalition advocating for a just transition. It was also supported by Carbon Washington, the organization that had put Initiative 732 on the ballot. Other organizations that supported the initiative included Stand.earth, The Nature Conservancy, and local chapters of 350.org and the Sierra Club. Elected officials who supported this initiative included United States Representative Pramila Jayapal and Washington Governor Jay Inslee. Opposition The \\"No on 1631\\" campaign was sponsored by the Western States Petroleum Association. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and Cascade Natural Gas have also given money to oppose this measure, as have BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, and Phillips 66. Oil companies collectively committed more than twenty million dollars to oppose Initiative 1631. Atmospheric sciences professor Cliff Mass opposed the initiative. Others opposed the measure because section 9(c) specifically exempted \\"Fossil fuels directly or eventually supplied to a light and power business for purposes of generating electricity\\" from the carbon tax. This meant that coal, gas, and diesel power plants would not directly be responsible for paying the carbon tax. However the majority of electricity generation in Washington state is derived from renewable sources. A 2017 report by The Washington Post indicated that 68% of electricity generated in Washington state comes from hydropower and 7% is from wind turbines. The same analysis further indicated that only 4% of Washington's energy comes from burning coal, all of which is generated by the Centralia Power Plant. This plant will begin phasing out its two coal boilers beginning in the year 2020 and transition completely to natural gas by the year 2025. Natural gas currently accounts for only 10% of Washington's energy generation, according to The Washington Post analysis. Ultimately, the initiative did not pass during the 2018 November election.

Although Mautloa lives in and is inspired by Alexandra, his studio is at The Bag Factory, the Johannesburg member of The Triangle Network. He and Sam Nhlengethwa were invited to be the first residents of the Bag Factory when David Koloane and Robert Loder created it in an area not strictly black or white during Apartheid segregation in 1991. Some of Mautloa's other studio mates were William Kentridge, Helen Sebidi, Penny Siopis, Wayne Barker, Benon Lutaaya and Deborah Bell. Mautloa is now a board member for Bag Factory.

It has been sampled in Europe and New Zealand. Along with the similar nematode Panagrolaimus detritophagus, in 2018 it was the first species of multicellular eukaryote to be thawed into a living state after prolonged cryopreservation. Female worms of this species were found in Pleistocene permafrost in the Kolyma River lowland (one of the sites was near the Alazeya River). They were mobile and ate, after being frozen for 30‚Äì40 thousand years. Taxonomy Plectus parvus was described by the English zoologist Henry Charlton Bastian in 1865. The names Plectus potamogeti (Schneider, 1937) and Rhabdolaimus baltonicus (Daaday, 1894) are considered synonyms. Sources differ on its higher level taxonomy. The World Register of Marine Species places it in order Plectida, while the Integrated Taxonomic Information System places it in the order Araeolaimida. Anatomy Adults of this species are reported to grow to 0.4‚Äì0.6 mm long. They possess two alae. The body is defended by a thin cuticle. The males possess asymmetrical spicules. Ecology In the river sediments and soils it inhabits, this worm is part of the benthos group. It has been shown that interaction between this species and another soil nematode Bursilla monhysteria in damp podzols increases both bacterial biomass and nitrogen mineralisation. It is one of the nematodes present in estuarine mud, and because of the absence of quantifiable levels of megafauna present in more polluted sediments, these nematodes can be used to assess pollution levels.

The Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railroad Company built the tunnel for its own use. Irish and Swedish immigrants comprised the construction crews. The tunnel cuts through sandstone of the Caprock Escarpment, about 50 feet below its ridge of about 2,800 elevation. The tunnel was originally long. After a train wreck in the tunnel in 1973, the line was closed for eighteen months while the tunnel was shortened to its current length, and the rails were upgraded to handle heavier traffic. As of 1976, it was one of very few railway tunnels still in use in Texas. The line was abandoned in 1989.

She was born in Bayonne, New Jersey on June 10, 1916. She graduated from the City College of New York evening session with a B.S. in Education in 1942.  Atomic spying case  In 1950, during the McCarthy era and as part of the atomic spies prosecutions, Miriam Moskowitz was indicted for conspiring with Abraham Brothman and Harry Gold to obstruct justice. Moskowitz's prosecution arose from an investigation into Soviet nuclear espionage into the Manhattan Project and related activities by which the United States developed atomic bombs. The investigation was capped by the prosecution and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for spying. Moskowitz and Brothman's trial was presided over by Judge Irving Kaufman, and prosecuted by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Irving Saypol and his 23-year-old confidential assistant, Roy Cohn. Harry Gold and Elizabeth Bentley testified against Moskowitz and her codefendant, Abraham Brothman. Roy Cohn viewed the case as \\"a dry-run of the upcoming Rosenberg trial. We were able to see how Gold and Bentley fared on the stand, and we were able to see how we fared, Saypol and I.‚Äù Only a few months later, Judge Kaufman presided over the espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg at which U.S. Attorney Irving Saypol and Roy Cohn prosecuted the Rosenbergs and Harry Gold and Elizabeth Bentley testified against the Rosenbergs. During her trial, Moskowitz was housed at the New York Women's House of Detention, where she met Ethel Rosenberg.Ethel Rosenberg: Beyond the Myths, By Ilene J. Philipson, pages 313-314 Moskowitz was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice. Judge Kaufman sentenced her to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Moskowitz served her time at Federal Prison Camp, Alderson in West Virginia.

Geology The waterfall runs off into what is called the Yin-Yang Sea, and because of the color of the water, it has long been assumed that it was polluted. However, recently it has been discovered that the color of the water is a natural occurrence. The soil and the water that runs off contains many minerals including sulfur, arsenic, and copper ore, which give the water its golden color. However, the water is very toxic because of the high amount of metal minerals in the water, and people are advised to not get into the water. The rocks in the waterfall have acquired a yellow color over time due to the levels of arsenic and other minerals in the water. Nearby the waterfall are an old gold mining factory and the Yin-Yang Sea, which the waterfall runs into.  History  There is an old Gold Mining Factory nearby the Golden Waterfall that dates back to the time of the Japanese occupation in Taiwan. It was because of this mining factory's presence and the amount of mining that had been done in that area that people believed the waterfall's color was because of pollution from these activities.  Yin-Yang Sea  The Golden waterfall runs off into the Shuinandong Bay and the sea there has two colors, the normal blue and the yellow from the waterfall's runoff. Because of this contrast of colors in the bay, the local people started to call it the Yin-Yang Sea. The inspiration for this name comes from the concept of duality and of two different sides becoming one whole.

The road was constructed around 1957, and majority of the road was paved by 1967. A portion of the route east of Matherville was removed from the state highway system in 1999. Route description The route is located in northern Wayne and southern Clarke counties. MS 510 is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and all of it is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT), as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. MS 510 starts at a three-way junction with MS 145 south of Shubuta in Wayne County, and it travels northward towards the Wayne‚ÄìClarke county line. The road crosses the county line, and it turns east at County Road 612 (CO 612). The route enters a large area of farmland, and it crosses Carson Sand Creek. It curves northward until it reaches the Choctaw Base Line, where it begins travelling eastward again. Past CO 611, MS 510 crosses Dry Creek and Shiloh Creek.

He was a national champion enduro rider and entrepreneur who went on to develop an enduro motorcycle brand that bore his name. He also founded a successful off-road motorcycle boot and apparel company. Penton was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1998. Motorcycling career Penton grew up on his family farm near Amherst, Ohio where he learned how to ride a motorcycle on his father's 1914 Harley-Davidson. He served in the Merchant Marine and in the Navy during the Second World War then, returned home and soon bought a Harley-Davidson Knucklehead motorcycle. Penton entered the grueling Jack Pine 500-Mile Enduro in 1948 where, he was impressed by the performance of the BSA motorcycle ridden by the race winner. The advantage that the nimble, lightweight British motorcycle had over heavier, more powerful motorcycles left an impression on Penton. He rode a BSA B33 to a second-place finish in the 1949 Jack Pine Enduro. The second-place finish inspired Penton to find a better performing enduro motorcycle. In 1950, Penton and his brothers opened a motorcycle dealership in Amherst where, they sold BSA as well as BMW and NSU motorcycles. Penton became one of the top motorcycle enduro competitors in the nation, representing the United States seven times at the International Six Days Trial (now called International Six Days Enduro) between 1962 and 1970. The International Six Days Trial is a form of off-road motorcycle Olympics which is the oldest annual competition sanctioned by the FIM dating back to 1913. He was also a long-distance motorcyclist, setting a transcontinental crossing record in 1958 when he rode a BMW R69S from New York to Los Angeles in 52 hours and 11 minutes. After winning the 1966 Jack Pine Enduro on a Husqvarna, the Swedish motorcycle manufacturer named him the distributor of the brand for the eastern United States. As the baby boomer generation came of age during the 1960s and 1970s, off-road motorcycling experienced a boom in popularity. Penton sought to capitalize on this boom by providing a lightweight off-road motorcycle. After failing to convince Husqvarna to produce an even lighter off-road machine, he decided make his proposal to the KTM factory in Austria which, at the time produced bicycles and mopeds. Penton offered to put up $6,000 of his own money if KTM would build prototypes to his specifications which, would be sold in the United States as Penton motorcycles. He formed a successful racing team that supported some of the top enduro racers of the era including his son, Jack Penton who competed in 12 ISDT events as well as Dick Burleson, Carl Cranke and Billy Uhl. By the time Penton sold the distributorship to KTM, approximately 10 years later, more than 25,000 Penton motorcycles had been sold in America. Penton's innovations also included off-road motorcycling apparel. With the assistance of Italian boot manufacturer Alpinestars, he developed one of the biggest-selling off-road motorcycle boots in the nation. Top motocross racer Bob Hannah wore the boots and consulted on improvements to the design. By the late-1970s, his boot and apparel company accounted for over half the sales in the American market. He was inducted to the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1998. A book, John Penton and the Off-Road Motorcycle Revolution, and a 2014 video documentary about Penton's life, Penton: The John Penton Story, narrated by Lyle Lovett, have been created.

Completed in 1965 and designed in the modernist International style by Ken Woolley from the NSW Government Architect's Office, the 128-metre-high building (known colloquially as the \\"Black Stump\\") took the title of the tallest building in Australia from the nearby AMP Building until 1967, when Harry Seidler's 170m Australia Square tower was completed. Designed to hold offices of the NSW Government, including the cabinet and the Premier's office, the State Office Block was demolished in 1997 to make way for Renzo Piano's Aurora Place development. History The State Government Office Block was the culmination of a much grander and ambitious plan by the NSW Government of Bob Heffron to remodel and redevelop Macquarie Street and Parliament House into a grand modernist-style government precinct, including several new office towers for the state government. This however, never eventuated, and by early 1961 this scheme had been substantially reduced to comprise the State Office Block on the Bent Street/Macquarie Street block occupied by the government-owned 1870s Government Printing Office building and the 1820s Australian Subscription Library, with a final design at 400-feet- high approved by the Height of Buildings Committee in January 1961. In 1962 the government called for tenders for the new office block to hold government offices, on the block bounded by Phillip Street, Bent Street and Macquarie Street. This contract was subsequently won in November 1962 by Perini Australia to a cost of ¬£5,761,266, being the largest architectural contract entered into by the Department of Public Works at the time. The NSW Government Architect's Office's Ken Woolley designed a 38-floor tower of composite concrete and steel with deep window recesses clad in black granite. Woolley's design accounted for the sun-exposure for such a tall building by including measures such as floor slabs projecting beyond the window line to make sunhoods, which were clad in bronze sheeting. Woolley also designed the interiors which were influenced by Scandinavian modernism exemplified by the use of modular furniture. The lift lobby leading for the Premier's office floor was decorated by a double-sided oxidised bronze Coat of Arms of New South Wales by sculptor Bert Flugelman. The building was completed at a total cost of over A¬£7 million. The office of the Premier moved into the building from the old Treasury Building, and State Cabinet meetings were held in the top-floor cabinet room. The State Office Block was the first major office building erected for the NSW Public Service since 1927 and provided accommodation for six departments: the Premiers Department, The Treasury and the departments of agriculture, local government, mines and public works. The building was topped out in 1965 and was officially opened on 18 September 1967 by Premier Bob Askin. Demolition By the late 1980s the office block remained in use, but discussion over its future began when government policy shifted to leasing rather than owning office space. In 1987 Premier Barrie Unsworth raised the potential of state-owned CBD buildings being sold and converted to hotels to increase tourist accommodation in the city and dismissed suggestions that the State Office Block be retained, saying: \\"We will always retain the heritage buildings but there is no real reason why we should retain the State Office Block\\". The State Office Block nevertheless survived into the 1990s, with heated discussion continuing over its future, but it was \\"considered old enough to be outdated, yet too young to be of heritage value\\" and was sold to Lendlease for demolition in 1996, to be replaced by the Renzo Piano-designed Aurora Place. Lendlease noted that the government sold the complex in full knowledge of company's desire to demolish and that the State Office Block was full of asbestos, was not energy efficient and the air conditioning system was outdated and required extensive replacing. Ken Woolley, who had led a bid to have the existing building converted into a hotel, advocated in vain for its conservation, noting in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald in August 1996: In a similar vein, prominent heritage architect Clive Lucas decried the \\"tragedy\\" that \\"quality development seems only to take place where excellence already exists. The State Office is a building of great distinction and it is not really satisfactory to justify its demise by getting an international architect to design a better building for the site.\\" By contrast, the Herald's architecture critic, Anne Susskind, praised the choice of Piano expressing that his appointment was \\"a welcome break from the awful sameness in design to which Sydney has been subject.\\" On the opening of Aurora Place in November 2000, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald recognised the contention over the State Office Block's demolition, noting that many architects deplored its demolition and quoting architecture Professor James Weirick lamenting that it was \\"very unfortunate they demolished the State Office Block, which was a very fine building of the 1960s, one of the great achievements of the Government Architect's office.\\" However a later review a few years later observed that while \\"there were murmurings in architectural circles\\" against its demolition, there was \\"little discernible public disquiet at the loss of the 'Black Stump'\\". A sculpture by Margel Hinder, \\"Growth Forms\\" (1959), that had been placed in the forecourt of the Office Block in 1980 when its original site was demolished, was again moved as a result of demolition, and is now on display in the UTS Tower following acquisition by the university and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

It \\"traces its descent in an unbroken line\\" from the Amalgamated Miners' Association, formed in 1874.

It stars Mammootty and Karthika Muralidharan in the lead roles, and Joy Mathew and Muthumani in supporting roles. It was released on 27 April 2018.  Plot  Shruthi, a student at Ooty college, is forced to go back to her home in Kozhikode due to the dangerous strikes at the location. Coincidentally, she meets Krishnakumar (KK) her father‚Äôs family friend, who offers her a ride back home. She reluctantly accepts this offer, as she has no other safe option. During the 6-hour drive, KK, whom Shruthi affectionately calls \\"Uncle\\", and Shruthi listen to music, tell stories, and look at the scenery. However, KK makes suspicious calls and talks to suspicious people throughout the trip, leading the audience to believe that Shruthi‚Äôs safety may be compromised. Her father back at home is understandably worried, and he fears that he doesn‚Äôt know KK, a bachelor, as well as he thought he did. However, her mother convinces her father that Shruthi is alright as both Shruthi and KK are calling home regularly and sound happy over the phone. This fear heightens when KK and Shruthi stay at a Tamilian house overnight, where KK is given a bottle of alcohol and Shruthi‚Äôs phone is taken away. However, nothing bad happens; in fact, the host family takes care of Shruthi well and gives back her phone, fully charged. KK tells Shruthi that the Tamilians are leaders of the village, and that she has nothing to worry about. Meanwhile Shruthi‚Äôs father sends her friend Sam to tailgate KK‚Äôs car throughout the trip. Shruthi discovers this and invites Sam to ride with them. This fear peaks when KK leaves Sam behind after filling up his car. Now, Shruthi gets even more worried and calls home more frequently. After passing the Kerala- Tamil Nadu border, KK pulls out a pouch of something that looks like crack cocaine, from his pocket, which he found in Sam‚Äôs bag. He shows it to Shruthi, which justifies why he left Sam behind. After this, KK offers some of the alcohol that he got from the Tamilians for Shruthi to taste. Shruthi gets worried at first, but she discovers that the ‚Äúalcohol‚Äù is actually rare honey, which her mother asked KK to bring. Now, Shruthi realizes that she can entrust even her entire life to this uncle. To celebrate, KK takes Shruthi to a special lake, with her parents‚Äô permission. The two are caught taking selfies together by the villagers, who report them to the police under a false pretense that they were in a compromising situation. Shruthi‚Äôs parents come to the station to convince the officer and villagers that she was in the hands of a trusted caregiver. The positive outcome of this ordeal cements Shruthi's parents' faith in KK. Although the last scene may appear silly, it is a real issue prevalent in India today, and this film seeks to address that.

The operation would be the first phase of the advance, being immediately succeeded by Operation Dauntless which would take the UN forces to the Wyoming Line to north of the 38th Parallel. The operation resulted in a UN victory. Background On 22 March, following the successful conclusion of Operation Courageous, US Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway notified UN forces commander General Douglas MacArthur that he was developing plans for an advance that would take Eighth Army forces above the 38th Parallel to a general line following the upstream trace of the Ryesong River as far as Sibyon-ni () in the west, falling off gently southeastward to the Hwach'on Reservoir, then running east to the coast. As in past and current operations, the objective would be the destruction of enemy troops and materiel. MacArthur approved Ridgway's concept but also scheduled a visit to Korea for 24 March, when he would have an opportunity to discuss the plans in more detail. Upon his return to Tokyo late on 24 March, following his conference with Ridgway and a visit to the front, MacArthur announced that he had directed the Eighth Army to cross the 38th Parallel \\"if and when its security makes it tactically advisable. More specifically MacArthur had approved Ridgway‚Äôs concept of a general advance as deep as twenty miles into North Korea. On 27 March, Ridgway assembled Corps and Division commanders at his Yeoju headquarters and advised them that ceasefire negotiations and future US Government decisions might compel the Eighth Army to adopt a static defense. Because of its inherent rigidity, such a stance would require strong leadership and imaginative tactical thinking, he warned, to stand off a numerically stronger enemy that might not be similarly inhibited in the choice of tactics. The Eighth Army meanwhile would continue to move forward and in the next advance would cross the 38th Parallel. Ridgway agreed with General MacArthur's earlier prediction that a stalemate ultimately would develop on the battlefront, but just how far the Eighth Army would drive into North Korea before this occurred, could not be accurately assessed at that time. Ridgway had revised his concept for advancing above the parallel since meeting with MacArthur on 24 March. He planned to point his main attack toward the centrally located road and rail complex marked out by the towns of Pyonggang in the north and Ch'orwon and Gimhwa-eup in the south. This complex, eventually named the Iron Triangle, lay above the 38th Parallel in the diagonal corridor dividing the Taebaek Mountains into northern and southern ranges and containing the major road and rail links between the port of Wonsan in the north-east and Seoul in the south-west. Other routes emanating from the triangle of towns connected with Pyongyang to the northwest and with the western and eastern halves of the present front. A unique center of communications, the complex was of obvious importance to the ability of the enemy high command to move troops and supplies within the forward areas and to coordinate operations laterally. The first phase of this advance was to occupy ground that could serve as a base both for continuing the advance toward the complex and, in view of the enemy's evident offensive preparations, for developing a defensive position. The base selected, the Kansas Line, followed the lower bank of the Imjin River in the west. From the Imjin eastward as far as the Hwach'on Reservoir the line lay to above the 38th Parallel across the approaches to the Iron Triangle. Following the lower shoreline of the reservoir, it then turned slightly north to a depth of above the parallel before falling off southeastward to the Yangyang area on the coast. In the advance to the Kansas Line, designated Operation Rugged, US I and IX Corps were to seize the segment of the line between the Imjin and the western edge of the Hwach'on Reservoir. To the east, US X Corps was to occupy the portion tracing the reservoir shore and reaching Route 24 in the Soyang River valley, and the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) III and I Corps were to take the section between Route 24 and Yangyang. In anticipation of enemy offensive operations, Ridgway planned to pull substantial forces off the line immediately after reaching the Kansas Line and prepare them for counterattacks. IX Corps was to release the US 1st Cavalry Division. The division was to assemble at Kyongan- ni, below the Han River southeast of Seoul, and prepare to meet enemy attacks aimed at the capital via Route 1 from the northwest, over Routes 33 and 3 from the north, or through the Bukhan River valley from the northeast. In the X Corps' zone, the bulk of the US 2nd Infantry Division was to assemble at Hongch'on ready to counter an attack following the Route 29 axis, and a division yet to be selected from one of the two ROK Corps in the east was to assemble at Yuch'on-ni on Route 20 and prepare to operate against enemy attacks in either corps sector. The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (187th RCT), which had left the I Corps' zone for Taegu on 29 March, meanwhile was to be ready to return north to reinforce operations wherever needed. While these forces established themselves in reserve, Ridgway planned to launch Operation Dauntless, a limited advance toward the Iron Triangle by I and IX Corps. With the objective only of menacing the triangle, not of investing it, the two Corps were to attack in succession to Lines Utah and Wyoming. They would create, in effect, a broad salient bulging above the Kansas Line between the Imjin River and Hwach'on Reservoir and reaching prominent heights commanding the Ch'orwon-Kumhwa base of the communications complex. If struck by strong enemy attacks during or after the advance, the two Corps were to return to the Kansas Line. To maintain, and in some areas regain, contact with enemy forces, Ridgway allowed each corps to start toward the Kansas Line as it completed preparations. The Operation Rugged advance, as a result, staggered to a full start between 2 and 5 April. On 3 April, Ridgway updated MacArthur on the operational plans. MacArthur agreed with the Operation Rugged and Operation Dauntless concept, urging in particular that Ridgway make a strong effort to hold the Kansas Line. At the same time, MacArthur believed that the two operations would move the battlefront to that \\"point of theoretical stalemate\\" he had predicted in early March. Once Ridgway's forces reached their Kansas-Wyoming objectives MacArthur intended to limit UN operations to reconnaissance and combat patrols, none larger than a battalion. Operation General Ridgway had widened the I Corps' zone eastward to pass control of the US 24th Infantry Division, which had been operating on the IX Corps' left, to I Corps commanded by General Frank W. Milburn. While Milburn's forces along the Imjin River stood fast, the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions in the eastern half of the I Corps' zone attacked north on either side of Route 3 on the morning of 3 April. East of the road, the 24th Division moved astride the Yongp'yong River valley, the 5th Infantry Regiment on the left advancing into the Kwanum Mountain mass abutting Route 3, the 21st Infantry Regiment striking for Kungmang Mountain just inside the right Corps' boundary. West of Route 3, the 27th and 35th Infantry Regiments of the 25th Division advanced toward high ground rising between a lateral stretch of the Yongp'yong River and the Hantan River farther north. Pushing scattered People's Volunteer Army (PVA) 26th Army forces out of position by fire and occasionally by assault, and turning back a few light counterattacks, the 25th Division took the heights overlooking the Hantan River on 5 April. Resistance to the 24th Division was desultory except at the far right where the 2nd Battalion, 21st Infantry, stalled on the western slopes of Kungmang Mountain on 4 April, under fire from a strong PVA 40th Army force dug in on the crest behind barbed wire and antipersonnel mines. The battalion finally cleared the position after air strikes and artillery fire had softened it on the morning of 5 April. The 5th Infantry occupied the Kwanum Mountain mass that same day; slowed by the Kungmang battle, the 21st Infantry reached the Kansas Line on 6 April. The adjoining British 27th Brigade following the Kap'yong River valley on the IX Corps' left was stopped by PVA fire from Kungmang Mountain until the 21st Infantry reduced that position; then the British marched unopposed to the Kansas Line on 6 April. Flushing scattered PVA out of the IX Corps' central zone, the ROK 6th Infantry Division reached its Kansas objectives the same day. On the Corps' right, where the 1st Cavalry Division advanced astride the Pukhan River, the attached 7th Marine Regiment moved easily up the west side of the river, but the 7th and 8th Cavalry Regiments attacking through cut-up, virtually roadless ground east of the Pukhan were slowed by strong delaying forces of the PVA 39th Army. On 6 April the two cavalry regiments were still some short of their Kansas Line objectives adjacent to the Hwach'on Reservoir. =Hwach'on Reservoir= Hwachon Reservoir map General Ridgway suspected that the stiff resistance to the 1st Cavalry Division was related to enemy plans to obstruct IX Corps' movement by releasing the reservoir's water through the Hwacheon Dam and flooding the Pukhan. The water was far from its maximum level, but air observers recently had noted that the dam's eighteen sluice gates were closed. The PVA were intent on keeping the Cavalry away from the reservoir to give the water time to rise before releasing it. As the advance got under way, the IX Corps' engineer calculated that simultaneously opening all sluice gates and penstocks when the reservoir was full would raise the Pukhan to in the vicinity of the Kansas Line and would flood much of the Chuncheon basin. Although the flooding would not be disastrous, it would temporarily disrupt lateral movement in the Corps' zone and north-south traffic on Route 17, IX Corps' main supply route; moreover, this harassment could be repeated as long as the dam remained in enemy hands. Ridgway, in light of these prospects, adjusted his plans to include the dam as an objective. The dam stood at the northwest corner of the reservoir, its spillway slanting north into a deep, narrow gorge through which the Pukhan at that point coursed north and then turned west and south to form a horseshoe-shaped loop. The structure abutted on two narrow-ridge peninsulas, one protruding south into the reservoir on the east, the other located in the loop of the Pukhan on the west. The western peninsula, which offered the only overland approach to the dam, jutted beyond the Kansas Line at the right of IX Corps; the dam itself rested above the Kansas Line at the X Corps' left. Ridgway shifted the boundary between the two Corps eastward to put both approach and objective in the IX Corps' zone and instructed Corps commander General William M. Hoge to seize the dam. With the reservoir level well below maximum, Ridgway attached no urgency to the seizure; he adjusted the Wyoming Line to include the dam, making it an objective not of Rugged but of Operation Dauntless to follow. As a Dauntless objective, the dam's capture would fall to the 1st Marine Division, scheduled to relieve the 1st Cavalry Division after the latter reached the Kansas Line. General Hoge elected a different course after the 4th Ranger Company joined IX Corps on 7 April. Hoge considered the specially trained company the ideal unit to put the dam gates out of commission. Hoge visualized a raid in which the Rangers would sneak to the dam along the reservoir side of the western peninsula, immobilize the gate machinery with all gates closed, and withdraw, all within two to four hours. Attaching the company to the 1st Cavalry Division, he instructed General Charles D. Palmer to use the Rangers against the dam before the division left the Kansas Line but did not specifically direct or limit the operation to a Ranger raid. Unaware of Hoge's concept of a hit and run attack, General Palmer assigned the mission to Colonel Harris' 7th Cavalry Regiment, then struggling through the rough ground directly below the dam, and instructed Harris to immobilize the sluice gates and occupy the dam area. Harris assigned the mission to his 2nd Battalion, then in reserve, and on 8 April, assembled the battalion with the 4th Ranger Company attached close to the front almost due south of the peninsular approach to the dam. He left detailed planning for later on the assumption that success in achieving the Kansas Line, and thus the dam operation, was some days away. Increasing resistance on 7 and 8 April, did portend a slow advance to the line. In an attempt to accelerate the attack, late on 8 April, General Palmer ordered his two assault regiments to deploy in greater strength the following morning. Obliged to commit the 2nd Battalion, Colonel Harris, with the dam operation in mind, gave the battalion the Kansas Line objectives that would carry it within of the base of the ridge leading to the dam. Although the reservoir was only half full, PVA troops and Korean employees of the dam power plant began opening sluice gates at midnight on the 8th. With the power plant not in operation, they were able to open only four gates fully and raise six slightly. The released water cost had limited impact as General Hoge earlier had warned his forces away from the Pukhan bottomland, but the flow gradually raised the river as much as , forcing the removal of floating bridges above and below Chuncheon and destroying another far downstream before it could be swung into the bank. The only PVA troops below the Pukhan on the morning of the 9th occupied the ridge leading to the dam. Elsewhere, those who had opposed the advance of the 7th and 8th Cavalry Regiments had withdrawn behind the river during the night to avoid being trapped below the flood. The two regiments were able to reach the Kansas Line well before noon. Eager to shut down the dam, General Hoge ordered General Palmer to open the operation immediately. Since Hoge also set the 10th as the date the Marines would relieve the 1st Cavalry Division, Palmer instructed Colonel Harris to try to complete the operation by day's end. Lt. Col. John Callaway, the 2nd Battalion commander, opened a hastily planned attack early in the afternoon. He opened the attack with inevitably reduced fire support since the severely convoluted ground for a distance of below the dam prevented tank and artillery movements. The single road serving the 7th Cavalry, actually no more than a narrow mountain track, branched off Route 29 in the adjoining zone of the 2nd Division to the east, entered the 7th's area near the southwest corner of the reservoir, ran north along the reservoir shore to a point beyond the Kansas Line, then turned west through a small valley at the base of the ridge leading to the dam. Rock outcroppings so confined the track at points that jeeps could barely negotiate it. With the division artillery positions as far north as the terrain allowed, Callaway's objectives were beyond the range of the howitzers. After the PVA opened the sluice gates, division artillerymen managed to get one . howitzer into a position from which it could reach the dam at maximum range. While the howitzer might discourage the PVA from further work on the dam, its fire at extreme range could not effectively support Callaway's attack. The 2nd Battalion advanced with Company F leading the attack to clear the ridge as far as Hill 454, which overlooked the dam. When Company F moved up the ridge, Company E, the battalion reserve, was to occupy Hill 364 at the ridge's southern end. Once Company F occupied Hill 454, the 4th Ranger Company was to move to the dam following the edge of the reservoir, close and immobilize the gates, and occupy high ground on the peninsula east of the dam. Meanwhile, to assist resupply and the displacement of the battalion's heavy weapons, Company G began to clear a segment of the regimental supply road running north along the reservoir and west through the valley at the foot of the approach ridge. After crossing the valley road, Company F stalled under mortar, small arms, and machine gun fire from Hill 364 and from mutually supporting bunkers on heights above the Pukhan to the northwest. A single air strike called down by Colonel Callaway did little to dampen the fire. Though ample cover prevented heavy casualties, Company F remained pinned until dark, then was able to withdraw south of the valley. Although the 1st Cavalry Division was due to leave the line on the 10th, General Hoge and General Palmer wanted another attack made on the dam. Hoge continued to visualize a raid; Palmer was certain that Callaway's battalion could have reached the dam on the 9th if more daylight had been available. Accordingly, while the remainder of the division began to move out of the Corps' zone on the morning of the 10th, the 7th Cavalry remained on line while the 2nd Battalion made a second attempt. Believing that the PVA did not hold the ridge in strength and perhaps had withdrawn as other delaying forces had done in other instances after a single engagement, Colonel Callaway did not change tactics. The narrowness and steep sides of the ridge in any case allowed little room for any other formation or maneuver. Again his lead company, this time Company G, was pinned down by fire from the north and north-west after crossing the road at the base of the ridge. Still without normal artillery support and now denied air support because of mist and lowhanging clouds, Callaway was unable to quiet the fire and continue north. General Palmer and Colonel Harris had expected that the 7th Cavalry, regardless of the outcome of Callaway's second attack, would be relieved by Marines immediately afterward. Harris, in fact, had allowed his 3rd Battalion to start assembling for the move to the rear. General Hoge, however, viewed Callaway's two attempts as halfhearted and ordered a \\"bona fide\\" effort against the dam before the 7th left the line. In ordering a third attempt to be made on the morning of the 11th, General Palmer authorized Colonel Harris to commit his entire regiment if he thought it necessary. Harris planned to launch a stronger effort in the belief that the PVA defense of the dam consisted of mutually supporting positions in the heights immediately northwest of the Pukhan and on the two peninsulas on which the dam abutted and that reaching the dam required simultaneous attacks in all three areas. But he believed that he had neither sufficient supplies, particularly ammunition, nor the time to accumulate them for a full regimental advance. He planned to send a company of the 1st Battalion in a diversionary attack northwest of the Pukhan, to recommit the 2nd Battalion on the western peninsula, and before dawn to dispatch the 4th Ranger Company reinforced with heavy weapons from Company M across the reservoir to attack up the eastern peninsula. He placed the 3rd Battalion on call to reinforce the Rangers or pass through the 2nd Battalion and occupy the dam site, whichever proved the necessary or better course. Two batteries of the 17th Field Artillery Regiment and a . battery of the 1st Marine Division's 4th Field Artillery Battalion were now within range of Harris' objectives, but worsening weather-a mix of rain, sleet, snow, and fog-eliminated air support. Colonel Harris had considered a reservoir crossing operation on the 9th, alerting the 4th Ranger Company to that possibility and setting staff members to getting twenty assault boats from the division's 8th Engineer Combat Battalion. The engineers earlier had acquired amphibious equipment in anticipation of crossing operations at the Pukhan, but before Harris' request reached them they had returned part of the equipment to Chuncheon depots and turned the rest over to the Marines relieving the division on the 10th. Attempts to retrieve equipment and transport it to the reservoir over the poor supply road produced just nine boats and four motors by the time set for the Rangers' crossing. Unable to obtain boat operators and mechanics in time for the operation, Colonel Harris hastily recruited from his own regiment men who had had some experience with motorboats. The Ranger company commander, Capt. Dorsey Anderson, embarked two platoons, artillery and mortar observers, and a machine gun section in the first lift. Concealed by darkness and paddling the boats to maintain silence, the first-wave forces reached the eastern peninsula undetected but were stopped by small arms and machine gun fire when they moved onto high ground above the landing point after daylight. PVA fire striking the following waves of Rangers as they crossed the reservoir in daylight grew heavy enough to force part of the last lift to return to the south shore. Even with the bulk of the company available, Captain Anderson was unable to advance and by midmorning used most of his ammunition in beating off counterattacks. PVA troops meanwhile began moving across the dam from the western peninsula to reinforce those holding up the Rangers. As Anderson's attack bogged down, Colonel Harris ordered the 3rd Battalion to the eastern peninsula. Company I, which had assembled near the Rangers' embarkation point during the night, started across the reservoir about 11:00 (UTC+9) forced by a shortage of boats to cross in increments, slowed to a paddling pace when most of the few outboard motors failed, and harassed by PVA fire, the company was not on the peninsula until midafternoon, and only one platoon by that time had joined the Rangers. Elsewhere, the diversionary attack across the Pukhan ended when intense fire from the northwest blocked all early morning attempts by a Company A patrol to search the still-swollen river for crossing sites. The 2nd Battalion again lost momentum when its lead company, now Company E, stalled at the base of the western ridge under heavy fire from pillboxes above. All attempts to destroy the fortifications with artillery fire failed. With the regiment stopped at every point, General Palmer, while Company I was crossing the reservoir to join the Rangers, authorized Colonel Harris to call off the attack. But Harris, though he no longer expected to occupy the dam area, deferred ending operations out of hope that by reinforcing the attack on the eastern peninsula he might be able to send Anderson's company in a raid to immobilize the dam's sluice gates. Following Company I's drawn-out reservoir crossing, however, Harris realized that the shortage of boats and motors would prevent the remainder of the 3rd Battalion from reaching the peninsula before dark. Fearful of losing the Rangers and Company I to a PVA night attack, he ordered them to withdraw. The PVA made no attempt to follow the Rangers and Company I platoon as they withdrew piecemeal from their high ground positions to join the remainder of Company I on the beach. Bothered only by sporadic fire, the two companies waited for darkness before shuttling forces to the south shore of the reservoir. Completing the return trip after midnight, they moved on to join the remainder of the regiment, which Harris had pulled back to the Kansas Line after ordering the evacuation of the eastern peninsula. As Harris began pulling his forces off the peninsula, General Hoge decided to forego any further separate action against the dam and authorized the relief of the 7th Cavalry by the 1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment on 12 April. Hoge attributed the 7th Cavalry's failure to reach the dam principally to the loss of surprise. Sharing the cause were hasty planning; shortages of equipment, particularly amphibious gear; and lack of normal direct support artillery fire. Certainly the canalized terrain and the strength and fortified position of the defending forces also contributed. In any case, since General Ridgway meanwhile had ordered the opening of Operation Dauntless, Hoge elected to wait until then, when the dam would be an objective of a full IX Corps' advance to the Wyoming Line. The decision would not prove a great gamble. Although the PVA had closed some of the sluice gates late on 10 April, they would not attempt to flood the Pukhan during the course of Operation Dauntless. Aftermath Operations Rugged and Dauntless eastern front map General Ridgway set an opening date for Operation Dauntless late on 9 April, after all but X and ROK III Corps had reached the Kansas Line. While those two Corps continued what had proved a battle more with terrain than with the enemy, I and IX Corps forces were to start toward the Iron Triangle on the 11th. Utah, the initial objective line, arched above Kansas between the Imjin River and the eastern slopes of Kungmang Mountain, its trace resting on the prominent Kumhak, Kwangdok and Paegun mountain masses. The opening phase thus would be primarily an I Corps operation involving attacks by the 3rd, 24th and 25th Divisions while requiring only a short advance by the British 27th Brigade at the left of IX Corps.

He passed the provincial examination of 1550. He was made a judge in Jiujiang afterwards, and became the inspecting censor of Guangdong, director of education of the North Metropolitan Area, and undersecretary in the Grand Court of Judicial Review. By leaving Guangdong, he implemented the \\"fair tax arrangement for the hundred-and-tithing system\\" (junping lijia fa ÂùáÂπ≥ÈáåÁî≤Ê≥ï) there. Later, he was appointed Right Assistant Censor-in-chief, and then Director-General of the Grand Canal (zongli hedao Á∏ΩÁêÜÊ≤≥ÈÅì), but he was obliged to resign and mourn his deceased mother soon. He returned to the position in 1570, and built low dyke (l√ºti Á∏∑Â†§) from Xuzhou to Pizhou, which incurred criticism for hindering the tribute navigation, and he was demoted in the next year. Zhang Juzheng reinstated Pan in 1578.exactly Director-General of the Grand Canal and Director-General of the Grain Tribute had been compacted into one position, knonw as zongli hecao tidu junwu Á∏ΩÁêÜÊ≤≥ÊºïÊèêÁù£ËªçÂãô, prior to his reinstatement, until 1588 During that time he had constructed the Gaojia Dyke (È´òÂÆ∂Â†∞) that made sure that the silt of the Yellow River was cleared by the waters of the Huai River. He was rewarded with the title of Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent and promoted to Minister of Works, then Right Censor-in- Chief and Director of the Grand Canal (zongdu hedao Á∏ΩÁù£Ê≤≥ÈÅì). The Director- General of the Grand Canal since 1572 to 1574, Wan Gong's solution for the Grand Canal and the Yellow River is building dyke to confine and narrow a section of the watercourse, increasing the velocity of the current ensued, the current with higher velocity would carry more silt, so that the watercourse would discharge silt into the sea. Pan endorsed and generalized that, he summarized it in eight characters: \\"Entraining silt with confined current by building dykes\\" (ÁØâÂ†§ÊùüÊ∞¥, ‰ª•Ê∞¥ÊîªÊ≤ô in Chinese). Pan proposed several suggestions towards the emperor of Wanli: # Fill breaches to keep the Yellow River follow its original course # Build dykes to avoid the river burst again # Repair sluices and dams to protect the Grand Canal # Build weirs to consolidate embarkment # Suspend dredging the estuary to reduce expenses # Let the proposal, recovering the defunct course of the Yellow River as a distributary to the sea, lie During the early 1580, Pan became the minister of War in Nanjing, and then the minister of Justice. He request the emperor to relent and forgive Zhang Juzheng's bereaved family, which led him reduced to commoner status in 1584. Some four year later, the emperor permitted the Grand Secretary Shen Shixing to recall Pan. Pan used liukun (Êü≥Ëº•, an equipment, usually more than 20 feet in diameter, and 150 feet long, put rod fascines to form a ring around a trunk draped with turfs to make, such a cylinder rarely be moved even in a rapid flow, supposedly) to plug gaps. Besides, he also argued that dykes should never be built as extremely long and continuous embankments. There were constituent dykes of the system. Dykes alongside of a river (l√ºti) would concentrate the water, parallel dams to these (yaoti ÈÅ•Â†§) would help in case the inner dams break, and transverse dams (geti Ê†ºÂ†§) would enable silt to deposit. Later, he put forward that reinforcing the dykes with silt gathered in depressions, by diverting floods, and using silt levees to replace lower l√ºti, also. However, his practice impeded the drainage of the Huai River and extended Hongze Lake, the city of Sizhou was submerged and the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum was threatened in the ensuing days. Thus he was censured and forced to resign soon after Shen's removal.

Facts Brennan and others, who were employed at the Corning Glass Works, claimed unlawful discrimination because men worked on night shifts and were paid more, while women were only allowed to work on day shifts and were paid less. The employer argued that there was no unequal pay, because the jobs were different: the time of day when work was performed should be considered when determining if ‚Äòworking conditions‚Äô were sufficiently similar. They argued this was a legitimate defense, that pay differences result from a seniority or merit system unrelated to sex under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 USC ¬ß206(d)(1). Judgment The Supreme Court held that although women plaintiffs worked at different times in the day, compared to male colleagues, the working conditions were \\"sufficiently similar\\" and the claim was allowed. ‚ÄòWorking conditions‚Äô means both ‚Äòsurroundings‚Äô and ‚Äòhazards‚Äô.

The film was written and directed by Kip Oebanda based on true events, with Glaiza de Castro playing the film's titular lead. The film was released on August 3, 2018, as part of the 14th Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival, where it received a special jury commendation and the audience choice award in the full-length feature film category. During its run, the film was noted for eliciting strong emotional responses from its audiences. During its Cinemalaya screenings, filmgoers often spontaneously applauded the film during the end credits. In some instances, viewers chanted protest songs which were used in the film that originated during the Marcos era. Along with Benedict Mique's ML, it was one of the two Cinemalaya 2018 films about the martial law, continuing the tradition of 2017's Respeto in light of the 2016 Burial of Ferdinand Marcos and the prominence of his wife Imelda Marcos and his children, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Imee Marcos, in Philippine politics.  Plot  Based on a true story and set in the waning days of the Marcos dictatorship, Liway is told from the point of view of Dakip, a boy living in a prison camp housing both criminals and members of the New People's Army. Even as conditions in the camp become progressively more difficult, his mother tries her best to shield him from the trauma of a political prisoner's life and to give him a normal life, telling him stories based on Philippine mythology. One of these stories is about Liway, the gurardian diwata of Mount Kanlaon, a fictionalized version of her own story in the resistance against the Marcos dictatorship. As the dictatorship becomes more unstable and their lives become more uncertain, Dakip's mother has to weigh his best interests against the prospect of never seeing each other again.  Cast  = Main Cast = * Kenken Nuyad plays the film's Point-of-View character - Dakip \\"Kip\\" Oebanda, the film's director, when he was a child. * Glaiza de Castro plays Ma. Cecilia Flores-Oebanda, better known as Commander Liway, and nicknamed \\"Day\\" (a vernacular endearment meaning \\"lady\\" or \\"miss\\") throughout the film. * Dominic Roco plays Ric, Day's husband and Kip's father - better known as Commander Toto. * Soliman Cruz plays the Warden of the prison in which the Oebandas are held * Sue Prado plays Pinang another dissident in imprisoned with the Oebandas =Other cast members= * Joel Sargo * Paolul O‚ÄôHarina * Ubong Joson * Nico Antonio * Gerry Corneto * Piana Alperez * Julie Batista * Don Benitoz * Liway Sabong * Sha Malala * Renante Bustamante * Madeleine Colas * Don Perding * Dengman * Boy Golden * Ben Tambling = Casting process = In a Reddit AMA before the release of the film, Kip Oebanda said that he sought out De Castro for the role not knowing whether he would be lucky enough to get such a high-profile actress. Describing why he specifically thought De Castro was suited to the role, he remarked: \\" ...She has both the vulnerability and strength required by the character. Someone who is gentle and kind but is handed a very difficult lot in life, and found strength and hope. I wanted to have an empowered and empowering female character, which is what Commander Liway is in real life. And Glaiza manages that perfectly.\\"  Writing  Director Kip Oebanda says that Liway took seven months to write, made more difficult because so much of the story was personal to him. In order to make sure the story was \\"more universal\\" and less specific to the perspective of just one person, he worked with co-writer Zig Dulay, who could be more detached from all the emotions Oebanda associated with the story. Oebanda was aware that the events of the film would be perceived as politically sensitive, because the adult protagonists of the story were part of the New People's Army. In an interview with CNN Philippines, he remarked: > ‚ÄúSome of the people from the left are asking me, ‚ÄòIs this about the > struggle? Is it about the NPA?‚Äô In parts it is, but that is a context of > where this family came from more than it [is] the actual story... It's > really just, how do you find and keep yourself resilient and hopeful even in > a situation when you're in prison with your child?‚Äù In an interview with the Manila Bulletin he recounted that the response a Facebook post he shared in response to the 2016 Burial of Ferdinand Marcos at the Philippines' Libingan ng mga Bayani (Cemetery of heroes) helped convince him of the need to tell the story of his childhood: > ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt judge any political figure, I did not praise or insult anyone in > politics, I didn‚Äôt pin the blame on anyone, I just said ‚Äòthese are the > facts, this is what happened.‚Äô It got massively shared, and what surprised > me was, no one bashed me for it, I didn‚Äôt get trolled or hated, not even by > those who do not necessarily agree with my political leanings. And so I > thought maybe this is the way to start the discourse with people who don‚Äôt > necessarily subscribe to your political views: Just give them facts, give > them the stories of what really happened. Even some people who supported the > regime were okay with it. They were willing to listen.‚Äù  Production  Shooting for the film proved physically demanding, especially flashback scenes which depicted the capture of Commander Liway and Commander Toto, before their days in prison. These scenes were shot in the jungle, and necessitated De Castro rushing to and fro between the set of Liway and the set of a Television series she was doing at the same time. The actors, particularly De Castro, were originally apprehensive about inhabiting their roles, because the people they were portraying were real people who were still alive. In order to make the actors more comfortable, Oebanda had to arrange for the actors to meet the actual people they were portraying. For De Castro, this meant a very emotional discussion with Oebanda's mother - Commander Liway herself.  Music  De Castro, who is also an indie music artist, also performed a cover of Philippine folk group Asin's song ‚ÄúHimig ng Pag-ibig‚Äù as part of the film and its promotion. She had to learn and record the song in one day because the director wanted the performance to have \\"raw, unpracticed emotion.\\"  Reception  = Audience reception = Public reaction to the film was strong, with audiences spontaneously applausing the film after screenings, and at least one screening erupting in various revolutionary chants which were used in the film, but still used in contemporary protests, such as: \\"Ang tao, ang bayan! Ngayon ay lumalaban!\\" (The people, the country! Are now fighting back!); and \\"Huwag matakot! Makibaka!\\" (Don't be fearful! Join the struggle!) In a tweet on August 4, 2018, the film's director reported: > \\"The cinema in Trinoma showing Liway erupted in spontaneous chants led by a > guy at the back as the credits rolled: \\"Ang tao ang bayan!\\" then the > audience answered \\"Ngayon ay Lumalaban!\\" \\"Huwag matakot! Makibaka!\\" It was a > surreal experience. \\" = Critical response = Critical reviews of the film were quick to praise how the film humanized the events of the Marcos Dictatorship era, and note its relevance in contemporary Philippine life. Heinrich Domingo of Cinetactic noted: > \\"Liway is an important work of cinema, especially in these trying times. As > the Marcos family and their cohorts spend millions to brainwash the general > public, the film‚Äôs director uses his personal narrative to tell a counter- > story. Liway is an inspiration to fight back. It calls for resistance.\\" Rappler film critic Oggs Cruz said: \\"Kip Oebanda‚Äôs Liway is not just an elegant and rousing tribute of a son to his mother, it is also a testament to the importance of telling stories.\\" He particularly praised the film's choice to focus on Dakip's point of view: > [Dakip']s concept of the world is limited to the curious mix of guards, > criminals and rebels he interacts with and the stories they tell. Oebanda > doesn‚Äôt waste resources in highlighting the pleasure and delight Dakip > exudes in every story he hears, with the film employing the simple spectacle > of shadow puppets to convey childlike wonder to the audience. The film > slowly but surely creeps towards more pertinent territories when the child > becomes aware of the world beyond the prison, and the stories morphing from > fables and fairy tales to very real experiences of strife, suffering and > struggle. Cruz compares the film to Oebanda's previous films Tumbang Preso (2014), Bar Boys (2017), and Nay (2017), saying that: > This time, there is a certain ease in the storytelling. It is as if the film > is unburdened by a need to veil itself with unnecessary metaphors or > trappings of sophistication. It is also sourced from a more personal space. > It is perhaps because the narrative is structured much simpler, with the > tall tales and the flashbacks occupying the same space as stories being told > by character to character instead of being an arbitrary and convenient > device. It helps that there is a softness to the visuals, a preference in > depicting not the glaring atrocities of the times but the enduring humanity > in the midst of all the suffering.

It is named after Carl Friedrich von Siemens and was founded in 1958 by Ernst von Siemens. Its Managing Director is currently Heinrich Meier. Since 1960, it has been running extensive scientific programs, awarding fellowships to outstanding scientists and scholars, and supporting university libraries in Germany with more than 60 million euros for the acquisition of scientific literature. Logo of Carl Friedrich von Siemens Stiftung History Ernst von Siemens, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG from 1956 to 1971, established the Foundation from his private assets. It bears the name of his father Carl Friedrich von Siemens, who was also Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Group between 1919 and 1941. From 1964 the foundation's managing director was the publicist Armin Mohler, and in 1985 Heinrich Meier succeeded Mohler. =The foundation under Armin Mohler 1964-1985= Mohler used the foundation mainly for political events. An example of this is a famos series on Carl Schmitt organized by Mohler in 1978. The lectures were then published by Propyl√§en-Verlag under the title Der Ernstfall as the second volume in the Foundation's series of publications, even though Schmitt was academically and journalistically isolated because of his commitment to the Third Reich. Speakers were Among others Knut Borchardt, Paul Carell, Hellmut Diwald and Christian Meier. The series was understood as a tribute to Schmitt. Other publications of the foundations also dealt with persons or topics related to the New Right. In 1980, the historian Ernst Nolte gave a lecture at the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Foundation entitled Zwischen Geschichtslegende und Revisionismus (Between Historical Legend and Revisionism), which the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published, thus triggering the Historikerstreit, the so called historians' dispute. =The foundation under Heinrich Meier from 1985= Today the foundation has the following priorities: * To organize scientific, interdisciplinary lecture series by individual speakers and to publish them. Some speakers who have given lectures at the Foundation includes Jan Assmann, Ernst-Wolfgang B√∂ckenf√∂rde, Jean Bollack, J. M. Coetzee, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Philippe Descola, Louis Dumont, Ronald Dworkin, √Ågnes Heller, Paul Kirchhof, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, Peter von Matt, Ernst Mayr, Ilya Prigogine, Martin Rees, Karl Schl√∂gel, Wolf Singer, Andreas Urs Sommer and Helen Vendler. Some of the lectures are published in the series Themen der Carl Friedrich von Siemens Stiftung (since 1985 more than 40 volumes have been published). * To award the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Fellowships to outstanding scientists (since 1993). These fellowships support the completion of research by outstanding scientists. * To support the supplement of scientific literature, which includes the supply of university libraries. * To organize guest events, scientific conferences and international symposia. Special emphasis is placed on promoting contact between German and foreign scientists. Critique Numerous experts on right-wing extremism, such as Peter Glotz consider the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Foundation under the management of Armin Mohlers to be a think tank of the New Right and assign the foundation to the New Right.

To understand why column level encryption is different from other encryption methods like file level encryption, disk encryption, and database encryption, a basic understanding of encryption is required. Generally, when data are being collected and stored as records, those records will appear in a tabular format in rows in the database with each rows logging specific attributes. Some data can be more sensitive than others, for example, data of birth, social security number, home address, etc., which can act as a personal identification. In order to ensure that these private information is transferred and stored securely, data goes through encryption, which is the process of encoding plaintext into ciphertext. Non-designated readers or receivers will not be able to read the data without the decryption key. Another example to illustrate this concept is, given a database stores client's phone numbers. The set of phone numbers will appear to most readers as gibberish alphanumerical text with a mix of symbols, totally useless to those who do not have access privilege to view the data in plaintext (original form). Because not all stored data are always sensitive and important, column level encryption was created to allow users the flexibility in choosing what sort of attributes should or should not be encrypted. This is to minimum performance disruption when executing crypto algorithms by moving data in and out of devices. Application and advantages The technology has been adopted by many encryption software companies around the world, including IBM, MyDiamo (Penta Security), Oracle and more. Column level encryption does not store the same encryption key like table encryption does but rather separate keys for each column. This method minimizes the probability of unauthorized access. =Advantages of column- level encryption= Advantages of column-level encryption: * Flexibility in data to encrypt. The application can be written to control when, where, by whom, and how data is viewed * Transparent encryption is possible * More secure as each column can have its own unique encryption key within the database * Encryption is possible when data is active and not just ‚Äúat rest‚Äù * Retrieval speed is maintained because there's less encrypted data References Category:Cryptographic software ","title":"Column level encryption"},{"id":"58027285","text":"Babul Ka Angna () is a Pakistani television soap opera which aired on Geo Entertainment.

History  The Walkerville Football Club was officially founded in 1901 but before then there have been previous Walkerville-based clubs. On 19 April 1876, there was a meeting to start a proposed Walkerville Football Club, and there was a Walkerville club that played at Gilberton in 1883. But the current club was founded in 1901 and took the field in 1902. The club played in the parkland area opposite the Buckingham Arms Hotel and wore red and white colours, playing on an oval located northwest to a field used by the North Adelaide Lacrosse Club. In 1911, the club recruited more men to play for them from the Walkerville Methodist Club, around the time when the club relocated its home ground to 'Pockers Paddock', a ground located on Smith Street, Walkerville. Known as Walkerville United, in 1912, the undefeated club was scheduled to play a match against West Adelaide in the South Australian National Football League but the game was never played. The North Adelaide District Football Association was founded in 1921 where Walkerville was a founding member and went to win three of its first five premierships and remained in the North Adelaide association until it joined the South Australian Amateur Football League in 1936. Walkerville won the Division 2 flag against Eastwood and won another in 1940. The club's first Division 1 flag was against Exeter in 1950, winning by 3 points. A second Division 1 flag followed in 1953 after minor premiers University lost to Exeter in their first semi final and played Walkerville who had beaten Exeter in the initial decider. The game was played at Alberton Oval and Walkerville won by 8 points. In 1955, the club changed to a new guernsey with royal blue and white hoops from a chocolate and blue guernsey and won a 1966 Division 5 flag prior to new clubrooms being built three years later, in 1969. The 1978 season saw the club relocate to Park 11 (Graduates Oval) in North Adelaide. The club amalgamated with North Adelaide Reserves in 1979 and joined the South Australian Football Association (SAFA) in 1980. The 1990 move back to the SAAFL saw the Cats a very successful era with three A-Grade premierships in 1990 (D6), 1992 (D4), and 1999 (D3), along with a C-Grade premiership and 6 reserves premierships before the club changed its guernsey again to the current navy blue and white hoops in 1998.

Later she became a civil servant, working in a government mail censorship office. She also became an anti-government activist. She was arrested, convicted and sentenced. On 24 May 1944 she was executed by guillotine at the Regional Criminal Court in Vienna.  Biography  Anna Wala was born in Vienna. After leaving school she worked till 1932 as a fashion model, demonstrating clothes for a succession of garment manufacturers. She entered government service in 1940, working in a branch of the censorship office that specialised in foreign mail. She was politically engaged from a young age. She joined the Social Democratic Workers' Party (as it was known at that time) in 1915 and was also a member of the Gewerkschaft der Privatangestellten, a trades union for private sector workers. After the 1932 General Election there was a transition to one-party government and the Social Democratic Workers' Party was crushed. Further dramatic political change arrived in March 1938 when Austrian was invaded. The invasion met with little resistance, and it led to the integration of Austria into an enlarged Nazi German state. Sources are largely silent about Anna Wala's political involvement during the 1930s, but it is known that from 1939 she was involved as an activist with the Young Communists, which had been the focus of increasingly aggressive government repression since 1934. Anna Wala made her apartment in Vienna 9 available for (by definition illegal) political meetings and for the storage of (illegal) literature. She donated money to \\"Red Aid\\", a workers' welfare organisation widely seen - especially by political enemies - as a branch of the Communist Party. In 1942 she joined an opposition group known as the Soldiers' Council Group. The group engaged in the distribution of \\"illegal [political] literature\\" and a \\"Soldiers' Letters\\" mass-mailing operation, sending letters to soldiers on the frontline urging political opposition and desertion from the army. Anna Wala was arrested on 25 May 1943. She was charged at the special People's Court in Berlin with \\"Preparing high treason and supporting the enemy\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat und Feindbeg√ºnstigung\\") on 23 September 1943. Her co-accused were Alfred Rabofsky, Ernestine Diwisch Sophie Vitek, Ernestine Soucek and Friedrich Muzyka. Anna Wala's charge sheet included the accusation that she had had close relationships with Jews (\\"... engere Beziehungen zu Juden\\"). On 8 February 1944 the court sentenced her to death and to lifelong dishonour (\\"Ehrverlust auf Lebensdauer\\"). Two of her co-accused were also sentenced to death. Of the other two, Sophie Vitek's death sentence was subsequently reduced to a fifteen year jail term (thanks to a personal intervention by her brother with Heinrich Himmler) and Ernestine Soucek ended up with an eight year jail term. Anna Wala, Ernestine Diwisch and Friedrich Muzyka were executed on 24 May 1944 at the Vienna Regional Criminal Court, where a guillotine had been installed back in 1934 in the aftermath of the so-called July Putsch.

It was designed by and built by members of the Higgins family between 1879 and 1931 with the assistance of monumental masons. It is also known as Higgin's Family Cemetery, Old Mans Valley Cemetery and Higgins Family Cemetery. The property is owned by Hornsby Shire Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006.  History  =Indigenous history= Old Man's Valley is associated with an Aboriginal family story in a recent history book by Peter Read, Haunted Earth. Read describes taking Dennis Foley, an Aboriginal man whose traditional land is to the east of Hornsby, to Old Man's Valley: =European occupation of Old Man's Valley= Ann Elizabeth Harrington headstone Albert E. Higgins headstone The family that established the cemetery are descendants of Second Fleet transportees, Thomas Edward Higgins and Eleanor McDonald. Eleanor's first husband, First Fleet convict David Killpack, was granted in the Field of Mars district (modern Carlingford). Eleanor and David were the first free settlers within the present day boundaries of Hornsby Shire Council. Following David's death in 1798, Eleanor sold part of the land but continued to farm some 30 acres of it in her own right. In 1799, she married Thomas Higgins, their son, Thomas Edward II being born in 1800. Thomas and Eleanor remained on their farm until their deaths in 1828 and 1835 respectively. Thomas Edward II was made a district constable for the Field of Mars district and in 1823 was promised a grant of land that included a relatively fertile valley west of the ridge now occupied by the Hornsby shopping centre. He is thought to have named the grant Old Man's Valley. In taking up the grant, Thomas Edward II became the first settler in the Hornsby area. After his death, ownership of the land passed to his son, Thomas Edward III whose large family formed the basis of the community that was established in the valley. It is believed that Thomas Edward III established the cemetery when his youngest son, Harrold died. It is further believed that the cemetery was consecrated as an Anglican burial site when Thomas himself was interred there in 1885. However the Anglican Diocese of Sydney has no record of this consecration, although it is acknowledged that a local consecration may have taken place and the local records lost. The earliest dated inscription in the cemetery records the death of Ann Elizabeth Harrington (daughter of Ann and Matthew Harrington) who died aged 14 months in 1871. Ann was not, however, buried in the cemetery, but within the orchards on the Harrington property and the inscribed stone is a memorial rather than a grave marker. In the period of its use from 1879 to 1931, 25 persons are known to have been interred there and it reliably recalled that a family midwife, Ann Harrington, buried some still-born and other non-surviving babies within the confines of the cemetery. It is also believed by family members that the cemetery was used for the burial of stillborn babies and other infants in unmarked graves near the east boundary. The establishment and use of the cemetery appears to be a direct response to the isolation of the valley and the difficulties of transporting the dead to the existing formal burial grounds, as well as a reflection of the strong connection between the Higgins family and the valley. In the early 20th century, matters concerning the burial of the dead were increasingly regulated with the passing of the Public Health Act 1902, and in sections of the Local Government Act 1919. Mrs. Dorothy Jansson remembers applying for special permission to enable the burial of Loretta Jansson in 1931, which was granted because of the economic hardship of the Depression. Thomas Higgins IV also wished to be buried in the cemetery but this was prevented by legal requirements. With the advent of the motorised funeral which became increasingly common from the 1930s, the conveyance of the dead became easier. In addition, new cemeteries supplemented the existing burial grounds available to the residents of the North Shore.Parsons Brickerhoff, 2004, p162 By the late 1960s, the last of the Higgins family left the valley, and the last standing residence, the house erected on the site of the original homestead built by Thomas Edward Higgins II, and residence of Thomas III and Ann Elizabeth Rhodes/Pollard, was demolished. This house was last occupied by Percy Higgins (tenth child of Thomas III and Ann), his wife, Clifton Forrest, and later their daughter Freda and her husband, Mr. Jones. A monument dedicated to the pioneering Higgins family was erected by Farley and Lewers on the site of the house in 1970.Parsons Brickerhoff, 2004, p165 =Deterioration of the Cemetery= The appearance of the cemetery in the early twentieth century is shown in surviving photographs taken . During this time the cemetery was enclosed by a morticed and tenoned, timber post and two railed, split-paling fence which defined and separated it from the surrounding area. A cleared fire-break was maintained around the cemetery area. Early photographs show that the family plots were extensively planted with both introduced and native species including alyssum, violets, lilies, daisies, climbing roses and bracken fern. Later photographs (c. 1960s to 1980s) also show the presence of snowdrops, belladonna lilies, watsonias and ornamental oxalis. By the late 1920s to early 1930s, the original timber fence had been replaced by fencing of timber posts with wire strands. At this time, access to the cemetery was through a gate positioned in the southwest corner. The boundary of the cemetery was further maintained by the presence of a clipped privet hedge which was maintained by Norman Higgins. After the 1930s, the Higgins family cemetery was no longer used for the burial of family members; however it appears that it was sporadically maintained by family members still living in the valley. During the late 1950s to early 1960s, the cemetery suffered a series of attacks by vandals. The railings and corner posts of many grave surrounds were broken or dislodged and the upper sections of many headstones were broken. Photographs taken in the mid 1960s show the cemetery in a state of neglect and decay and several additional damaged and overturned cemetery monuments are evident. Another major attack by vandals which resulted in additional destruction of monuments and increased scattering of fragments away from their original locations was reported in The Advocate in 1969. It appears that a timber post and wire fence which remained extant until the early twenty-first century was erected at this time. =Rock mining in Old Man's Valley= In , blue metal began to be quarried from the Old Mans Valley. It was hauled out by horse and dray, two draught horses being used in tandem for the steep climb up the escarpment. Once the ridge had been reached, one of the horses was unhitched and tethered in the shade whilst the other delivered the load. By the 1920s, the quarry was in full production and operating on a commercial scale. Hornsby Shire Council acquired the lease to operate a quarry from the then land owner during this time. Four years later, Hornsby Road Metal Limited acquired the lease of the quarry, which they held for more than ten years. When Hornsby Road Metal Ltd first took over the lease of the quarry, crushed blue metal was being hauled to the ride in skips on a narrow railway line. As production increased, a continuous chain of buckets was installed to deliver crushed rock to the screening plant, above the valley floor. During the 1930s, bushland walks were apparently created around the quarry as part of unemployment relief. The quarry operations were temporarily closed down during World War II, and work did not recommence until the 1950s. In 1954, the Council sub-leased the quarry. The lessee worked the quarry until 1959 and production increased dramatically during this time. In 1959, Hornsby Blue Metal Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Farley & Lewers Ltd, acquired the quarry and Council lease. Farley & Lewers commenced management of the present quarry operation and acquired several of the original Higgins family properties. Farley & Lewers was subsequently taken over by CSR Ltd and incorporated within the Readymix Group. CSR Readymix continued to operate the quarry until its recent acquisition by Council. Products produced by the quarry included road base and aggregates.Parsons Brickerhoff, 2004, 165-166. =Acquisition by Hornsby Council= In recent years, the quarry became increasingly unviable due to the poor quality of extracted material and the then owners, CSR Ltd, explored opportunities to fill the site with either waste or virgin excavated material, or rezone areas of the side for medium density residential development. Neither of these proposed options was undertaken and CSR Ltd subsequently served notice on Council to acquire the site on 22 March 2001. In accordance with Council's obligations under the HSLEP, and the statutory processes required under the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act, Council obtained the approval of the Minister for Local Government on 9 May 2002 to acquire the quarry site and the adjacent lands.Parsons Brickerhoff, 2004, p166 The final transfer of title was formalised on 31 May 2006. =Higgins family conservation of the cemetery= In 1992, a Conservation Plan was prepared by Godden Mackay Logan and a cemetery restoration project commenced. The work proceeded under the guidance of archaeologist, Siobhan Lavelle who supervised volunteer workers from the Higgins family and friends. A stonemason was engaged for the skilled restoration of graves and monuments with family members restoring metal fencing around the graves. A security fence was erected to protect the work and a silt trap and site drainage works were completed to protect the site from damage due to run off. The project was completed in March 1994. One of the objectives of the Conservation Plan was to provide education resources. These resources comprised the erection of an interpretive sign on the site of the cemetery and the preparation of an educational brochure. The conservation work was supported by a grant from the New South Wales Government on the recommendation of the Heritage Council of New South Wales. Thus the preparation of the conservation plan was funded by the NSW Heritage Council, the first such example of public funding for conservation works in a private cemetery. Financial contributions were also made by the National Trust of Australia and descendants of Thomas and Eleanor Higgins. Assistance in kind was provided by the Council of the Sihire of Hornsby and CSR Pty Ltd (former owners of the land). As part of its Heritage Week Celebrations since 1998 Hornsby Council has promoted Open Days and guided bushwalks in Old Man's Valley, including a tour of the Old Man's Valley Cemetery. A Guide to Berowra Valley Regional Park (BVRP) was published in 2001 by Friends of BVRP, a subcommittee of the Bushland Management Advisory Committee formed under the auspices of Hornsby Shire Council. The Guide contains a discussion on Old Man's Valley and the Higgins Family Cemetery. Hornsby Council Library distributed copies of Memories of Old Man's Valley, a private publication prepared by Ted Angelo in 1999, which references the Old Man's Valley Cemetery. Rangers and descendants of the Higgins family also carry out regular educational discovery activities to the Old Man's Valley Cemetery on behalf of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. These guided walks provide an opportunity for local and interstate visitors including culturally diverse groups to experience a social and historic connection with earliest European settlement. The cemetery has thus become the focus of considerable heritage interest. This galvanisation of institutional and community resources provides an exemplar for the conservation of other family cemeteries in NSW. Timeline for southern Old Man's Valley The following timeline covers the southern Old Man's Valley:From Parsons Brickerhoff, 2004, p11-12 *Pre-EuropeanAboriginal people of the Dharug, Kuringai and Darkingung language groups lived in the Hornsby area *1820Study area settled by Higgins family, who were the first Europeans to permanently live in the Hornsby area. Thomas Edward Higgins was promised a land grant of 250 acres by Governor Brisbane in 1823 with the land grant formally recorded in 1836 by Governor Bourke. *1830s-1880sHiggins cleared 35 acres and cultivated it for orchard and market garden production. Thomas Higgins died in 1885 and was buried in what is now the family cemetery. *Late 1880sPart of Higgins land was sold and then subdivided. The remainder continued to be used for farming, orcharding and market gardening by relatives of Thomas Higgins. *Early 1900sMining operations commenced and the quarry was opened as a hard rock quarry. Blue metal was quarried and carried out of the quarry by horse and cart. *1920sBy 1924 the quarry was in full production and operating at a commercial scale by Hornsby Road Metal Ltd. Later, Hornsby Council acquired a lease to operate the quarry. *1930s-1950sQuarry worked irregularly by Council. *1951Study area zoned Green Belt under County of Cumberland Planning Scheme. *1954-1959Council sub-leased the quarry and lessee mined the quarry intensively and increased production. *1959Hornsby Blue Metal Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Farley & Lewers acquired the quarry and Council lease.

Description  The Old Man's Valley Cemetery is bounded by cyclone fencing and is largely camouflaged by surrounding thick vegetation growth. The Cemetery rises steeply from the east to west and overburden from quarry activities has been piled adjacent to the southern and western boundaries of the Cemetery. The Cemetery contains at least twenty three known burials, however, only fifteen marked gravestones, and five marked but unidentified graves remain visible. When it was established during the 1880s, the Old Man's Valley Cemetery was apparently set out as a square area, its probable dimensions approximately by . The wire security fence now enclosing the area is set back from the original boundary a distance of . The earliest graves in the cemetery were arranged in east facing rows, a traditional orientation. As the number of burials in the cemetery increased during the early 20th century, it seems that a number of conscious decisions were made regarding planning and layout. The cemetery gradually became more formalised with distinct groupings of graves for each branch of the family. The McKenzie family plots occupied the southeast corner, the Jansson family plots occupied the northwest corner, the Higgins' family plots occupied the centre and western area and the unmarked infants' graves were placed along the eastern boundary towards the northeast corner. The earliest headstones in the cemetery are of sandstone, but the majority of the monuments are marble headstones. Remnants of other grave furniture is also extant, including iron fences with hooped railings, sandstone kerbing and quite elaborate grave surrounds formed by \\"barley twist\\" pattern cast iron railings. These are affixed to small stone corner posts and additional borders are formed by white-painted bricks placed diagonally in the ground to give edging with a zig-zag profile. The graves are linked by paths and informal gardens comprising native shrubs as well as species representing some of the exotics used as grave plantings by the families (e.g., alyssum (Lobularia maritima), violets (Viola odorata), lilies (Lilium spp.) and freesias (Freesia spp./cv.s). The cemetery is enclosed in remnant native forest including Eucalypt and Angophora species mixed with introduced species such as privet (Ligustrum spp.) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). The mature remnant native trees presently on the site suggest that some native species were deliberately retained within the cemetery area. The vegetation provides an attractive setting and screens the cemetery from the nearby quarry and the surrounding residential areas, thus preserving its serenity. Interpretative signage outlining the history of the cemetery and identifying the graves is located by the double gate that provides the only access to the site in the north eastern corner. The cemetery has been maintained by family descendants since , who have revealed plot edgings and some hitherto unknown stones. = Condition = The cemetery suffered several incidents of vandalism during the mid-twentieth century, during which the railings and corner posts of many grave surrounds were broken or dislodged and the upper sections of many headstones were broken and scattered. As a result of extensive, professionally directed conservation work conducted in 1992-94 and regular on- going maintenance since then, the cemetery has been largely restored to its original state. While some of the monuments cannot be fully restored, most are in very good condition. The design and layout of the cemetery have been accurately preserved. The legibility of some of the inscriptions is deteriorating because of weathering, but where appropriate, inscriptions have been recorded on mental plaques placed near their respective monuments. The cemetery is now in sound condition, with the continued maintenance and visitation of local family members ensuring its preservation. The cemetery was restored in 1992 under the supervision of a professional conservator (Siobahn Lavelle/Godden McKay Pty Ltd). Standard conservation procedures were followed, including the use of photographic and other documentary evidence. The cemetery has been systematically and regularly maintained since that time. = Modifications and dates = Photographs and the surviving physical evidence on the site, indicate that the monumental masonry erected in the cemetery was of fairly standard types and designs. The earlier headstones in the cemetery were of sandstone, but a majority of the monuments were marble headstones. The most elaborate monument in the cemetery was a sculptured angel figure on the pedestal on the grave of Spencer E. Higgins, 1897 - this monument has not survived. The early twentieth century photographs also show the presence of other grave furniture in the cemetery including quite elaborate grave surrounds formed by \\"barley twist\\" pattern cast iron railings affixed to small stone corner posts and additional borders formed by white-painted bricks placed diagonally in the ground to give edging with a zig-zag profile. Only a few remnants of these features now survive. The other surrounds used in the cemetery were either iron fences with hooped railings of which several examples survive, or simple sandstone kerbing. The original wooden fence and privet hedge that marked the original boundary have virtually disappeared. In 1992, a Conservation Plan was prepared and a cemetery restoration project commenced under the supervision of an archaeologist and with the help of a stonemason and the volunteer labour of Higgins family members. A security fence was erected to protect the work and a silt trap and site drainage works were completed. An interpretive sign on the site of the cemetery was also erected.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 21 December 2006, the Old Man's Valley Cemetery was of State significance for its rarity as one of the few fully conserved family cemeteries in New South Wales and possibly the only one. It is also of State significance for the social value that this high state of conservation represents - firstly to a wide array of Higgins family descendants (now living all over Australia) who have funded its conservation over many years, accessing both professional advice and their own labour. Its social significance to the wider community is also demonstrated by its role as a heritage destination by visitors, cemetery enthusiasts and educational institutions. Acquired by Hornsby Shire Council in 2006, it provides an exemplary model of how a family cemetery may be conserved and valued. Sited in Old Man's Valley, which was first agricultural land then a bluestone quarry (recently decommissioned), the cemetery is associated with the economic development of the locality and also has high local historical significance for its graves memorialising the descendants of Hornsby's earliest European settler family, Thomas Edward Higgins, son of Thomas Higgins and his wife Eleanor McDonald. Containing twenty-three known burials with interments dating from 1879 to 1931, its dates are unusually late for a private cemetery. Its establishment and use appears to have been a direct response to the isolation of Old Man's Valley and the difficulties of transporting the dead to established communal burial grounds. It is also of high local significance for its representative examples of late nineteenth and early twentieth century monumental masonry, providing a good record of the designs, inscriptions, motifs indicative of funerary symbolism and practices used in a modest family cemetery in NSW at that time. The cemetery also has high representative significance at a local level for its landscape setting amid both remnant natural vegetation and traditional European grave plantings. Old Man's Valley Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Old Man's Valley Cemetery is of state significance for demonstrating the earliest application of professional conservation techniques and management methods to a small private cemetery in NSW. It has since provided an exemplar for the proper conservation and protection of cemeteries generally, and small isolated cemeteries in particular, undertaken in accordance with the first publicly funded conservation plan prepared for a private cemetery in NSW. Sited in \\"Old Man's Valley\\", which was first agricultural land then a bluestone quarry (recently decommissioned), the cemetery is not only associated with the economic development of the locality but has local historical significance for its evidence of the settlement and occupation of the Old Man's Valley by a pioneering settler family. The cemetery is now the major surviving physical evidence in the valley of almost 150 years of occupation by the Higgins family. An unusually late private cemetery with interments dating from 1879 to 1931, its establishment and use appears to have been a direct response to the isolation of Old Man's Valley and the difficulties of transporting the dead to established communal burial grounds. The ages of those buried (more than one third of whom did not reach maturity) attest to the hardships of pioneer life. The Old Man's Valley cemetery serves as a distinctive reminder of the part that early convict settlers and their descendants played in the social, cultural and economic development of NSW. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Containing twenty-three known burials, the Higgins Family Cemetery is of local significance for its associations with the Higgins family, a pioneering settler family of the Hornsby Shire [other families?] who occupied the Old Man's Valley continuously from the 1830s to 1970. The cemetery contains the burial site of the grandson of the original settlers - Second Fleet convicts Thomas Edward Higgins and his wife Eleanor McDonald - and also records the continuing presence of the descendants of these pioneer settlers in the Old Man's Valley. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The cemetery is of local significance for its representative examples of late nineteenth and early twentieth century monumental masonry, providing a good record of the designs, inscriptions, motifs indicative of funerary symbolism and practices used in a modest family cemetery in NSW at that time. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Old Man's Valley Cemetery is of State significance for its social value as one of the most carefully conserved family cemeteries in NSW. Its considerable social significance to a wide array of Higgins family descendants (now living all over Australia) is evidenced by their work in funding its conservation over many years, accessing both professional advice and their own labour. More than 200 descendants gathered at the cemetery in 1990 to celebrate the bicentenary of Thomas Edward Higgins and Eleanor McDonald's arrival in Australia. Several Higgins family descendants continue to reside in the Hornsby district and conduct working- bees at the cemetery every three months which also serve as family reunions. The cemetery has also been a focus of wider community interest for some years, and is a focus of local heritage tours by visitors and educational institutions. It provides a sense of historic continuity and contributes to the community's sense of identity. It is of State significance as an exemplary example of how a small, isolated site of historical significance may be conserved and valued. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Old Man's Valley Cemetery has local significance for its research potential to understand the living conditions, circumstances, values and genealogy of a pioneer family. The cemetery is an important genealogical resource, recording many individuals from the network of European families that inhabited in the valley. The conservation project of the 1990s also provides an example of community organisation of resources as well as conservation techniques applied to a small-scale family cemetery that may be measured over time for their effectiveness. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Old Man's Valley Cemetery is of State significance as one of the few fully conserved family cemeteries in New South Wales. It is of local significance for its rarity in providing evidence of an isolated rural settlement pattern within Sydney region in this period, and as one of the few remnants of early European settlement in the Hornsby district. Dating from 1879-1931, it is also an unusually late private cemetery. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Old Man's Valley Cemetery is of local significance as a representative remnant of pioneering settler life that evidences the difficulties faced by early settlers as well as the close-knit family-based community which inhabited the valley. The cemetery also has representative significance at a local level for its landscape setting amid both remnant natural vegetation and traditional European grave plantings.

Kangal Harinath was the biography of Sri Harinath Majumdar, editor of Grambarta Prakashika, who was his teacher in the Goalanda School, and a philosopher and a guide to Jaladhar Sen. He also edited many books. His travelogue titled \\"‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶Ø‡¶º\\" (Himalaya) was an account of his perilous journey to Himalayas, which appeared in Bengali literary periodical \\"‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßÄ\\" (Bharati) in installments during a span of about two years in 1903-04 while Smt Sarala Debi was the editor. It became extremely popular and sensitized Bengali society. Later it was published as a book in 1916 from Calcutta. This book, later, was included in the list of text books for Calcutta University. \\"Himalaya\\" was one of the pioneering literary works written in Bengali in the genre of travelogue, with an account of travel to the Himalayas, and contemporary to \\"Himaranya\\" written by Swami Ramananda Bharati describing his experience of travel to Kailsh and Manas Sarovar, published during 1901-02 in the Bengali literary magazine ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø \\"Sahitya\\", and followed by several noted Bengali travelogues writers in later years, such as Uma Prasad Mukhopadhyay, Shanku Maharaj etc. to popularize travel and expedition to Himalayas in Bengali society and psyche. Acquaintances, friends and personalities ; Lalan Fakir (Lalan Shah) Jaladhar's was acquainted with Lalan Shah (or Lalan Fakir) through his mentor Kangal Harinath (Harinath Majumdar). In his memoirs he wrote: ;Kangal Harinath and Phikir Chand Fakir Movement Harinath Majumdar alias Kangal Harinath was a close acquaintance to Haladhar Sen, father of Jaladar. Harinath had remarkable influence in Jaladhar's life, starting from the moment of his birth, when Harinath attributed the name Jaladhar to him. During 1880s, when Harinath was editing and publishing \\"Grambarta\\" from his residence at Kumarkhali village, many young men were attracted to him and a social group was formed. During this time Akshay Kumar Maitreya proposed formation of a performing artists' forum (‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶â‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¶‡¶≤) with Jaladhar and other close friends to compose and perform \\"Baul\\" songs, a form of folk music of Bengal. Akshay Kumar Maitreya, Prafulla Chandra Gangopadhyay with his brother Banwarilal and cousin brother Nagendranath, Jaladhar Sen himself and many others under the patronage of Harinath formed this group. Collectively they created many Baul songs and used a common pseudonym ‡¶´‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶¶ ‡¶´‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶∞ (Phikir Chand Fakir), used in the last stanza of most of the songs. Soon the group became very popular and a devotional movement was observed to be sweeping in many places far and near. This group was most probably the first of its kind in Bengal which is known as Band in the present day. Some of the early creations of Baul song by this group are noted under: ;Dwijendralal Ray In the year 1878 Jaladhar appeared in the Entrance examination, and for that purpose he had to travel to Krishna Nagar, the district headquarters, from his village Kumarkhali. His elder brother could managed to gather only four rupees for the purpose for his trip. Jaladhar had only a \\"Dhuti and Chador\\" as his dress, did neither have a shirt nor shoes. After a short rail journey, he had to walk down to Krishna Nagar from Bogula in the last leg of the journey. There on the day of examination he met Dwijendralal Ray, who also appeared the examination in the same year. The remarkable event that led to a long and deep friendship between the two was described by jaladhar in his own words in his memoirs: Dwijendralal went to England for higher studies, and after return joined the government service, while Jaladhar continued as a school teacher. They met again during 1895-96 in Mahishadol. Dwijendralal was posted in Tamluk as the Settlement Officer and Jaladhar was the school teacher of Mahishadol that time. In later days when both of then were in Calcutta, in many occasions Dwijwendralal used to say: In 1913 Dwijendralal initiated publication of a Literary magazine in Bengali, (Bharat Barsha) as an editor. Unfortunately, he died unexpectedly on 17 May 1913, and Jaladhar Sen was appointed as the editor along with Amulya Charan Bidya Bhushan in the first year. After a year Amulya Charan left and Upendra Krishna Bandyopadhyay joined as co-editor. In the third year Upendra too left. Jaladhar continued as the editor of (Masik Bharat Barsha) for twenty two years. ;Swami Vivekananda Jaladhar Sen mentioned in the memoir ‡¶Ü‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Æ‡¶ú‡ßÄ‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßÄ ‡¶ì ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶Æ‡ßÉ‡¶§‡¶ø‚Äî‡¶§‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶™‡¶£ about his chanced meeting with Swami Vivekananda during his wandering days at Himalayas: ;Rajanikanta Sen Rajanikanta Sen was very close to Jaladhar Sen. One of such many incidences was cited by Jaladhar Sen himself: The song was \\"‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶ì‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ ‡¶Æ‡ßã‡¶ü‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶™‡¶°‡¶º ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßá ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶á\\" (Mayer deoa mota kapor mathay tule ne re bhai). ;Surendranath Roy A letter of condolence from Jaladhar Sen to Manindranath Roy-1929When Surendranath Roy died, Jaladhar Sen, Editor of Bharatbarsha, wrote to Manindranath, son of Surendranath, a letter of condolence https://independentindian.com/2009/02/23/jaladhar-sen-writes-to-manindranath- at-surendranaths-death-c-nov-dec-1929/ Awards and recognition *Jaladhar Sen was awarded with a title of ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶¶‡ßÅ‡¶∞ (Ray Bahadur) by the British government in 1929 for his contribution to Bengali literature and social reform.

The statue was prepared by Azerbaijani sculptors Tokay Mammadov and Omar Eldarov between 1958 and 1963. The architect of the statue is Haji Mukhtarov. For this work, sculptors Tokay Mammadov and Omar Eldarov were awarded silver medals of the USSR Academy of Arts.  History  In 1958, a competition for the establishment of a statue to Azerbaijani poet Mohammed Fuzuli was proclaimed on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the death of the poet. The project was jointly prepared by Tokay Mammadov and Omar Eldarov, who studied together at St. Petersburg State Academy of Fine Arts, Sculpture, and Architecture named after I. E. Repin, together with architect Haji Mukhtarov won the competition. Before working on the statue of Fuzuli, both Tokay Mammadov and Omar Eldarov established some \\"poetic\\" works. So, Tokay Mammadov worked on the portrait of Nizami Ganjavi in those years. This portrait, the first wooden portrait in the Azerbaijani sculpture, is kept in the Museum of Azerbaijan Literature named after Nizami Ganjavi. Omar Eldarov was working on the marble portrait of the 19th century Azerbaijani poet and daughter of Karabagh's khan Khurshidbanu Natavan in the 1950s. Soon he was ordered to establish the bronze statue of Natavan by the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the People's Writer of Azerbaijan, Mirza Ibrahimov. The opening of the statue took place in 1962.  Description  The statue of Mohammed Fuzuli consists of a bronze part on the granite pedestal and a fountain located in front of it. The height of the sculpture is 12 meters. The lines of the poet's faces, frown on his forehead, and between his eyebrows describes his life with intense thoughts and excitements. For the first time, Fuzuli's artistic image was created by Azerbaijani sculptor Fuad Abdurahmanov. Thus, when the facade of the building of the Azerbaijan Literature Museum named after Nizami Ganjavi was being developed, one of the facades decorates was intended to be a statue of Fuzuli. Fuad Abdurrahmanov's project won the competition declared for the statue of the poet. The image of Fuzuli, created by Fuad Abdurahmanov for the museum building in 1939, was officially recognized as a portrait of the poet. While preparing statue of Fuzuli sculptors were loyal to the general image created by F.Abdurrahmanov.

He was popular in Northern music halls in the early part of the twentieth century. Billed as ‚ÄúThe Bashful Limit‚Äù, he typically played the part of a \\"bashful fool\\", whose ostensible lack of experience with women could turn out to reveal hidden purpose. He popularised the songs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Twenty-One Today‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Shy, Mary Ellen, I‚Äôm Shy‚Äù, which remain the songs for which he is best remembered. Death Jack Pleasants died in 1924 aged forty-nine. He died of a perforated appendix after an evening pantomime performance of Little Red Riding Hood at the Prince's Theatre, Bradford. One source suggests that Pleasants dropped dead on stage, and that he had been only \\"subbing\\" for Arthur Lucan and Kitty McShane of Old Mother Riley fame. The pantomime began to seem jinxed. The 7 February 1924 edition of Variety carried the following report: > \\"Francis Laidler's pantomime at Prince's Theatre, Bradford is having a > particularly unhappy time.

She was the lead ship of the , which included two other ships, and . Ordered as part of a naval expansion program after the Austro- Prussian War, Ariadne was laid down in September 1868, launched in July 1871, and was commissioned in November 1872. Ariadne was a small vessel, armed with a battery of just eight guns. Ariadne went on four major overseas cruises during her career. The first, from late 1874 to late 1876, saw the ship visit Chinese waters where she protected German shipping from pirate attacks. During the second, from late 1877 to late 1879, Ariadne operated off South America and the central Pacific Ocean, where her captain negotiated a series of trade agreements with local chiefs. In 1880‚Äì1881, the ship went to South American waters to protect German interests during the War of the Pacific between Peru, Chile, and Bolivia, and in 1884‚Äì1885, she operated off West Africa, where she negotiated the acquisition of a protectorate in what is now Guinea. After returning to Germany in 1885, Ariadne was reassigned as a training ship for apprentice seamen, a role she performed for the next five years. During this period, she went on training cruises to the Caribbean Sea, conducted training in the Baltic Sea, and participated in fleet exercises in German waters. She was decommissioned in September 1890, stricken from the naval register in April 1891, and sold to ship breakers in October. Design The three Ariadne-class corvettes were ordered as part of the fleet plan of 1867, an expansion program aimed at strengthening the Prussian Navy in the wake of the Austro-Prussian War. The plan called for a total of twenty screw corvettes. The design for Ariadne was prepared in 1869. Ariadne was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 12 officers and 220 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove one 4-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . As built, Ariadne was equipped with a full ship rig, but this was later reduced to a barque rig. Ariadne was armed with a battery of six 22-caliber (cal.) breech-loading guns and two 23-cal. guns. In 1882, she had four Hotchkiss revolver cannon installed. Service history =Construction and early career in home waters= Ariadne was laid down in September 1868 at the K√∂nigliche Werft (Royal Shipyard) in Danzig. Work was delayed by the Franco-Prussian War and she was launched on 21 July 1871; during the launching ceremony, she was christened after the Greek goddess Ariadne by the shipyard director, Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Franz Kinderling. She was commissioned into the fleet on 23 November 1872. She thereafter began sea trials, during which a number of defects were discovered that required repeated repairs. She was finally ready for service with the fleet by Spring of 1873. On 15 April, Ariadne finally received her full crew to take her to Wilhelmshaven, where she joined the training squadron for training exercises. While in the outer Jade Bay, she and the other ships of the fleet were reviewed by a commission from the Reichstag on 23 May. She then visited Norway in company with the steam frigate . The training squadron was disbanded on 11 September, and on 13 October Ariadne was decommissioned at what was now the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig to have her rigging reduced. Ariadne returned to service in 1874 and conducted trials to test her new rigging. On 6 June, she joined the training squadron, which at the time consisted of the ironclad warships and , the gunboat , and the aviso , commanded by Konteradmiral (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Ludwig von Henk. The ships conducted maneuvers, shooting drills, sail training, and landing exercises. Later in the year, Ariadne accompanied Crown Prince Friedrich to Britain, which included a stop in Cowes on the island of Portland. After the ship returned to Germany, she stopped in Danzig Bay to rejoin the training squadron. She then went to Danzig and later Wilhelmshaven to prepare for an overseas deployment. =First overseas deployment= German 1872 map of China, Japan, and Korea On 5 October, Ariadne left Wilhelmshaven to begin her cruise to East Asia. She transited the Suez Canal and arrived in Singapore on 24 December. She remained there until 4 January 1875, when she left for Manila in the Philippines, before proceeding on to Hong Kong, where she replaced the corvette as the station ship in China. At the time, Chinese pirates were a major problem and the Qing government refused to address the problem. European shipping companies therefore demanded that the fleets of their national governments intervene to stop the attacks. That year, the German government ordered the frigate and the gunboat to join Ariadne. The three ships patrolled off the coast between Canton and Taku before arriving at Whampoa on 12 September, where Ariadne and Cyclop launched a retaliatory raid against a group of pirates that had attacked the German schooner Anna. Ariadne conducted a hydrographic survey around Amoy in early 1876, and in April, the three ships in Chinese waters united in Hong Kong. They were joined by the frigate , whose captain, KzS Alexander von Monts, became the squadron commander. Later that year, on 1 July, Ariadne was replaced by her sister ship, , allowing Ariadne to begin the voyage back to Germany on 17 July. She passed through the Suez Canal and arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 20 October; she was decommissioned there ten days later. =Second overseas deployment= Illustration of the Central America Squadron, with Leipzig, Elisabeth, and Ariadne from left to right Ariadne was given a thorough overhaul that lasted until late 1877; she was recommissioned on 15 October for another overseas cruise, this time to Central America and the central Pacific Ocean. She left Germany on 30 October, her departure having been delayed by heavy storms. Bad weather forced her to stop in Margate, Great Britain, to seek shelter. She was able to resume her voyage only on 16 December. Ariadne sailed to Funchal, Madeira and then proceeded to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she arrived in January 1878. She then sailed to Punta Arenas, Chile, to replenish her coal, but on arrival her crew discovered that the local depot had no coal. The crew had to cut down trees to burn in the boilers instead. Ariadne visited several islands in the Gulf of Penas before continuing on to Valparaiso, where she rendezvoused with the corvette . The two ships sailed north to Panama, where they met Elisabeth; the three ships formed a squadron under the command of Elisabeths captain, KzS Wilhelm von Wickede. They then sailed to Nicaragua, where the previous year a dispute with Germany had resulted in the German ambassador being attacked. Ariadne then sailed independently to Panama, where she received the order to leave South America and cross the Pacific. She sailed to the Gal√°pagos Islands and then to the Marquesas Islands, where she visited the islands of Nuku Hiva and Fatu Hiva. Ariadne then sailed to Tahiti and visited the town of Papeete, where her commander, Korvettenkapit√§n (KK‚ÄîCorvette Captain) Bartholom√§us von Werner assured the local government that Germany had no intent of colonizing the islands. Ariadne arrived in Apia, Samoa on 23 June. Under pressure from the United States, two Samoan chiefs had unilaterally repudiated the trade agreement they had signed with Germany. Ariadne was tasked with punishing the chiefs, and she sent men ashore to capture the towns of Saluafata and Falealili on the north coast of the island of Upolu. Ariadne left Samoa on 16 March to go to Sydney, Australia, where Werner informed Berlin of his activities. The ship also picked up the German consul Weber and, departing Sydney on 20 October, began a tour of the Melanesian and Micronesian islands. The ship visited Nuku ªalofa in the Tonga Islands from 26 to 29 October and Levuka and Tariani in the Fiji Islands from 30 October to 2 November. On 13 November, while in the Ellice Islands, Werner concluded trade agreements with the islands of Funafuti and Vaitupu. While visiting the Gilbert Islands, Ariadne had to conduct hydrographic surveys to correct the navigational charts of the area. In the Marshall Islands, Werner negotiated another trade and friendship agreement with the main island of Jaluit on 29 November. The treaty also allocated part of the port as a coaling station for German ships. On 11 December, Ariadne stopped in Mioko Island in what was to later become Neu Lauenberg; there was insufficient coal there, and so the crew again had to resort to cutting wood for the boilers. Weber asked Werner to continue the tour of the island of New Pomerania to show the flag and secure additional trade treaties. On 19‚Äì20 December, Werner concluded an agreement with the chief of Mioko Island to establish a coaling station there. Ariadne began the voyage back to Samoa on 21 December, stopping briefly at Savo Island in the Soloman Islands before reaching Apia on 16 January 1879. There, the two Samoan chiefs had finally agreed to honor the agreement with Germany, and to allow the construction of a coaling station at Saluafata. On 25 January, Ariadne left for Auckland, New Zealand to cable Berlin and inform the government of the developments in Samoa. On arriving there on 4 February, Ariadne received the order to return to Germany once her replacement, the corvette , arrived in Apia. Ariadne stopped in Nukualofa on the way to present the chief with a medal that had been awarded by Kaiser Wilhelm I. Bismarck reached Apia on 19 May, allowing Ariadne to leave on 28 May. She sailed through the New Hebrides, passed through the Torres Strait and the Arafura Sea, and stopped in Batavia. Ariadne transited the Suez Canal and steamed through the Mediterranean Sea, arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 30 September. She was decommissioned there on 12 October. In the course of her voyage, she had covered some . =Third deployment abroad= Over the winter of 1879‚Äì1880, Ariadne underwent a thorough overhaul at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven, and on 1 April she was recommissioned for another deployment to South America. She left Germany on 14 April and arrived in Montevideo, Uruguay on 6 June, though unrest in Argentina prompted her to go to Buenos Aires to protect German interests. After the situation had calmed, she passed through the Strait of Magellan and arrived in Coronel on 11 August, where she replaced the ironclad corvette . Ariadne was then tasked with observing the Chilean and Peruvian ports during the War of the Pacific and to protect German interests. In early January 1881, she took aboard sixty-four Germans at Anc√≥n as a precaution against violence in the city. From 16 to 20 January, the ship sent a detachment of sailors ashore at Lima, Peru to help defend the Europeans in the city from plundering troops. On 14 July, Ariadne met the corvette that had been sent to replace her. Two days later, Ariadne left Valparaiso, steamed through the Strait of Magellan, and north through the Atlantic, arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 7 October. On the return voyage, she carried a banker from Frankfurt who had been charged with fraud and had escaped to South America, only to have been apprehended while Ariadne was on station. The ship transferred to Danzig later in the month and was decommissioned there on 31 October. =Fourth overseas deployment= In 1882, Ariadne had another major overhaul, but she remained in reserve until 15 July 1884, when she was reactivated. She was initially used as a training ship for engine and boiler room crews and four-year volunteers. She also participated in the autumn fleet maneuvers in late August with the corvette , the artillery school ship , and a flotilla of torpedo boats. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Ariadne received orders on 27 September to join a new West African Squadron, commanded by KAdm Eduard von Knorr to protect German interests in the region. The squadron also included the corvettes Bismarck, , , and Sophie, along with the tender Adler. The ships left Wilhelmshaven on 30 October, bound for West Africa. While in Cape Verde, Ariadne was detached from the squadron to proceed with Adler to Liberia to settle financial disputes. She then steamed off the coast of what was to become French Guinea; the chiefs in the territory between the Pongo and Dubreka rivers that had previously signed agreements with the German explorer Friedrich Colin in 1882 signed protectorate agreements with Ariadnes captain. The German government later traded these territories for areas on the border of Togoland. The ship then went to Freetown before proceeding on to Porto Grande, Cape Verde, where she remained from 15 January to 1 March 1885. While there, she received orders to return to Germany, which she reached on 30 March. =Later career= After arriving in Wilhelmshaven, Ariadne was reassigned to training duties for Schiffsjungen (apprentice seamen), though she was not formally reassigned as a training ship until 1888. In this role, she typically conducted training cruises in the Baltic and participated in the annual fleet maneuvers. She joined the newly-established Training Squadron on 29 September, which began a long training cruise to the Caribbean Sea on 10 October, which lasted until 27 March 1886 when the ships returned to Wilhelmshaven. She spent the next several months as she had in 1885, conducting training cruises in the Baltic and the autumn fleet exercises. On 14 October, she was decommissioned in Kiel. Ariadne was recommissioned on 1 April 1887 to resume training duties in the Baltic. She was present for the ceremonial beginning of construction on the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Kiel in June, shortly before embarking on another cruise to the Caribbean on 12 June. During the voyage, she also visited ports in the United States. Ariadne arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 25 August 1888 and immediately joined the fleet maneuvers, where she was tasked with defending the port with the ironclad and some armored gunboats against a simulated attack. Ariadne was again decommissioned on 29 September and she remained out of service until 16 April 1889 for another cruise to the Caribbean. After returning to Germany in 1890, she took part in a naval review held during a visit by a squadron of ironclads from the Austro-Hungarian Navy in August, which coincided with the annual fleet maneuvers, which Ariadne also joined. She decommissioned for the last time on 30 September. The ship was stricken from the naval register on 14 April 1891 and sold on 6 October; she was thereafter broken up in Hamburg.

She was the second member of the , which included two other ships, and . Ordered as part of a large naval expansion program after the Austro-Prussian War, she was laid down in 1871 during the Franco-Prussian War. She was launched in December 1872 and completed in June 1874. Luise was a small vessel, armed with a battery of just eight guns. Luise went on two major overseas cruises early in her career, both to East Asian waters. The first lasted from 1875 and 1877; during the cruise, she visited Chinese ports to protect German interests and show the flag. The second lasted from 1878 to 1880 and saw similar activities, though during her time in the East Asia Squadron, she served as its flagship. While on the way home, she attempted to negotiate a dispute between Germany and Madagascar, but a severe storm forced her to leave before a settlement could be reached. In 1881, Luise was converted into a training ship, and she served in this capacity for most of the rest of her career. She made several overseas cruises, visiting the Americas twice in 1881‚Äì1882 and 1885. The ship carried replacement crews to the gunboats stationed in German West Africa in 1886 and 1887. Luise was hulked in 1892 and used as a torpedo test ship in 1894‚Äì1896, before being stricken from the naval register in December 1896. She was sold for scrap the following year and broken up in Hamburg. Design The three Ariadne-class corvettes were ordered as part of the fleet plan of 1867, an expansion program aimed at strengthening the Prussian Navy in the wake of the Austro-Prussian War. The plan called for a total of twenty screw corvettes. The design for Luise was prepared in 1869, but work on the ship was delayed until 1871 by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. Luise was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 12 officers and 220 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove one 4-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . As built, Luise was equipped with a full ship rig, but this was later reduced to a barque rig. Luise was armed with a battery of six 22-caliber (cal.) breech-loading guns and two 23-cal. guns. In 1882, she had four Hotchkiss revolver cannon installed. Service history The keel for Luise, named for Princess Louise of Prussia, was laid down in 1871 at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. She was launched on 16 December 1872 without any celebration and she was commissioned into the fleet on 4 June 1874. She then began sea trials, which ended in mid-July, after which she was moved to Wilhelmshaven and decommissioned in late August. =First deployment abroad= German 1872 map of China, Japan, and Korea Luise was reactivated in early 1875 for training operations with the main fleet in German waters. She was ordered on a deployment abroad late in the year, which she began on 11 October. She left Wilhelmshaven on 26 October and sailed through the Atlantic Ocean to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil before rounding the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Ocean. She arrived in Melbourne, Australia on 1 April 1876, where she was compelled to stay for two weeks, since a fever had broken out among the crew. From there, Luise sailed to Jolo, the main island of the Sulu Archipelago of the Philippines. In the capital of Jolo, she attempted to secure payment of a debt owed to a German merchant, but she was unable to do so, as the residents of the town had burned it to the ground and fled to the interior of the island during a revolt against the colonial Spanish government. Luise met with the East Asia Squadron in Hong Kong on 1 July and she relieved her sister ship , which then began the voyage back to Germany. On 13 July, Luise sailed to Chefoo in company with the squadron flagship, the screw frigate , since the German ambassador feared there would be Chinese riots as a result of British activities in the area. By the end of September, the threat of unrest had passed, and so on 1 October, Luise was able to begin a tour of several Chinese ports. At the end of January 1877, Luise went to Shanghai to ensure that the Chinese authorities had dropped the tax on German imports in the port. She then steamed up the Yangtze to Wuhu to show the flag and conduct hydrographic surveys. Luise sailed to Nagasaki, Japan, after her work around Wuhu was completed. There, she underwent an overhaul; during this work, the British ironclad warship accidentally collided with her, crushing three of her boats and wrecking one of the boat cranes. After repairs were completed, Luise received the order to return to Germany; she left Nagasaki on 7 May and arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 1 September. At the beginning of 1878, she went into the shipyard to be modernized, which included a reduction of her sailing rig. =Second deployment abroad= Luise was reactivated in late 1878 for another foreign cruise, and she left Germany on 3 December. This time, she passed through the Suez Canal on her way to East Asian waters. While on the way from Aden to Bombay on 26 January 1879, she collected deep-ocean temperature and salinity samples in conjunction with scientific expeditions conducted by the German frigate and the British corvette . Luise then stopped in Bombay and Calcutta, the first time the ports had been visited by a German warship. She proceeded on to Hong Kong, where she arrived in early May to replace her sister . Shortly thereafter, the corvette reached Hong Kong; her captain, Kapit√§n zur See (Captain at Sea) Carl Paschen, had been the senior officer of the East Asia Squadron by date of rank, but he was replaced in this position by Luises commander. Beginning in June 1879, Luise toured Japanese ports, sometimes in company with the corvette and in August she conducted additional deep-see tests in the Korea Strait. In March and April 1880, Luise had to go to Shanghai to protect German nationals against unrest in the city; she was joined in this task by the gunboats and . The situation had calmed by 24 April, allowing Luise to return to Hong Kong, since she had received orders to return to Germany at the beginning of April. After making preparations for the voyage, she left Hong Kong on 3 July and sailed to Madagascar to complete a diplomatic mission on the way back to Germany. Anti-European sentiment was strong among the island's population in the context of French colonial ambitions, and they refused to recognize the German ambassador. Luise stopped in the main port at Tamatave, where Luises captain and five officers met with Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony on 16 August. Negotiations were not possible with the government as a result of the approach of a very strong storm that forced Luise to leave the island immediately. She proceeded on to Simonstown to replenish her stock of coal before continuing on to Wilhelmshaven, where she arrived on 9 November and was decommissioned on 20 November. =Training ship= Illustration of Luise in heavy seas Luise was converted into a training ship for Schiffsjungen (apprentice seamen) in early 1881, and she entered service in this role on 15 April. From 18 May to the middle of June, she conducted a training cruise in the Baltic Sea, and on 19 June she began a voyage to North, Central, and South America. She visited a number of ports, including Halifax, Canada, and Georgetown, British Guiana. She arrived back in Kiel on 4 September 1882, where she joined the fleet training exercises that were being conducted in the Baltic. She was decommissioned for the year on 25 September. The ship had deteriorated in condition by this time, so in 1883 she was taken into the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig for a thorough repair. This work lasted until February 1885, and on the 24th she was recommissioned to resume her training duties. Luise conducted a short set of trials outside Kiel before cruising in the Baltic starting on 11 May. The ship began another overseas cruise on 1 June, again to the Americas. On the way back from the tour, she stopped in Queenstown, Ireland, and then went to Cowes to represent Germany at a Royal Navy fleet review in 1886. She left Cowes on 10 August and visited Gravesend and Leith before arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 10 September. On arrival in Wilhelmshaven, Luise received orders to carry replacement crews to the gunboats that were stationed in German West Africa, Cyclop and . She sailed to Douala, Kamerun to transfer the new crews, and arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 26 January 1887. She was then formally re-designated as a school ship. Luise moved to Kiel on 10 February, where her crew was reduced. On 5 April, she had her crew replenished to resume training duties. She was present during the celebration of the beginning of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Kiel. She went on further cruises in German waters until 9 September; six days later she was decommissioned and assigned to the I. Reserve. A month later on 15 October, Luise was reactivated to carry another set of replacement crews to the gunboats in West Africa. She reached Douala on 17 December, transferred the crews, and left ten days later, arriving back in Kiel on 18 February 1888. Two days later, she was again decommissioned and placed in the I. Reserve, which lasted until April, when she was recommissioned for another stint as a training ship. She cruised in the Baltic until 29 September, when she returned to Kiel for an overhaul. She spent the years 1890 and 1891 as a training ship; she also participated in those years' fleet maneuvers. Luise was converted into a hulk in 1891 and based in Kiel, serving in that capacity until 19 December 1896, when she was stricken from the naval register. During this period, she was also used as a torpedo test ship from late 1894 to 16 April 1896. She was sold the following year and broken up in Hamburg.

Ordered as part of a large naval expansion program after the Austro-Prussian War, she was laid down in 1872 after the Franco-Prussian War. She was launched in December 1874 and completed in October 1876. Freya was built to a different design than her sisters, being longer and carrying a heavier armament of twelve guns. The ship went on two major overseas cruises in her career, the first from 1877 to 1879, and the second immediately after from 1879 to 1881, both of which were fairly uneventful. On the first cruise, she went to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and then to China as part of the East Asia Squadron. The second voyage began with a deployment to Chilean waters to protect German interests during the War of the Pacific, after which she returned to Chinese waters. After returning to Germany in 1881, she was converted into a training ship and returned to service in that capacity in 1883. She went on only one major training cruise, which lasted from mid-1883 to late 1884; she toured ports in the Americas and helped to protect civilians during a period of civil unrest in Haiti in late 1883. She was thereafter decommissioned and remained out of service for the rest of her existence, seeing no further use.

Freya was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 12 officers and 220 enlisted men.

Freya was armed with a battery of eight 22-caliber (cal.) breech-loading guns, one of which was later removed. She temporarily also carried four 25-cal. guns. In 1886, she had six Hotchkiss revolver cannon installed. Service history The keel for Freya was laid down in January 1872 at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. She was launched on 29 December 1874 and she was transferred to Kiel on 21 August 1876, mostly complete. There, she received her final fitting-out, before being commissioned into the fleet on 1 October 1876. She thereafter began sea trials, which lasted until 15 November, when she was decommissioned in Kiel. Freya was assigned to I Reserve of the North Sea Naval Station and based in Wilhelmshaven on 15 January 1877, and she was moved to the base over the course of 19 July ‚Äì 4 August. The voyage was delayed significantly because she was driven ashore by bad weather and had to be pulled free by a merchant vessel. =First overseas deployment= German 1872 map of China, Japan, and Korea On 1 November 1877, Freya was commissioned for an overseas cruise to the Mediterranean Sea, which she began on 15 November. Severe storms in the English Channel forced the ship to take shelter in Falmouth, and she arrived in Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire on 12 December. There, she came under command of the German squadron in the Mediterranean, along with the frigate . Freya visited Piraeus, Greece on 7 February 1878, where she was later joined by Hertha. The two ships remained there until mid- March, when they returned to Smyrna. In July, the squadron was disbanded and Freya initially remained in the Aegean Sea. On 12 August, she received the order to proceed to East Asia, where she was to replace her sister as a station ship in Chinese waters. Freya reached Hong Kong on 6 October where she rendezvoused with the corvette , which was the flagship of the East Asia Squadron. After arriving in Hong Kong, Freya went into the dry dock for repairs and periodic maintenance after her long voyage from Europe. This work lasted until 9 December, and two days later the ship moved to Shantou and then to Amoy to observe an episode of domestic unrest, and to be prepared to intervene if the situation devolved into attacks against Germans in Fujien province. She remained in Amoy from 17 December to 7 January 1879, though the riots did not threaten Germans in the city, and Freya was able to embark on a tour of ports in Formosa and the city of Fuzhou in Fujien. She went to Shanghai on 4 February, where she remained until 4 April. While there, she received the order to return to Germany, so she sailed to Hong Kong to await her replacement, Luise, and to prepare for the voyage back home. Freya remained there from 9 April to 3 May, when Luise arrived, allowing her to depart the station. While on the way back, she had a serious accident where one of her boilers overheated and burst, throwing boiling water into one of the crew spaces, badly burning several sailors and killing four, who were buried in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. She stopped in Cape Town, South Africa, where the British forces were waging the Anglo-Zulu War, where the colonial governor gave captured Zulu trophies to the ship as gifts to the German crown princess, Victoria, who was the daughter of British Queen Victoria. After much of the crew began to suffer from scurvy, Freya was forced to stop in Faial Island in the Azores to pick up fresh food to alleviate the condition. The ship arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 17 September, and she was decommissioned there ten days later. =Second overseas deployment= Freya was still in good condition, and so a lengthy overhaul was not necessary, allowing the ship to begin another cruise abroad immediately. She was recommissioned on 3 October; she was ordered to return to East Asia by way of the western coast of South America, where she was to assist the ironclad in protecting German interests during the War of the Pacific between Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. Freya left Germany on 26 October, and she met the frigate several times on the trip to South America. While in the Strait of Magellan, Freya encountered the stranded British steamer and she towed her to Punta Arenas. On 3 March 1880, Freya arrived in Valparaiso, Chile, where she rendezvoused with Hansa. From 8 March to 14 April, Freya went to the Chilean port of Arica, which was under a Peruvian blockade. The pressing need for warships in Chinese waters forced Freya to end her operations off South America on 14 April, and she steamed north to Panama to take on provisions for the lengthy voyage across the Pacific Ocean. She left Panama on 8 May and sailed to Honolulu (in what was then the Sandwich Islands), where she was visited by King KalƒÅkaua. From there, Freya proceeded to Spanish Guam, where she took on additional fresh food from 4 to 5 August. She arrived in Hong Kong on 21 August, where she joined the East Asia Squadron, which also included Vineta and the gunboats and . Freya steamed to Yantai on 9 September to rest her crew after their long voyage across the Pacific. She remained there until 28 October, and during that period she was joined by other members of the squadron. She then left for Shanghai, where she began a six-week period of maintenance on 1 November. On 22 December, she returned to Hong Kong, and on 15 February 1881, the ship's new commander, Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Kupfer, arrived. During the stay in Hong Kong, Freya conducted shooting drills in Mirs Bay, and from 30 March to 11 April, she made two trips to the Paracel Islands to conduct hydrographic surveys of the area. On 30 April, the German consul in China requested that Freya go to the Ninepin Group, where Chinese pirates had attacked the German barque Occident. She was unable to locate the pirates, however, and so returned to Hong Kong. On 24 May, Vineta left the squadron, making Kupfer the squadron commander, but on 18 June, he died of typhoid fever; the first officer, Korvettenkapit√§n (KK‚ÄîCorvette Captain) Lepel-Gnitz, took command of the vessel. Freya began the voyage back to Germany on 30 June, and while in Batavia in mid-July, she met her replacement, the corvette , where Lepel-Gnitz turned over command of the squadron. Freya then proceeded across the Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean, arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 6 October, where she was decommissioned on 21 October. =Later career= Having already had success using Luise and as training ships for Schiffsjungen (apprentice seamen), the Kaiserliche Admiralit√§t (Imperial Admiralty) decided to convert Freya into a training vessel as well. The work lasted from late 1881 to early 1883, and she was recommissioned for training duties on 3 March 1883. She went to Kiel on 7 May, and then proceeded into the North Sea for trials. She then embarked a contingent of trainees and began a short training cruise to Danzig and Karlskrona, Sweden on 12 July, which ended in Kiel. On 25 July, a longer- distance cruise to South America and the Caribbean Sea began. During the voyage, she stopped in Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina on 24 September. She went to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in response to domestic unrest there. She arrived on 29 October and remained until 16 November, when she left to go to Jacmel, where she picked up 250 civilians and carried them to Kingston, Jamaica. Freya returned to Port-au-Prince on 16 December, and since the government had by then suppressed the rebels, Freya was able to continue her cruise in January 1884. She visited Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, Bermuda, and Hampton Roads, United States. On arriving back in German waters, she joined the annual fleet maneuvers on 1 September, which were conducted in the North and Baltic Seas. After the maneuvers ended, Freya returned to Kiel on 21 September and continued on to Danzig six days later, where she disembarked the trainees. The ship was decommissioned for an overhaul on 11 October, which lasted until late 1887. During this period, her rigging was reduced to that of a barque. The ship was recommissioned on 23 October 1887 for trials, after which she went to Kiel and then Wilhelmshaven, where she arrived on 22 December. On 17 January 1888 she was decommissioned there; she did not see further active use, which was unusual given that she had just been overhauled. The naval historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert R√∂hr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz speculated that because the corvette , which had been built specifically as a training ship, had entered service by that time, the Admiralit√§t decided that Freya was redundant. In late 1893, Freya was transferred to the list of harbor ships, and she was stricken from the naval register altogether on 14 December 1896. She was thereafter broken up in Kiel.

Period of equally high activity over 8,000 years ago marked. Space climate is the long-term variation in solar activity within the heliosphere, including the solar wind, the Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), and their effects in the near-Earth environment, including the magnetosphere of Earth and the ionosphere, the upper and lower atmosphere, climate, and other related systems. The scientific study of space climate is an interdisciplinary field of space physics, solar physics, heliophysics, and geophysics. It is thus conceptually related to terrestrial climatology, and its effects on the atmosphere of Earth are considered in climate science.  Background  Space climatology considers long-term (longer than the latitudinally variable 27-day solar rotation period, through the 11-year solar cycle and beyond, up to and exceeding millennia) variability of solar indices, cosmic ray, heliospheric parameters, and the induced geomagnetic, ionospheric, atmospheric, and climate effects. It studies mechanisms and physical processes responsible for their variability in the past with projections onto future. It is a broader and more general concept than space weather, to which it is related like the conventional climate and weather. In addition to real-time solar observations, the field of research also covers analysis of historical space climate data. This has included analysis and reconstruction that has allowed solar wind and heliospheric magnetic field strengths to be determined from back to 1611. 300px The importance of space climate research has been recognized, in particular, by NASA which launched a special space mission Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) dedicated to monitoring of space climate. New results, ideas and discoveries in the field of Space Climate are published in a focused peer-review research Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate (JSWSC). Since 2013, research awards and medals in space weather and space climate are annually awarded by the European Space Weather Week. Another recent space observatory platform is the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE). Space climate research has three main aims: # to better understand the long- term solar variability, including also the observed extremes and features of this variability in the solar wind and in the heliospheric magnetic field # to better understand the physical relationships between the Sun, the heliosphere, and various related proxies (geomagnetic fields, cosmic rays, etc.) # to better understand the long-term effect of solar variability on the near-Earth environment, including the different atmospheric layers, and ultimately on Earth's global climate = History = In the early 2000s, when the concept of space weather became common, a small initiative group, led by the University of Oulu in Finland had realized that physical drivers of solar variability and its terrestrial effects can be better understood with a more general and broader view. The concept of Space Climate had been developed, and the corresponding research community formed, which presently includes a few hundred active members around the world. In particular, a series of International Space Climate Symposia (biennial since 2004) was organized, with the first inaugural symposium being held in Oulu (Finland) in 2004, followed by those in Romania (2006), Finland (2009), India (2011), Finland (2013), Finland (2016), Canada (2019), as well as topical space climate sessions are regularly held at the General Assemblies of the Committee on Space Research and Earth Science.

William Browne of Glengarry, who served in the American revolution. Her father worked in Ireland as an Army recruitment agent and when he died in 1813, Burdett ended in a legal case brought by the government against her father's estate looking for an account of his finances. The case continued on for over 10 years. She married widower Capt. George Burdett, R. N., of Longtown House, County Kildare in 1806. He had served in the British navy during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. They had a son George and two daughters, Frances Elizabeth and Catherine Jane. Burdett published her first novel in 1827 and continued writing books which were largely based on her own experiences. Her books were published as written by Mrs C. D. Burdett. Her husband was killed unexpectedly when a chemist's assistant mistakenly mislabelled oil of tar as his prescription in 1832. She herself died while visiting Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in 1861.

Two years later, she‚Äôs the only indicted suspect for a crime that attracts a lot of media attention and has placed her in the center of the public eye. Dolores spends her days preparing for the trial, secluded in her house as her parents work as a team ready to do anything to defend their daughter. The best lawyer is not enough, they obsessively control around her: how she looks, what she does, eats and who she sees. But as the trial moves forward and pressure grows, suspicion and secrets emerge within the family.

It was selected to be screened in the main competition section of the 75th Venice International Film Festival. Plot Imrane and Manuel, members of an Arabic crime family, celebrate their friend Nouri's release from jail. Nouri's contacts in jail lead them to a drug deal. Urged on by Imrane, Manuel sets up the deal. En route, they are ambushed in a drive-by that results in the deaths of Imrane and Nouri. Manuel escapes but becomes the primary suspect of both the criminal underworld and the police. Driss, an Arabic narcotics officer who grew up with Manuel and the others, reveals to Manuel that Imrane was working as an informant. Manuel initially refuses to believe this and rejects his offer to work together. Already distrusted by his fellow police, Driss experiences further difficulty in the Arabic community when he attempts to make contact with family and former friends during his investigation. Driss comes under pressure to solve the embarrassing loss of his informant. Manuel, too, is pressured by crime boss Raji to find who killed Imrane, his son. After another attempt to kill him, Manuel reluctantly agrees to work with Driss. Manuel kills Carminatti, a gangster he believes to have sold them out to the killer. Using Carminatti's phone, Driss tracks a call to a burner phone but warns Manuel that homicide detectives intend to arrest him. Driss advises Manuel to allow himself to be arrested, as he will likely be released for lack of evidence. As Manuel considers his options, he tracks the burner phone to Jean-Marc, who admits Carminatti gave him a tip. Jean-Marc eventually reveals that Raji is behind the order to kill them. Manuel disbelieves this but consults with Driss. Driss says Raji is likely making amends to corrupt officials for an unauthorized drug deal Imrane and Manuel performed. After Manuel's estranged ex-wife, Manon, gives him an alibi, the police release him. Driss pushes Manuel to replace Imrane as his informant and continue the original drug deal that got Imrane killed. The deal goes poorly, and Manuel learns there is now a contract on his life. Driss goes in early to save Manuel's life but arouses suspicion among the drug dealers that Manuel is an informant. Driss, knowing that Manuel can not escape the crime scene without jail time if he wants to survive, insists that Manuel must give himself up. Manuel asks to be given a few hours before he is arrested, during which he warns Manon and his son Yvan that he will likely be going away for a while. Manuel breaks into Raji's house and confronts him. Raji admits to ordering the hit but says he did it to protect his family, admitting that it has instead destroyed everyone's life. Guessing Manuel's course of action, Driss arrives, only to see Manuel execute Raji. Manuel leaves the house, only to be shot and killed outside.

The operation immediately succeeded Operation Rugged which took the UN forces to the Kansas Line north of the 38th Parallel. The operation was initially successful, reaching its initial objectives, but was brought to a halt by the Chinese Spring Offensive on 22 April 1951. Background On 22 March, following the successful conclusion of Operation Courageous, US Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway notified UN forces commander General Douglas MacArthur that he was developing plans for an advance that would take Eighth Army forces above the 38th Parallel to a general line following the upstream trace of the Ryesong River as far as Sibyon-ni () in the west, falling off gently southeastward to the Hwach'on Reservoir, then running east to the coast. As in past and current operations, the objective would be the destruction of enemy troops and materiel. MacArthur approved Ridgway's concept but also scheduled a visit to Korea for 24 March, when he would have an opportunity to discuss the plans in more detail. Upon his return to Tokyo late on 24 March, following his conference with Ridgway and a visit to the front, MacArthur announced that he had directed the Eighth Army to cross the 38th Parallel \\"if and when its security makes it tactically advisable. More specifically MacArthur had approved Ridgway's concept of a general advance as deep as into North Korea. On 27 March, Ridgway assembled Corps and Division commanders at his Yeoju headquarters and advised them that ceasefire negotiations and future US Government decisions might compel the Eighth Army to adopt a static defense. Because of its inherent rigidity, such a stance would require strong leadership and imaginative tactical thinking, he warned, to stand off a numerically stronger enemy that might not be similarly inhibited in the choice of tactics. The Eighth Army meanwhile would continue to move forward and in the next advance would cross the 38th Parallel. Ridgway agreed with General MacArthur's earlier prediction that a stalemate ultimately would develop on the battlefront, but just how far the Eighth Army would drive into North Korea before this occurred, could not be accurately assessed at that time. Ridgway had revised his concept for advancing above the parallel since meeting with MacArthur on March 24. He planned to point his main attack toward the centrally located road and rail complex marked out by the towns of Pyonggang in the north and Ch'orwon and Gimhwa-eup in the south. This complex, eventually named the Iron Triangle, lay above the 38th Parallel in the diagonal corridor dividing the Taebaek Mountains into northern and southern ranges and containing the major road and rail links between the port of Wonsan in the northeast and Seoul in the southwest. Other routes emanating from the triangle of towns connected with Pyongyang to the northwest and with the western and eastern halves of the present front. A unique center of communications, the complex was of obvious importance to the ability of the enemy high command to move troops and supplies within the forward areas and to coordinate operations laterally. The first phase of this advance was to occupy ground that could serve as a base both for continuing the advance toward the complex and, in view of the enemy's evident offensive preparations, for developing a defensive position. The base selected, the Kansas Line, followed the lower bank of the Imjin River in the west. From the Imjin eastward as far as the Hwach'on Reservoir the line lay to above the 38th Parallel across the approaches to the Iron Triangle. Following the lower shoreline of the reservoir, it then turned slightly north to a depth of above the parallel before falling off southeastward to the Yangyang area on the coast. In the advance to the Kansas Line, designated Operation Rugged, US I and IX Corps were to seize the segment of the line between the Imjin and the western edge of the Hwach'on Reservoir. To the east, US X Corps was to occupy the portion tracing the reservoir shore and reaching Route 24 in the Soyang River valley, and the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) III and I Corps were to take the section between Route 24 and Yangyang. In anticipation of enemy offensive operations, Ridgway planned to pull substantial forces off the line immediately after reaching the Kansas Line and prepare them for counter-attacks. IX Corps was to release the US 1st Cavalry Division. The division was to assemble at Kyongan- ni, below the Han River south-east of Seoul, and prepare to meet enemy attacks aimed at the capital via Route 1 from the north-west, over Routes 33 and 3 from the north, or through the Bukhan River valley from the north-east. In the X Corps' zone, the bulk of the US 2nd Infantry Division was to assemble at Hongch'on ready to counter an attack following the Route 29 axis, and a division yet to be selected from one of the two ROK Corps in the east was to assemble at Yuch'on-ni on Route 20 and prepare to operate against enemy attacks in either Corps sector. The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (187th RCT), which had left the I Corps' zone for Taegu on 29 March, meanwhile was to be ready to return north to reinforce operations wherever needed. While these forces established themselves in reserve, Ridgway planned to launch Operation Dauntless, a limited advance toward the Iron Triangle by I and IX Corps. With the objective only of menacing the triangle, not of investing it, the two corps were to attack in succession to Lines Utah and Wyoming. They would create, in effect, a broad salient bulging above the Kansas Line between the Imjin River and Hwach'on Reservoir and reaching prominent heights commanding the Ch'orwon-Kumhwa base of the communications complex. If struck by strong enemy attacks during or after the advance, the two corps were to return to the Kansas Line. On 3 April, Ridgway updated MacArthur on the operational plans. MacArthur agreed with the Operation Rugged and Operation Dauntless concept, urging in particular that Ridgway make a strong effort to hold the Kansas Line. At the same time, MacArthur believed that the two operations would move the battlefront to that \\"point of theoretical stalemate\\" he had predicted in early March. Once Ridgway's forces reached their Kansas- Wyoming objectives MacArthur intended to limit UN operations to reconnaissance and combat patrols, none larger than a battalion. General Ridgway set an opening date for Operation Dauntless late on 9 April, after all but X and ROK III Corps had reached the Kansas Line. While those two corps continued what had proved a battle more with terrain than with the Korean People's Army (KPA), I and IX Corps forces were to start toward the Iron Triangle on the 11th. Utah, the initial objective line, arched above Kansas between the Imjin River and the eastern slopes of Kungmang Mountain, its trace resting on the prominent Kumhak, Kwangdok and Paegun mountain masses. The opening phase thus would be primarily an I Corps operation involving attacks by the US 3rd, 24th and 25th Divisions while requiring only a short advance by the British 27th Brigade at the left of IX Corps. On 11 April General MacArthur was removed from UN command and Ridgway was appointed in his place with General James Van Fleet assuming command of 8th Army on 14 April. Operation Operations Rugged and Dauntless eastern front map =Advance to the Kansas and Utah Lines= Since occupying positions around Yangyang above the Kansas Line on 10 April, the ROK I Corps had had no contact on its front, and on the 11th a company from the 29th Regiment, 9th Division, had patrolled some north of Yangyang without encountering enemy forces. The KPA 69th Brigade had been taken off the line and disbanded, and the KPA 2nd Division, now responsible for the coastal area, had yet to deploy forces in contact. The untested ROK 11th Infantry Division joined ROK I Corps. In the ROK III Corps zone high in the Taebaek Mountains, the ROK 3rd Infantry Division, despite having to be resupplied entirely by air and porters in the virtually roadless mountains, had beaten back detachments of the KPA 45th Division to reach the Kansas Line on 14 April, and its patrols since then had encountered few enemy forces above the line. To the west, the three divisions of the X Corps were just beginning to consolidate positions along the Kansas Line on 16 April. Since the 10th, after it became obvious that KPA 1st Division forces opposite the Corps' left were withdrawing hastily eastward from the ground below the Hwach'on Reservoir, the US 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Division had swung east along the lower shore in pursuit. Abandoned ammunition, food supplies, and a fully stocked aid station evidenced the enemy's haste. Ahead of the pursuing forces, the bulk of the KPA 1st Regiment (also known as the 14th Regiment) crossed the reservoir at a narrow point north-west of Yanggu, using boats and rafts that were burned after the crossing; the remainder moved to Yanggu and then north around the eastern end of the reservoir. Leading forces of the 23rd Infantry entered Yanggu and reached the Kansas Line on 15 April. The strongest KPA resistance encountered just above the Soyang River by the 7th Infantry Division at X Corps' center and the ROK 5th Division at the right had begun to dissolve on 13 April. The 5th Division cleared KPA 45th Division forces out of their defenses around Inje on the 15th, and after artillery pounded the ridges north of town during the night, dawn attacks carried the ROK to the Kansas Line with negligible contact. The US 17th Infantry Regiment, advancing on the 7th Division's left through decreasing opposition from KPA 15th Division forces, found Route 29 leading into Yanggu obstructed by booby-trapped fallen trees and cleverly placed wooden box mines but reached the Kansas Line and made contact with the 2nd Division in Yanggu on the 15th/16th. On the division's right, the US 32nd Infantry Regiment pushed through brief but sharp resistance to reach the line early on 17 April. Beginning on the 17th, X Corps' patrols ranging above the Kansas Line found progressively fewer enemy forces. X Corps commander, General Edward Almond attempted to follow the KPA withdrawal by establishing forward patrol bases in all division zones, whence strong patrols were to advance farther north each day in search of KPA positions. As of 20 April the patrolling had reached a depth of about without meeting significant resistance. On the opposite side of the Hwach'on Reservoir, IX Corps' patrols sent forward of the Kansas Line by the ROK 6th and 1st Marine Divisions began to bring back reports of PVA withdrawal when forces engaged in Operation Dauntless to the west drew closer to the Utah Line. By 17 April the 1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment, which had replaced the 7th Cavalry Regiment after the latter's unsuccessful effort to capture the Hwacheon Dam, established outposts near the dam on the ridge inside the Pukhan loop and on heights above the Pukhan to the west. On the 18th a Marine patrol crossing the Pukhan west of the dam found Hwacheon town on Route 17 unoccupied except for eleven Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) soldiers, whom the patrol took captive. Intelligence officers appraised the voluntary withdrawal ahead of the two IX Corps' divisions as a realignment of forces with those dropping back in the Dauntless sector, but did not overlook the possibility that the PVA were coaxing the IX Corps into a vulnerable deployment. A recently captured document, dated 17 March, extolled the virtues and explained the purpose of \\"roving defensive warfare,\\" defined as defense through movement without regard for the loss or gain of ground which could \\"conserve our own power, deplete the enemy's strength, and secure for us more favorable conditions for future victory.\\" By 17 April, the first phase of Operation Dauntless had been successfully achieved. On the east flank of the advance, the British 27th Brigade of IX Corps had cleared minor PVA 40th Army forces from Paegun Mountain above the headwaters of the Kap'yong River to reach the Utah Line on 16 April. The ROK 19th Regiment, 6th Division was currently relieving the brigade, which, except for the New Zealand artillery assigned to stay forward in support of the ROK, was withdrawing into corps reserve near Kap'yong town. The relief in part was in preparation for the second phase of Dauntless in which IX Corps would make a full advance with the ROK 6th and 1st Marine Divisions. While in reserve, the British brigade also was to begin rotating units under a British policy calling for annual replacement. The 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, was to be replaced on 23 April, by the 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers; on the 25th, brigade headquarters itself was to leave the line and be replaced by a new staff and commander from Hong Kong. The brigade at that time would become the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade under the command of Brigadier George Taylor. On the west flank of the Dauntless area, at approximately I Corps' center, the US 65th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Division, reinforced by the Philippine 10th Battalion Combat Team and two companies of the 64th Tank Battalion, had easily defeated PVA 26th Army detachments in a narrow zone between the Imjin River and Route 33 to reach the Utah Line on 14 April. In the right half of the Corps' zone, delaying forces of the 26th and 40th Armies had been more reluctant to give way before the 25th and 24th Divisions advancing toward Ch'orwon and Kumhwa. The 25th Division spent four days crossing the Hantan River and getting a foothold in the Pogae-San heights, a series of steep north-south ridges between Routes 33 and 3, and needed two days more to cover half the distance between the Kansas and Utah Lines. East of Route 3, the 24th Division attacking through the Kwangdok-san ridges shouldering the Yongp'yong River gained scarcely in three days. But by 17 April resistance weakened in both division zones. On that date a company of the 6th Tank Battalion, 24th Division, moved up Route 3 within of Kumhwa without contact. On the following day, in the 25th Division zone, a battalion of the 35th Infantry, two companies of the 89th Tank Battalion and an artillery battery moved through the upper Hantan River valley within of Ch'orwon before receiving fire. Impeded by rough ground, heavy rains, and somewhat stiffer resistance beginning on 19 April, the two divisions were on the Utah Line on the 20th except at the left of the 25th Division where enemy delaying forces held up the attached Turkish Brigade along Route 33. By 20 April, the western I Corps' front lay along of the meandering Imjin, from its mouth northeastward to a point on Route 33 below Ch'orwon. At the left, the ROK 1st Division sat astride Route 1 with its tank destroyer battalion (still organized and fighting as an infantry unit) and 11th and 12th Regiments stretched out from the mouth of the Imjin to the river's Korangp'o-ri bend upstream. The 3rd Division occupied the Korangp'o-ri Route 33 sector with the attached British 29th Brigade adjacent to the ROK division and the 65th Infantry on the ground taken during its recent advance. It was a gaping front, manned for the most part in a series of separated battalion strongpoints. As the Imjin River front had developed to its present width since the beginning of the month, the two divisions manning it had patrolled extensively above the river. The patrols encountered thinly disposed forces of the KPA 8th Division along the far bank, most of them ahead of the ROK 1st Division, until the 10th, when they discovered that the KPA had vacated their positions. ROK patrols later moved along Route 1 as far as Kaesong, the ancient capital of Korea some above the Imjin, without making contact. The 8th Division appeared to have joined the remainder of the KPA I Corps west of the Ryesong River. Other ROK 1st Division and British 29th Brigade patrols ranging up to above the Imjin after 10 April began to encounter a sprinkling of PVA, mostly across the British front between Korangp'o-ri and a near ninety-degree bend in the river where its flow changes from south-east to south-west and where it receives the water of the west flowing Hantan. Although intelligence agents had in the meantime identified the PVA XIX Army Group in the general Kumch'on- Kuhwa-ri area and had discovered the neighboring PVA III Army Group (but misidentified it as the XVIII Army Group), the minor engagements within of the river were the first indication that any of these forces had displaced forward. Five prisoners taken at scattered locations between 11 and 14 April, all belonged to the 561st Regiment, 187th Division, 63rd Army of the XIX Army Group. One prisoner stated at interrogation that the 561st had a defensive mission pending the arrival of reinforcements. The light contact and wide dispersion of a single regiment did suggest a screen, but as ROK and British patrols continued to probe the thin enemy positions through 20 April, no evidence appeared of PVA forces massing behind them. The most visible evidence of enemy activity appeared as Eighth Army forces closed on the Kansas and Utah Lines were billows of smoke rising at numerous points ahead of them. By mid- April, belts of smoke up to deep lay before much of the I, IX and X Corps fronts. Air observers confirmed that enemy troops, some in groups of fifty to five hundred, were setting fire to grasslands and brush. Some observers reported that smoke generators also were being used. Fires doused by rain showers were rekindled. Sea air that frequently stagnated over the battlefront, added sea haze and moisture to the smoke and produced smog. On a number of days-varying from sector to sector rain, haze, fog, smog and particularly smoke hampered ground and air observation, the delivery of air strikes, and the adjustment of artillery fire. Though the smoke was intended to shield daylight troop movements, there was not much evidence that enemy forces were moving toward the front. During the last three days of the advance to the Utah Line the 65th Infantry captured a member of the 181st Division, part of the 60th Army of the III Army Group. Two prisoners taken by the 24th and 25th Divisions were from different regiments of the 81st Division, which belonged to the 27th Army of the IX Army Group. One of the latter told his captors that his unit would be committed to offensive operations after the 27th Army finished relieving the 26th. By 20 April these three prisoners and the sprinkling of PVA discovered above the Imjin were the only indications that fresh forces might have moved forward under the smoke. To give some order of probability to the opening of the expected enemy offensive, Eighth Army Intelligence Officer Colonel Tarkenton advised General Van Fleet on 18 April, that a \\"survey of all sources,\\" while failing to indicate conclusively any specific date or period for the initial attack, pointed to 20 April, through 1 May. Tarkenton considered the latter date especially significant since it was the \\"most important day of the year to International Communism.\\" Having learned that two fresh army groups (the XIX and III) were in the general Kumch'on-Koksan-Ich'on area, he believed the \\"greatest enemy potential\\" for a major attack to be from the north and northwest across the Imjin. As of the 20th, however, I Corps' patrols had seen no signs of offensive preparations in this sector, nor had any evidence that the PVA was about to attack appeared elsewhere. Incoming reports to Van Fleet from Corps' commanders and Colonel Tarkenton's own daily intelligence summaries all described enemy forces as maintaining a \\"defensive attitude.\\" Since all units were on or near their Utah and Kansas objectives, and since there was no clear sign that the impending enemy offensive would start immediately, Van Fleet elected to open the second phase of Operation Dauntless. In notifying General Ridgway that I and IX Corps would move toward the Wyoming Line on 21 April, Van Fleet also proposed that X, ROK III and ROK I Corps attack to secure the segment of Route 24 running northeast ahead of ROK III and I Corps to a junction with the coastal highway near the town of Kansong, above Yangyang. This move would give the two ROK Corps a supply route in the higher Taebaeks, needed in particular by ROK III Corps. To secure the road, Van Fleet wanted to hinge an advance at the eastern end of the Hwacheon Reservoir and swing the forces between the reservoir and the coast northwestward to the Alabama Line to above Route 24. Ridgway approved a sweep that would achieve the same end but with a substantially shorter eastern arc. Van Fleet set the 24th as the opening date. =Advance to the Alabama and Wyoming Lines= The I Corps' final Dauntless objectives lay in the zones of the 25th and 24th Divisions stretching north of the Utah Line to Ch'orwon and Kumhwa at the base of the Iron Triangle. Ahead of the ROK 6th Division and 1st Marine Division in the IX Corps' zone, the Wyoming Line curved southeast from the Kumhwa area to the Hwacheon Reservoir. On the 21st the two IX Corps' divisions moved to above the Kansas Line against almost no opposition. Immediately west, the 24th Division did not test the opposition below Kumhwa, but deliberately stood fast in the Kwangdok-san ridges to allow the neighboring ROK 6th Division to come abreast. In the Pogae-san heights, the 25th Division attacked toward Ch'orwon, but made no substantial progress after receiving increasing artillery fire during the day and becoming involved in hard fights right at the Utah Line, especially in the zone of the Turkish Brigade along Route 33. Neither Corps developed evidence of enemy offensive preparations during the day. The absence of opposition in the IX Corps' zone only confirmed the recent patrol reports of withdrawal. Below the Iron Triangle, the resistance that began to stiffen on 19 April had been expected to grow progressively heavier as I Corps' forces moved above the Utah Line. On the Imjin front, daylight patrols working above the river again found only a scattering of PVA. General Milburn concluded in an evening wrap-up report to General Van Fleet that the \\"enemy attitude remains defensive.\\" The only appreciable change in enemy activity on the 21st occurred east of the Hwacheon Reservoir in the X Corps' zone. North and northeast of Yanggu, 2nd and 7th Division patrols, after several days of nearly fruitless searches, located several groups of 600-1000 KPA immediately above the Corps' front. These groups suggested, as General Almond reported to Van Fleet, that a relief or reinforcement of enemy units was taking place. On the 21st, the Eighth Army G-2 reported that his information still was not firm enough to \\"indicate the nearness\\" of the impending enemy offensive with any degree of certainty. A worrisome fact, as he earlier had pointed out to General Van Fleet, was that a lack of offensive signs did not necessarily mean that the opening of the offensive was distant. In preparing past attacks, PVA forces had successfully concealed their locations until they moved into forward assembly areas immediately before they attacked. The first indication that the enemy would repeat this pattern appeared during the night when I Corps' patrols reconnoitering above the Imjin ran into PVA positions that were stronger and nearer the river than those encountered during past searches. There was no question that the XIX Army Group was setting out a covering force. More evidence appeared on 22 April, as I and IX Corps continued their advance toward the Wyoming Line. The progress of the attack resembled that on the previous day, IX Corps' forces making easy moves of , the two I Corps divisions being limited to shorter gains by heavier resistance. On the east flank of the advance, the Hwacheon Dam, defended so stoutly by PVA 39th Army forces only a few days earlier, fell to the 1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment without a fight. But a PVA captive taken elsewhere in the 1st Marine Division zone during the afternoon told interrogators that an attack would be opened before the day was out. In mid-afternoon the ROK 6th Division captured several members of the PVA 60th Division and, immediately west, the 24th Division took captives from the PVA 59th Division. These two divisions belonged to the fresh 20th Army. The full IX Army Group had reached the front. In the 25th Division zone on the west flank of the advance, six PVA who blundered into the hands of the Turkish Brigade along Route 33 during the afternoon were members of a survey party from the 2nd Motorized Artillery Division. The division's guns, according to the officer in charge, were being positioned to support an attack scheduled to start after dark. For the scheduled advance to the Alabama Line east of the Hwacheon Reservoir, the X Corps/ROK III Corps boundary was to be shifted west at noon on 23 April, to give the ROK III Corps, which had been operating with only the ROK 3rd Division on line, a two-division front. The III Corps' reserve division, the ROK 7th Division, began occupying the added frontage on the 22nd, its 5th Regiment relieving the ROK 36th Regiment, 5th Division and the X Corps' right early in the evening. On 23 April, the incoming division's 3rd Regiment was to move into a gap directly above Inje between the 5th Regiment and the 35th Regiment, now the right flank unit of the 5th Division. The latter's 36th Regiment meanwhile assembled below its former position in preparation for moving west into the redrawn 5th Division zone the following day as the remainder of the ROK 7th Division came into its new area. A similar shifting of KPA forces above the X and ROK III Corps was indicated when the ROK 5th Division, previously in contact with the KPA 45th Division, III Corps above Inje, captured a member of the KPA 12th Division, V Corps. Farther east, the ROK 3rd Division, which had had almost no contact since reaching the Kansas Line, received hard local attacks that drove in its outposts and pressed its main line before easing in the evening of 22 April. Thus the KPA III Corps could be shifting west toward the reservoir and the KPA V Corps returning to the line from a point above Inje eastward. Aerial reconnaissance after daybreak on 22 April, reported a general forward displacement of enemy formations from rear assemblies northwest of I Corps and north of both I and IX Corps, also extensive troop movements, both north and south, on the roads above Yanggu and Inje east of the Hwacheon Reservoir. Though air strikes punished the moving troops bodies, air observers reported the southward march of enemy groups with increasing frequency during the day. On the basis of the sightings west of the Hwacheon Reservoir, it appeared that the enemy forces approaching I Corps would mass evenly across the corps front while those moving toward IX Corps would concentrate on the front of the ROK 6th Division. Civilians entering I Corps' lines from the northwest confirmed the enemy approach from that direction, and through the day British 29th Brigade forces along the Imjin observed enemy patrols investigating the north bank of the river for crossing sites. The 3rd Division meanwhile found evidence that the PVA III Army Group was included in the forward displacement when a patrol operating north along Route 33 above the division's right flank picked up a member of the 34th Division, which belonged to the group's 12th Army. At 17:00, 25th Division air observers reported a long column of trucks, some towing artillery pieces, moving down Route 33 toward the Turkish Brigade. Aircraft and artillery attacked the trucks until they dispersed off the road into wooded areas. By 18:00 PVA infantry were seen on Route 33 marching south in close column and just before dark were observed occupying foxholes along the sides of the road. Ten batteries of artillery kept the road and the suspected enemy artillery positions under fire. Immediately east, artillery pilots spotted PVA columns nearing 24th Division lines late in the afternoon and brought them under fire as they came within range. The approaching forces simply accepted casualties as they massed above the center of the division front. At 19:00 the division commander, General Blackshear M. Bryan, notified I Corps' headquarters that he expected to be attacked in about two hours. \\"I think this is what we have been waiting for,\\" he added. Bryan's prediction of attack on the 24th Division proved correct. The initial assault of the PVA/KPA spring offensive opened at 18:00. Aftermath On the night of 22 April, the PVA opened their Spring Offensive pushing back the UN forces across the entire front, erasing all the gains of Operations Dauntless and Rugged. The UN forces retreated to the defensive positions prepared by General Ridgway earlier, the No-Name Line north of Seoul. The Eighth Army counterattacked in May‚ÄìJune regaining the Kansas Line.

It was launched on May 20, 2018 as a social media campaign when twelve women of various political persuasions got together to launch a public campaign calling out what they perceived as anti-women remarks made by President Duterte. The social media campaign eventually took the form of live protests later held under the movement. The founders of the movement were included among the \\"25 Most Influential People on the Internet in 2018\\" list by Time. History The Babae Ako movement started out as an online campaign in May 2018. It was a response to President Rodrigo Duterte's various remarks which was seen as misogynist by critics. Among these statements was President Duterte's ruling out any female successor to outgoing Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales who was to retire on July 26, 2018, and said that he wanted a person with integrity but preferably not a woman to succeed Maria Lourdes Sereno, who was removed from her post in a quo warranto petition. Days after Duterte made the remark on the Ombudsman post, BabaeAko convenors launched the social media campaign which also drew in the participation of former Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo. Convenors of BabaeAko include journalist Inday Espina-Varona, actress Mae Paner, Socorro Reyes of Baigani, Edna Aquino of LODI, Coalition Against Trafficking in Women chief for Asia Pacific Jean Enriquez, Zena Bernardo of Bahay Amihan, lawyer Susan Villanueva, Annelle Gumihid-Sabanal of Christians for Life and Democracy ( CLAD ), Melba Magay and Fhabi Fajardo of the Institute for Studies in Asian Church and Culture (ISACC), Sharon Cabusao-Silva of Voices of Women for Justice and Peace ( VoWJP ), Gert Ranjo-Libang of the women's alliance GABRIELA and Marielle Rugas of Girls for Peace. The movement was a concept originally proposed by Bernardo. In response to President Rodrigo Duterte kissing a married Filipino woman in South Korea amidst applause from supporters on June 3, 2018, #BabaeAko mobilized its supporters and encouraged women to post video messages addressed to Duterte followed by a pledge of \\"lalaban ako\\" (). The online campaign later led to activism in real life, as demonstrators marching under the Babae Ako movement organized a protest during Independence Day on June 12, 2018. 1,000 to 1,500, including men, attended the protest. Political positions =Women in politics= The Babae Ako movement has condemned President Rodrigo Duterte's remarks on his preference in hiring a successor to former Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, who was removed from her post in a quo warranto petition.

History Wen Yuan-ning and Louise Mary Newman established the magazine together after Newman, at age 19, arrived in Shanghai. Wen, of Southeast Asian Chinese origins and educated in Singapore and the United Kingdom, had previously taught English literature at Peking University and Tsinghua University, and after moving to Shanghai became a contributing editor to the English-language weekly The China Critic.Christopher Rea, \\"Introduction,\\" in Wen Yuan-ning, and others. Imperfect Understanding: Intimate Portraits of Modern Chinese Celebrities (Amherst, NY: Cambria Press, 2018). Newman, a Chinese woman originally from Changsha, had been adopted by a British man, Frank Newman, and his Chinese wife, Mei-lan, after her biological parents abandoned her. Called \\"Marylou\\" by her father and \\"Billie\\" by her friends, she was educated in British international schools in Shanghai and previously worked at Reuters. Wen hired her after she responded to an advert for his publication. A flat on Yuyuan Road in Shanghai, not in the city's main commercial district, housed the T'en Hsia offices. Newman became known as the magazine's \\"backroom girl\\" as she edited and proofread the publication and liaised with the printer; she worked on the publication until its end. Newman later married Irishman Arthur \\"Paddy\\" Gill, a warrant officer of the Army of the United Kingdom, on January 31, 1940 and took his family name. The staffers moved to Hong Kong in circa 1937 due to the Japanese invasion of Shanghai as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War. While in Hong Kong the publication's offices were at the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building in Central. The publication ceased production after the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong on December 8, 1941. Louise Mary Gill was captured and put in an internment camp, while the editors escaped to the area known as \\"Free China\\".

The club's professional senior team was a foundation member of the Victorian Football League (now the Australian Football League) along with seven other clubs on its inception season of 1897. From the late 1960s onward, the club suffered from stadium constraints and financial difficulties that resulted in multiple merger and relocation proposals. With mounting financial pressure from creditors, the 1996 season would be Fitzroy's last season at the senior level. The club's AFL operations were merged with the ten-year-old Brisbane Football Club to become what is now the Brisbane Lions Football Club. There were as many as seven merger proposals, and two separate discussions of permanent relocation as a stand- alone entity. Despite the AFL license being taken over by Brisbane, Fitzroy Football Club Ltd remained in Melbourne. Confirmed negotiations and speculations =Sydney Lions (1980)= A plan for Fitzroy to relocate to Sydney had its beginnings in Easter 1979, when Fitzroy president Frank Bibby and Graeme Plum (Fitzroy committeeman 1979-1983) were invited by Kevin Humphries, president of the NSW Rugby League, to the Sydney Cricket Ground, for the 'Rugby League Marathon'. During the game Bibby and Plum concluded that there was a great opportunity for Australian football in Sydney and that Fitzroy should be a part of that. The club carried out a series of fact finding work, including lining up a deal with a licensed Australian rules club in North Sydney to act as a social club, finding sponsors and even lining up a bank to assist with finances, if they were given significant representation on the board. The promising initial findings encouraged some of those on the Fitzroy committee to consider a move was worthy of more investigation.Jim Main, Shake Down The Thunder, Geoff Slattery Publishing, 2006, In July 1980, President Frank Bibby stated publicly that Fitzroy was effectively bankrupt. The Club was $300,000 in debt and the deficit was expected to be $400,000 by the end of the VFL season in September. On 15 July, the Club defaulted on a cheque for $17,500 to the Australian Taxation Office, wages cheques were expected to be dishonoured that week; creditor could not be paid; an annual repayment of a major loan was six months overdue; a taxi company threatened the previous week to stop servicing the Club unless there was a significant payment on an outstanding account, and overdue maintenance work continued to force staff to work in sub-standard accommodation.Mike Sutherland, Rod Nicholson, Stewart Murrihy, The First Hundred Seasons: Fitzroy Football Club 1883-1983, Fitzroy Football Club, 1983, Bibby proposed that Fitzroy relocate to Sydney. Fitzroy's solicitor David Cotter registered the name \\"Sydney Lions.\\" The guernsey of the new Sydney Lions would have been the existing Fitzroy guernsey with the 'FFC' monogram replaced by a 'SFC' monogram. At the time Fitzroy Football Club was not incorporated (this would occur in 1981) and any significant move such as relocation needed the approval of members at an extraordinary meeting. Fitzroy held a series of these at the Fitzroy Town Hall. Finally at the end of the season, a fund raising campaign was attended by 1200 supporters at the Camberwell Civic Centre, the relocation was finally put to rest, with an announcement that Fitzroy would not be relocating to Sydney made on 19 August 1980. Three weeks later Frank Bibby announced his resignation from the Fitzroy presidency, after five years in office. Fitzroy enjoyed modest success following Frank Bibby's resignation, finishing fourth in 1981 and 1983 and fifth in 1984. However the Lions were unable to develop their existing home ground - the Junction Oval - because of financial constraints. On field success did not translate into increased membership and revenue with Fitzroy eventually moving to play home games at Victoria Park in 1985, five years after the shift to Sydney was first mooted. =Relocation and merger proposals of 1986= While the Fitzroy Lions eventually merged with the Brisbane Bears in 1996, ten years earlier there were proposals to relocate Fitzroy to Brisbane. During the 1986 season, Fitzroy was more than one million dollars in debt and few thought the club would survive to the following year; during the season, two private consortiums made bids to take control of the club and relocate it to Brisbane, a third consortium proposed to move the club to Canberra, and the club also investigated mergers with , and during the year ‚Äì but the Brisbane proposal was considered the strongest. Fitzroy's players, after training at Wesley College one Sunday morning late in the 1986 season were told of the proposal to relocate to Brisbane; knowing that Fitzroy were in desperate financial trouble, they voted almost unanimously in favour of the shift. However a saviour was found when Fitzroy-based company Hecron Pty Ltd announced a bid to buy the club and keep it in Melbourne; the VFL Board of Management rejected the Hecron purchase by a large 10‚Äì2 majority, but the company still sponsored the club, and the club was able to stay in Melbourne for another ten years.Paul Roos: Paul Roos Beyond 300, An Autobiography, Random House, 1997, =Melbourne Lions (1986, 1994)= The Melbourne Lions was to have been a new club made up from the merger of the Melbourne Football Club and the Fitzroy Football Club. The merger would have taken place at the end of 1986 and the club would have debuted in 1987. The jumper of the new team was essentially the traditional red and blue Melbourne jumper with a gold band separating the two colours, the gold Fitzroy lion logo featured on the front and a gold number on the back. Most of the merger details had been worked out in negotiations by both boards. It was established that Fitzroy chairman Leon Weigard and Melbourne president Stuart Spencer would share presidential duties, while the committee would be an even split of the current Fitzroy and Melbourne boards. The proposed merger was within a couple of days of being put to the members of Melbourne and Fitzroy for voting. However Fitzroy president Leon Weigard asked for more time in the hope that he could raise a substantial amount of money in the hope of keeping the Fitzroy Football Club as an independent entity in the then VFL (now AFL). Melbourne president Stuart Spencer then discontinued talks and the proposed merger was off.Ian Ridley and John Ridley: Urge to Merge, 2002, Melbourne and Fitzroy again discussed a merger in 1994. This time Melbourne president Ian Ridley and Fitzroy chairman Dyson Hore-Lacy conducted talks. These talks began in late July 1994 at the city offices of Noel McMahen (Melbourne's vice president). While many of the merger details were the same as in 1986, a major sticking point was Dyson Hore-Lacy's insistence that \\"Fitzroy\\" remain part of any merged club's name; for example the \\"Melbourne - Fitzroy Football Club\\". However an in-principle' tentative agreement was reached that a company called the \\"Melbourne Football Club - Fitzroy Football Club Pty Ltd\\", operating as the \\"Melbourne Lions\\" would operate in the AFL for the 1995 season.Dyson Hore- Lacy: Fitzroy, Lion Productions 2000, On Thursday 4 August 1994, Dyson Hore- Lacy met with Geoff Lord the President of the Hawthorn Football Club and John Lauritz, Hawthorn's Chief Executive Officer to discuss the possibility of a merger between Fitzroy and Hawthorn where a new club would be formed known as the \\"Hawthorn Lions.\\" However, as Fitzroy had a tentative in principle agreement with the Melbourne Football Club to merge, the proposed merger with Hawthorn was rejected. On Friday 5 August 1994, representatives of Melbourne and Fitzroy met the AFL commission who were supportive of the idea for Fitzroy and Melbourne to merge. Later that day Dyson Hore-Lacy met with Ron Casey, Peter de Rauch and Ken Montogomery of North Melbourne and informed them they were committed to merging with Melbourne. North Melbourne was informed that Fitzroy would be interested in talking to North Melbourne if the proposed merge with Melbourne did not work out. The Melbourne board decided that not only was the name a problem, but the benefits of a merger with Fitzroy were limited. Like Melbourne, Fitzroy lacked a permanent training venue and had limited resources to make any new club, a strong powerful entity. =Fitzroy Bulldogs (1989)= The Fitzroy Bulldogs was to have been a team made up from the merger of the Footscray Football Club and the Fitzroy Football Club. The merger was announced in October 1989, and the club was approved by the VFL to debut in 1990. The VFL agreeing to clear both Fitzroy's and Footscray's debts as part of the merger, and allow the new club to begin debt-free. The merger was driven by immediate financial difficulties suffered by Footscray, but the merger collapsed when Footscray supporters secured sufficient money and sponsors to save their club from extinction. =North Fitzroy Kangaroos Football Club (1996)= The North Fitzroy Kangaroos Football Club was to have been a team made up from the merger of the North Melbourne Football Club and the Fitzroy Football Club. The merger would have taken place in 1996 and the club would have debuted in 1997, but the merger didn't eventuate as Fitzroy was placed in administration during the 1996 season and the administrator accepted a merger offer from the Brisbane Bears, forming the Brisbane Lions. North Melbourne continues to play in the AFL in its original state.

The merger agreement is set to be signed by the AFL on Friday morning (5 July) subject to the AFL clubs' endorsement. * 4 July 1996 ‚Äì AFL Presidents' Meeting rejects the Fitzroy-North Melbourne merger. After a meeting between the administrator of Fitzroy and the AFL commission, the AFL commission recommends a Bears-Fitzroy merger. North Melbourne withdraws from the merger race. =Brisbane Lions (1996)= * 4 July 1996 ‚Äì A reconvened AFL presidents' meeting endorses the AFL commission's recommendation of a Brisbane Bears-Fitzroy merger. Fitzroy today Fitzroy Football Club was completely gutted by the administrator at the end of 1996, leaving a club that temporarily only had a board of directors and shareholders. The AFL, the Brisbane Bears and the Administrator had done a deal where Brisbane took on Fitzroy's assigned debt to Nauru as a registered charge and in return the Bears were authorised by the AFL to assume Fitzroy's branding in the AFL. For two years, the Brisbane Bears held the registered charge over Fitzroy Football Club's head threatening to liquidate the club until in 1999 Allan Piper had the charge removed.. From that point onwards, Fitzroy Football Club started re-accumulating assets, trademarking the FFC logo, launching a \\"Fitzroy Shop\\", which sold Fitzroy jumpers and other merchandise, issuing club memberships to supporters, and slowly getting back on its feet as an operating football club. In 1999-2000, the Fitzroy Football Club sponsored the Coburg Football Club in the VFL who temporarily renamed themselves the Coburg-Fitzroy Lions. This arrangement ended for the 2001 season when under the AFL-VFL alignment system, Coburg aligned with the Richmond Football Club to become known as the Coburg Tigers. Meanwhile, in the wake of Fitzroy leaving the AFL and having temporarily no football operations, the University Reds sought to fill some of the void (and thereby gaining more support) by renaming themselves the 'Fitzroy Reds', adopting (with the Fitzroy Football Club's blessing and sponsorship) the Fitzroy jumper and playing out of Fitzroy Football Club's traditional home, the Brunswick Street Oval. However, as Fitzroy Football Club further increased its assets and profile it was felt that two separate football clubs called 'Fitzroy' wasn't the most efficient way to rebuild Fitzroy's profile in the Victorian footballing community. In December 2008 the Fitzroy Reds Football Club terminated its membership of the VAFA, transferred all its assets to the Fitzroy Football Club and ceased to exist as an entity. In return the Fitzroy Football Club (by special dispensation from the VAFA), took the Fitzroy Reds' place in the VAFA competition. Also the Fitzroy Football Club agreed to add \\"incorporating the Fitzroy Reds\\" to their logo and name. Today the club fields amateur and semi professional teams in the Victorian Amateur Football Association, Victorian Women's Football League and various other junior leagues respectively.

After winning one minor race as a two year old he emerged as a top-class stayer in the following year, winning the Queen's Vase and Goodwood Cup as well as finishing a close third in the St Leger. As a four-year-old he won the Yorkshire Cup, Ascot Gold Cup, a second Goodwood Cup and the Lonsdale Cup, securing a ¬£1 million bonus for winning all four races, and ended the year by winning the British Champions Long Distance Cup. In 2019 he repeated his victories in the Yorkshire Cup, Ascot Gold Cup and Lonsdale Cup, and won a third Goodwood Cup, giving him a second ¬£1 million bonus. With jockey Frankie Dettori on board, on 18 June 2020, Stradivarius won his third Ascot Gold Cup (by 10 lengths) and on 28 July 2020, he won his record fourth Goodwood Cup. Background Stradivarius is a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze and four white socks bred in Ireland by his owner Bjorn Nielsen. He was sent into training with John Gosden at Newmarket, Suffolk. He is from the fourth crop of foals sired by Sea the Stars who won the 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 2009. His other major winners have included Harzand, Taghrooda and Sea The Moon. Stradivarius's dam Private Life won two minor races in France and was placed twice Listed races. She was a granddaughter of the outstanding racemare Pawneese. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Stradivarius made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over eight and a half furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse on 5 October in which he started at odds of 3/1 and finished fifth of the nine runners behind Contrapposto. Two weeks later, in a similar event over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse he ran fourth behind his stablemate Cracksman. On 7 November the colt stated favourite for a one-mile maiden on the synthetic tapeta track at Newcastle Racecourse. Ridden as on his debut by Robert Havlin he led for most of the way and rallied after being headed in the closing stages to win in a blanket finish from Bowerman, Mutarabby and Lethal Impact. =2017: three-year-old season= Stradivarius began his second season in handicap races. Over ten furlongs Beverley Racecourse on 19 April he carried a weight of 131 pounds and won \\"readily\\" by six lengths from Election Day. At Chester Racecourse in May he was assigned 133 pounds for a handicap over one and a half miles and was beaten half a length by Here And Now,to whom he was conceding 13 pounds. At Royal Ascot on 23 June, the colt was stepped up in class and distance to contest the Group 2 Queen's Vase over 14 furlongs in which he was partnered by Andrea Atzeni. Starting the 11/2 second choice in the betting he overcame interference in the straight to take the lead inside the final furlong and on by a neck from Count Octave. On 1 August at Goodwood Racecourse Stradivarius was stepped up to Group 1 class and matched against older stayers in the Goodwood Cup over two miles. Ridden by Atzeni he started the 6/1 second favourite behind Big Orange (winner of the race for the last two years) while the other runners included US Army Ranger, Wicklow Brave (Irish St Leger), Sheikhzayedroad (Northern Dancer Turf Stakes), Pallasator (Doncaster Cup), Qewy (Geelong Cup), Higher Power (Northumberland Plate), High Jinx (Prix du Cadran) and Sweet Selection (Cesarewitch). After racing in mid-division as Big Orange led, Stradivarius began to make progress three furlongs out. He overtook the favourite approaching the final furlong and \\"stayed on strongly\\" to win by one and three quarter length with a gap of three and half lengths back to Desert Skyline in third. John Gosden commented \\"He's not the biggest of horses and it was a bit rough on the first bend. He didn't panic and it opened up for us. He's a lovely little horse\\". At Doncaster Racecourse on 16 September Stradivarius started 9/2 second favourite behind Capri in what appeared to be a strong edition of the St Leger. He made steady progress on the inside in the straight and finished third, beaten half a length and a short head by Capri and Crystal Ocean with Rekindling in fourth. On his final start of the year he took on older horses again the British Champions Long Distance Cup over two miles at Ascot in October in which he finished third behind Order of St George and Torcedor, beaten a length by the winner. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Stradivarius was given a rating of 118, making him the 90th best racehorse in the world. =2018: four-year-old season= On his first appearance as a four-year-old Stradivarius started 4/6 favourite for the Yorkshire Cup over one and three quarter miles at York Racecourse. Ridden by Dettori he took the lead in the last quarter mile and accelerated away from his rivals to win \\"readily\\" by three lengths from Desert Skyline. After the race Dettori said \\"He's a star ‚Äì it's very rare you get a stayer with a turn of foot, but that is what he has got. It's a deadly combination.\\" The colt's second appearance at Royal Ascot on 21 June saw him made 7/4 joint favourite with Order of St George for the Gold Cup over two and a half miles, with the third choice in the betting being Vazirabad, a French gelding whose victories included the Prix du Cadran and two editions of the Prix Royal Oak. The other six runners included Desert Skyline, Torcedor, Sheikhzayedroad and Max Dynamite (2nd and 3rd in the last two Melbourne Cups). Dettori settled the colt behind the leaders before moving forward to make his challenge in the straight. Stradivarius took the lead from Torcedor a furlong out and kept on \\"gamely\\" to win by three quarters of a length from Vazirabad. Dettori commented \\"He was a lion, he fought everything off. The crowd lifted him.\\" On 31 July Stradivarius attempted to repeat his 2017 success in the Goodwood Cup and started 4/5 favourite against six opponents headed by Torcedor, Idaho and Desert Skyline. Atzeni (deputising for the suspended Dettori) tracked the leaders as Torcedor set the pace. He moved into second place in the straight, caught Torcedor inside the final furlong, and won by half a length. His victory meant that a win in the Lonsdale Cup at York in August would earn his owner the WH Stayers‚Äô Million, a ¬£1 million bonus offered for a horse who was able to win the Ascot Gold Cup, Goodwood Cup and Lonsdale Cup in the same season. Commenting on the horse's victory, and his prospects of securing the bonus, Gosden said \\"He's got a lot of heart, and he was very determined to go and win his race. That [Lonsdale Cup] would be the obvious choice, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve got it very well insured! He's the most charming horse to be around. He's a lovely ride\\". Stradivarius was partnered by Dettori when he started the 4/11 favourite for the Lonsdale Cup on 24 August. His opponents on this occasion included Idaho, Desert Skyline, Max Dynamite, Count Octave and Red Verdon. He won the race and earned the ¬£1 million bonus, beating Count Octave by one and a half lengths after taking the lead a furlong out. Interviewed after the race Gosden commented \\"he has managed to get over every hurdle and he must feel like he has just gone 12 rounds with Muhammad Ali. He is not a big horse but he is fabulous and he showed a real mentality. Full marks to the owner, he's been trying to breed a Derby winner for years and he ends up with a Cup horse\\". Stradivarius ended his season in the Group 2 British Champions Long Distance Cup at Ascot on 20 October although Gosden had considered withdrawing him on account of the soft ground. He started favourite again, with the best-fancied of his five rivals being the Aidan O'Brien-trained three-year-olds Flag of Honour (winner of the Irish St Leger) and Sir Erec. Approaching the final turn he was boxed in on the rail and looked unlikely to get a clear run but Dettori found a gap on the inside and sent him to the front two furlongs out. Stradivarius stayed on well and won by one and a half lengths from the Doncaster Cup winner Thomas Hobson. Dettori said \\"I had half a chance and took it, but you can only do that when you have plenty of horse. He's been a model of consistency and owns the crown of being champion stayer ‚Äì you can't take it away from him. He's all heart\\". At the 2018 Cartier Awards, Stradivarius was named Cartier Champion Stayer. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Stradivarius was given a rating of 120, making him the 42nd best racehorse in the world. =2019: five-year-old season= Stradivarius began his fourth campaign with an attempt to repeat his 2018 success in the Yorkshire Cup and started at odds of 4/5 against seven opponents including Ispolini (Nad Al Sheba Trophy), Southern France (Yeats Stakes), Mildenberger (Feilden Stakes) Sevenna Star (Sandown Classic Trial) and Desert Skyline. After tracking the leaders he took the lead entering the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Southern France. Dettori commented \\"He was a bit rusty and it was a bit of a sprint... he's a fighter. He's got me out of trouble so many times\\", while Gosden said \\"He's a bit of a streetfighter. He was roaring and shouting and slightly misbehaving before the race but then he goes out there and races and gets into a different zone... He's obviously the best stayer I‚Äôve ever trained... It's like all of us, the older we get, the more we need galvanising.\\" On 20 June Stradivarius ran for the second time in the Ascot Gold Cup and started favourite despite Gosden's concerns that he would be unsuited by the soft ground. The best fancied of his opponents were Dee Ex Bee (runner up in the 2018 Epsom Derby) and Cross Counter while the other eight runners included Capri, Flag of Honour, Thomas Hobson, Called To The Bar (Prix Vicomtesse Vigier) and Magic Circle (Henry II Stakes). After being settled by Dettori just behind the leaders he was boxed in on the inside early in the straight before being switched to the left to obtain a clear run. He took the lead a furlong out and won by a length and a nose from Dee Ex Bee and the 66/1 outsider Master of Reality. After the race Dettori said \\"What an amazing horse he is. He got me out of trouble. He's a horse for the big occasion\\". On 30 July Stradivarius attempted to emulate Double Trigger by becoming the second horse to win a third Goodwood Cup. Dee Ex Bee and Cross Counter renewed their opposition, while the best fancied of the other five runners was the three-year-old Dashing Willoughby (Queen's Vase). After racing in mid division he moved up to take the lead approaching the final furlong and looked likely to win comfortably but as Dettori celebrated by waving to the crowd, Dee Ex Bee rallied strongly and the final winning margin was only a neck. Dettori admitted that he celebrated prematurely before saying \\"Stradivarius wastes very little energy and he's very tough mentally. He's never going to be flash and win by 10 but he gets the job done. All I have to do is put him in the place to win the race and he does the rest, he's a perfect partner\\". It was expected that Stradivarius would go straight to the British Champions Long Distance Cup, but Gosden opted to give him a run in the Doncaster Cup on 13 September. Following the late withdrawal of Dee Ex Bee he went off at odds of 1/9, with the best-fancied of his four opponents being the seven-year-old Barsanti. He recorded his tenth consecutive win as he took the lead a furlong out and won easily by one and three quarter lengths from Cleonte. His success made him the seventh horse after Isonomy, Alycidon, Souepi, Le Moss, Longboat and Double Trigger to win the Stayers' Triple Crown. On 19 October Stradivarius attempted to win his eleventh consecutive race as he ran for the third time in the British Champions Long Distance Cup and went off the 8/13 favourite. The closing stages saw Stradivarius and the four-year-old Kew Gardens draw away from the field and although the favourite gained a narrow lead a furlong out, his younger rival rallied in the final strides to win by a nose. On 12 November Stradivarius was named Champion Stayer at the Cartier Awards, taking honour for the second time. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Stradivarius was given a rating of 122, making him the nineteenth best horse in the world, and the best over extended distances. =2020: six- year-old season= The 2020 flat racing season in England was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Stradivarius began his campaign in the Coronation Cup which was run that year at Newmarket on 5 June, and saw him racing over one and a half miles for the first time in three years. He was in contention for most of the way before being outpaced in the last quarter mile and came home third behind Ghaiyyath and Anthony Van Dyck. Gosden commented \\"That was absolutely perfect and what we expected... he hasn‚Äôt run for a very long time. He'll have needed that today as he's a bigger horse again. He's six years old and he's fully developed in every sense. He's bigger and rounder and you could notice that in the paddock\\". At Royal Ascot on 18 June Stradivarius attempted to become the third horse after Sagaro and Yeats to win a third consecutive Ascot Gold Cup and was made the 4/5 favourite ahead of seven opponents including Technician, Cross Counter, Moonlight Spirit (Prix de Lut√®ce), Nayef Road (Sagaro Stakes), Prince of Arran (Geelong Cup) and Withhold (Northumberland Plate). Dettori settled the favourite in mid-division as Nayef Road set the pace and then made steady progress on the outside as the field entered the straight. Stradivarius took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew right away from his opponents in the closing stages to win by ten lengths. On 28 July, despite giving substantial weight (15 lbs) to the younger horse Santiago and getting boxed in before the final run to victory, Stradivarius won a record fourth Goodwood Cup by one length. His next start was the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe where he came seventh in the eleven horse field.

This technology is utilized to detect and isolate transient events such as mortar or rocket firings, munition impacts, and other explosive events. It consists of an array of acoustic sensor stations that are linked via radio to a receiving base. Each sensor has the ability to monitor hostile territory, international borders, and/or detect indirect weapon fire covertly with 24-hour surveillance. These small, inexpensive, non-imaging sensors can monitor large areas without a significant need for power sources and manpower. System concept Three to five acoustic arrays are set up in a roughly equilateral configuration several hundred meters from each other. Each array detects an impulsive event such as motor/rocket launch and determines the line of bearing from the array to the launch site. The lines of bearing from each array are transmitted via radio link to a central point where the results are combined to establish the location of the firing point through triangulation. Impact points are detected and located the same way. Results are displayed on a georeferenced map as icons using a laptop PC. The system generally detects the weapons out to their maximum range and screens out false results due to local noises from vehicles, people, etc. UTAMS can locate the x, y, and z directions from an acoustic signal and are sensitive in the 20-500Hz frequency range. Noise canceling algorithms produced a continuous resonance that UTAMS separated out through adaptive filtering. Processing for infra-sound was combined with acoustic microphones and deployed in Iraq with smaller sensor arrays to detect rockets, small arms, and mortars. History In 2001, ARL fielded infrasonic sensors (<20 Hz) in the Republic of Korea to meet a U.S. Army requirement for passive surveillance systems to detect artillery fire (8-10Hz) in the vicinity of the Demilitarized Zone. To meet the new requirement that came out of Iraq in 2004, ARL reconfigured the infrasonic sensor processing box to be used with acoustic sensors for the UTAMS detection of mortar fire (<100 Hz). The Rapid Equipping Force funded UTAMS in 2005 and 2006 for use in Iraq for Forward Operating Base protection. In 2006, UTAMS II was designed, based on lessons learned from previous fielding, and automatic alignment with two GPS sensors for precise pointing direction. Solar panels with batteries were used as power sources to reduce power requirements. The Miniature Acoustic Warning System (MAWS) is a mobile UTAMS in a smaller package. In 2012, the Program Manager Ground Sensors took over fielding. Extended capabilities UTAMS were deployed with various configurations since the program started in 2004. One such configuration was the integration of UTAMS with the Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) and the Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS) aerostat surveillance systems as well as the Rocket Launch Spotter. ARL also demonstrated increased range detection and localization capabilities by mounting a UTAMS variant under a tethered aerostat, named the aerostat-mounted UTAMS system (AMUS). In each of these systems, UTAMS would send acoustic detection locations to cue camera systems to focus surveillance efforts on areas where suspicious activities are occurring. The capability to review past events was added to allow the user to analyze historical sensor detection and target localization. Live data is continuously being processed by the ground station; however, users can view previous events in the review mode. To share critical situational awareness information on the battlefield, UTAMS provided a flexible message output system to transmit sensor and target detection. Recognition In 2004, the UTAMS Mortar, Rocket, Explosive Locator System was awarded the U.S. Army's Greatest Inventions.

About the Expedition  The Expedition looked in particular at the meteorology, topography and prehistory in Mongolia, the Gobi Desert and Xinjiang. Chiang Kai-shek was a patron of the Expedition. * 1927-32 - from Beijing - via Baotou, Mongolia, the Gobi Desert, Xinjiang - to Urumqi * 1933-34 - from Beijing to Kashgar, with a view to constructing two roads suitable for cars Between 1927 and 1935, Hedin led an international Sino- Swedish Expedition which investigated the meteorological, topographic and prehistoric situation in Mongolia, the Gobi Desert and Xinjiang. Hedin described it as a peripatetic university in which the participating scientists worked almost independently, while he‚Äîlike a local manager‚Äînegotiated with local authorities, made decisions, organized whatever was necessary, raised funds and recorded the route followed. He gave archaeologists, astronomers, botanists, geographers, geologists, meteorologists and zoologists from Sweden, Germany and China an opportunity to participate in the expedition and carry out research in their areas of specialty. Hedin met Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, who thereupon became a patron of the expedition. The Sino-Swedish Expedition was honored with a Chinese postage stamp series which had a print run of 25,000. The four stamps show camels at a camp with the expedition flag and bear the Chinese text, \\"Postal Service of the Prosperous Middle Kingdom\\" and in Latin underneath, \\"Scientific Expedition to the Northwestern Province of China 1927-1933\\". A painting in the Beijing Palace Museum entitled Nomads in the Desert served as model for the series. Of the 25,000 sets, 4,000 were sold across the counter and 21,500 came into the possession of the expedition. Hedin used them to finance the expedition, selling them for a price of five dollars per set. The stamps were unwelcome at the time due to the high price Hedin was selling them at, but years later became valuable treasures among collectors. Envelope of a letter from Hedin to his sister Alma with Chinese stamps issued on the occasion of the Sino-Swedish Expedition The first part of the expedition, from 1927 to 1932, led from Beijing via Baotou to Mongolia, over the Gobi Desert, through Xinjiang to √úr√ºmqi, and into the northern and eastern parts of the Tarim Basin. The expedition had a wealth of scientific results which are being published up to the present time. For example, the discovery of specific deposits of iron, manganese, oil, coal and gold reserves was of great economic relevance for China. In recognition of his achievements, the Berlin Geographical Society presented him with the Ferdinand von Richthofen Medal in 1933; the same honor was also awarded to Erich von Drygalski for his Gauss Expedition to the Antarctic; and to Alfred Philippson for his research on the Aegean Region. From the end of 1933 to 1934, Hedin led‚Äîon behalf of the Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing‚Äîa Chinese expedition to investigate irrigation measures and draw up plans and maps for the construction of two roads suitable for automobiles along the Silk Road from Beijing to Xinjiang. Following his plans, major irrigation facilities were constructed, settlements erected, and roads built on the Silk Road from Beijing to Kashgar, which made it possible to completely bypass the rough terrain of Tarim Basin. One aspect of the geography of central Asia which intensively occupied Hedin for decades was what he called the ‚Äúwandering lake‚Äù Lop Nur. In May 1934, he began a river expedition to this lake. For two months he navigated the Kaidu River and the Kum-Darja to Lop Nur, which had been filled with water since 1921. After the lake dried out in 1971 as a consequence of irrigation activities, the above-mentioned transportation link enabled the People's Republic of China to construct a nuclear weapon test site at Lop Nur. His caravan of truck lorries was hijacked by the Chinese Muslim General Ma Zhongying who was retreating from northern Xinjiang along with his Kuomintang 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) from the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. While Hedin was detained by Ma Zhongying, he met General Ma Hushan, and Kemal Kaya Effendi. Ma Zhongying's adjutant claimed to Hedin that Ma Zhongying had the entire region of Tian-shan-nan-lu (southern Xinjiang) under his control and Sven could pass through safely without any trouble. Hedin did not believe his assertions. Some of Ma Zhongying's Tungan (Chinese speaking Muslim) troops attacked Hedin's expedition by shooting at their vehicles. For the return trip, Hedin selected the southern Silk Road route via Hotan to Xi'an, where the expedition arrived on 7 February 1935. He continued on to Beijing to meet with President Lin Sen and to Nanjing to Chiang Kai-shek. He celebrated his 70th birthday on 19 February 1935 in the presence of 250 members of the Kuomintang government, to whom he reported interesting facts about the Sino-Swedish Expedition. On this day, he was awarded the Brilliant Jade Order, Second Class. At the end of the expedition, Hedin was in a difficult financial situation. He had considerable debts at the German-Asian Bank in Beijing, which he repaid with the royalties and fees received for his books and lectures. In the months after his return, he held 111 lectures in 91 German cities as well as 19 lectures in neighboring countries. To accomplish this lecture tour, he covered a stretch as long as the equator, by train and by car‚Äîin a time period of five months. He met Adolf Hitler in Berlin before his lecture on 14 April 1935.

C. elegans is notable for the presence of a scissor like mechanism consisting of a straight edge on the back of the head and corresponding serrated edges on the first thoracic segment, these were initially suggested to used by the female to grasp the male during mating, but the structure is not sexually dimorphic, so a use to hold prey was subsequently suggested. Its morphology suggests a predatory habit inhabiting shrubs and trees. In 2020 a Caputoraptor elegans nymph was described that was in the process of being predated upon by a Ceratomyrmex hell ant.

These temples are built around the place where major Hindu deity Lord Krishna was born. The place holds religious significance since the 6th century BC. In 20th century, the new temple complex was built with the financial help from industrialists containing the Keshavdeva temple, the Garbha Griha temple at the birthplace and the Bhagavata Bhavan. History Ogee arches and balconies containing human figures, rear view, circa 2nd century BCE, found from archeological excavation of Katra Keshavdeva. Now in left left According to Hindu traditions, Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva in a prison cell where they were confined by his maternal uncle Kansa, a king of Mathura, due to prophecy of his death by the child of Devaki, and a temple dedicated to Krishna was built the birthplace by his great grandson Vajranabh. The present site known as Krishna Janmasthan () was known as Katra () Keshavdeva. The archaeological excavations of the site had revealed pottery and terracotta from 6th century BC. It also produced some Jain sculptures as well as a large Buddhist complex including Yasha Vihara, a monastery, belonging to Gupta period (). Cunningham opined that Hindus may have occupied the former Buddhist site. The Vaishnava temple may have erected on the place as early as the first century. Some late 8th century inscriptions mentions donations to the site by the Rashtrakutas. In 1017 or 1018, Mahmud of Ghazni attacked and plundered Mahaban. Ghazni's scribe, though not accompanying him on the expedition, Al Utbi describes in his Tarikh-i-Yamini neighbouring holy town which is identified as Mathura. He wrote, \\"In the centre of the city there was a huge and magnificent temple, which the people believed wasn‚Äôt built by men but by the angels... Any description of the temple, either in words or in pictures, would fall short and fail to convey its beauty.\\" Mahmud of Ghazni wrote, \\"if any one wished to construct a building equal to it, he would not be able to do so without spending a hundred million dinars, and the work would occupy two hundred years, even though the most able and experienced workmen were employed.\\" He ordered to burn all the temples and demolish them. He plundered gold and silver idols and carried away a load of hundred camels. A stone inscription in Sanskrit found from the site mentions that in Vikrama Samvat 1207 (1150) a person named Jajja who may have been a vassal of Gahadavala king built a Vishnu temple which was 'brilliantly white and touching the clouds'. Vaishnava saints Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Vallabhacharya visited Mathura in early 16th century. Abdullah, in the reign of Mughal emperor Jehangir, mentions in Tarikh-i-Daudi the destruction of Mathura and its temples by Delhi Sultan Sikandar Lodi in 16th century. Lodi had prohibited Hindus from bathing in the river and shaving of heads on the banks as well. In the reign of Jehangir, in 1618, Raja Veer Singh Deva Bundela of Orchha had built a temple at the cost of thirty-three lakhs. A French traveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier visited Mathura in 1650 and had described the octagonal temple built in red sandstone. The Italian traveller Niccolao Manucci, who worked in the Mughal court, has also described the temple. Mughal prince Dara Shikoh had patronised the temple and donated a railing to the temple. The railing was removed by Mathura governor Abdun Nabi Khan on the order of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and he built Jama mosque on the ruins of a Hindu temple in the city center. During the Jat rebellion in Mathura, Abdul Nabi Khan was killed in 1669. Aurangzeb attacked Mathura in response and destroyed the Keshavdeva temple in 1670, later building the Shahi Eidgah on part of its area. Its idols were meanwhile buried beneath the steps of the Jahanara mosque in Agra. = Since 19th century = left Garbha Griha shrine (left) behind the Eidgah (centre) and entrance of the Keshavdeva temple (right), 1988. Mathura came under British control in 1804. The East India Company auctioned the land of Katra and it was purchased in 1815 by Raja Patnimal, a wealthy banker of Banaras. Raja Patnimal wanted to build the temple but could not do so. His descendants inherited the land of Katra. His descendant Raj Krishna Das was challenged, for the ownership of 13.37 acres of land on which the shrine and the Eidgah is situated, in two civil suits by the Muslims of Mathura but the Allahabad High Court ruled in favour of Raj Krishna Das in both suits in 1935. Kailash Nath Katju and Madanmohan Chaturvedi had helped in lawsuits. Politician and educationist Madan Mohan Malaviya acquired the land from Raj Krishna Das on 7 February 1944 at the cost of Rs. 13000 with financial help of Industrialist Jugal Kishore Birla. Following death of Malaviya, Jugal Kishore Birla formed a trust named Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Trust, later registered as the Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan, on 21 February 1951 and acquired the land. Jugal Kishore Birla entrusted the construction of the new temple with another industrialist and philanthropist Jaidayal Dalmia. The construction of the temple complex was started in October 1953 with leveling of lands and completed in February 1982. His eldest son Vishnu Hari Dalmia succeeded him and served on the Trust until his death. His grandson Anurag Dalmia is Joint Managing Trustee on the Trust. The construction was funded by other business families including Ramnath Goenka. In 1968, the Trust and the Shahi Eidgah committee reached an agreement which granted the temple land to the Trust and the management of the Eidgah to the Eidgah committee as well as no legal claim of the Trust on the Eidgah. Following the demolition of the Babri Mosque in 1992, Manohar Lal Sharma, a resident of Vrindavan, has filed a petition in the Mathura District Court challenging the 1968 agreement as well as a petition to quash the Places of Religious Worship Act of 1991 which preserves the status quo as on 15 August 1947 for all places of worship. Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar was the first chairman of the Trust. He was succeeded by M. A. Ayyangar, followed by Akhandananda Saraswati and Ramdev Maharaj. Nritya Gopal Das is the present chairman. Hindu nationalists claim that the prison cell where Krishna was born is in the basement of the Eidgah mosque. An underground cell believed to be the place where Krishna was born exists behind the qibla wall of the Eidgah.

The construction of the temple started on 29 June 1957 and inaugurated on 6 September 1958 by Hanuman Prasad Poddar. It is located south of the Shahi Eidgah. =Garbha Griha shrine= It is said that Shahi Eidgah was constructed on the sabhamandapa (assembly hall) of the original temple and the garbha griha (sanctum sactorum) was left. It is considered as the place of the prison cell where Krishna is believed to have born. A marble pavilion and an underground prison cell were built on the place with spacious veranda. There is shrine near it dedicated to eight-handed goddess Yogmaya. It is located against the rear wall of the Shahi Eidgah. =Bhagavata Bhavan= The construction of the temple dedicated to Shrimad Bhagavata was started on 11 February 1965 and the installation ceremony of the deities were held on 12 February 1982. It includes five shrines: the main shrine having six-feet tall couple of Radha and Krishna; the shrine of Balarama, Subhadra and Jagannatha on right; the temple of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita on left; Garuda Stambha (pillar) and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in front of Jagannatha shrine and Hanuman in front of Ram shrine; the temple of Durga and the temple with Shivalinga. The ceiling, walls and pillars of the assembly hall are adorned with frescoes depicting life events of Krishna and his associates and devotees. The text of Bhagavad Gita engraved on copper- plates adorn the walls of the parikrama (circumambulation) of the main temple. There are statues of Malaviya and Birla in the complex. Other constructions include the Ayurveda Bhavan, International Guest House, shops, library and open space for performances. = Potra Kund = There is a large and deep stepped water tank, Potra Kund or Pavitra Kund, in south-east of the Janmasthan temple which is said to have been used for the first bath of child Krishna after his birth. The steps of the tank were built by Mahadji Scindia in 1782. They were restored by his descendants in 1850.  Culture  The temple is one of the most visited temple of India. Janmashtami, Diwali and Holi are the major festival celebrated at the temple.

Early life Floyd Swink was born in Villa Park, Illinois in 1921. While attending York High School, he picked up an interest in local botany and explored natural areas in the Chicago region with his brother. As a young man, he worked as a professional and competitive speed typist, achieving speeds of 190 words per minute and demonstrating typewriters for L.C. Smith and Corona Typewriter Company in downtown Chicago. His speed was impressive, but his showmanship and eidetic memory more so, such as keeping nickels perched on his knuckles, typing the capitals of the states in alphabetical order while he was reading a book upside down.\\" He served as a typist in the U.S. Navy in a Chicago recruiting station between 1942 and 1945. Careers =Early botanical studies= Floyd Swink spent most of his career teaching plant and animal identification and creating works that allowed others to teach themselves with the help of a book. He studied plants largely on his own throughout his early 20s, but in 1946 he began to study intently under Julian Steyermark, a researcher and botanical curator at the Field Museum of Natural History. The two spent weekends collecting plants in Missouri as part of Steyermark's research there, culminating in his publishing of Flora of Missouri in 1963. Swink struck up a correspondence with noted Indiana botanist Charles Deam, author of Flora of Indiana, in 1947. He quickly won Deam's respect as a rising young botanist. They eventually met for a botanical outing with two other Indiana botanists. Deam wrote to Swink shortly after the trip saying, \\"no Prof. of the Chicago U. can equal you. Few can.\\" =Poisonous plants= Between 1949 and 1955, Swink was a professor of botany, zoology, pharmacognosy, and entomology as well as a part-time student at the College of Pharmacy of the University of Illinois at Chicago. He was nationally- recognized as an authority on poisonous plants, serving as an expert consultant to hospitals around the country in cases of poisoning and potentially poisonous plant identification. =Plants of the Chicago Region= Swink published his first book in 1953: A guide to the wild flowering plants of the Chicago region. Between 1957 and 1960, he was employed as a naturalist with the Forest Preserve District of Cook County. In 1960, he joined The Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois as the director of education, teaching botany and natural history. He became the arboretum‚Äôs plant taxonomist in 1963. He continued to work for the Morton Arboretum for almost 40 years. Few and out-of-date botanical resources were available to Chicago area botanists in the 1960s. At the request of Northern Illinois University's Dr. Herbert Lamp, in 1965 Swink typed up a list of plants from M. L. Fernald's 8th edition of Gray's Manual that included only those species found in the Chicago area. It became known by naturalists as the \\"Lamp List.\\" After several years fervently collecting plant specimens and county records throughout the region, Swink published Plants of the Chicago Region in 1969. Only 250 copies were printed and it quickly sold out. This regional flora compiled wild plant occurrences from counties in northeastern Illinois, southeastern Wisconsin, northern Indiana, and southwestern Michigan‚Äîan area delimited by what was considered a reasonable a day trip from Chicago. In contrast with other floras which were sometimes deemed \\"too recondite for the weekend botanist,\\" the plants were sorted alphabetically by genus rather than in phylogenetic order and author citations were excluded, to the disapproval of some other contemporary botanists. Plants of the Chicago Region was also distinctive in providing lists of \\"associated\\" plant species for each entry, and with later editions rendering non-native species in italics while leaving native species non-italicized. These unique features of the flora reflected the nascent community of ecological restoration practitioners that grew out of the Chicago region in the mid-20th century. The lists of associate species have been widely referenced by regional restoration projects, including Stephen Packard's efforts to restore savannas along the North Branch of the Chicago River. Swink continued work on this regional flora for several decades. The second edition was published in 1974. The third edition, co-authored with Gerould Wilhelm, was published in 1979, and the fourth and final edition was published in 1994. The third edition of Plants of the Chicago Region was the first regional flora to include coefficients of conservatism for each plant species, following the Floristic Quality Assessment system originally conceived by Wilhelm in 1977 for Kane County, Illinois. =Accolades= Swink was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1995 by Western Illinois University for the vast botanical and ornithological knowledge he had acquired by individual study, as well as his generosity in sharing that knowledge with others. Swink, Robert Betz, and Ray Schulenberg‚Äîthe \\"Prairie Triad\\"‚Äîwere awarded the George B. Fell Award in 1996 for their work in the pioneering of prairie restoration in northern Illinois. Legacy Hypericum swinkianum Floyd Swink is known for his lasting contributions to botany through his several published works on the flora of the Chicago region. He was instrumental in securing the protection of numerous natural areas. He worked with Robert Betz to preserve Santa Fe Prairie in Hodgkins, Illinois, Sagawau Canyon, a unique natural feature near Lemont, IL, and also advocated for the restoration of the Indiana Dunes. Swink's legacy of botanical study in the Chicago Region continues in those that he mentored, including the publishing of Flora of the Chicago Region: A Floristic and Ecological Synthesis by Gerould Wilhelm and Laura Rericha in 2017.

He is also known as an advocate for restoration of the monument of Josef Radetzky in Prague, which was removed in 1921. In 1991 Jan B√°rta together with chemist Ji≈ô√≠ Rathousk√Ω founded a company to produce facade colours, hydrophobic coats and other chemicals aimed for restoration of historic houses. It has been the exclusive supplier of facade colours for the historic buildings of Prague Castle and various other historic monuments of Czechia and elsewhere. In 2011 Jan B√°rta founded Spolek Radeck√Ω Praha (Radetzky Association Prague), which aims to commemorate Field marshall Radetzky and for several years has been advocating for the restoration of Radetzky's monument on Malostransk√© n√°mƒõst√≠ in Prague. This endeavour has been supported by numerous historians. B√°rta stresses that Radetzky was a great Czech historical personality from an old Bohemian noble family and the monument was a beautiful work of art. In an interview for Czech online newspaper iDNES.cz, B√°rta stated that the nationalist concept of Czech history in the 20th caused many great persons (such as Radetzky) to be almost forgotten, so his aim is to correct that. In 2016 the association held great celebrations of 250 years since Radetzky's birth in his birthplace Sedlƒçany (under the patronage of the municipal government) and in Prague.

It was adapted into a feature film by the same name in 2017. Plot summary The narrator Mia is married to Frederik who undergoes radical personality changes due to a slowly growing brain tumor that leaves his intellect, speech and motor control intact. Their lives change even more when it comes out that, in the year before his diagnosis, Frederik embezzled DKK 12 million from the private school in Copenhagen where he is headmaster. But was the tumor already determining his actions at the time, absolving him, or should he go to jail? In preparing Frederik's defense, Mia immerses herself in the latest brain research, the emerging neurological portrait of human nature, and the classic metaphysical question of free will. Her reading profoundly affects how she responds to Frederik ‚Äì and to her own passionate impulses. Reception You Disappear has been both a critical and a commercial success in Denmark since being published there in March 2012. Library and newspaper readers awarded it the L√¶sernes Bogpris, and it was nominated for two other major honors, Politiken's Literature Prize and the Martha Prize, while staying on the top-10 list of bestselling fiction for an entire year.

In 1969, he founded Blue Rock Studio located in downtown Manhattan. Upon opening in 1970, after 14 months of design and construction, Korvin served as chief engineer for 10 years and as supervising engineer until 1986 when Blue Rock was sold. With co-composer Ron Frangipane, Korvin scored a documentary series, This Was America, which won an Emmy Award for the episode \\"Hometown.\\" Early years Korvin was born and raised in Manhattan. He came from a ‚Äútheatrical family‚Äù as his step father was actor, Charles Korvin. Coincidentally, his birth father was a movie producer, then based in England, known as half of The Danziger Brothers. Family friends and acquaintances in the music field were composers Burton Lane and Johnny Mercer, singer Anita Ellis, conductor Ted Saidenberg, violinist Issac Stern, bass/baritone George London, record store owner, Sam Goody, Arturo Toscanini, and Murray the K. Blue Rock Studio Through spending time with Robert Traynor, college friend and booking manager for Electric Circus, Korvin helped with equipment load-in, stage set up and microphone set ups. After producing sessions recorded at Bell Sound and Apostolic Studios with a New York 3-piece electric house band, Sirocco, Korvin decided to assemble all the organizational elements necessary to build an audio recording studio, Blue Rock Studio. Intentionally conceived as a one-room-only recording facility, Blue Rock Studio offered privacy and intimacy in a creative surrounding. Korvin says, ‚ÄúBlue Rock was a space of learning, a place to acquire and use technical skills and musical knowledge. During each and every recording and mixing session, as an engineer, I always learned something new. As a producer, directing musicians in the studio, it was about setting the groundwork to try to capture those moments of magic.\\" The Fatback Band, led by drummer Bill Curtis, recorded their first few albums at Blue Rock in the early 70‚Äôs. Described in an interview with Ace Records some 40 years after the event: ‚ÄúRight away, Bill booked himself into New York‚Äôs Blue Rock studios and within four hours his band laid down 9 tracks. Two hours later, the album 'Lets Do It Again' had been mixed! Bill acknowledges the input of the studio staff; 'The guy responsible for our sound was Eddie Korvin ‚Äì he was the engineer. He said he never heard a session recorded this way in his life ‚Äì so he kept it the way we played.'\\" Work in television and film Korvin began composing music commercially around 1980, scoring for projects in film, television and commercials. In 1982, he won an Emmy Award for scoring an episode of the documentary series, ‚ÄúThis Was America‚Äù. Working with film director David Sutherland, a former classmate at Tufts University, Korvin was composer and assistant director for the award- winning film, Jack Levine: A Feast Of Pure Reason. Other scoring projects included two more films with Sutherland for PBS as well as shows for HBO, Cinemax and an ABC TV Christmas special. Still active today, he was recently music supervisor on Bender, directed by John Alexander.

Jonathan Hutt wrote in Monstre Sacr√©: The Decadent World of Sinmay Zau that \\"For many, Shao was not simply inspired by the Occident but rather was of it\\" and that his lack of awareness of \\"the Chinese literary scene\\" distinguished him from his colleagues. On some occasions he used the name Hao Wen ().Bien, Gloria. Baudelaire in China: A Study in Literary Reception. University of Delaware, December 14, 2012. , 9781611493900. p. 125. \\"47. Hao Wen Êµ©Êñá (pseud. of Shao Xunmei),\\" Life He was born Shao Yunlong () in 1906 into a wealthy Shanghainese family with its ancestral hometown in Yuyao, Zhejiang. Shao lived in the wealthiest part of Shanghai, Bubbling Well Road. His grandfather was a high-ranking official who served as governor of Taiwan and as a diplomat to Russia. His father Shao Heng () married Sheng Xihui (), a daughter of the tycoon Sheng Xuanhuai; Xunmei was the oldest of their six children. Shao had been tailed by tabloids since his childhood and had various girlfriends, including the actress White Lotus (ÁôΩËìÆ B√°ili√°n) and a woman with the English name Prudence; Shao was briefly jailed after a man who was infatuated with Prudence was murdered, but Shao was found to have been not guilty and released. Shao began a tour of Europe at age 17 in 1923 and continued it until 1927, going to Naples, Italy; Cambridge, England, and the √âcole des Beaux Arts in Paris; he was educated in Cambridge and Paris. While in Europe he had relationships with women there. He finished a poetry collection towards the end of the trip and published it, titled Parade and May, in 1927. He became intrigued by the English writer Algernon Charles Swinburne and French writer Charles Baudelaire. The titles of works Fire and Flesh (ÁÅ´ËàáËÇâ Hu«í y«î r√≤u) and Flower-like Evil (Ëä±‰∏ÄËà¨ÁöÑÁΩ™ÊÉ° HuƒÅ yƒ´bƒÅn de zu√¨'√®) were respectively inspired by a Swinburne poem and Les Fleurs du Mal by Baudelaire. The latter is an updated version of the earlier Paradise and May. In December 1927 he married his cousin and childhood love Sheng Peiyu (), a granddaughter of Sheng Xuanhuai. Hutt described Sheng as a \\"trophy wife\\". She was also known as \\"Zoa\\". Twenty- five Poems (Ë©©‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫îÈ¶ñ Shƒ´√®r sh√≠w«î sh«íu), Shao's collection of poetry that was published in 1936, did not garner significant attention. Hutt stated that Shao's popularity was declining by 1936. In 1937 he began an affair with Emily \\"Mickey\\" Hahn; the affair ended after Hahn stopped smoking opium. When Hahn wrote articles for The New Yorker,Lee, Leo Ou-fan (Li Oufan). Shanghai Modern: The Flowering of a New Urban Culture in China, 1930-1945 (Interpretations of Asia Series). Harvard University Press, 1999. , 9780674805507. p. 377. she referred to Shao as \\"Pan Heh-ven,\\" forming the basis of the 1942 book Mr. Pan. Hahn used Shao as the inspiration for Sun Yuin-loong, a character in Steps of the Sun. After the Japanese invasion Hahn was not interned since she had stated she was legally married to Shao Xunmei on a document, and therefore the Japanese treated her as, in the words of Taras Grescoe of The New Yorker, \\"an honorary Asian\\". Hahn stated that Shao's wife approved of the document since it was a possible method of saving his press and that Shao had not been married \\"according to foreign law\\". According to an article published in Ming Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper, during World War II, Shao had a habit of drinking alcohol and gambling, and therefore racked up a lot of expenses; Hahn covered the costs by selling her books. Hahn later wrote about Shao in her memoir, China to Me: A Partial Autobiography, using his actual name, spelled as \\"Sinmay Zau\\". Shao had a son, Shao Zucheng, who attended schools operated by American missionaries and became an English teacher. He also had a daughter, Shao Xiaohong. In 1958 Shao Xunmei wrote a letter to a friend in the United States, and as a result was imprisoned. He was released in three years, but his health had declined and did not improve afterwards. Shao Zucheng stated \\"When he came out of jail, he was so thin. He looked just like a monkey.\\" Hahn learned that Shao eventually stopped using opium. After Shao died, Hahn was unaware that he was dead. He was buried in Gui Yan Cemetery. Legacy Hutt stated that Shao continued to be perceived as \\"a caricature\\" by the 1990s even though his image had been somewhat rehabilitated in that decade. Jicheng Sun and Hal Swindall, authors of \\"A Chinese Swinburne: Shao Xunmei's Life and Art,\\" wrote circa 2015 that few people were aware of him \\"except for a handful of scholars of modern Chinese literature\\"; they stated that there were not many scholarly articles about Shao, and that reference books published in China \\"give him a few lines as a minor poet with decadent tendencies\\".

In 1982, Prestige issued this session as a gatefold LP paired with For Basie as Basie Reunions; this issue also has the track titles reversed. Reception Allmusic awarded the album 4¬Ω stars and reviewer Ken Dryden stated, \\"While this session isn't meant to substitute for the original recordings by Count Basie, the consistently swinging performances make this meeting of mostly Basie alumni worth purchasing\\". On All About Jazz, Derek Taylor wrote \\"Brimming with talent from bands past and present the one- shot aggregation places a premium on expansive individual solos and relaxed first-rate swing ... This disc a winner on a variety of fronts: as an opportunity to hear Basie alum paying inspired homage to their employer, and as a rare opportunity to hear Washington cut loose in the company of his peers.

Life  Hans Baur was born in Konstanz. His father, Johann Baur (1789-1837), was also a sculptor, originally from Thurgau, across the lake in Switzerland. The son completed his schooling in 1846 and went on to become a pupil of Johann Jakob Oechslin in Schaffhausen. Oechslin evidently recognised Baur's talent, but there was also a personal connection, in that Oechslin's second wife, Adelheid, was Hans Baur's half-sister. Oechslin was able to direct Baur towards the increasingly fashionable classical style. With a financial bursary from the Grand Duke, Baur was able to study between 1851 and 1855 at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, where he was taught by Max von Widnmann. He returned to Konstanz in 1855. Here he immediately received the commission for the two life-sized figures of Saints Conrad and Pelagius positioned above the west door of the Minster, which underwent an extensive restoration between 1844 and 1860. That year he also produced a statuette of Jan Hus. Between 1857 and 1861 Hans Baur worked at the newly established Fine Arts Academy (\\"Kunstschule\\") in Karlsruhe. He was able to rent a private studio in the academy's new building in the Bismarckstra√üe. Students whom he taught here included Friedrich Moest and Gustav von Kre√ü.Heinz Schmitt (compiler-editor.): Denkm√§ler, Brunnen und Freiplastiken in Karlsruhe 1715‚Äì1945. (publication of the Karlsruher Stadtarchivs vol. 7). 2nd edition, Braun, Karlsruhe 1989, , p. 686. In 1862, having left the Fine Arts Academy, he moved back to Konstanz where he married Albertine Robert (1842-1926). Based in Konstanz, he would be able to pursue his career as a sculptor from now on. There was an interlude during 1863/65, however, during which he undertook an extended study tour to Paris and Rome. Two life-sized marble figures which he produced for the Villa Weschsler in Ulm on his return show clear signs of his study of Italian sculpture. In Konstanz he taught the young Joseph Franz Baumeister between 1873 and 1877. The celebratory unveiling of his final work took place on 30 October 1897, nearly five months after his death. The imposing \\"Kaiserbrunnen\\" (loosely \\"Emperors fountain\\" in the Market Square in Konstanz features a niche on each of its four sides. Each contains a life-sized statue of an emperor: Henry III, Barbarossa, Maximilian I and Wilhelm I. The political message lacked subtlety: the recently deceased Hohenzollern Emperor of the united Germany could be ranked with three of the most celebrated Holy Roman Emperors of the second millennium.

It began as a limousine operator and expanded to taxi service in 1940. NK operates the most popular taxi hailing mobile application in Japan, Japan Taxi. Toyota invested 500 million yen in the app in 2017, followed by a second 7.5 billion investment in 2018. Tokyo Musen, a major rival of Nihon Kotsu in the Tokyo area, joined the app later that year in an effort to counterbalance foreign rivals such as Uber and Didi Chuxing. The app covered approximately one in four Japanese taxis as of 2018. Nihon Kotsu also participated in a government trial of taxi sharing in early 2018. NK was the first major customer for the JPN Taxi, a new Japanese taxi design based on the black cabs of London, which began production in 2017. In 2018, NK began selling multilingual payment terminals to other taxi operators in Japan.

He was appointed khagan by Emperor Gaozong of the Tang dynasty after the conquest of the Western Turks. His fierce rivalry with his cousin, Ashina Mishe, was instrumental in driving the Western Turks away from the Tang and into allegiance with the Tibetan Empire.  Life  Buzhen was a member of the ruling caste of the Western Turks. According to modern Turkish historian Ahmet Ta≈üaƒüƒ±l, he was a descendant of Istemi. After the Western Turks were conquered by the Chinese Tang dynasty his younger cousin Mishe was created khagan in 632. Angered by this, Buzhen attacked Mishe in 639 and killed 20 people including several of Mishe's brothers and nephews. Consequently, Mishe submitted to the Tang, fearing for his life. Buzhen declared himself Yabghu (khagan) of the Dulu tribes (ÂíÑÈôÜÂè∂Êä§) but was not accepted by the Dulu. Having lost prestige, he too submitted to Tang. Buzhen participated in the Tang- Goguryeo war in 645 and the Battle of Irtysh River where Tang armies defeated Ashina Helu. In 657 he was appointed Jiwangjue Khagan () to rule over five Western Turkic tribes by Emperor Gaozong. In 659 he participated in a campaign alongside Mishe against rival claimant to the title of khagan, Zhenzhu Yabgu, near Shuanghe. in 662 Gaozong sent the general Su Haizheng (ËòáÊµ∑Êîø) to attack Qiuzi and ordered Buzhen and Mishe to assist him. Buzhen, continuing his rivalry with Mishe, falsely informed Su that Mishe was preparing to rebel and would attack the Tang army; Su responded by ambushing Mishe, killing him and his chief assistants. Shunishi chief Chupan (Èº†Â∞ºÊñΩËôïÂçäÂïú) and Basaigan chief Tong Ishbara (ÊãîÂ°ûÂππÊöæÊ≤ôÈâ¢‰øüÊñ§), angry over Ashina Mishe's death, turned away from Tang and submitted to the Tibetan Empire instead. When Buzhen died in 667, Tang influence in the region was greatly reduced.
