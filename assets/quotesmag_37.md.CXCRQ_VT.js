C.K.W. de Dreu, 1966 - at the UvA Album Academicum website. is a Professor of Psychology at Leiden University and Behavioral Economics at the University of Amsterdam and member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received his PhD in social and organizational psychology from the University of Groningen (1993) and was president of the European Association of Social Psychology (2008 ‚Äì 2011) and the International Association for Conflict Management (2000 ‚Äì 2002). In 2016 he was named Distinguished Research Fellow at the University of Oxford.https://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-carsten-kw-de- dreu  Research  De Dreu works at the intersection of social psychology, (neuro)biology, and behavioral economics. He studies the neurobiological origins, contextual plasticity, and cognitive and strategic consequences of cooperative versus competitive motivation in negotiation and conflict resolution, group decision making, and conflict and competition within and between groups. In addition, he examines the various functions of social conflict within and between groups for individual health and well-being, creativity and innovation, and team performance in work organizations. His research uses a mixture of laboratory experiments, organizational field studies, and meta-analyses. With Laurie Weingart and Evert van de Vliert, he conducted pioneering work on the influence of different types of conflict‚Äîwhether task or relationship focused‚Äîon team performance, innovation, and job satisfactionDe Dreu, C.K.W., & Weingart, L.R.

(1997, Eds.). Using conflict in organizations. London: Sage (pp. 1 - 229). Furthermore, he uncovered a key role for social preferences in predicting successful negotiation and dispute resolution. With Matthijs Baas and Bernard Nijstad he developed the Dual Pathway to Creativity Model, which predicts creative cognition and performance as the result of loose, flexible thinking on the one hand, and persistent, effortful processing on the other.Boot, N.C., Baas, M., Van Gaal, S., Cools, R., & De Dreu, C.K.W.

Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek and is divided into 43 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Papyrus 53 (3rd century; extant verses 33 to chapter 10:1) * Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) * Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) * Codex Bezae (~400) * Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) * Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450) * Codex Laudianus (~550) Statue of Saint Paul in Damascus. =New Testament references= * : ; On the Damascus Road (9:1‚Äì9) The purposeful journey to Damascus by Saul (verse 1) was abruptly halted (verse 3) when a heavenly light blinded him (verse 8) while a heavenly voice made his followers speechless (verse 7), so now Saul had to be 'told what to do' (verse 6) and 'led by the hand' (verse 8). What was the most terrifying for Saul is that the heavenly voice was the voice of 'Jesus, whom you are persecuting' (verse 5), confirming that 'Stephen's vision (Acts 7:56) was not total delusion'. =Verse 5= :And he said, \\"Who are You, Lord?\\" :: Then the Lord said, \\"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. It is hard for you to kick against the goads.\\" NKJV Ananias's vision (9:10‚Äì19) The house believed to be of Ananias of Damascus in Damascus Just like the story of Cornelius, there were two visions involved in Saul's story, 'each confirming the other'. While Saul was blinded from his vision and in chastened state ('he is praying', verse 11), Ananias, who was a resident of Damascus (verse 13) and a disciple of Christ (verse 10), received instructions with precise directions to Saul's address (verse 11; the 'street called Straight' is still shown in the Old City of Damascus). It also contains 'a divine commission' (in distinctly Pauline language) highlighting the contrast between Saul's dark past and God's 'elective grace' (verse 15: cf. 1 Corinthians 15:9‚Äì10; Romans 9:23) for Saul's future career, as prophetically outlined in verses 15‚Äì16. Ananias was initially reluctant and argued with 'the Lord' (cf. Moses in Exodus 3:11‚Äì4:17), but he obediently followed the instructions with generous response (verse 17) to lay hands (primarily for healing) and to baptize Saul (verse 18). =Verse 17= : And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, \\"Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.\\" NKJV =Verse 19= :So when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus. NKJV John Gill suggested in his Exposition of the Bible that these disciples were among those dispersed from Jerusalem to Judea and Samaria at the onset of the Christian persecution described in Acts 8:1 Gill's Exposition of the Bible http://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/9.htm, accessed 24 August 2015 Saul in Damascus (9:19‚Äì25) Bab Kisan gate (now Chapel of Saint Paul), believed to be where Paul escaped from persecution in Damascus Saul's conversion immediately showed apparent effect, as characteristically recorded in Luke's style to be a 'universal amazement' (verse 21). Luke's narrative here and Paul's own account of his conversion in Galatians 1 are not identical but reconcilable: Paul didn't mention that his call was in Damascus, yet in after going to Arabia, Paul wrote that he 'returned to Damascus', implying that the call took place there. Another mention of Damascus in Paul's letters is at in relation to his escape (being let down over the walls in a basket), which could hardly happened twice, so it must refer to the same episode. In the epistle to Corinthians, Paul wrote that the person wanting to capture him was Aretas was king of the Arabian kingdom of Nabatea, who only had any kind of judicial authority in Damascus between 37-39 CE, thus providing a narrow date range of the event. =Verse 25= : Then the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall in a large basket. NKJV * Cross reference: 2 Corinthians 11:33 * Saul or Paul was helped to escape the city in a similar manner to how Rahab helped two spies to escape prior to the Battle of Jericho (), and Michal, the daughter of King Saul helped her husband, David ().The Nelson Study Bible. Thomas Nelson, Inc. 1997 Saul returns to Jerusalem (9:26‚Äì30) Compared to Paul's account in Galatians 1, Luke seems to imply a short interval before Paul's first Jerusalem visit (verse 19b), 'a longer stay in Jerusalem, and a meeting with more than one apostle' (verse 27), but the two accounts simply provide different perspectives on the same event. Luke's account highlights the suspicion of the Jerusalem church to Saul (verses 26‚Äì27) and the 'relative independence' of Paul's gospel teaching from 'apostolic control'. It brings the 'narrative circle back to its point of departure in chapter 6', that 'Saul, the zealous young man who approved of the killing of Stephen', returned to Jerusalem to finish Stephen's argument with the Hellenists and 'arouses the same violent response'. The 'brothers' could not control the situation, so perceiving a great danger had Saul hurriedly sent off to Tarsus, his hometown (verse 30; cf. ), while he was 'still unknown by sight to most members of the Judean churches' (). Summary and transition (9:31) The summary verse at the end brings the narrative to the main thread, with glimpses of the scattered groups of 'brothers' or 'disciples' (both men and women) under the guidance of the Spirit spreading their faith. However, 'behind this diversity is a larger unity', called 'the church' (in the singular) that was growing and 'being built up' throughout the region. Until now, Luke has recorded 'dramatic scenes of conversion and conflict' in various cities: Jerusalem (chapters 1‚Äì7), Samaria (chapter 8), one encounter on the desert road (chapter 8) and then Damascus (chapter 9), with the underlying steady consolidation behind the scenes and in the country regions: Samaria (cf. 8:25), Judea and Galilee, and all along the coastal plain (cf. 8:40). Harmonizing the narratives of Paul's conversion According to the New Testament, this event took place in the life of Paul the Apostle which led him to cease persecuting early Christians and to become a follower of Jesus. It is normally dated by researchers to AD 33‚Äì36. The phrases Pauline conversion, Damascene conversion and Damascus Christophany, and road to Damascus allude to this event. Within the New Testament, Paul's conversion experience is discussed in both Paul's own letters and in the book known by the title Acts of the Apostles. According to both sources, Paul was never a follower of Jesus and did not know Jesus before his crucifixion. Instead, he severely persecuted the early Christians. Although Paul refers to himself as an \\"Apostle\\" of Jesus, it is clear that Paul was not one of \\"The Twelve\\" apostles. Paul's conversion occurred after Jesus' crucifixion. The accounts of Paul's conversion experience describe it as miraculous, supernatural, or otherwise revelatory in nature. Peter and Aeneas (9:32‚Äì35) Verse 31 leads the narrative back to the Jerusalem church and to Peter as its 'chief figurehead', as he went 'here and there among the believers' (verses 32) suggesting how the church was 'built up' (verse 31) and implying Peter's 'pastoral oversight over the whole church' ('all'), which by then included 'believers in the towns of the coastal plain'. The communities may have been founded as suggested in Acts 8:40 from Lydda (the modern 'Lod') to Sharon (in the region of Sarona), northwards along the coast towards Caesarea. Two brief miracle stories displayed Peter's power as a healer, an echo to the healing miracles of Jesus, as Luke is careful to stress that 'Peter heals in Jesus' name, not his own' (verse 34). The healing of Tabitha (9:36‚Äì43) The entrance to Simon the Tanner's house in Joppa (Jaffa), where Peter stayed (Acts 9:43). Luke uses the unusual term mathetria for a woman disciple (outside the church, women would not often be characterized as 'students') in the fledgling community at the port of Joppa (Jaffa), called \\"Tabitha\\" (Greek 'Dorcas': both names mean 'gazelle'), who had a charitable ministry (a clothing club) among the women of the town, in particular, the widows (verse 39). The term 'upper room' (verse 39) and Peter's prayer (verse 40) relate to the resurrection miracles of Elijah and Elisha in and 2 Kings 4:33 (cf. ), but with the closest parallel to the gospel story of Jesus' healing of Jairus' daughter (, and parallels.). Intriguingly, only Mark records the Aramaic words Jesus to the child, talitha cum () which is so close to Peter's words here (though in the gospel story talitha is not a name).

The team ran in the world championship with Shell- sponsored Honda motorcycles from to and became the first Australian-owned and managed team in the premier class of road racing. History Jeff Hardwick started his long relationship with Honda in 1972, when he bought a motorcycle dealership on the Gold Coast, Queensland. Within few years the business expanded to many shops and dealerships. In 1985, Jeff approached Shell to market its motorcycle oils in Australia. Around that time Hardwick and Shell began backing a number of bikes in major local road racing events such as Bathurst and the Castrol 6-Hours, providing a national platform for riders like Mick Doohan, Mat Mladin, Troy Bayliss and Andrew Pitt. In Hardwick Racing entered a team in the 500cc world championship establishing a workshop in Belgium. Garry McCoy and Juan Borja were the two riders, aboard Shell-backed Honda NSR500Vs. McCoy was the leading rookie until a crash at Brno ended his season prematurely. The following year Hardwick joined forces with Mick Doohan to enter a team in the 250cc world championship with Tohru Ukawa riding a works Honda NSR250, and Anthony West on a TSR-Honda 250. Ukawa won the French and Valencian grands prix, finishing the season in second place behind the young Valentino Rossi. In the Hardwick team continued in the 250cc world championship with Ukawa and West. The Japanese rider won two races and finished fourth in the championship. The team moved back to the premier 500cc class in with Chris Walker aboard a Honda NSR500 and Leon Haslam riding a Honda NSR500V. During the season Hardwick signed Katja Poensgen to ride the last races with an Honda in the 250cc class. For 2002 Hardwick planned a four- riders team, signing Poensgen and Alex Debon for the 250cc class, while Haslam and Tetsuya Harada would have contested the 500cc class. However at the end of 2001 Shell ceased their sponsorship deal with Hardwick Racing and the team fell in financial difficulties. The 250cc program was discarded, leaving Poensgen and Debon without a team, while the 500cc program and Harada were taken over by Pramac Racing. Jeff Hardwick became the first Pramac team manager, but then he retired from racing and returned to Australia to establish the Hardwick Racing Products emporium. Jeff Hardwick died in 2011 at the age of 66.

A treat is given at the sound of a click at the exact moment the cats are doing a desired behavior. It's just more of a fine tuning way of training, Martin said. It's noise and treats. It triggers something in their brain, and they get it very quickly. Martin uses varieties of tuna and chicken to reward the cats. The results are not as consistent as might be achieved with more compliant animals such as dogs, but the \\"long-standing notion that cats are un-trainable is thrown completely out the window.\\" During the one-hour show, the cats perform tricks such as \\"walking tightropes, pushing carts, skateboarding, jumping through hoops, ringing bells, balancing on balls and turning on lights.\\" When the cats don't perform as planned, it adds an element of humour, an important part of the show. Promotion of cat welfare Martin aims to improve the public perception of cats and to promote their welfare during her show. \\"We use our show as an entertaining demonstration of what cats are really capable of, as well as the healthy benefits of clicker training.\\" Martin demonstrates the clicker training technique in the show, training a kitten or cat to learn some new tricks. She explains that training can build richer relationships between cats and their humans; can be life- saving in emergencies when cats are trained to go to their carrier at the sound of a whistle; and can prevent behavioral problems, while providing physical exercise and mental stimulation. \\"'We hope people are inspired to train their own cats,' Martin said. 'They enjoy the training. They want you to work with them.'\\" Clicker training kits are made available for purchase at shows and online.\\"Acro-Cats Merchandise\\" , Bewitched Cat Toys, accessed July 27, 2014. The cats in the troupe are mainly former orphans, rescues and strays. Since about 2008, Martin has also fostered many homeless cats and kittens. She brings her fosters on tour, training them and featuring them in the show. Over the years, over 140 foster cats or kittens have been adopted to new homes as a result of these efforts. A portion of show proceeds is typically given to cat rescue organizations, and on occasion the show itself is a benefit to promote a rescue organization. The Rock-Cats Each show closes with a performance by the Rock-Cats, billed as the \\"only cat band in existence\\". A review of a Seattle show in 2014 said \\"these cats are capable of anarchic musical compositions\\" that Martin likens to free jazz; \\"an unpredictable assortment of instrument clanging, and rarely does it sound like the cats are playing the same song, let alone an actual, fully realized piece of music.\\" Nevertheless, the reviewer found that \\"white-haired diva\\" band leader Tuna \\"has the perfect demeanor for a rock star of any species.\\" Another reviewer of the Seattle show said it was a \\"really, really fun way to spend an afternoon\\", and listened politely to the band while realizing that Oz was a better guitar player than she was. A reviewer of a 2013 show in New Orleans was critical of the band's musicality, and complained that the advertised \\"seasonal carol selections such as 'A Cat in a Manger' and 'Catnip Roasting on an Open Fire'\\" never materialized.\\" A review of a Los Angeles show in 2012 stated that although the band was unlikely to win any Grammy Awards anytime soon, \\"what they lacked in technical skill, they certainly made up for in rock 'n' roll catitude\\". =Band members= As of 2014: *Oz, a male green-eyed tabby domestic short-haired cat born in 2005, plays guitar.\\"Oz\\", Samantha's Amazing Animals, accessed August 27, 2014. *Nola, a female blue-eyed, mainly white domestic short-haired cat with grey siamese tabby markings, born in 2014, also plays guitar.Tuna and the Rock Cats Facebook Page, September 1, 2014, update. *Dakota, a female white haired Turkish Angora cat with a tiny black mohawk, born in 2005, is the main drummer.\\"Dakota 'The Diva'\\", The Acro- Cats, accessed August 27, 2014.\\"Dakota\\", Samantha's Amazing Animals, accessed August 27, 2014. *Fiji, a female white and grey Himalayan cat born in 2007, is a back-up drummer.\\"Meet Fiji: The Princess\\", Samantha's Amazing Animals, accessed August 27, 2014.Fiji, Samantha's Amazing Animals, accessed August 27, 2014. *Asti, a female golden-eyed tabby domestic short-haired cat born in 2010, is in training for drums.\\"Asti 'The Sneak'\\", The Acro-Cats, accessed August 27, 2014.\\"Asti\\", Samantha's Amazing Animals, accessed August 27, 2014. *Nue, a female blue-eyed tabby domestic short-haired cat born in 2005, is on keyboards.\\"Nue 'The Flirt'\\", The Acro-Cats, accessed August 27, 2014.\\"Nue\\", Samantha's Amazing Animals, accessed August 27, 2014. *Sookie, a female tortoiseshell domestic short-haired cat born in 2009, is on chimes.\\"Sookie 'The Airhead'\\", The Acro-Cats, accessed August 27, 2014.\\"Sookie\\", Samantha's Amazing Animals, accessed August 27, 2014. *Cluck Norris, a chicken, plays cymbal and tambourine. *Garfield, a groundhog, works a gong or cymbals. =Former band members= *Pinky, a female white domestic short-haired cat, was a \\"focussed, professional and very demanding\\" guitar player, who died of breast cancer in August 2012.\\"Pinky 'The Artist'\\", The Acro-Cats, accessed August 27, 2014. *Hendiana Jones, a chicken with a knack for peace-keeping, last appeared in 2012. *Tuna, a female white domestic short-haired cat born in 2002, was the band leader and played a cowbell.

Background Lines from Within, (1993) Castle Park, Bristol Ann Christopher was born on 4 December 1947 in Watford, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Harrow School of Art from 1965-1966 and the West of England College of Art in Bristol from 1966-1969.Royal Academy of Arts: Ann Christopher RA  Artist  Royal Academy of Arts, accessdate: 29/08/2014 Career Christopher's first solo exhibition was at the Mignon Gallery, Bath in 1969. She continued to have solo exhibitions throughout the 1970s and the 80s. In 1989, she had a retrospective of her work produced between 1969 and 1989 at the Dorset county Museum and Art Gallery. At first glance Christopher's elegantly understated sculpture seems to be tied to a series of simple formal decisions and aesthetic concerns about form and surface. However her making process is much more complex and instinctual. Once a basic shape is chosen and a template constructed, often out of material as humble as cardboard, it is built up using resin, giving depth and texture to the form before casting into Christopher's metal of choice and further worked laboriously by hand. Later, precise machine milled linear incisions are made to create a tension with the delicate hand finished surfaces. Locations of her art Her commissioned work exist in many locations including the University of Bristol, the City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, the Chantrey Bequest, the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and World Wide Business Centres Inc., Philadelphia. A 1990 bronze by Christopher is located on Tower Bridge Road in London while her 1993 work Lines from Within is situated in Bristol's Castle Park.

It was aired on August 28, 2014. The episode was written by Todd Slavkin & Darren Swimmer and directed by Michael Nankin. The episode aired back-to-back with the next episode, \\"I Almost Prayed\\". Plot The episode starts with Stahma (Jaime Murray) and Datak (Tony Curran), who have spent the night together, and they discuss Datak coming back home. Stahma tells him her rules to accept him back and Datak agrees until he hears that she wants to be a partner in the family business. Datak asks her to leave and when someone knocks at his door, thinking is Stahma, he opens it and is kidnapped by a stranger. Stahma is also kidnapped on her way back home and the two of them wake up in an abandoned silo, tied up. Nolan (Grant Bowler) continues to drag the injured Tommy (Dewshane Williams) on the sleigh, trying to get him back in Defiance in time for someone to take care of his wound. On their way, Tommy tells Nolan about Cai (Robin Dunne) and that Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) asked them to kill him if they see him. Nolan realizes that Irisa is afraid of Cai because somehow the two of them are linked and he can destroy her plan. Doc Yewll (Trenna Keating) continues to hide so she will not get arrested and the illusion of Lev (Hannah Cheesman) keeps her company. The two of them find out about Irisa's plan and Yewll decides to stop hiding and go back to Defiance to inform everyone about it and tell them how they can stop Irisa. Lev tries to stop her and convince her that what Irisa is doing is for the best. Yewll realizes that the artificial intelligence of the Ark has taken over Lev and she removes the ego device from her neck while saying goodbye to Lev. She then heads back to Defiance to help stop Irisa. Pilar (Linda Hamilton) visits Rafe (Graham Greene) in prison before she meets Christie (Nicole Mu√±oz). Rafe wants to be sure that Pilar is now fine for the sake of their children and she reassures him that she had never been better. Quentin (Justin Rain) takes Pilar to meet Christie and the two of them reunite. Amanda (Julie Benz) and Pottinger (James Murray) have a dinner together and Pottinger tells Amanda that he has a surprise for her. He takes her to the place where Stahma and Datak are locked and tells her that he found Kenya's murderers. Pottinger leaves her alone with the Tarrs giving her his gun and the chance to revenge. Stahma confess that she killed Kenya and Amanda is ready to shoot her but she changes her mind and does not do it. Amanda gets out of the silo and is mad at Pottinger for thinking that she would do something like that and she tells him that they should find another way to bring Tarrs in justice. After Amanda leaves, Datak agrees to Stahma's rules and she agrees to let him come back home. Before going back home, they go to find the three men who betrayed them to Pottinger, using the poison Stahma used to kill Kenya, they kill them. Nolan finally gets back to Defiance but it is too late for Tommy. Berlin (Anna Hopkins) asks Nolan who did this and he tells her that it was Irisa but Irisa is not being herself. In the meantime, Irisa proceeds with her plan and by using stones and dirt, she controls the Arks that are in space and leads them to New York. She destroys and terraforms the city while Nolan goes and finds Cai, the only person who can stop Irisa.

Plot Nolan (Grant Bowler) forces Cai (Robin Dunne) to go with him so they can stop Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) who continues with Irzu's plan to destroy the planet. Cai explains to Nolan that since Irisa kissed him, he has visions of a past life or from their ancestors and how they stopped the Kaziri. Nolan figures out that to be able to stop Irisa, they have to separate the two keys which are both inside Irisa. Datak (Tony Curran) returns home and finds Pilar (Linda Hamilton) talking with Stahma (Jaime Murray). Pilar wants Christie (Nicole Mu√±oz) and Alak (Jesse Rath) to go and live with her for a while but Stahma disagrees with her, making the two women argue. Datak asks Pilar to leave and Pilar decides to convince Christie and Alak to go with her since the Tarr family will not allow them to do so. When they are ready to leave, Alak notices something is wrong and does not want to leave, leading Pilar and Quentin (Justin Rain) to kidnap them and force them to go with them. The Tarrs' handmaiden informs Datak and Stahma about the kidnapping and the two of them free Rafe (Graham Greene) from the E-rep camp so they can follow and find Pilar. Berlin (Anna Hopkins) had previously tried to stop the execution of Rafe and found herself nearly being executed herself but she is saved when the Tarrs come to take Rafe. Mercado (William Atherton) returns to Defiance as soon as they hear the news about New York being destroyed and they try to find a way to stop Irisa. Mercado asks Amanda's help and Nolan arrives at Defiance with Cai explaining how they can stop Irisa. Amanda and Pottinger do not believe his story but Mercado does and wants to follow Nolan's plan. That is until Doc Yewll (Trenna Keating) arrives and tells them that she knows how to stop Irisa; by killing her. Nolan reacts to that and Amanda asks to lock him up because he will never cooperate if Irisa has to be killed. E-rep soldier lead Nolan and Cai to prison but before they lock them up, Nolan manages to fight them back and they escape. Yewll explains to Amanda and Pottinger what they have to do to kill Irisa, but Amanda first wants to know why she made a fake Kenya. Yewll lies to her, claiming that she was working with the Votanis Collective as a spy for Pottinger, and that the VC forced her to do it; Yewll claims she never told Pottinger about it because he would stop her. Yewll's lie allows Pottinger, the true culprit, to avoid arousing Amanda's suspicion. After the explanations, the three of them leave to find Irisa. The three find Irisa, but at the moment Amanda is ready to shoot her, Nolan and Cai arrive, and Nolan shoots Amanda's gun, stopping her. Nolan cuffs Amanda and knocks out Pottinger and Yewll. Irisa hears the noise and tries to run away from Cai, but Nolan captures her and Cai manages to transfer one of the two keys into himself making the keys stop controlling Irisa. Irisa wakes up, and when she realizes that she killed Tommy, she asks Nolan to kill her, but Nolan convinces her that she has to fight and save the planet from Irzu. Nolan, Cai, and Irisa get into the ship to finish their mission and stop Irzu, who continues to try in vain to convince Irisa to change her mind until the last possible moment. Cai and Irisa deactivate the ship and save the planet. Cai manages to get out of the ship before it collapses; Irisa and Nolan become trapped, and they enter one of the capsules to protect themselves. At the same time, Amanda and Pottinger, knowing that now they are safe, get together; Yewll gets back to her office; and Datak, Stahma, and Rafe follow Pilar to take back Christie and Alak.

It was the second university in the ancient Kingdom of Valencia, founded 40 years after the University of Valencia. The official name of the institution was Pontificia y Real Universidad de Orihuela (Pontifical and Royal University of Orihuela). The aforementioned university was governed by the Order of the Preachers (Dominicans) who had their convent inside it. Its building is currently occupied by the Diocesan School of Santo Domingo. Founding Its origin lies in the establishment of Cardinal Loazes, who created the so-called College of the Patriarch in accordance with his rank as Patriarch of Antioch, in the year 1547. He himself offered the management of his college to the Order of Preachers, while he was still bishop of L√©rida. The Order accepted this appointment in the general Chapter of the Order of Rome in 1543. Through a papal bull from Pope Julius II (1510) and a favor from King Ferdinand the Catholic, the University would be built near their convent in the city - the convent of the Virgin of Succour‚Äîwhich once stood on the site now occupied by the church. History Cardinal Loazes, founder of the university.Calomarde, the minister who closed the university. In 1552 Pope Julius III granted, by papal privilege, the rank of University to the College. In the year 1569, Pope Pius IV granted it Pontifical University status via papal bull. In 1569, Pope Pius V granted the College the full category of Public University of all sciences and arts for those who wanted to attend, be they clergy or secular, comparable to the Universities of Salamanca, Alcal√°, Valencia and others, with the same prerogatives and rights. However, they had to wait until 1610 for studies to begin and until 1646 for King Philip IV, by the Royal Warrant of 1646, to grant the title of ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù to the Pontifical University of Orihuela, declaring it a Regal, Public, and General University in spite of pressures from the University of Valencia, which wanted this declaration for itself and not for Orihuela. It thus became the only existing university in the arc that spans Alcal√° de Henares (founded by Cardinal Cisneros in 1499), Valencia (founded by Ferdinand the Catholic in 1502), and Granada (founded by Carlos I of Spain in 1531). During the 18th century, coinciding with the population increase and the revitalization of agriculture, the University of Orihuela experienced a Golden Era. It boasted 24 department chairs, a faculty of some 100 doctors and close to 300 students, in addition to 117 schoolchildren in the seminary, which was incorporated into the university, as well as the seminary of Saint Fulgencio of Murcia. During the War of Spanish Succession, Orihuela chose the side of the Habsburg candidate, and after the war ended in 1713, the political positions of the city of Orihuela and of the new Bourbon monarchy had negative repercussions on the university, with teachers not being able to attend the town council easily. The 1807 education reform plan restricted the disciplines to philosophy and theology, in fact losing almost all the secular students. The university was going to be closed down by the General Decree of University Closures, because of which the likes of Baeza, √Åvila, etc. were closed down in 1818, but in the end, its closure was postponed until 1824 and once again until the final date of 1835, after three hundred years of history. This closure was carried out by the minister Francisco Tadeo Calomarde. The real reason for its removal was the fact that it was overshadowing the University of Valencia, the city that received King Fernando VII on his return to Spain. Finally, in 1836, after the Law of Expulsion of the Religious Orders and the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal, the building was passed on to the Diocese of Orihuela, that, from 1871 supported the Collegiate school until 1956, when the current Diocesan College was built. Education Colegio Santo Domingo. Door of the University. Shield of the College. In the beginning, it was for general studies, where the Trivium and the Quadrivium were taught in accordance with the legal teachings, but Pope Paul III elevated the university a short while after its creation, creating diverse departments such as philosophy, theology, the arts, and grammar. The teachings of the university were reformed in the 17th century with new statutes provided by King Philip IV. Likewise, in the Age of Enlightenment, new reforms were attempted. The university was given departments of Civil Law, Canonical Law, Medicine, Theology, Philosophy, among others. In addition to the teachings in this university, in the Orihuela convent (currently the Monastery of the Salesian Religious Order), the Society of Jesus established departments of Rhetoric and Grammar, which expanded the General Studies. The University was established in one of the largest capitals of the kingdom, and in one of the few to gain the Royal and Pontifical titles (along with those of Salamanca and Alcal√°). Its importance reached a point where its professors' opinions were always sought out, to the point that even in its worst moments like the promulgation of the suppression in 1818 (which was not carried out until 1835), its prestige led to its being consulted in the Criminal Code Project of 1823. Building The Diocesan College of Santo Domingo or the College of the Patriarch Loazes is a monumental building of over 15,000 square meters where many different styles ranging from the Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo are followed. It is the largest Valencian National Monument. It was composed of two cloisters, three courtyards, one refectory, three massive facades, and the church. It was founded by Cardinal Loazes (Patriarch of Antioch) under the name of College of the Patriarch. Its construction began in the sixteenth century and ended in the eighteenth century. It preserves works by Antonio de Villanueva, Camacho Felizes, Bartolom√© Albert, Nicol√°s Borr√°, and more. It was declared a monument of the Fine Arts by Queen Isabella II, becoming a National Monument, now considered a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural of Spanish heritage. The first National Public Library of Spain (16th century), now the Fernando de Loazes State Public Library, was founded at this school. Personalities Numerous students attended the University of Orihuela, many of whom became persons of importance and high standing in Spanish society. Many diverse personalities graduated from the University, and went on to obtain great prestige, including many prestigious lawyers and doctors, such as lawyers of the Court of Appeals and of the Chancellory of Valladolid and Granada, reaching the rank of Viceroys in Peru or New Spain. Various ministers of the king passed through its halls, the best known being Jos√© Mo√±ino, Count of Floridablanca. In this building the universal Miguel Hern√°ndez and the novelist Gabriel Mir√≥ studied. For the latter, the whole of Santo Domingo served as inspiration in his works El Obispo Leproso (The Leper Bishop) and Nuestro Padre San Daniel (Our Father Saint Daniel).

Created by head writer Ron Carlivati, Nathan was introduced in late 2013 by Frank Valentini as a love interest for Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms). In January 2018, Paevey announced he had opted to leave the serial of his own decision. Paevey's casting was very well received. The character of Nathan becomes quite popular rather quickly among viewers and critics, becoming known as the show's resident heroic \\"good guy\\" as he tries to support his mess of a family. At the same time, Nathan's pairing with Maxie becomes a fan favorite pairing and their \\"slow burn\\" romance was praised by critics.  Storylines  Detective Nathan West arrives in Port Charles, and meets Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) when he sublets her apartment. Maxie leaves on a vacation, while Nathan settles in Port Charles. He starts investigating Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton) in regards to the overdose of Silas' wife, Nina Reeves (Michelle Stafford), suspecting Silas is responsible. It's later revealed Nathan is actually Nina's brother. Nathan's mother Madeline Reeves (Donna Mills) claims Nina has died after Silas has relinquished his rights to Nina's vast estate. Nathan is shocked when Madeline falls into the trap to catch the killer, and confesses she drugged Nina to kill her unborn child. He arrests Madeline, and simultaneously reveals his identity. Maxie returns with her new manipulative boyfriend Levi Dunkleman (Zachary Garred), who Nathan immediately clashes with. Nathan meets Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud) at the same time it's revealed Nathan is the biological son of Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati), Madeline's sister, and Britt is actually his sister. Madeline confesses to Nathan when he mentions almost sleeping with Britt. Nathan is shocked when Madeline reveals Nina is alive as she is carted off to prison. Maxie is trying to regain custody of her daughter Georgie, but is discouraged about going to her hearing. Nathan encourages Maxie to fight for Georgie, then covers for her, lying he threw her summons away by mistake. When the judge discovers Nathan lied for Maxie and she loses custody of her daughter, Nathan suspects Levi tipped off the judge, and tries to prove it. Meanwhile, Nathan is reunited with Nina, who arrives in Port Charles. Levi later frames Nathan for tipping off immigration about Levi's expired visa, leading to Maxie throwing Nathan out of the apartment. As Maxie is set to marry Levi, Nathan discovers Levi has stolen a family heirloom from Maxie's mother Felicia Scorpio (Kristina Wagner). With the help of his partner Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna), Nathan crashes the wedding, only for Levi to escape with Maxie and Dante's wife, Lulu (Emme Rylan), at gunpoint. Nathan tracks down Maxie, but is kidnapped by Victor Cassadine (Thaao Penghlis). Nathan is about to kill Victor until Obrecht says they are father and son. Nathan rescues Maxie, and the two end up killing Levi and his father, Peter Harrell (David Gautreaux). As they escape, it was revealed Victor isn't Nathan's father. Obrecht kills Victor to keep Nathan from finding out. Nathan and Maxie start dating, but when Maxie is threatened with losing custody of Georgie again, they're forced to stay apart. Nathan asks for help from his mother, who arranges for Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson) to appeal to the judge on Maxie's behalf. A thrilled Maxie gets visitation rights to Georgie, and she and Nathan finally start a relationship freely. Nathan moves out at Maxie's request they ease into their relationship. They later clash when Maxie helps fugitive Johnny Zacchara (Brandon Barash) skip town. Georgie returns with her father Damian Spinelli (Bradford Anderson), who is hoping to reunite with Maxie. Maxie dumps Nathan after she blames him for accepting Spinelli's challenge to box for her affections. Nathan teams up with Spinelli's ex-girlfriend Ellie Trout (Emily Wilson), pretending to date to make their respective lovers jealous. The plan works, and Maxie and Nathan reunite after the Nurses' Ball. Silas is found dead, and Nina is accused of murdering him. Wanting to prove Nina innocent, Nathan investigates, and starts to suspect Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst), Nina's new husband whom she randomly married. Nathan figures out Ric married Nina on Madeline's request, to drive Nina crazy and gain Nina's inheritance. Nathan gets Ric's cooperation, and is able to arrest Madeline for Silas' murder, disgusted by her actions. When Nathan is shot in 2016, under the influence of drugs, he refers to Maxie as \\"Claudette.\\" Maxie later asked Nathan who Claudette is, and he claims it was his dog. Nathan later admits she's his ex- wife, Claudette Beaulieu. Nathan admits he and Claudette had a green card marriage, but he fell in love with her till he discovered she was cheating on him. Nathan later confesses to Obrecht he didn't tell Maxie the entire story. After he and Maxie get engaged, Nathan admits he discovered Claudette's infidelity when he walked in on her and her lover. Drunk and angry, he shot Claudette's lover, who disappeared. Maxie is hesitant to trust Nathan, but they soon reconcile, only for Claudette (Bree Williamson) to show up in town. Maxie convinces Nathan to let Claudette stay to keep an eye on her. Nathan discovers his recent confidant Griffin Munro (Matt Cohen) was Claudette's lover. Furious, he attacks Griffin. Maxie and Claudette have to pull him off. Maxie accuses him of still being in love with Claudette, but he convinces her this is not true, and he loves her. Claudette asks Nathan for help to protect her daughter, Charlotte (Scarlett Fernandez) ‚Äì who she claims is also Nathan's daughter ‚Äì from Claudette's ex-lover, Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart). Rightfully suspicious, Maxie exposes Charlotte is not Nathan's daughter. Claudette eventually skips town, and Nathan and Maxie get back to planning their wedding. They're set to marry on New Year's Eve, but Nathan finds out his marriage to Claudette was never annulled, hence they're still married and he can't marry Maxie. He and Maxie fly to Canada to track down Claudette, and find out she's dead. Nathan and Maxie return, and finally get married in early 2017. When Maxie goes to Portland for work, Nathan is left to wonder if the marriage can survive the long distance. Nathan learns Nurse Amy Driscoll (Risa Dorken) has been writing the \\"Ask Man Landers\\" advice blog, using his picture. Nathan is initially upset until Amy reveals she is writing the column to support her brother Chet (Chris Van Etten), a war veteran who was wounded in action. When Amy lands a book deal, he agrees to help her out so she can pay Chet's medical bills. Maxie returns, and aims to expose Ask Man Landers' identity forcing Nathan to lie. Amy gives Nathan her blessing to tell Maxie the truth just as Maxie begins to suspect they are having an affair. Nathan and Amy's secret is exposed in tabloids forcing them to do damage control. Chet steps in and tells his story, winning sympathy and keeping Nathan and Amy from being charged with fraud. On Thanksgiving, Nathan is thrilled when Maxie reveals she's pregnant. In preparation for the baby's arrival, Nathan requests Victor's medical records. While Obrecht obtains the records, Nathan and Maxie realize the medical records are inconsistent with the Cassadine family's genetic history and a DNA test later confirms Nathan is not a Cassadine after all. Obrecht is forced to admit that Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) is Nathan's biological father. Lulu convinces Nathan to do an expos√© on him as Faison's son to help the authorities lure him out of hiding. Maxie fears the danger Faison could bring to their doorstep, but Nathan is determined to bring his father to justice. As expected, Faison shows up and takes Maxie and her boss Peter August (Wes Ramsey) hostage. Nathan comes to Maxie's rescue only to be shot by Faison. While he survives emergency surgery, Nathan dies in recovery shortly after professing his love for Maxie. He was buried with full policeman honors. Maxie later gives birth to a baby boy; in memory of Nathan, she names their son James, Nathan's given name. Development =Casting and creation= In November 2013, the producers released a casting call for a contract role. In late December 2013, head writer Ron Carlivati announced on Twitter that model turned actor Ryan Paevey had joined the cast in the contract role of Detective Nathan West. The December 30th edition of Soap Opera Digest revealed that Paevey's first scenes were with Kirsten Storms, who played Maxie Jones. ABC Soaps In Depth confirmed the character's full name to be Nathan West. Paevey made his debut as a contract cast member. Though he was originally slated to appear on December 27, Paevey's first air date was pushed back to December 30, due to news coverage. During an interview with AfterBuzz TV, Paevey revealed that the rather unconventional casting process started when he was just lounging around with his close friends and management team and one of his managers suggested that Paevey should meet with casting director Mark Teschner. Paevey revealed that when he first auditioned for the show, \\"there was no part. They just wanted some young blood on the show.\\" The producers had the actor come in to read dummy sides quite a few times. He was brought back to audition again for executive producer Frank Valentini and other people from the network. During the audition process, he screen-tested opposite Storms and Chad Duell, who played Michael Corinthos. Of his casting, Paevey said, \\"This is my first series regular role, the first time I have a dressing room with my name on the door. I'm not an ego guy, but by the same token, I also kind of wanted to my best to fit in quickly.\\" Paevey himself was shocked by his success because he had no prior acting experience when he auditioned for General Hospital. =Characterization= The initial casting notice described the character as a \\"Caucasian\\" in his \\"late 20s\\" who is \\"handsome, sexy\\" and \\"dynamic.\\" The character was further described as a \\"rich, privileged, charming badboy.\\" However, the \\"badboy\\" characteristic appeared to have been dropped by the time of Paevey's casting. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Paevey described Nathan as a \\"good guy,\\" who is \\"guided by a moral compass. He's a straight- shooter.\\" Paevey described Nathan's demeanor as a cop as \\"hawklike focus.\\" Ron Carlivati described Nathan as a \\"hard-nosed, buttoned-down, practical guy.\\" Soap Opera Digest described Nathan as a \\"hard-driving cop character.\\" Paevey told Soaps In Depth that Nathan's birth name, \\"James represents a part his family [and himself] that is restricted.\\" This complicates things further because he loves his family very much and there are several aspects of that family that make Nathan who he is. Paevey said that during the audition process when the character was being formed, he noticed that he and the character had a lot in common. Since the character's introduction, it has been very clear that \\"he's a law-abiding, true-seeking good guy.\\" Paevey immediately rejected the notion that Nathan could have a dark side because of his genetics ‚Äì \\"I don't think he's the type\\" Paevey insisted. \\"Sometimes a good egg comes out of a bad nest.\\" According to Paevey, Nathan is not \\"morally ambiguous.\\" He doesn't have some deep dark sketchy past that he is trying to live down. Nathan is \\"straight and he's clear. My gut tells me that,\\" Paevey said. Paevey later said \\"I think the fact that his family was so busted up is the reason he's a good guy.\\" =Introduction (2014)= Not attaching Nathan to a specific love interest immediately allows for the writers to slowly integrate him into the canvas. Soaps In Depth reported that Nathan's isn't just some \\"run-of-the-mill\\" cop, but \\"he's on a mission to stir things up for a few people!\\" It is soon revealed that Nathan is in town investigating his estranged brother-in-law Silas Clay (Michael Easton) in the attempted murder of his comatose sister Nina. However, Silas's former mistress Ava Jerome (Maura West) is also at the top of the suspect list. In 2014, legendary actress Donna Mills, known for her portrayal of Abby Cunningham on the prime time soap, Knots Landing was cast in the role of Madeline Reeves‚ÄîNathan's mother. It is revealed that Madeline raised Nathan to believe Silas was guilty and he is working on her behalf to lock Silas up for Nina's condition. Despite acting to avenge his sister, Nathan tolerates Madeline's disdain for his career choice because she thinks it is \\"below them.\\" Nathan partners up with Silas and his girlfriend Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) to set a trap for Ava believing she is guilty. However, the sting operation doesn't go as planned when Madeline is revealed to be the culprit‚Äîand Nathan is forced to arrest her. =Lineage= Madeline's arrest sets the stage for several more revelations starting with Nathan being revealed to be the biological son of Madeline's estranged sister, Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati) and therefore the half-brother of Obrecht's daughter Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud). Nathan is \\"dumbfounded\\" by the shift in his family dynamics, much like Paevey himself. Madeline is forced to come clean after learning that Nathan and Britt nearly slept together. Soaps In Depth said Nathan is in a \\"rock and hard place\\" with mothers like Obrecht and Madeline. Nathan must come to terms with the fact that \\"the murderer he thought to be his mother is actually his aunt. And the murderer he believed to be just another nutjob is actually his biological mother!\\" According to Paevey, Nathan is immediately put off by the revelation of his connection to Obrecht due to her less than stellar reputation and he is reluctant to have anything to do with her. While she is genuinely interested in building a relationship, he is not. Though Paevey expected Nathan to eventually bond with Obrecht, Ron Carlivati insisted it would take much more than the information for Nathan to come to see Liesl as his mother especially because of his feelings towards Madeline. Nathan struggles with trusting anyone because his entire life has been a lie. And because there is so much happening in his life at the time Nathan's feelings about the situation get pushed to the side. As Madeline is carted off to prison, she drops yet another bomb on Nathan by revealing that Nina (Michelle Stafford) is very much alive. For Nathan, his relationship with Nina has always been \\"sacrosanct\\" and he is that one good thing in her life which makes him vulnerable to her schemes. According to Paevey, \\"Nina is the one pure memory of [Nathan's] childhood.\\" When Madeline is released from prison, Nathan tries to give her the benefit of the doubt because her actions don't negate the good she did in raising him. As for his feelings toward Obrecht, Nathan recognizes she isn't \\"all-bad.\\" Despite giving them a chance, Paevey said \\"nothing really surprises him anymore\\" when it comes to his family. Nathan's expectations are not too high because \\"he already knows that everybody in his family is a mess.\\" In 2014, Paevey said \\"Nathan is intrinsically distrustful of the concept of his family.\\" Despite the recent revelations about Nathan's other familial connections, in May 2014 Paevey himself wondered if Nathan's paternity would be addressed. With the reveal that Obrecht is his mother, On- Air On-Soaps immediately speculated that Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) who had recently been revealed as his sister Britt's father could be Nathan's father too. However, Carol Baroom from SoapHub said the Faison theory \\"doesn't make sense\\" because there would have been no reason for Obrecht to give Nathan up‚Äîshe would have raised him with Faison and Britt. Faison as Nathan's father would also contradict Obrecht's prior disappointment with being unable to give him a male heir. Baroom also suggested that Obrecht feels it would hurt Faison to know she had another man's child. In December 2014, it is made clear that Faison would have never accepted another man's child. In June 2014, when Thaao Penghlis announced that he would reprise his role as Victor Cassadine, Daytime Confidential speculated that Victor could turn out to be Nathan's father. During an interview in July 2014, Ryan Paevey guessed that his character would turn out to be a member of the famous, yet infamous Cassadine family. Meanwhile, speculation increased when Penghlis invited Paevey to appear with him at his book signing and fed into the rumors with cryptic messages on social media. However, Penghlis refused to confirm or deny the potential plot twist when he was questioned by Soaps In Depth. Then head writer Ron Carlivati revealed that there was much more to Victor and Obrecht's relationship than expected. Though she viewed Victor as the more \\"feasible\\" candidate for Nathan's father, Carol Baroom immediately questioned Obrecht's motives for hiding Nathan from Victor and vice versa. Obrecht claims Victor as Nathan's father in September 2014 only for Victor to order a DNA test which disproves that theory. However, Obrecht kills Victor before he can tell Nathan that they aren't father and son after all. She then allows Nathan and the rest of the world to believe her lie. In March 2015, Janette Smith of Soap Opera Spy recognized that Obrecht \\"fears for the safety of Nathan if his father is ever revealed\\" and proposed yet another potential candidate as Nathan's father. Based on Obrecht going to such extreme lengths to keep Nathan from questioning his paternity, Smith speculated that Nathan's father could actually be the never before seen Valentin Cassadine‚Äîa character that was slated to be introduced in 2009, but the story was terminated before it hit airwaves. Even the notoriously evil Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers) who had wreaked havoc on Port Charles for years was visibly terrified of Valentin when the character was first mentioned in 2009 as he was supposed to be more much more lethal than any of the other Cassadines. In May 2016, Paevey commented on the character's paternity plot taking a backseat as his story progressed and felt it would definitely be addressed sometime in the future. However, Paevey admitted that the writers were very adamant about a Cassadine connection. When Valentin (James Patrick Stuart) comes after Nathan's supposed daughter Charlotte in October 2016, SoapHubs Hope Campbell speculated that the series had finally set the stage to solve the two-year long mystery of Nathan's paternity. =Relationships= Australian actor Zachary Garred played Levi, who does his best to isolate Maxie from her loved ones, putting him at odds with Nathan. Nathan's only significant romance within the series to date is his relationship with Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms). Ron Carlivati recalled during an interview with Soap Opera Digest, \\"When we saw Ryan [Paevey, Nathan] we thought, 'Oh, wow, he'd be really great for Maxie.'\\" The purpose of their first scenes, which are Storms's final scenes before her maternity leave to make sure viewers saw the obvious chemistry. Carlivati said \\"These two may be arguing, bickering, or sparring, but you can see there is a spark there.\\" According to Ryan Paevey, Nathan and Maxie clash because they complete opposites and that is what appeals to Nathan. He finds her to be \\"charming.\\" Meanwhile, Nathan clashes with Maxie's new boyfriend Levi Dunkleman (Zachary Garred) and a triangle evolves from the storyline with Levi exploiting the existing tension between Nathan and Maxie. Unlike Levi, Nathan is supportive of any decision Maxie makes on her own‚Äîbut they struggle to recognize how right they are each other. But it Nathan's willingness to break the law for Maxie by committing perjury that allows for fans to root for the couple. With Maxie and Levi set to marry to prevent him from being deported, Nathan admits to himself that he has feelings for Maxie. The triangle culminates with Levi proving to be even more dangerous than even Nathan could have thought. Levi and Maxie's wedding sets the stage for Levi's exposure and also allows for Nathan to play hero to Maxie. Carlivati said that he enjoyed the slow build between Maxie and Nathan. Nathan would do anything to give Maxie some stability in her life, even overlooking when she breaks the law for a friend. Throughout the triangle, Nathan finds an ally in Maxie's stepfather Mac Scorpio (John J. York). The couple's next obstacle comes in the form of Maxie's ex-boyfriend and father of her child, Damian Spinelli (Bradford Anderson). They briefly split and Maxie goes back to Spinelli. Nathan steps back and allows for Maxie to realize what she really wants. According to Paevey, Nathan understands Maxie's need to make it work with Spinelli for the child's sake and knows there will \\"always\\" be love between them. Nathan is briefly paired with Spinelli's girlfriend Ellie Trout (Emily Wilson) when they team up to make their respective loves jealous. In 2016, the writers began exploring Nathan's past by revealing that he was once married to a woman named Claudette‚Äîsomething he had chosen to keep from Maxie‚Äîand everyone else. In the meantime, Maxie and Nathan become engaged. In May 2016, it was announced that Bree Williamson had been cast in the role of Claudette and was set to debut in July 2016. Though there seems to be more to the story than Nathan is willing to admit, according to Ryan Paevey, it is Nathan's honest nature that forces him to come clean. Nathan \\"recognizes how glaringly out of character\\" the consistent lying is. Though he has some encouragement from Griffin Munro (Matt Cohen), Paevey insisted that Nathan would've eventually came clean on his own‚Äîbut confiding in the doctor-priest helped hasten his decision. Despite the lie, Nathan fears that \\"knowing all these things is going to make [Maxie] view him as someone that she doesn't want to be with.\\" Nathan doesn't have any cards left to play once he comes clean. He confesses and hopes \\"their feelings are strong enough to carry them through this.\\" Reception Ryan Paevey's \\"good looks\\" drew comparisons to former General Hospital heartthrob Antonio Sab√†to Jr. who played top cop Jagger Cates in the 1990s. Carlivati's Twitter announcement garnered quite the reaction with fans wondering about Paevey and his role on the show. Shortly after Paevey's debut, a fan created a fake Twitter account, pretending to be the actor. Of the fan reaction, ABC Soaps In Depth said Paevey was an \\"instant hit on social media and the internet,\\" and described as the \\"next big thing.\\" Connie Passalacqua of the soap opera website, Marlena De Lacroix listed Paevey as one of the daytime four actors to watch in 2014. She said: \\"Paevey is quite good looking, can act well and plays a police detective quite believably.\\" Soaps In Depth listed the character at number 5 in the \\"5 Things We're Loving\\" section in the February 3, 2014 edition. Sara Bibel said that while \\"GH is full off good looking men.\\" Paevey is one that makes others say \\"Damn, he's good looking.\\" Bibel also likened the character of Nathan to a young Mac Scorpio. Of the character's introduction, the magazine said, \\"We can't help but love a man of mystery, and that's what General Hospitals Nathan ‚Äì‚Äì whom we've dubbed Detective Sexypants ‚Äì‚Äì is to us right now.\\" One viewer praised the casting of Paevey and Ryan Carnes (Lucas Jones) and the fan mail was featured in Soap Opera Digest: \\"great job adding [Paevey and Carnes]; drop-dead gorgeous and they can act too!\\" The character of Nathan became quite popular with fans, despite viewer complaints that there were too many characters on canvas. Carol Boorom from SoapHub said Paevey \\"whose good looks are only out shined by his good heart, is a special treat to watch.\\" DashboardGirl from General Hospital Blog said \\"Ryan Paevey has been such a delightful newcomer to the GH cast.\\" She continued, \\"he's easy on the eyes, and his role as Detective West is nothing short of sweet, sexy, compassionate, and much more.\\" On Britt and Nathan being siblings, Soaps In Depth said, \\"They may well be the hottest siblings ever.\\" Paevey \\"has become quite the sensation in short amount of time\\" said Michael Fairman in November 2014. Paevey's popularity led to the 30-year-old being featured in Peoples \\"Sexiest Man Alive\\" issue in \\"The Sexiest Men At Every Age\\" list. In 2015, Jenn Bishop of TVSource Magazine included the character in the list of several new characters that she enjoyed from Ron Carlivati. In 2015, Rosemary A. Rossi described Paevey as \\"one of the hottest properties on daytime.\\" Paevey's popularity also landed him a reporting gig on the syndicated TV newsmagazine Extra. Within Paevey's first year on the series, his character entered into a relationship with Maxie Jones that became quite popular with viewers and critics alike. ABC Soaps In Depth described the chemistry between Paevey's Nathan and Storms' Maxie as \\"instant.\\" General Hospital Blog praised the duo's chemistry described Nathan and Maxie (known as Naxie) as \\"one of the most loveable couples on GH.\\" TVSource Magazine praised the duo's chemistry as well as the \\"slow burn\\" writing for the pairing: \\"Nathan and Maxie have reminded us what a soap couple worth for looks like.\\" References West, Nathan West, Nathan West, Nathan West, Nathan ","title":"Nathan West (General Hospital)"},{"id":"43685366","text":"William Henry Wyman (December 14, 1951 ‚Äì June 19, 2013)Dates of birth and death based on (1) obituary cited below, and (2) Ancestry.com.

She studied at Edinburgh College of Art and the Royal College of Art, and was elected as a Royal Academician in 2014. She became professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools in 2016.  Early life and education  Pilkington was born in Manchester, England. She attended the art foundation course at North Cheshire College in Warrington (now part of the University of Chester), then went on to study silversmithing at Edinburgh College of Art from 1986. She graduated with a BA in 1991, with first-class honours, and in the same year was awarded the first John Watson Prize for Art. She also taught in America and India in 1989‚Äì1990. She exhibited with the Bruton Gallery in Bath from 1992, and was part of the first Royal West of England Academy Open Sculpture Exhibition in 1993. Pilkington studied at the Royal College of Art in London from 1995, gaining an MA in Sculpture in 1997; she was subsequently awarded the Cheltenham Fine Art Fellowship.  Career  In 1999, Pilkington's sculpture Bill and Bob, depicting two Jack Russell terriers swimming in a pool, was installed in Millennium Square in Bristol. This was Pilkington's first commission for a public space, The two dogs are rendered in painted bronze and set in a pool of vivid blue rubber, flush with the square's paving. Pilkington's \\"amusing and ambiguously sentimental sculptures\\" were included in the three-person show Off the Leash at the Graves Art Gallery in Sheffield in 2003, the same year that her Homunculus (2003), a miniature painted fibreglass manikin of a boy, was displayed outside the headquarters of The Economist magazine in London. At the time she was based in London as a lecturer at Camberwell College of Arts. In 2012, her solo exhibition entitled The Value of the Paw was held at the V&A; Museum of Childhood in Bethnal Green, London. Pilkington was elected as a Royal Academician in 2014, and was awarded the Sunny Dupree award for her work Reclining Doll (2013) Referencing the reclining figures of Henry Moore, Pilkington's interest in using shop windows and modes of display, and in using dolls and manikins in her work, is evident here: as she says, \\"The doll is a perfect object to put lots of ideas into\\" . In 2017, after being appointed Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools, Pilkington created the project Anatomy of a Doll, in which she placed ballet-dancer figures, derived from those in the work of Edgar Degas, distorted and apparently in the process of being sculpted, in the Life Room of the Royal Academy Schools. her Surrealist approach to the figure was shared with participants in the project 'Exquisite Corpse' which she invited members of the public to attend classes based on the work.She says of her engagement with the female form: 'I am consciously joining in with the objectification of the female form, but on my own terms, and with glee' For the Brighton Festival in 2017 Pilkington created Life Rooms and engaged with the work of British artist Eric Gill, co-curating the exhibition Eric Gill: The Body, with Cathie Pilkington which featured work by Gill and her own work, Doll for Petra, inspired by a doll made by Gill for his daughter, at Ditchling Museum of Art and Craft, Sussex. Pilkington's work is held in the collections of the Deste Foundation in Athens, Manchester Art Gallery and the David Roberts Collection in London.

According to Allard the party cannot be placed anywhere on the traditional left-right spectrum, and instead focuses on local issues. Some of its key issues include lowered wages for politicians, stricter migration policy, and free dental care. The party runs candidates for seats in the municipal assembly of √ñrebro Municipality and the √ñrebro County Council, and got two seats in the municipal council after the elections of 2018. Its symbol represents Svampen (The Mushroom), a water tower that is a prominent landmark in √ñrebro. History The initiative to found the √ñrebro Party was taken in early 2014 by Markus Allard, who is also the first party leader. Allard had previously held positions as substitute member of the √ñrebro municipal council and district chairman of the Young Left in √ñrebro; in December 2013 he was expelled from the Left Party and its youth wing Young Left for \\"liking\\" the Revolutionary Front, a militant revolutionary socialist and anti-fascist organization, on Facebook and refusing to disavow it when questioned. Allard has stated that the real reason for his expulsion was that he was perceived as a threat to the established party bureaucracy. As a result of signing the petition required for √ñP to be registered as a party, a large number of Left Party members in √ñrebro were informed of the party's intention to expel them. This triggered backlash from several other Left Party members in social media, and a number of Left Party and Young Left members who had signed the petition later appeared on the party's list of election candidates while not joining √ñP as members. Throughout early 2014, several members of the Young Left were expelled for expressing support for Allard and his position on the Revolutionary Front, among them the writer Malcom Kyeyune and Axel Frick, Allard's replacement as district chairman of the Young Left in √ñrebro and an √ñrebro Party candidate. In the September 2014 Swedish election, the party received 1,050 votes in the municipal council election in √ñrebro, and also some write-in votes in √ñrebro County for the Riksdag. In February 2018 , an √ñrebro police officer, joined the party. He had attracted attention the previous year for a Facebook post about his experience with overrepresentation of violent crime among immigrants. In the 2018 election, the party gained two seats on the √ñrebro municipal council, where it is represented by Allard and Springare. They subsequently gained representation on the √ñrebro municipal executive committee, with Allard as full-time municipal commissioner. In keeping with the party's policy against high political wages, he has been donating half of his monthly allowance to fund a planned series of social programmes. In august 2019 the party announced the first such project to be social pole-walking (sauvak√§vely) for pensioners. During the Corona crisis the party has used this fund to provide face masks to municipal elderly care workers, while heavily criticising what is perceived as a political gag-order on care workers regarding poor equipment and conditions. Since achieving municipal representation in 2018 the party has gotten considerable attention for Allards distinctly polemical debating-style in the municipal chamber, with a number of speeches going viral. Ideology While party leader Allard has described himself as a Communist, and a Marxist, at its founding in March 2014 he defined the √ñrebro Party as \\"broad left\\". At that time the party considered itself a \\"local party that wants to carry on the labour movement's ideals\\", and \\"not interested in administrating the current society\\". In February 2018, Allard stated that having decided to focus on \\"down-to-earth and local issues\\", the party membership had broadened since its foundation and he would no longer characterize it as either left or right. The party is heavily opposed to political corruption and high politician incomes ‚Äì among some of the measures it supports are reducing the wages of politicians and senior officials, making plebiscites easier to enact and more potent, increased social housing and subsidies for youth recreation, and free dental care. The party opposes continued privatization of health care, elderly care, public housing and municipal education, among other things.

The sect was founded by a Sistani named Muhammad ibn KarramEncyclopedia Iranica, \\"KARRƒÄMIYA\\" (d. 896) who was a popular preacher in Khurasan in the 9th century in the vicinity of Nishapur. He later emigrated with many of his followers to Jerusalem. According to him, the KarrƒÅmites were also called the \\"followers of Ab≈´'AbdallƒÅh\\" (a·π£·∏•ƒÅb Abƒ´'AbdallƒÅh) . Zysow: Two unrecognized KarrƒÅmƒ´ texts. 1988, p. 580 . Its main distribution areas were in Greater Khorasan, Transoxiana and eastern peripheral areas of Iran. Early Ghaznavids and the early Ghurid dynasty granted the KarrƒÅmƒ´yan rulership. The most important center of the community remained until the end of the 11th century Nishapur. After its decline, the KarrƒÅmƒ´ya survived only in Ghazni and Ghor in the area of today's Afghanistan. Doctrine The doctrine of the Karramiyya consisted of literalism and anthropomorphism. Ibn Karram considered that God was a substance and that He had a body (jism) finite in certain directions when He comes into contact with the Throne. This belief was rejected by orthodox Sunni Muslim scholars such as: Abu Bakr al-Samarqandi (d. 268/881‚Äì2), al-Hakim al-Samarqandi (d. 342/953), 'Abd al-Qahir al-Baghdadi (d. 429/1037‚Äì8), and the Ash'ari-Maturidi scholars in general. Ibn Hajar al- Haytami stated that, \\"They believe that God is a body sitting on the Throne, touching it and resting on it, and then moves down every night during the last third of the night to the heavens, and then goes back to His place at dawn.\\"Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed, Introduction in Ibn Taymiyya and His Times, eds. Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed (Karachi: Oxford University Press, 2010), 278 They also believed that Munkar and Nakir angels were actually the same as guardian angels on the right and left side of every person. The Karramiyya also held the view that the world was eternal and that God's power was limited. These beliefs were rejected by many Sunni theologians as heretical and eventually disappeared. The Karramiyya operated centers of worship and propagated asceticism. Unlike other corporealist groups, the Karramiyya emphasised use of reason to defend their beliefs. Ibn Taymiyyah, a late student of Karrami theology, defended Ibn Karram from the accusations of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, and said he was a Sunni muslim.Hashim, Abdul Quddus, and Abdull Rahman Mahmood. \\"Isu Melihat Allah SWT di Akhirat Antara Al-B≈´tƒ´ dan Salafiyyah Semasa.\\" Fikiran Masyarakat 5.1 (2017): 41-49.

They play an integral role in the electrical conduction system of the heart by transmitting cardiac action potentials from the bundle of His to the Purkinje fibers.  Structure  There are two branches of the bundle of His: the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch, both of which are located along the interventricular septum. The left bundle branch further divides into the left anterior fascicles and the left posterior fascicles. These structures lead to a network of thin filaments known as Purkinje fibers. They play an integral role in the electrical conduction system of the heart by transmitting cardiac action potentials to the Purkinje fibers.  Clinical significance  When a bundle branch or fascicle becomes injured (by underlying heart disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiac surgery), it may cease to conduct electrical impulses appropriately, resulting in altered pathways for ventricular depolarization. This condition is known as a bundle branch block.  History  The bundle branches were separately described by Retzer and Braeunig as early as 1904, but their physiological function remained unclear and their role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph on Das Reizleitungssystem des S√§ugetierherzens (English: The Conduction System of the Mammalian Heart) in 1906. Although Tawara's monograph had demonstrated that the branches of the bundle of His may transmit cardiac action potentials to the ventricles, the functional proof for his observation was not provided until 1910, when Hans Eppinger and Carl Julius Rothberger showed that cutting off both branches to induce a bilateral bundle branch block results in a complete heart block.

It was an active U.S. military facility during the 20th century, but the airport was shut down in 2005 and the runway is not maintained. Although no longer a diversion airport, it is still considered preferable to a dangerous water landing in an extreme emergency. History In September 1941, construction of an airfield on Johnston Island commenced. A by runway was built, together with two 400-man barracks, two mess halls, a cold-storage building, an underground hospital, a fresh-water plant, shop buildings, and fuel storage. The runway was complete by December 7, 1941, though in December 1943, the 99th Naval Construction Battalion arrived at the atoll and proceeded to lengthen the runway to . The runway was subsequently lengthened and improved as the island was enlarged. During WWII, Johnston Atoll was used as a refueling base for submarines, and also as an aircraft refueling stop for American bombers transiting the Pacific Ocean, including the Boeing B-29 Enola Gay. By 1944, the atoll was one of the busiest air transport terminals in the Pacific. Air Transport Command aeromedical evacuation planes stopped at Johnston en route to Hawaii. Following V-J Day on August 14, 1945, Johnston Atoll saw the flow of men and aircraft that had been coming from the mainland into the Pacific turn around. By 1947, over 1,300 B-29 and B-24 bombers had passed through the Marianas, Kwajalein, Johnston Island, and Oahu, taking military personnel back to Mather Field and civilian life. The airline Continental Micronesia served the island commercially, touching down between Honolulu and Majuro. When an aircraft landed it was surrounded by armed soldiers and the passengers were not allowed to leave the aircraft. Aloha Airlines also made weekly scheduled flights to the island carrying civilian and military personnel. In the 1990s, there were flights almost daily, and some days saw up to three arrivals. Just prior to movement of the chemical munitions to Johnston Atoll, the Surgeon General, Public Health Service, reviewed the shipment and the Johnston Atoll storage plans. His recommendations caused the Secretary of Defense to issue instructions in December 1970 suspending missile launches and all non-essential aircraft flights. As a result, the Continental Micronesia service was immediately discontinued, and missile firings were terminated, with the exception of two 1975 satellite launches deemed critical to the islands mission. Incidences and current use The Johnston Atoll runway was used for emergency landings for both civil and military aircraft on many occasions. After it was decommissioned, it could no longer be considered as a possible emergency landing place when planning flight routes across the Pacific Ocean. As of 2003, the airfield consisted of a closed, unmaintained, single asphalt/concrete runway 05/23, with a parallel taxiway, and a large paved ramp along its south-east side.

The service was viewed as a Canadian-based competitor to Netflix, with a library of 1,200 films and 11,000 hours' worth of television programs available on launch. Shomi content could be accessed as an over-the-top service through the service's website and apps, or through the video-on-demand libraries of participating television providers. The service emphasized manually curated categories of content, in contrast to the algorithmic approach used by competing services. As of its beta launch on November 4, 2014, the service was not available as a standalone product and could only be purchased by internet and television subscribers of Rogers and Shaw. After August 20, 2015 that restriction was removed, and the service was available standalone. It competed directly with other subscription-based over-the-top streaming services, such as Bell Media's CraveTV. On September 26, 2016, Shomi announced the service would shut down on November 30, 2016.  Distribution  Shomi was available via the video-on-demand library of subscribers' set-top boxes, and as an over- the-top service via its website, mobile apps, video game consoles, and other devices. The service was priced at $8.99 per month; for its beta phase, Shomi was only available to those who are customers of Rogers and Shaw's internet or cable television services. A Rogers representative stated that the venture was \\"evaluating various distribution models\\" and was in talks with other television providers. As of August 20, 2015, Shomi was available as a standalone service and was no longer exclusive to Rogers or Shaw customers. In October 2015, Shaw Direct added Shomi to the lineup.http://www.shawdirect.ca/english/shomi/?intcid=ib-2015-10-15-shomi- Hero1-eng-shawdirect/  Content  At its initial launch, the service offered 340 television series (11,000 hours) and 1,200 movies. Rather than using computer algorithms for suggesting content that a viewer may be interested in based on past viewing habits, Shomi content was divided into manually curated categories. In October 2014, the service announced a content deal with the American premium cable service Starz, which will see some of that channel's original series, including Power, Survivor's Remorse, Black Sails, The White Queen, Spartacus and Da Vinci's Demons, distributed through the service.\\"shomi Partners with Starz Digital Media\\".

Criticism  In February 2015, the Consumers' Association of Canada and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre filed a complaint with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) about Shomi and Bell Media's competing service CraveTV, arguing that their exclusivity primarily to those who are subscribers of their respective owners' television services was a form of tied selling that \\"[discriminates] against customers who wish to only view programming through an Internet service provider of their choice\\". On March 12, 2015, the CRTC announced new proposed regulations for video on demand services, creating a new category for \\"hybrid online video-on-demand\\" services between unregulated digital services and licensed video on demand services offered by providers, which are not allowed to offer \\"exclusive\\" content, and are also subject to genre protection and Canadian content rules. These services would not be bound to the aforementioned rules, including the ability to offer \\"exclusive\\" content, and can be made accessible within a television provider's video on demand system, but they must be also offered over-the-top on a standalone basis without a television subscription. The CRTC did not explicitly state whether CraveTV or Shomi would be classified as a \\"hybrid\\" VOD service under its proposed regulations, which would have required them to offer their service on a standalone basis. Shomi announced in May 2015 that it would begin offering its service as a standalone product later in the year. In June 2015, Eastlink and Telus also filed a complaint with the CRTC against Shomi, arguing that the exclusivity period to Rogers and Shaw subscribers gave the two companies an unfair advantage, as they do not operate in all areas of the country, and no other third-party provider had offered it. The complaint alleged that the partnership had purposely frustrated attempts by third-party providers to negotiate deals to offer Shomi through various means, including providing limited notice of its launch (in contrast to CraveTV, which provided more advance notice, giving time for providers to reach deals), and stalling attempts to negotiate carriage deals by refusing to send a full contract to Eastlink. The complaint concluded that the actions demonstrated Rogers and Shaw \\"had no intention of making Shomi available to independent [providers], and their customers, in a timely manner.\\" Discontinuation On September 26, 2016, Shomi announced it would shut down on November 30, 2016. David Asch, senior vice-president and general manager for Shomi, cited the changing climate of the online video marketplace in Canada and greater than anticipated challenges in operating as the reasons for the shut down. Melani Griffith, senior vice-president of content at Rogers, said that the number of subscriptions was not \\"big enough to be renewed for another season\\". This announcement came amid reports that Rogers and Shaw expect to incur a \\"loss on investment of approximately $100 million to $140 million in its third quarter\\". Solutions Research Group conducted a study in June 2016 that indicated that 5.2 million Canadian households subscribe to Netflix. In the same study, Crave and Shomi together had fewer than 700,000 subscribers. The discontinuation was criticized by CRTC Chairman Jean-Pierre Blais, who remarked in an address that he \\"can't help but be surprised when major players throw in the towel on a platform that is the future of content‚Äîjust two years after it launched. I have to wonder if they are too used to receiving rents from subscribers every month in a protected ecosystem, rather than rolling up their sleeves in order to build a business without regulatory intervention and protection.\\" No general announcement was made regarding programming rights Shomi had at the time of shutdown. Amazon.com announced that it would expand its video service worldwide for the launch of its new original series The Grand Tour. Shomi held Canadian rights to several Amazon series including Transparent. Since the launch of Amazon's Prime Video service in Canada previous Shomi held series including Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle have appeared on Amazon with the most recent season missing.

It was founded around 1237 in memory of Joan, wife of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth. The Friary survived the depopulation of the town, but was dissolved in 1538 and most of the buildings dismantled soon afterwards. The land became an estate on which, in 1623, Rowland Whyte built a house which he called Friars. It became one of the many properties of the Bulkeley family, and was substantially rebuilt in 1866. By the 20th century the house and grounds were owned by James Hartley Burton. In 1939 they were requisitioned for wartime use, adapting and repairing flying boats, by Saunders-Roe, who continued after the war with a wide variety of light engineering activities. The industrial uses finally came to an end in the late 1990s. An archaeological dig on the site in 1991 identified substantial buried remains of the friary church and other monastic buildings. The site is a Scheduled monument. The Maedref of Llanfaes The medieval settlement of Llanfaes is now represented only by St Catherine's Church, and even that is a product of 19th century rebuilding. However it is the residual survivor of a thriving town which by the 12th century was controlling 70% of the trade of the whole of Gwynedd. By the 900s it was the main town (Maerdref) and Royal Court (Llys) of the commote of Dindaethwy which covered the southeast quarter of Anglesey. Control of the ferry crossing gave Llanfaes its wealth and prestige, and by the early 13th century it was a busy commercial town, probably centred around the Church. It was into this urbanised location that the Franciscan Friary was established. However, by the end of the 13th century Edward I had defeated Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and put down the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn, and to press home his conquest, began a new castle and walled town at Beaumaris. The new town took control of the ferry crossing, and to ensure Llanfaes did not compete commercially with the new maerdref of Beaumaris, in 1303 the Llanfaes burgesses were forcibly resettled on the other side of Anglesey, at another new township, Newborough. Apart from the Church and the Friary, little seems to have survived this determined depopulation, such that even the location of the town is now uncertain. Foundation The first Franciscans arrived in Britain in 1224 as part of a missionary expansion of this new order of friars living a life of poverty and preaching. Unlike many earlier monasteries that had sought rural seclusion, the Franciscans needed and embraced urban locations, both to provide them with the daily charitable giving needed by a mendicant existence, and to be amongst the people they wished to teach and serve. All the earliest British foundations were small, often redundant or decayed premises, and there was an active resistance to prestige or permanence in their buildings. However this very rejection of the trappings of success was greeted with enthusiasm across England and Wales and by 1240 at least 29 houses had become established. The Friary at Llanfaes was founded about 1237 AD, just as this early stress on poverty was beginning to be replaced by an acceptance of larger, well-funded premises, from donors eager to be associated with this lively new expression of Christian faith. In this case it would appear that Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, Prince of Gwynedd and Wales, established the friary in memory of his wife Joan, Lady of Wales, who died in 1237 at their palace in Abergwyngregyn. The friary was consecrated in 1240, prior to Llywelyn's death, and Joan's original burial place was within a consecrated enclosure which remained within the friary precincts after it was constructed. As a result of these events, the friary became associated with female members of the royal family of Gwynedd, and in 1282 it was the burial place of Eleanor de Montfort, Princess of Wales.Brut y Tywysogion, Peniarth MS20, 223; Peniarth MS20Tr, 117. It was also the favoured burial site of local Anglesey nobility. Decline Some damage to the friary occurred in 1295, during the revolt of Madoc ap Llywelyn. It was further embroiled in the 1401 rebellion of Owain Glyndwr, causing sufficient damage that the occupants were forced to vacate it for several years. It was restored in 1414 with the support of King Henry V. Despite the disappearance of its town, the monastery was at least sustainable, and was still a going concern at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Dissolution The friary was dissolved in 1538 by Henry VIII, and an inventory at that time indicates that, as well as the church, vestry, accommodation and refectory buildings, a substantial agricultural holding was in place. It lists a brew-house with a furnace and brewing vat, a yard with carts, a cheese store, kitchen, hall with table and trestles and a store house, agricultural produce, grain, cattle and sheep. The buildings were gradually demolished from 1539 onwards, to provide building material in Beaumaris. The precinct boundary wall was still visible to John Speed in 1610, and the Friary church remained until the mid-nineteenth century, in use as a barn. There are few surviving traces, other than a few medieval floor tiles. Some of these have images of oak leaves and acorns; it has been suggested that this relates to the name \\"Llanfaes\\", derived from \\"mes\\", a Welsh word for acorns. The friary's lands were initially acquired by the Bulkeley family. They then passed to the Wynne (Welsh for \\"White\\") family and, in 1623, Rowland Whyte built a house there. An empty stone coffin now to be found in St Mary's and St Nicholas's Church, Beaumaris, has long been considered to be that of Joan. The panel above the coffin is inscribed: \\"This plain sarcophagus, (once dignified as having contained the remains of Joan, daughter of King John, and consort of Llewelyn ap Iowerth, Prince of North Wales, who died in the year 1237), having been conveyed from the Friary of Llanfaes, and alas, used for many years as a horsewatering trough, was rescued from such an indignity and placed here for preservation as well as to excite serious meditation on the transitory nature of all sublunary distinctions. By Thomas James Warren Bulkeley, Viscount Bulkeley, Oct 1808\\" More recently, experts have reviewed the carved coffin lid, which does not appear to be associated with the coffin itself. It has been suggested that the style of the carved image is not in keeping the 1230s when Joan died, although the presence of a coronet suggests a member of the royal family. Eleanor de Montfort is considered by many to be the most likely alternative. Henllys and Fryars Henllys, the ancient Llys and mansion site last rebuilt in the 1850s by the Hampton family Near to Llanfaes was Henllys, in early medieval times the principle seat of one of the 15 tribes of North Wales. When Llanfaes was de-populated at the start of the 14th century, Henllys survived as a residence of note, and after 1460 it was granted to William Hampton, by then the Deputy Governor of Beaumaris Castle. The name Henllys means the 'old llys', acknowledging its former status as a royal court, and is first recorded in 1584. The Hamptons became the principle family of the locality and the family retained Henllys, expanding their land holdings such that by 1630 they held most of the former township of Llanfaes, and continued to do so until the mid-20th century. Henllys was rebuilt and expanded over the centuries, most recently in the 1850s. At the outbreak of the second world war it was requisitioned for wartime use to house engineering workers at the Fryars site. After the war Henllys was owned by a Franciscan order during the 1950s, before becoming a hotel and in 2003 became a part of the Holiday Property Bond. At the same time as the Hamptons were expanding their landholdings, the Bulkeleys were the principle Beaumaris family. At the dissolution of the Friary in 1539, it was the Bulkeleys who took the lease on the site, and plundered its building stone for use in Beaumaris. The next leaseholder, from 1563, was Ellis Wynne (White), and his descendant, Rowland Whyte built a house in 1623, which he named Friars. The Bulkeley family, with their huge mansion at nearby Baron Hill re-took possession of Friars from the Whytes and thus the two major landholders of the area, the Hamptons and Bulkeleys, divided Llanfaes between them. In 1866 Friars (which came to be spelled Fryars) was rebuilt and by the start of the 20th century Fryars had been bought by James Hartley Burton, originally from Birkdale, Lancashire. They had triplets, two boys and a girl. The two sons, Alfred and Richard, were both killed in World War I and are recorded on the Beaumaris war memorial. Industrial uses of the site Northern end of the friary site, showing now derelict engineering sheds. Catalina IVB 205 Sqn RAF, on the ground at Saunders-Roe's Friars site. The background was blanked out by a wartime censor to avoid showing the site details. In 1939 the 50 acre Fryars estate was requisitioned from the Burton family, for use in the war effort. The site was allocated to Saunders-Roe, who used it for modifying American and Canadian built Catalina flying boats. Over four years 399 Catalinas received a wide range of adaptations to fit in with RAF needs, including .303 British version Browning machine guns, British type bomb-racks and RAF radio equipment. They also installed highly secret Air-to-Surface Vessel radar (ASV) and from 1942, Leigh lights. German U-boats had to spend time on the surface at night, while they re-charged their batteries. The combination of radar and the high powered searchlights enabled the planes to find and attack a U-boat before it could dive. The Fryars Slipway on the foreshore of Fryars Bay At Llanfaes, a long slipway was built across the road and across the foreshore to Fryars Bay. The flying boats were able to utilise the large area of deep water along the east end of the Menai Straits. The Catalinas were manufactured in USA and Canada, and were initially sent over on cargo ships, but from November 1942 they were able to be flown over direct from either Bermuda or CFB Goose Bay, Canada.Extended quote from ‚Äì One of the survivals from this time is a large concrete turning circle, just south of Fryars House, used when setting aircraft compasses. After the war the factory diversified into a wide range of engineering tasks. Some aircraft activity continued, such as trialing floats for Auster light aircraft, and a pioneering use of aluminium in the manufacture of motor torpedo boats P1602, Dark-class fast patrol boats, Bras d'Or (R-103) Hydrofoils and Airborne lifeboats.Flight, February 13, 1953. \\"Service Aviation: New Airborne Lifeboat.\\" Retrieved on September 21, 2009. They also produced a wide variety of civilian and military land based craft, such as the coachwork for buses. 620 of these buses were exported to Cuba in the 1950s. At its height over 2,000 people worked at the site. Fryars House became the offices. In the war, workers were housed in nearby Henllys Hall, Plas Rhianfa (now Chateau Rhianfa Hotel and in prefabricated housing. This was gradually replaced by permanent houses such that a new village of Llanfaes has grown up north of the factory site. Saunders Roe Friars Site in 2013 In 1968 the Llanfaes SARO site, along with an engineering works in Llangefni were merged as part of the Cammell Laird shipbuilding firm, to become Laird (Anglesey). By the 1990s this had become owned by Faun Group, who in 1997 opened a new works in Llangefni and the decaying wartime hangars and buildings finally fell into disuse. Aluminium construction still remains the core activity of the firm at Llangefni,Faun Trackway Ltd, company website but the Llanfaes site is no longer in use. Archaeological investigation A proposal to construct sewage treatment works within the area of the scheduled monument required a thorough archaeological investigation, which was carried out by Gwynedd Archaeological Trust in the summer of 1991, to establish the nature and extent of any buried features. The sewage works were subsequently built in the southern corner of the site. The 1991 excavations opened a series of trenches in some of the more accessible parts of what had become an area of dense tree cover. The main existing structure in the area is the large concrete turning circle from the 1940s flying boat activities. The Friary Church itself stood some 20 metres north of the circle, and did not form part of the study area. Two trenches close to the circle proved particularly rich in finds relating to the friary graveyard and boundary wall. The largest of these, Trench E, on the down-slope (east) side of the circle, revealed seven phases of activity. # Graves from an early period of the friary's history. These were cut alongside a boundary wall and drain of broadly the same date. # Graves on a slightly different alignment were dug at a later period. # A second wall, with further graves, were cut through the earlier graves, which by then must have been unmarked and forgotten. # Two grave holes with no contents. This suggests these were disinterred and relocated when the friary was dissolved in 1538. (Earlier burials were left in situ.) # A cobbled surface. This was probably laid during construction of the 1623 'Friars House' # An accumulation of of clay soil, had occurred, whilst a trackway running north-south remained as a depression feature. # The sunken track was filled in, the site levelled up with clay and gravel, and finally tarmacked, all during the 20th century. Other trenches had much less archaeology. The west (up-slope) side of the circle had been cut down to the natural to give a level area for the circle, so that archaeology there had been lost. The trenches south of the circle revealed nothing of interest apart from the trackway/road, and so that area was deemed permissible for the sewage treatment works to be built.

Information Bulletin 99-1, September 1999. p. 8  Background  Hamilton was born on June 10, 1817 in Lansing, New York, son of William and Elizabeth (Bower) Hamilton. He was raised on his family's farm, and received a common school education. At the age of 18, he attended the academy in Aurora, Cayuga County, New York, then spent a winter teaching school. For the next seven years he alternated between teaching school and attending Cazenovia Seminary. At 25 he took up the study of law, first with a firm in Genoa, New York, then later with one in Auburn, continuing all the while to teach school. He was admitted to the bar in New York City in April, 1845; and had a legal practice in Mecklenburg, New York, until 1849. In 1847 he married Mary C. Jaycox, of Mecklenburg, who would become the mother of two children before her death in 1854, though neither child survived long.  In Wisconsin  In October 1849 he came to Wisconsin, and settled in Neenah, where he chose to settle. He was the Winnebago County district attorney for 1852-3. He had been a Democrat, but with free soil sympathies; but in 1856 joined the Republican, of which he would remain a local leader throughout his career. He was chairman of the board of supervisors of his town in 1856, and president of the village of Neenah in 1857 and 1858.Randall, Geo. A.

The development was financed by a $1 million loan guaranteed by Rush's father in law. The lodge opened in 1970, but with an occupancy rate of less than 20%, the lodge closed in 1973. In the meantime, in 1971, Mr Rush's father in law died, resulting in the executor paying out the loan and seeking repayment by Takaro. Due to the financial difficulties, Takaro sought to sell 90% of the shares to the Japanese company Mitsubishi, which planned to develop a golf course and up to 136 holiday homes. However, at the time, under the Reserve Bank Act [1964] for such a foreign investor to be able to buy shares in a New Zealand company, it required the consent of the Minister of Finance. Bill Rowling, the finance minister at the time, refused to consent to the investment on the basis that he wanted the business to revert to a New Zealand owner. Rush then requested Rowling to reconsider this decision on the basis that a refusal would cause severe financial hardship, but resulted in the same decision. As a last result, Rush filed for a judicial review of Rowling's decision, with Wild CJ later ruling that Rowling had no legal right to consider reversion to New Zealand ownership in his decision, directing Rowling to reconsider his decision again. By now however, as a result of the Yom Kippur War, a worldwide economic recession had begun to occur, causing Mitsubishi to reconsider whether to invest in a luxury lodge, and they ultimately pulled out of the deal. Soon after, the lodge was placed into receivership and was sold. Rush later sued Rowling in tort, claiming he was negligent in his decision making process. In the High Court, his claim was dismissed by the judge, but on appeal to the Court of Appeal, it was overturned, being awarded $300,000 in damages. Rowling appealed to the Privy Council. Held The Privy Council overturned the Court of Appeal judgment, ruling the minister had wider powers to make the decision than the Court of Appeal allowed, meaning that Rowling's decision at the time complied with the law. Legal Significance This case makes it highly unlikely that a government minister could owe someone a duty of care. Whilst this case will often be contrasted with the case Meates v Attorney-General[1983] NZLR 308 where a Minister was held to owe a duty of care, this decision was made at the lower level of the Court of Appeal.

Opened in 1961, it was the first shopping mall in Western Michigan. The center features Planet Fitness, Citi Trends, and OfficeMax among its major stores. History Built in 1960, the mall originally included S. S. Kresge and W. T. Grant variety stores, Kroger and A&P; supermarkets, Cunningham Drug, and Montgomery Ward. An adjacent development, Southland Plaza (now Wyoming Village Mall), opened one year later with a Wurzburg's department store. Mall developers were initially unsuccessful in attracting a department store for the eastern anchor, but by 1971, a Turn Style discount store had opened on the east end. This store was the subject of a lawsuit from Kresge. Into the late 1980s, the Stannard's Music store was one of the first stores in the area to introduce the public to the MIDI, giving seminars on the capability of the device. By the 1990s, the mall was having difficulty attracting business. In 1990, the mall's east anchor had become Best Products and in 1990 and 1991, the mall held a \\"Haunted Hotel\\" event, sponsored by Easter Seals, near Halloween. In 1991, a fire in the Best store resulted in three people hospitalized for smoke inhalation. In 1994, Office Max became a tenant replacing Bargain Books, with the bookstore moving into a smaller space. while Gantos, a boutique, closed. In 1998, a United States Postal Service store opened in the center of the mall. Rogers Plaza had a total of 30 retail stores in 1999 with the mall \\"filling up fast\\", with the former space used by Best being filled. However, much of the mall's business was taken by the newly opened Rivertown Crossings Mall in Grandville. Into the 2000s, Ward's closed in December 2000 with 140 employees losing their jobs while the mall was sold in May 2000 to a new owner. In 2001 and 2002, the mall underwent a 14-month renovation project. As part of the renovation, the vacated Montgomery Ward was demolished for a Family Fare supermarket and AJ Wright discount store. AJ Wright closed in February 2011 and became CW Price in August of the same year. The mall was purchased by Sun Valley Ltd. in June 2012. At the time, other major tenants included Big Lots, Harbor Freight Tools, Citi Trends, and OfficeMax. In June 2019, Family Fare was closed down and the space is going to be auctioned off.

Edmund Lord Bishop of London sent Viscount of Oxenford, James MacGill to administer a chapel of ease in Queen Caroline Parish in Anne Arundel County. (later broke off to become Howard County.) On 17 August 1732, King Charles granted to James MacGill to form a new Church of England in the Maryland Colony. The patent was titled \\"Athol\\" after MacGill's home in Scotland. The title named the county \\"Winkepin\\", a reference to the future Wincopin plantation. \\"Williams Lot\\", \\"Scantlings Lot\\", and \\"Brown's Hopyard\\" were combined into a new patent named \\"Athole Enlarged\\" on 29 September 1763. MacGill brought laborers from Scotland and local slaves to construct the granite building where he raised eleven children with his wife Sarah Hilleary. Construction on Athole started in 1732, and finished by 1740. A side addition was built in 1768. A steep roof and door size windows were built to minimize taxes to Britain on certain features. A square cupola was added, and later removed due to deterioration. A conservatory was constructed in the 1980s. In 1776, the American Revolutionary War caused the cutoff from the Church of England.

In 1927, the estate was conveyed by James Clark to local newspaper magnate Paul Griffith Stromberg to the Coar family who added electricity, plumbing and central heating.

A stretcher-bearer, Allen enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force in mid-1940, volunteering for overseas service. He was posted to the 2/5th Battalion, an infantry unit, and deployed to the Middle East where he saw action in the Western Desert and Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaigns, before his unit returned to Australia in 1942. He subsequently served in New Guinea. In July 1943, Allen took part in the Battle of Mount Tambu where he rescued twelve United States soldiers who had been wounded in the fighting. For this action he was awarded the Silver Star. He returned to Australia later in the year and was eventually medically discharged in 1944 after his mental health deteriorated. After the war, he worked as a labourer and as a medical orderly. He died in May 1982 at the age of 65.

The study is funded by the Australian Government Department of Health and is a collaborative endeavour conducted by staff and investigators at The University of Newcastle and The University of Queensland. The current Director is Professor Gita Mishra, the previous Director was Annette Dobson  Method  In 1996, women in three age groups (born 1973-78, 1946‚Äì51 and 1921‚Äì26) were randomly selected from the national Medicare database. These women were sent an invitation by mail to participate in the study. Over 40,000 women responded and agreed to participate. These women represented 2-3% of women in their age groups living in urban, rural and remote areas of Australia at that time. In 2012, Women‚Äôs Health of Australia (WHoA!) was launched. WHoA! was developed to recruit an additional cohort of women aged 18‚Äì23. Over 17,000 women were recruited using social media. The primary method of data collection employed by ALSWH is self-completed surveys. ALSWH also includes a qualitative data set, where participants are asked to write anything they feel is important to their health and wellbeing in a free response space at the end of the survey.  Scope  The ALSWH study assesses: * Physical and mental health (including well-being, major diagnoses and symptoms, determinants and consequences of chronic disease) * Use of health services (general practitioners, specialist and other visits, access and satisfaction, cultural appropriateness) * Health behaviours and risk factors (weight and exercise, diet and eating disorders, body image, smoking, alcohol and other drugs) * Time use (including paid and unpaid work, family roles, leisure, social support, aspirations and financial resources) * Socio- demographic factors (location, education, employment and family composition) * Violence (physical and sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, harassment, psychological and abuse of older women) * Life stages and key events (such as childbirth, menopause, major illness, falls and fractures, divorce, widowhood, dementia and bereavement).  Substudies  As well as completing the main surveys, participants are occasionally invited to participate in substudies that aim to examine selected issues in more depth. A wide range of topics has been covered, including: * Sleeping difficulties and disturbances * Domestic violence * Urinary incontinence * Retirement * Caring * Breast cancer * Experiences of motherhood * Future plans of young women * Alcohol use during pregnancy * Weight change at menopause * Prenatal and postnatal depression * Menopausal symptoms and diet * Contraception * Adverse pregnancy outcomes ‚Äì miscarriage, preterm delivery and stillbirth.  Data linkage  ALSWH has approval to anonymously link survey data with a number of national and state- based administrative datasets. Currently these approvals include the National Death Index, Medicare data, state-based cancer registries, perinatal data collections and hospital admission datasets. The aim of linking to these datasets is to provide new insights into the health and health service use of Australian women, taking into account individual level differences in socioeconomic, behavioural, environmental and other risk factors. In the context of a changing health system, it is important to be able to monitor and evaluate the impact and outcomes of health service policy and practice.  Outcomes  The longitudinal study design ensures that the same women are followed over many years so researchers can observe changes in their health, clarify cause-and-effect relationships, and assess the effects of changes in policy and practice. ALSWH can provide information about the health of women across the lifespan. This information has assisted federal and state governments to plan for the future and to develop and evaluate health policy and practice relevant to Australian women. The study was used extensively in the 2010 National Women‚Äôs Health Policy. ALSWH has collaborated with numerous investigators, universities and organisations around the world. The findings from ALSWH have been reported in over 100 reports to the government, and been included in more than 400 academic publications.

Originally from San Diego, California, McCain converted to Islam in 2004, and traveled to Syria by way of Turkey in early 2014. He was believed to be the first U.S. citizen to be killed while fighting for ISIL. At the time of McCain's death, there were reportedly dozens more Americans fighting in Syria for Islamic militant groups. Later it was established that the first U.S. citizen killed in the Syrian Civil War was Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha in May 2014. McCain attended the same high school as Troy Kastigar, who also died as an Islamic Jihadist, in 2009 in Somalia. The two may have been roommates. Biography McCain was born in Chicago, Illinois. He moved from Chicago to Minnesota before moving again to California after high school. He attended Robbinsdale Cooper High School from 1997 to 1999 before transferring to nearby Robbinsdale Armstrong High School but never graduated. Robbinsdale Cooper was also the school Troy Kastigar attended, and McCain may have lived in Kastigar's house for a while, in 2000 and 2001. He loved basketball, was a fan of the Chicago Bulls, and was, at the time, an aspiring rapper. McCain had a criminal record with minor charges including traffic violations, disorderly conduct, and providing false names to police officers. He converted to Islam in 2004. He traveled to Europe, and by 2013 returned to San Diego where, according to one report, he worked at a mosque, while another report states he worked at a Somali restaurant and frequented a mosque. According to a former classmate he was eager to talk about Islam and his conversion, but remained respectful of others' beliefs and was not radical. He was active on social media, with the handle \\"Duale Khalid\\" on Twitter and \\"Duale ThaslaveofAllah\\" on Facebook.

In 2002, two members were detained by Egyptian authorities under the charges of \\"contempt of religion\\". However, some books by the founder, L. Ron Hubbard, have started to appear in several Egyptian bookstores in the late 2000s, and were even approved by Al-Azhar, the highest Sunni learning institution in the Muslim world. Egypt is listed on an official Scientology website as being a country \\"in which Dianetics and Scientology services are ministered\\". Narconon, an organization which promotes Hubbard's drug abuse treatment, has a branch in Fayoum.  Detention of two members  On December 24, 2001, Egyptian authorities arrested two members of the Church of Scientology: Mahmoud Massarwa, a 28-year-old Israeli citizen of Palestinian origin, and his Palestinian wife Wafaa Ahmad. They were charged with \\"contempt of religion\\" and were accused of trying to establish a branch in Egypt and harm the country's two main religions \\"with the aim of sparking riots\\". Two months later, a court extended their custody for 30 days to allow further police questioning, adding that they have confessed to have come to Egypt in order to spread their doctrine. Human rights director of the Church of Scientology, Leisa Goodman, denied these claims on behalf of the church and said that the couple was in the country representing the Italian branch of New Era Publications, a firm that publishes the works of L. Ron Hubbard, to promote Hubbard's book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, stressing that the authorities had allowed the book's entry to Egypt. \\"We are greatly concerned at their prolonged detention, which appears to be a violation of their right to freedom of expression,\\" Goodman said. The two were finally released the next month and the court ruled that condemning people for adopting new ideas is a violation of human rights. Scientology books in Egypt Arabic-language translations of books by L. Ron Hubbard, such as Dianetics and The Way to Happiness,(‚Üí Al-Azhar Validation Letter) have been sold in several book stores in Egypt and were made available at the annual Cairo International Book Fair. The books bore the approval stamp of Al-Azhar, the Muslim world's highest Sunni learning institution. They were printed in Denmark, both in English and Arabic, and shipped to Egypt by New Era Publications. Ahmed Abdel Khalek, a professor at Al-Azhar University who has served as chief-of-staff and translator to the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, said that he had no objections to the approval of the books unless they violated \\"morality and traditions\\". \\"We should be open-minded and listen to the other. After all, if I disagree with something in a book, I should write a rebuttal,\\" he said. New Era Publications' public relations office said that Al-Azhar's move was essential and insisted that there was nothing religious about the books' nature. Narconon Narconon Egypt, a drug abuse treatment center based in Fayoum, is the Egyptian branch of the global Narconon organization. The branch's executive director, Mohamed Nour Salah, said that there is no connection between Narconon Egypt and the Church of Scientology, stressing that it is a non-profit organization and that none of the staff are Scientologists. Nevertheless, Narconon Egypt's website mentions Hubbard's work as an inspiration for its founding.

He picked up a bronze medal in the welterweight at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, and also competed in two editions of the Olympic Games (1992 and 2004) under different banners. Nourian's career had been overshadowed by a doping controversy in 2000, resulting to a ban from the Iranian boxing team at the Summer Olympics in Sydney and his emigration to Australia, where he later obtained a dual citizenship. Nourian made his official debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where he ousted his opening match to Italy's Michele Piccirillo in men's light welterweight division (63.5 kg), receiving a default score 5‚Äì23. Two years later, Nourian came powerful with a bronze medal on his semifinal match 17‚Äì26 against Thailand's Arkhom Chenglai in the welterweight category (70 kg) at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Nourian sought his sights to compete for the Iranian team in the light welterweight division (63.5 kg). On 17 September 2000, the International Amateur Boxing Association banned him from the Games after he was tested positive for the steroid nandrolone, permitting his opponent Ajose Olusegun of Nigeria to walk over with an effortless victory in the first round. As a result, Nourian left the Iranian boxing squad shortly to move to Sydney, Australia, and later became a naturalized citizen in February 2004. Pursuing his sporting career outside of Iran, Nourian trained under the boxing squad for the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. Twelve years after his Olympic debut, Nourian qualified for his newly joined Australian squad, as a 32-year-old veteran, in the men's light welterweight division (63.5 kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, he guaranteed a spot on the nation's boxing team after finishing first from the AIBA Oceania Qualification Tournament in Tonga. Unlike his two previous Games, Nourian scored a convincing victory 22‚Äì51 over Seychelles' Kitson Julie in the opening round, before losing out his next match to Italy's Michele di Rocco with a decisive 25‚Äì33 count.

Blakey led or co-led the group from the outset. \\"Art Blakey\\" and \\"Jazz Messengers\\" became synonymous over the years, though Blakey did lead non-Messenger recording sessions and played as a sideman for other groups throughout his career. The group evolved into a proving ground for young jazz talent. While veterans occasionally re-appeared in the group, by and large, each iteration of the Messengers included a lineup of new young players. Having the Messengers on one's resume was a rite of passage in the jazz world, and conveyed immediate bona fides. Many former members of the Jazz Messengers established careers as solo musicians, such as Lee Morgan, Benny Golson, Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Timmons, Curtis Fuller, Cedar Walton, Keith Jarrett, Joanne Brackeen, Woody Shaw, Chuck Mangione, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Terence Blanchard, Donald Harrison and Mulgrew Miller. Some members, such as bassist Clarence Seay and Gregory Charles Royal, are documented to have played in the Jazz Messengers but did not record with the group. History =Origins= On December 17, 1947, Blakey led a group known as \\"Art Blakey's Messengers\\" in his first recording session as a leader, for Blue Note Records. The records were released as 78s at the time and two of the songs were released on the New Sounds 10\\" LP compilation (BLP 5010). This octet included Kenny Dorham, Howard Bowe, Sahib Shihab, Musa Kaleem, Ernest Thompson, Walter Bishop Jr., and LaVerne Barker. Around the same time‚Äîin 1947 or 1949‚ÄîBlakey led a big band called \\"Seventeen Messengers.\\" The band proved to be financially unstable and broke up soon after. The Messengers name then went dormant for several years. Blakey and Horace Silver began working together in the early 1950s. Some cite the group that included Blakey, Silver, Kenny Dorham, Lou Donaldson and Gene Ramey in 1953 as the original Jazz Messengers. On February 21, 1954, a group billed as the \\"Art Blakey Quintet\\" produced the live set of records called A Night at Birdland. The quintet included Horace Silver, Clifford Brown, Lou Donaldson and Curly Russell. These records were quite successful, and some cite this date as the beginning of the Jazz Messengers. =The Jazz Messengers (1954‚Äì56)= Most date the origin of the Jazz Messengers to 1954, or 1955, when the first recordings credited to the band appeared. The Jazz Messengers formed as a collective, nominally led by Silver or Blakey on various dates. Blakey credits Silver with reviving the Messengers name for the group. The other members included Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley and Doug Watkins. Their first recordings officially using the Jazz Messengers name were a pair of live dates, recorded at the Caf√© Bohemia in 1955. A pair of earlier recordings from sessions in late 1954 and early 1955‚Äîreleased on Blue Note 10\\" LPs as the Horace Silver Quintet, vol. 1 and vol. 2‚Äîwere subsequently reissued as a 12\\" LP entitled Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers. In 1956 Dorham left the band to go out on his own and was replaced by Donald Byrd. This group released The Jazz Messengers on Columbia Records. Later in the year, the original group all went their own ways, but Blakey retained the Jazz Messengers name for his future groups. =The \\"Second\\" Messengers (1956‚Äì58)= For a brief period in 1956 Donald Byrd stayed on as a new lineup was formed. It included Kenny Drew, Wilbur Ware, Ira Sullivan playing tenor sax in place of his more familiar trumpet. The only contemporary documentation of this version of the Messengers was two tracks backing up singer Rita Reys on The Cool Voice of Rita Reys on Columbia. Blakey then formed a new lineup that would prove to be much more stable. The most notable name, at the time, was Jackie McLean. He was only 25, but had already recorded with Miles Davis and Charles Mingus. Bill Hardman, Sam Dockery and Jimmy \\"Spanky\\" DeBrest filled out the group. They recorded another record for Columbia: Hard Bop‚Äîstill under the collective's moniker The Jazz Messengers. They went on to record for several different labels including RCA subsidiary Vik Records, Pacific Jazz, Elektra, Cadet, Jubilee, Bethlehem and a date on Atlantic featuring Thelonious Monk. Over this time the band's name evolved to include Blakey's name, starting with \\"The Jazz Messengers, featuring Art Blakey\\" on Ritual, then \\"Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers\\" on several records, and also \\"Art Blakey and his Jazz Messengers\\" on Cu-Bop. =Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers (1959‚Äì64)= In 1958 Blakey formed a new lineup with four Philadelphia natives: Lee Morgan, Benny Golson, Bobby Timmons, and Jymie Merritt. This marked the beginning of probably the most fruitful period of the Jazz Messengers. They returned to Blue Note and the first record‚Äîentitled simply Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers‚Äîproduced their biggest hit: \\"Moanin'\\". It featured two more songs which would become Messengers classics, and jazz classics as well: \\"Blues March\\" and \\"Along Came Betty\\" by Benny Golson. Golson left the band in 1959 after a European tour (which produced live albums and a film soundtrack on Fontana Records and French RCA) to be replaced, briefly, by Hank Mobley. Mobley did not accompany the band to a Canadian jazz festival in 1959; Lee Morgan encountered Wayne Shorter at the festival, and he joined the band in Mobley's place. This lineup produced several notable recordings, including the second Messenger album, A Night in Tunisia. In 1961 the group expanded to a sextet with the addition of Curtis Fuller. This lineup produced the Art Blakey!!!!! Jazz Messengers!!!!! album for Impulse! Records. At the end of that summer, Lee Morgan and Bobby Timmons left and were replaced by Freddie Hubbard and Cedar Walton respectively. This lineup recorded Three Blind Mice for United Artists and two albums for Blue Note: Mosaic and Buhaina's Delight. In mid-1962 Reggie Workman replaced long-time double bassist Jymie Merritt, who wanted to settle down in Philadelphia. This version of the group produced three albums for Riverside: Caravan, Ugetsu, and Kyoto; in addition to another Blue Note under the name Free for All. This lineup stayed together until March 1964, when Lee Morgan rejoined in place of Freddie Hubbard. Around this time‚Äîthe recording date is unknown‚Äîthe band produced an album from the musical Golden Boy for the Colpix label with an expanded lineup. This lineup included both Freddie Hubbard and Lee Morgan on trumpet, plus Charles Davis, Julius Watkins, and Bill Barber. In April 1964, the Jazz Messengers produced their final, new, recording for the Blue Note label: Indestructible. =The \\"New\\" Messengers (1964‚Äì66)= In September 1964, Wayne Shorter left the Messengers to form Miles Davis' Second Great Quintet. Lee Morgan enlisted long-time Sun Ra tenor saxophonist John Gilmore to fill in‚Äîthough it was understood he would return to Sun Ra after a time. Gilmore brought along fellow Arkestra member Victor Sproles and John Hicks joined on piano. The edition of the Messengers would see more quick turnover of members than the previous. The band signed with Quincy Jones' new Mercury sub-label Limelight Records. This group‚Äîstill including Curtis Fuller on trombone‚Äîrecorded the first album for the label: 'S Make It. The band soon reverted to a quintet as Fuller departed. Alto saxophonist Gary Bartz replaced the departing John Gilmore and this quintet‚Äîwith Freddie Hubbard sitting in alongside Morgan‚Äîrecorded Soul Finger for Limelight. By January 1966 the band had completely turned over again. Now Chuck Mangione occupied the trumpet chair with Frank Mitchell on tenor sax, Keith Jarrett on piano and Reggie Johnson on bass. This lineup produced the live album Buttercorn Lady under the moniker Art Blakey and the \\"New\\" Jazz Messengers. While the band continued to perform live, this would be the final Jazz Messengers recording of the decade. =The dark years (1966‚Äì76)= The late 1960s saw the ascendance of rock music in popular culture, and the jazz world was experimenting with free jazz and jazz fusion, styles Blakey did not care for. It was difficult for Blakey to maintain a steady lineup for the Messengers, during this period, and even more difficult to produce recordings. Between 1966 and 1972, the Messengers produced only a single official record: Jazz Messengers '70, a live date in Tokyo. This particular lineup included Bill Hardman, Carlos Garnett, Joanne Brackeen and Jan Arnet. Blakey kept the Messengers working during this period‚Äîparticularly abroad in Europe and Japan where they maintained their popularity. But the lineups were fluid, with several musicians rotating through based on who was available for the particular engagement. In various combinations, between 1966 and 1972 the band included trumpet players Woody Shaw and Randy Brecker in addition to Hardman; saxophonists Garnett, Mitchell, Billy Harper and Ramon Morris; and trombonists Slide Hampton and Julian Priester. The piano chair saw the greatest turnover. After Jarrett, pianists included Mike Nock, Lonnie Liston Smith, Chick Corea, McCoy Tyner, Ronnie Mathews, George Cables, Joanne Brackeen, Albert Dailey, plus occasionally veterans John Hicks, Cedar Walton, and Walter Davis Jr.. Bassists included Juni Booth, Buster Williams, Larry Evans, Scotty Holt, Arnet, and Mickey Bass. In 1972 the Messengers were signed to Prestige Records and produced three albums. Child's Dance featured pieces from two recording sessions on 1972, with different, expanded, and somewhat overlapping lineups. The regular Messengers on the album were Woody Shaw; Ramon Morris; John Hicks, Walter Davis Jr. and George Cables on both acoustic and electric pianos; and Mickey Bass. The band was augmented by Buddy Terry (soprano sax), Manny Boyd (flute), Michael Howard (guitar), Stanley Clarke (electric bass), and percussionists Nathaniel Bettis, Sonny Morgan, Pablo Landrum, Emmanuel Rahim and Ray Mantilla for different tunes across the two sessions. In 1973, a regular lineup of Woody Shaw, newcomer Carter Jefferson, Cedar Walton, and Mickey Bass recorded two more Prestige albums: Anthenagin and Buhaina. Conga player Tony Waters appears on Anthenagin and trombonist Steve Turre appears on Buhaina. Blakey struggled to keep the band going the next three years. Only one recording‚Äîa 1975 collaboration with Sonny Stitt called In Walked Sonny on the Swedish Sonet label‚Äîwas produced between 1973 and 1976. That album included long time trumpet stalwart Bill Hardman again occupying the trumpet chair. David Schnitter was now on tenor sax and would stay with the Messengers for some time to come. Walter Davis Jr. was back on piano, and the new bassist was Isao Suzuki. The Messengers were still popular in Japan, and travelled there annually. Hardman and Schnitter were constants throughout this period. Pianists also included Albert Dailey and Mickey Tucker and bassists after Suzuki included Cameron Brown and Chris Amberger. =Messengers rejuvenation (1976‚Äì90)= In 1985. In 1976 the Messengers recorded a record for Roulette ‚Äì Backgammon‚Äîfeaturing Hardman, Schnitter, Dailey and Suzuki. In that year Blakey began a professional relationship with Wim Wigt, a Dutch music booker and owner of the Timeless label. Wigt booked the Messengers throughout Europe. A second record for Roulette followed, featuring Schnitter, Walter Davis Jr. and newcomers Valery Ponomarev, Bobby Watson, and Dennis Irwin. From this point the lineups began to stabilize as the band worked more regularly. In October 1977 Blakey hired a new, regular, pianist: James Williams. This group (Ponomarev, Watson, Schnitter, Willams and Irwin) recorded In My Prime Vol. 1 on November 1977 for Wigt's Timeless label. In 1978 they recorded In This Korner for Concord Jazz and In My Prime Vol. 2 and Reflections in Blue for Timeless. In February 1979, they recorded the third Messengers album entitled Night in Tunisia for Philips. In November 1979 they recorded One by One, a live album in Italy, for the Italian Palcoscenico label. In 1979 Blakey decided to assemble an 11-piece \\"big band\\" to take on a European tour in 1980. This band was unique in that it included two sets of brothers: Wynton and Branford Marsalis and Robin and Kevin Eubanks, and that the group had the first guitarist that Blakey ever hired, Bobby Broom. The young musicians were cultivated by playing in the smaller Jazz Messengers combo around New York City through 1979. Broom left the group before the 1980 tour. These would be Ponomarev's last appearances with the Messengers. While Watson and Williams continued with the Messengers, David Schnitter was replaced by Bill Pierce and Dennis Irwin was replaced by Charles Fambrough. This band also featured a second drummer: John Ramsay. Live at Montreux and Northsea by the Jazz Messengers Big Band was recorded at the Northsea and Montreux Jazz Festivals by Timeless. The regular working sextet that emerged from this European tour now included Wynton Marsalis, Bobby Watson, Bill Pierce, James Williams and Charles Fambrough. This group produced Art Blakey in Sweden on the Amigo label, Album of the Year on Timeless and Straight Ahead on the Concord Jazz imprint‚Äîall in early 1981. When Branford Marsalis graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 1981, he joined his brother in place of Bobby Watson. Donald Brown replaced James Williams at this time as well. In January 1982 this lineup produced Keystone 3, the third live album recorded by the band at Keystone Korner in San Francisco. Wynton Marsalis' star was rising quickly. He and his brother left to form their own band in early 1982. Due to Donald Brown's struggles with arthritis, he left the band at this time as well. The new lineup was Terence Blanchard and Donald Harrison on the front line, and Johnny O'Neal on piano, joining Pierce and Fambrough. This lineup recorded Oh- By the Way for Timeless in 1982. The band turned over gradually over the next year. Pierce left to begin teaching at Berklee in September 1982. He was replaced by Jean Toussaint. Fambrough left in mid-1983 to be replaced by Lonnie Plaxico. And Mulgrew Miller took over for Johnny O'Neal in 1984. This new lineup ‚Äì Blanchard, Harrison, Toussaint, Miller, and Plaxico‚Äîstayed together throughout 1985, into 1986. They recorded New York Scene in 1984 and Live at Kimball's in 1985, both for Concord Jazz. A live date from Ronnie Scott's in London also appeared. Blanchard and Harrison formed their own band in mid-1986. They were replaced by Wallace Roney and Kenny Garrett, respectively. Tim Williams was also added on trombone. This group recorded the Feeling Goodalbum for Delos. By the end of 1987 the band had turned over once again. Philip Harper was the new trumpet player, Javon Jackson joined on tenor, and Robin Eubanks returned on trombone. The new pianist was Benny Green and Peter Washington was the bassist. This lineup recorded Not Yet and I Get a Kick Out of Bu (with Leon Dorsey replacing Washington on bass), both for Soul Note in 1988. In 1989, what became the final Jazz Messengers lineup was established: Brian Lynch on trumpet, Javon Jackson and Dale Barlow on tenors, Steve Davis and/or Frank Lacy on trombone, Geoff Keezer on piano and Essiet Okon Essiet on bass. A concert at the Leverkusen Jazz Festival in Germany commemorated in October 1989 commemorated Blakey's 70th birthday. Playing were the current messengers, plus many special guests: Freddie Hubbard, Terence Blanchard, Donald Harrison, Jackie McLean, Wayne Shorter, Benny Golson, Curtis Fuller, Walter Davis Jr., Buster Williams, Roy Haynes, and Michele Hendricks singing a song composed for the occasion by Horace Silver. This final group recorded the final Messengers album, One for All, on A&M; Records.

The film stars Robbie Amell and Alexa Vega. It premiered on the Hallmark Channel on October 25, 2013. Synopsis Carter and Jordyn Flynn are not the average mother and father. For them, a typical workday can take place anywhere in the world, raiding ornate museums and evading pursuing authorities as Hunters, protectors of powerful fairytale artifacts that are anything but make-believe. While the Flynns take their jobs seriously, they're just as concerned about the welfare of their two sons, 21-year-old Paxton and 16-year-old Tripp, who are unaware of their parents' true line of work. When Carter and Jordyn disappear after being intercepted by the mysterious Mai during one of their missions, the boys learn the truth about their parents and their lineage from the Flynns‚Äô young assistant Dylan. They turn to old family friend Mason for help, but they soon discover that the deceitful Mason is after what the Flynns were trying to protect‚Äîan enchanted mirror that has the ability to grant any wish. It has quite a history too: It is the same mirror that played a pivotal role in the destiny of Snow White. It becomes evident that it is up to the valiant brothers and Dylan to save the day before very real fairy tale magic falls into Mason‚Äôs less-than-worthy hands.

It is the administrative center of Starobesheve Raion. Starobesheve is located on the right bank of the Kalmius River, about northwest of the border with Russia. Population: . History Starobeshevo was founded in 1779 as a selo of Beshevo by Greek settlers who moved from the settlement of Beshevo in Crimea, hence the name. During much of the 19th century, it belonged to Alexandrovsky Uyezd of Yekaterinoslav Governorate. In 1874, it was transferred to Mariupolsky Uyezd of the same governorate. After 1866, it was the administrative center of Beshevskaya Volost. In 1896, Beshevo was renamed Starobeshevo (Starobesheve, literally, Old Beshevo). In the beginning of the 20th century, the population of Beshevo was about 4000. Following the October Revolution, Soviet power was established in Starobesheve in January 1918. Between April and November the selo was occupied by German troops, and subsequently between December 1918 and May 1919 by the White Army. In May 1919, the Red Army occupied the locality. In the meantime, in January 1919 Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was established and Mariupolsky Uyezd was formally included in the republic, along with Starobesheve. In April 1920, the uyezd was transferred to the newly established Donetsk Governorate. On March 7, 1923 Styla Raion was established with its administrative center in the selo of Styla. Starobesheve was included in the raion. In November 1924, Starobesheve became the administrative center of the raion, and the raion was renamed Starobesheve. On October 1, 1925 Donetsk Governorate was abolished, and Starobesheve was included in the newly established Mariupol Okruha, one of the okruhas into which Ukraine was divided. On July 2, 1932 Starobesheve was included in Donetsk Oblast. In 1936, the okruhas were abolished, and the raions were subordinated directly to the oblast. During World War II, Starobesheve was occupied by German troops between October 1941 and September 1943. In 2014, during the War in Donbass, Starobesheve changed hands several times. Finally, it became controlled by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic.http://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/27549232.html. Economy =Transportation= Starobesheve is connected by road with Donetsk, with Novoazovsk and Mariupol via Telmanove, with Dokuchaievsk via Styla, with Amvrosiivka via Kuteinikove, with Novyi Svit, and with Mospyne.

Todd Moye and published by the University of North Carolina Press. It discusses the events in Sunflower County, Mississippi during the Civil Rights Movement of 1954 through 1968, including a post-Brown v. Board of Education movement and a 1960s action led by Fannie Lou Hamer.Piliawsky, p. circa 93. The book also chronicles the subsequent aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement until the year 1986.Eskew, circa p. 1573. This includes a 1980s education reform movement.Newman, p. circa 1059. The final issue discussed is a Delta Pride strike.Woodruff, p. 222. Let the People Decide is the first published overview book of the Sunflower County civil rights movements, defined by the author as three separate and interconnected movements. It documents changing African- American attitudes towards race and the background of the White community's resistance movement.Vandal, p. 533. Moye concluded that \\"the class differences that developed in African American communities over time [which] profoundly affected the goals and strategies of the movements they created\\" as stated on p. 23. Moye stated that there were many civil rights movements occurring throughout the United States and that the influences of economics and social class also caused differences.Rosenberg, p. circa 554. \\"In analyzing the struggle for racial justice, Moye writes that there was never one civil rights movement, either in a particular locality or in the United States as a whole. Moye notes the importance of class differences in the way the movement unfolded on the local level and observes that such distinctions influenced the ‚Äògoals and strategies‚Äô of those working to effect change. And over time, changes in the economic system in a particular place also informed the movement's trajectory. Thus, one cannot ‚Äògeneralize‚Äô about ‚Äòthe civil rights movement‚Äô in a community, a region, or the nation.\\" On p. 204 Moye stated that at as of 2004, in Sunflower County \\"a successful civil rights movement created a better business climate\\"; Mark Newman of the University of Edinburgh stated that Moye did not provide the relevant figures proving this point.Newman, circa 1060. Background Moye served as the director of the Tuskegee Airmen Oral History Project of the National Park Service (NPS).Rosenberg, p. circa 553. The book's title, \\"Let the People Decide,\\" is a slogan that was used by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to organize people. For research, Moye consulted articles, scholarly books, and newspaper articles. The total number of secondary sources used is in the hundreds.Piliawsky, p. circa 94. Moye also used written primary sources, government documents,Vandal, p. 534. and several oral interviews to develop his book. The written primary sources originated from over thirty archival collections. There were a total of 25 oral interviews from both Blacks and Whites. On p. 231 Moye argued that using interviews was important \\"to tell stories that would otherwise go undocumented\\" and \\"to flesh out the framework of events that are described in contemporary written documents\\". Moye stated on the same page that he did not solely rely on oral interviews because \\"I do not consider oral history research a substitute for archival research\\". Reception Tiyi Morris of Ohio State University at Newark wrote that the book is \\"an invaluable contribution to recent scholarship hthat enhances our understanding of \\"local movement centers\\" in the civil rights era.\\"Morris, p. 447. Monte Piliawsky of Wayne State University stated that the book and a suggested companion book, Life and Death in the Delta by Kim Lacy Rogers, both have \\"compelling collective memoirs of the trauma, suffering, resistance, and achievement of the civil rights movement in the darkest of venues, the Mississippi Delta.\\"Piliawsky, circa p. 95. Jonathan Rosenberg of Hunter College concluded that the book was a \\"compelling analysis of how and why\\" the racial situation in Sunflower County changed.Rosenberg, p. circa 555. Gilles Vandal of the Universit√© de Sherbrooke stated that it was \\"gracefully written\\" and that it \\"adds significantly to the growing body of literature on the civil rights movement\\". Nan Elizabeth Woodruff of Pennsylvania State University concluded that the book \\"adds to a growing literature that illuminates the daily details of life and struggle of black people in communities throughout the South.\\" See also * Educational segregation in Mississippi Delta References * Eskew, Glenn T.

History  In 1969, Boyesen set up the Gerda Boyesen Training School at Acacia House in Acton Park. It is both a psychological and energetic therapy which is concerned with the integration of all aspects of an individual. This includes the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects of existence. A key concept in biodynamic massage is the belief in a universal life force that connects all of us. Biodynamic massage is used on its own, as part of body psychotherapy or to support psychotherapy of a different modality. The touch does not attempt to cure, but rather bring the client into relationship with her body.  Biodynamic massage techniques  There are a wide variety of techniques that focuses on skin, bone, muscular, fascia, energy and aura.  Theory  According to Biodynamic massage, the digestive tract has a dual function. It is to digest physical nourishment, but also the emotional digestion of stressful situations. Once away from the stressful situation, the experience can be digested in our guts when rest is possible. Biodynamic therapists use a stethoscope during the massage to listen to the peristalsis and use it as feedback to guide the massage.

It has its roots in classical sociological theory, notably Durkheim and Weber, and from contemporary sociological theory, notably Goffman and Bourdieu. Notable authors include but are not limited to, Eviatar Zerubavel, Aaron Cicourel, Barry Schwartz, Karen A. Cerulo, Paul DiMaggio, and Michael W. Raphael. The term 'cognitive sociology' was used already in 1974 by Cicourel. However, in 1997 DiMaggio published what has been referred to as a now classic paper of how cognitive sociology overlaps with the sociology of culture & cognition. Michael W. Raphael provides an overview of cognitive sociology in its current form. Special journal issues on the topic of Cognitive Sociology has been published by the scientific journals Poetics and the European Journal of Social Theory in 2010 and 2007 respectively. Graduate-level courses in cognitive sociology has been organized at the University of Copenhagen by Jacob Strandell in 2014 and 2016 In order to organize this interdisciplinary investigation, scholars have articulated five models of the actor that stress different locations of human cognition in relation to the social contract. These models are: # Universal cognitivism stresses \\"naturalistic explanations of human behavior\\". This is reflected in the work of Stephen Park Turner, Omar Lizardo and Gabriel Ignatow. # Fuzzy universal cognitivism \\"emphasizes naturalism in the explanations, but its ontological positions are not as balanced as plural cognitivism\\". This is reflected in the work of J√ºrgen Habermas and Paul DiMaggio. # Plural cognitivism seeks to formulate a \\"balanced model of the actor subjected to socio-mental control. Socio-mental control describes how impersonal cognitive norms shape the thinking, learning, and courses of activity individual actors are able to undertake as a result of institutional reflexivity.\\" Institutional reflexivity is a process described by Goffman in \\"The Arrangement between the Sexes\\". This is reflected in the work of Eviatar Zerubavel and his students. # Fuzzy individual cognitivism \\"emphasizes humanism in the explanations, but its ontological positions are not as balanced as plural cognitivism\\". This is reflected in the work of Luc Boltanski and Laurent Th√©venot as well as Alban Bouvier. # Individual cognitivism investigates the \\"inner determinants of action with respect to the practical, cognitive, and moral properties of social facts.\\" This is reflected in the work of Raymond Boudon and Patrick Pharo.

Lafleur is a trademark of Olymel (l.p.), owned by . The cooked meats brand, specializing in the processing of pork products, was founded in 1912 by Alphonse Lafleur (1882-1934). Lafleur products are exclusively sold in Quebec.  Description  Lafleur is a specialized brand in the Quebec meat processing industry. Over seventy products are sold under this trademark, including their smoked sausages, which are among the best selling in Quebec. Their products are divided into 8 categories: fresh bacon, fully cooked bacon, smoked sausages, fresh sausages, ham, deli, sliced deli and spreads, like cretons or head cheese. Since 2005, Lafleur has been owned by Olymel, l.p., headquartered in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. They employ nearly 10,000 people in Canada. Lafleur produces 15 million kilograms of products each year. Most of their products are made in the Qu√©bec region.. The Lafleur brand is visible at many public venues in Qu√©bec and at major events in the area of entertainment and sports. Lafleur is the official provider for the Bell Centre and for the amusement park La Ronde. The company also sponsors many local sporting organizations and is associated with various fundraising initiatives for charitable organizations.  History  Alphonse Lafleur started a deli meat shop bearing his name in the parish of St. Roch in Limoilou, Quebec, in 1912. A discreet sign announced the shop: ALP. LAFLEUR ‚Äî BOUCHER ‚Äî SAUCISSE & VIANDE DE CHOIX. The business was known for sausages and deli prepared with a careful selection and blending of spices. In 1913, Lafleur began acquiring the lots adjacent to his shop. He purchased more lots in 1920, enabling him to increase the size of the business. The family business continued to flourish after they started doing deliveries by truck in 1930. In 1934, at the age of 52, the founder Alphonse Lafleur died and his wife Oliva became the president of the company. Oliva and her four sons (Jean- Marie, G√©rard, Raymond et Georges-Henri) inherited the business. The commerce was transformed into a corporation and the company's capital stock was established at 20,000 dollars, or 200 shares at 100 dollars each. The company focused on pork products until 1942. That year, the family decided to diversify and began slaughtering cattle and calves. Oliva Lafleur was president of the company until 1943. She then passed the business on to her children, along with the company shares. Her son Raymond became the new president and G√©rard, the Treasurer. On June 6, 1944 a meeting of the company directors was held at which time the Lafleur boys assigned new duties to family members. Between 1943 and 1945, the company acquired new lots and buildings and went through a major transformation of the brand and the modernization of their equipment. By 1955, Lafleur employed over 80 people. They began offering their products wholesale and used a fleet of modern trucks for delivery. In 1956, the firm's capital stock was increased from 20,000 to 120,000 dollars. Using major daily papers in Quebec such as Le Soleil, they advertised Lafleur products including blood sausage, cracklings, head cheese, ham, etc. The brand's products were sold through grocery stores and butcher shops in the region. As Lafleur prepared to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 1961, the company president, Raymond Lafleur, died. His brother G√©rard took over the leadership of the family business. In 1962, Lafleur was classified as a factory and had an order preparation centre, deli, salting and cooking departments as well as smokehouses and sections for packaging. The death of Gerard Lafleur, in 1967 led to a reorganization of the senior management. In 1969 important decisions for the future were taken, including a withdrawal from retail trade in order to focus on wholesale meat products and meat processing, and the cessation of calf and cattle slaughtering. The company signed its first collective agreement in November 1970. In February 1972, Alphonse Lafleur Limited accepted a purchase offer from J.N. Brochu Inc., a family owned agrifood company from L√©vis, Quebec. Lafleur operations were consolidated with Salaisons Brochu, a division of Groupe Brochu, in the late 1970s. An additional 150 people were hired in 1978, and the plant began operating at full capacity producing emulsions, hams, bacon and smoked sausage. The facility in Saint-Henri-de-L√©vis was expanded many times and was producing 100 million pounds of pork each year. The company was the first Qu√©bec slaughterhouse to export its products to Japan. The Brochu family began to take over the Montreal market in the early 1980s. They helped expand the Lafleur brand. In 1985, a centre was built in Laval to handle product distribution. In 1991, the company hired hockey player Guy Lafleur to become the advertising spokesman for \\"La Bonne Fourchette,\\" a sausage brand in the Lafleur product line. Revenues from the Lafleur division were then estimated at $88 million. Lafleur was the first in Canada to produce pre-cooked bacon in 1997. The Brochu family innovated with products, such as pre-packaged sliced meats, marinated pork, honey and maple flavoured shaved Black Forest ham. They also introduced bold initiatives on product traceability. In 1998, the Joliette slaughterhouse was the first company to be certified compliant with the Food Safety Enhancement Program (FSEP) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) standards. In subsequent years, all their plants received this certification, long before the program became mandatory in November 2005. In 2005, Supraliment, the meat division of Groupe Brochu, merged with Olymel l.p., a fiduciary of La Coop f√©d√©r√©e. This cooperative movement is accountable for more than 90,000 farmer members. The company employs nearly 10,000 people in Canada, including over 7,500 in Quebec. Its sales are in excess of 2.5 billion dollars annually, and it exports nearly 50% of its products. Lafleur became one of Olymel's leading brands, along with Olymel and Flamingo. The company is represented in two major sectors in their industry: pork and poultry. Olymel has been developing the Lafleur brand since 2005. In 2009, Lafleur launched a new brand of products under the name of \\"Authentique.\\" Traditional recipes, using simple and authentic ingredients, adapted to 21st century consumers, inspired this sub-brand. Lafleur celebrated their 100th Anniversary in 2012. It was then inducted into the corporate 'Hall of Fame' by the Quebec Food Retailers Association (A.D.A.), section member/provider (SMF). The brand was inducted for being in business for 100 years. This is a rare occurrence for a brand in Quebec history.  Visual Branding (logo)  Throughout the 50s, the Lafleur logo was bearing the words \\"A. Lafleur Lt√©e.\\" In 1978, the logo displayed a flower inside the corner of the letter \\"L\\". The company decided to rejuvenate the logo that adorned the brand's products in 1984. The new signature, with the \\"u\\" in Lafleur surmounted by five red petals, was inspired by the words of Alphonse, the founder, who always said he was making \\"the flower of sausages\\". The company used a modified version of their logo to promote the centennial of the brand in 2012. It had the same appearance as the official logo, replacing the word \\"Lafleur\\" with \\"100 years\\", or \\"100 ans\\" in French. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  1972  1978  1984  1985  Modified version for the centennial of the brand in 2012. }  Products  More than seventy Lafleur products are offered, under 8 categories: Bacon * Fully cooked bacon * Fresh bacon Deli products * Full-serve deli counter * Self-serve deli counter Sliced deli products * Shaved meats * Sliced cold cuts Smoked sausages * Smoked sausages * Cocktail wieners Breakfast sausages * Fresh sausages * Frozen sausages Ham * Full-serve deli counter * Self-serve deli counter Spreads * Cretons * Others  Certifications  Lafleur products are prepared under the supervision of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The facilities are compliant with the Food Safety Enhancement Program (FSEP) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) standards. This systematic and preventive guideline to enhance food safety is recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the United Nations international standards organization for food safety. In August 2010, the company embarked on a process to bring all its facilities up to Safe Quality Foods (SQF) Code standards, a certification recognized internationally by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). The Lafleur products all bear the label \\"Aliments du Qu√©bec\\" or \\"Aliments pr√©par√©s au Qu√©bec.\\"  Plants  The Lafleur products are prepared in facilities in Saint-Henri-de-L√©vis, Drummondville, Trois-Rivi√®res, Cornwall and Anjou (slicing). Over 1780 employees work in these plants.  Publication  In honour of their 100th anniversary in 2012, the Lafleur brand was featured in a recipe book called \\"De Lafleur √† votre table.\\" The company's corporate Chef, Marc Laroche, contributed all the recipes in the book, highlighting their products along with some popular, local products like cheese and maple syrup.  Advertising  In the early 1990s, celebrity hockey player Guy Lafleur became the advertising spokesman for \\"La Bonne Fourchette\\" sausages, a Lafleur product line. \\"The Flower,\\" as hockey fans knew him, pushed the brand recognition even higher. In 2009, Lafleur launched a major publicity campaign. The brand replaced the name of products with their logo. Lafleur began the celebration of their centennial with the launch of a TV commercial, \\"Au c≈ìur de vos moments partag√©s,\\" aired for the first time on the popular year-end show Bye Bye, in 2011. Throughout 2012, the company celebrated their 100 years in business with various in-stores and TV promotions. A Facebook page was also launched to engage a discussion with consumers. In 2014, Lafleur launched two advertising campaign. The first one, in French, featured Bob Le Chef with the tag line \\"On se dit les Vraies Affaires.\\" The second one presented important events under the theme \\"Chez nous c‚Äôest Lafleur.\\"  See also  Olymel: Olymel is a Canadian meat packing food processing company, a producer of pork and poultry products, based in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec.

The building remained unfinished, and it is still unknown which pharaoh was really intended to be buried here since no appropriate inscription has been found. The pyramid was rediscovered in 1910 by Ernest Mackay and excavated in the following year by Flinders Petrie.Flinders Petrie, G. A. Wainwright, E. Mackay: The Labyrinth, Gerzeh and Mazghuneh, London 1912, available online. Attribution When the two Mazghuna pyramids were rediscovered, scholars noticed many structural similarities between those two and Amenemhat III's pyramid at Hawara; for this reason the southern pyramid was attributed to the son and successor of this king, Amenemhat IV. Subsequently, the northern pyramid was attributed to the female-pharaoh Sobekneferu, sister of Amenemhat IV and last ruler of the 12th Dynasty. However, some scholars such as William C. HayesW.C. Hayes, The Scepter of Egypt. A Background for the Study of American Antiquites in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. From the Earliest times to the End of the Middle Kingdom, New York, 1953. believed that the two Mazghuna pyramids were built during the 13th Dynasty, on the basis of some similarities with the pyramid of Khendjer. In this case, the northern pyramid should have belonged to one of the many pharaohs who ruled between the beginning of the 13th Dynasty and the loss of control of the northern territory occurred during or after the reign of Merneferre Ay.McCormack, Dawn. \\"The Significance of Royal Funerary Architecture in the Study of 13th Dynasty Kingship.\\" In M. Mar√©e (ed) The Second Intermediate Period (13th-17th Dynasties), Current Research, Future Prospects, Belgium: Peeters Leuven, 2010, pp. 69-84. Description The pyramid superstructure seem to have never been started, and the only information that can be determined from it is that the pyramid was planned larger than its southern neighbor, which has a side length of . Plan of the hypogeum The hypogeum is similar to the one of the southern pyramid but much more tortuous, changing direction six times. The entrance is on the north side. From there, a staircase leads down to a square chamber and then to another staircase an to the first quartzite blocking. After that, two other chambers are connected by a passage with a second, still unsealed blocking. After the third chamber, a stairway and then a corridor leads to the antechamber just prior to the large burial chamber: this room, partially covered by an inverted V-shaped ceiling, is entirely filled by a huge sarcophagus-vault, which was carved from a single block of quartzite. The never-used sarcophagus lid, a 42-ton quartzite slab, still awaits to be fitted in the chamber. All exposed quartzite, which was built in the pyramid, had been painted with red paint and sometimes also decorated with vertical black stripes. The function of a large room behind the burial chamber remain unknown.Franco Cimmino, Storia delle Piramidi. Rusconi, Milano 1996, pp. 294‚Äì295, .Mark Lehner, The Complete Pyramids, Thames and Hudson, London 1997, pp. 184-185. . From the pyramid complex the valley temple, the funerary temple and the enclosure walls had apparently left no traces. Only a large portion of the causeway has been discovered, as well as another blocking stone, likely abandoned due to a change of the pyramid's design.

The church was built by the Dutch in 1755 and is one of the oldest Protestant churches still in use in the country. History The current existing church is believed to be the third building in the fort to serve the Dutch Reformed Church, the first being located near the Galle Clock Tower and the second, more elaborate building was constructed opposite the present church, with only the belfry remaining today. The present church is said to have been built on the site of a Portuguese Capuchin Convent. Watercolour painting of the Dutch Reformed Church, Galle by J. L. K. van Dort (1888) The present church was built on the highest point in the Galle fort, which stands more than above sea level. The foundations of the church were initially laid in 1682 but further work stagnated for a number of decades. In 1755 the Commandeur of Galle, Casparus de Jong (Lord of Spanbroek), and his wife Geertruyda Adriana Le Grand donated the money for the church to be constructed as a thanksgiving for the birth of their daughter for which he had waited for many years. The child was not baptised until the church was completed. An entry in the Baptismal Register gives the date of baptism as 24 August 1755. In 1760 a second-hand organ from Colombo was installed in the church. The church underwent various changes during the British Period. A stained glass window was built into the west fa√ßade of the church around 1830 and a communion rail was built in the south wing. At the beginning of the 20th century, a small organ was placed in the south wing. Around 1890, a canopy was built above the stained glass window to protect it from leaking. =Belfry= The church's detached belfry, which was erected in 1701, stands over the road from the church, at the corner of Queen's Street. The bell was cast in 1709 and was rung on Sundays to announce the services at the church. Architecture The church was constructed in the Doric style of the period, in a similar manner to the Wolvendaal Church in Colombo, the church is also in the form of a cruciform, only the transepts are shorter. Two arches separate them from the nave. The church has no central tower inside to bear the weight of the roof and as a result is compensated by the addition of two large dutch gables to the north and to the south. It is also decorated with an unusual double scroll moulding, unique to this church. The masonry gables are finished off with three flamed-like finials. The two large timber doors and stained glass windows provide light and ventilation. The high vaulted ceiling was originally painted blue and studded with golden stars. The main timber used for the roof was iron wood. The wooden pulpit is built in an hexagonal shape with calamander panelling mixed with local satinwood. High pews were erected along the walls for the Commandeur, the Deacons and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) officials. The pews along the southern end were dismantled to accommodate the altar and communion rails of the Anglican community who were allowed to use the church from the time of the early British rule down to 1867. Presently, in place of the altar, an organ is located on this location. Restoration The Groote Kerk was fully renovated with a financial grant from the Dutch Embassy. On 28 November 2004, the then President of Sri Lanka, Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga officially inaugurated the renovated building in the presence of the Dutch Ambassador, Mrs Susan Blankhart, the President of the Dutch Reformed Church, Reverend Charley Jansz and numerous distinguished guests. The conservation programme for the church restoration won a 2005 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Award for best practice. The church did not suffer any damage from the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake due to its relative height and protection by the walls of the Galle fort.

Etymology  Fagu is derived from Sanskrit word Falgu. As an adjective, it means beautiful, handsome, fine, etc. As a noun, it became synonyms of the Spring season. Falgun, a spring season month according to Hindu calendar, is origin of this word. Form Fagu is a lyrical form depicting beauty of nature during spring. It also portrays joys and pleasures of love, fears and hopes separation and union of lovers. This form was popular among Jain poets who were mostly monks, so many of these Fagu starts with erotic sentiments and ends with renunciation or self restraints. History  An oldest known Fagu is Jinachandra Suri Fagu (about 1225) by Jinapadma Suri. It has 25 verses with 6 to 20 verses missing. The first complete Fagu is Sthulibhadra Fagu composed between 1234 and 1244 or in 1344 or 1334. It describes rainy season instead of spring. The separation of Rajula and Jain Tirthankara Neminatha was a popular theme among Jain poets. Some examples are Neminatha Fagu (1344) by Rajshekhar, Neminatha Fagu (1375) by Jayashekhar and Rangasagara Neminatha Fagu (1400) by Somsundar. A poem Neminatha Chatushpadika (1269) by Vinaychandra depicted the same story. There are twelve known Fagus of these period and majority of them are written by Jain monks. Only two Fagus, Vasanta Vilas Fagu and Narayana Fagu, written by unknown authors are of non-Jain poets. Vasanta Vilas Fagu written in the fourteenth century by unknown author is beautiful Fagu without any religious sentiments. Narayana Fagu (1441) is about Krishna.

Performance history The work was first produced by Ballet Theatre (now the American Ballet Theatre) at the Metropolitan Opera House on 8 April 1942. The opening-night cast included Nora Kaye as Hagar, Antony Tudor as the Young man, Hugh Laing as the Man in the house across the way, Lucia Chase as the Eldest Sister, Annabelle Lyon as the Youngest Sister, Maria Karnilova, Charles Dickson, Jan Davidson, John Kriza, Virginia Wilcox, Wallace Seibert, Jean Hunt, Barbara Fallis, Sono Osato, Rosella Hightower, Muriel Bentley, Jerome Robbins, Donald Saddler, Frank Hobi, Balina Razoumova, and Roszika Sabo.Walter Terry, Ballet Guide, 1976, p. 259, Synopsis American Ballet Theatre describes it in full extensive detail in its archives. The setting is a small country town in 1900 (perhaps in Schoenberg's Austria). Hagar, the middle of three sisters, whose elder sister is a spinster, foresees the same fate for herself. Hagar is surrounded on the one side by the prude and judging neighboring women of the small town, and on the other by licentious men and their hedonistic women. The man she unrequitedly loves seems to show preference for her flirtatious younger sister. Hagar in desperation gives herself sexually to one of the licentious men, whom she definitely does not love, and who then immediately leaves her abandoned. Afterwards she is shunned by the prude and judging women and is totally distraught by what she has done. This resulting crisis, however, unites her with the one she really loves - the man she loves comes to her, and they dance together rapturously. The ballet is set in the period around 1900 because it was then that Schoenberg composed its music Verkl√§rte Nacht (\\"Transfigured Night\\"). The story plot is based on several traditional text versions - in some versions Hagar becomes pregnant before her true love finally comes to her. An actual performance An actual American Ballet Theatre performance, together with spoken brief remarks by Anthony Tudor, is available on Youtube.

They were created in 1956 as part of the Portuguese Air Force, being transferred to the Portuguese Army in 1993. Presently, most of the Paratroopers are part of the Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade which comprises all 3 special forces troops. The Portuguese Paratroopers were usually nicknamed \\"Paras\\" or \\"Green Berets\\" (Boinas Verdes). Organization Until 2006, the Portuguese Paratroopers formed an autonomous command within the Army, the Airborne Troops Command (Comandos de Tropas Aerotransportadas) or CTA. All parachute units and most of the Paratroopers were under that command. The CTA was also responsible for the selection of the future Paratroopers and for their training. The main operational formation of the CTA was the Independent Airborne Brigade (Brigada Aerotransportada Independente) or BAI. The CTA was created in 1993, when the Paratroopers were transferred to the Army, succeeding the Parachute Troops Command (Comando de Tropas Paraquedistas), that had the same functions within the Air Force. The CTA was extinct in the Army reorganization of 2006, at the same time the BAI being transformed in the Rapid Reaction Brigade or BrigRR. Since then, the Paratroopers do not form a collective corps, constituting only a speciality of the Army. They serve mainly in the following units of the BrigRR (that now also includes non-parachute units): * School of Parachute Troops (including the Air-Land Support Battalion and its Pathfinders Company); * 1st Parachute Infantry Battalion / 15th Infantry Regiment; * 2nd Parachute Infantry Battalion / 10th Infantry Regiment; History =The Parachute Rifle Battalion= The first female paratrooper nurses and an instructor in 1961. The first Portuguese Paratroopers were a group of 12 Timorese soldiers trained in Australia in 1942, to participate in the fight against the Japanese forces that were occupying Portuguese Timor. Some of them were launched in the rearguard of the Japanese forces. After the successful use of airborne forces in the Second World War by Germany and the Allies, other armed forces began to examine the possibility of forming parachute Troops for special missions. In 1955, the Portuguese Defense Minister approved a request for funds for airborne paratroop training. Two Portuguese Army captains went to France to take the French parachute course at the √âcole des Troupes A√©roport√©es. After the Portuguese Air Force was created as an independent service branch, it was decided that the Paratroopers would be part of the Air Force, much like the German organizational structure during World War II. The Parachute Rifle Battalion (Batalh√£o de Ca√ßadores P√°raquedistas) or BCP was formed in 1956. The Paratroopers were issued unique green berets and camo uniforms, being the first Portuguese military unit to wear these items of uniform. The Paratroopers initially jumped using the venerable German tri-motored Junkers Ju 52 aircraft. The BCP was provisionally installed in the Carregueira Military Camp, near Lisbon, but soon it was moved to Tancos, which still serves today as the main base of the Portuguese Paratroopers. =The Parachute Rifles Regiment and the Overseas War= Paratroopers being launched from an Alouette III helicopter in an air-mobile assault in Angola in the early 1960s. In 1961, conflict erupted in the African colonies, which soon evolved into a series of guerrilla campaigns against Portuguese rule. The Paratroopers were then required to fight in Africa. The BCP was enlarged to become a regiment, as the Regimento de Ca√ßadores Paraquedistas or RCP. It included an operational battalion (11th Paratroopers Rifles or BCP 11) and a training battalion. By this time, the men were armed with the modern 7,62mm ArmaLite AR-10 battle rifle, a weapon previously not seen in Western military forces.Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), pp. 183-184 The paratroopers liked the accuracy and mobility of the AR-10, but supplies were embargoed after initial deliveries were completed in 1960, and paratroopers were later issued the collapsible-stock variant of the m/961 (G3) rifle. To fight the various separatist guerrilla movements, additional Paratroopers battalions were created in the Portuguese African territories of Angola, Guinea and Mozambique. Due to Portuguese Air Force control over airborne units, the Paratroopers rifles battalions (BCP) numbers reflected their subordination to the several regional Air Force commands. So, the 1st Air Region (North Atlantic air command) commanded the BCP 11 based in European Portugal and the BCP 12 based in Portuguese Guinea, 2nd Air Region (South Atlantic air command) commanded the BCP 21 based in Angola and the 3rd Air Region (Indian Ocean air command) commanded the BCP 31 and BCP 32 both based in Mozambique. In the War, the Portuguese Paratroopers suffered the following casualties: * BCP 12: 56 dead (3 officers, 6 sergeants and 47 soldiers). * BCP 21: 47 dead (5 officers, 9 sergeants and 33 soldiers) * BCP 31: 39 dead (2 officers, 6 sergeants and 31 soldiers) * BCP 32: 18 dead (2 sergeants and 16 soldiers) A total of 160 Portuguese paratroopers were killed in action. On April 25, 1974, a military coup led by left-wing members of the Portuguese Army ended the authoritarian government regime in Portugal, and the country moved towards fully democratic elections. Shortly afterwards, peace negotiations with the various African colonies resulted in an end to the African wars, followed by the independence of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea- Bissau. Military reforms were instituted in Portugal in 1975, resulting in a reorganization of airborne forces. = The Parachute Troops Corps = In 1975, the Parachute Troops Corps (Corpo de Tropas Paraquedistas) or CTP is created within the Portuguese Air Force, to centralize the control of all its parachute units, under the command of a general officer. On the 5 July 1975, to the CTP is given an organization consisting of a dual structure: fixed and dynamic. The so-called fixed structure would include fix bases designed to train and support the Parachute Troops. Within this structure, the following bases are created: * No 1 Parachute Troops Operational Base (Base Operacional de Tropas Paraquedistas n.¬∫ 1) or BOTP 1, at Monsanto (Lisbon) * No 2 Parachute Troops Operational Base or BOPT 2, at S√£o Jacinto (Aveiro) * Parachute Troops School Base (Base Escola de Tropas Paraquedistas) or BETP at Tancos. A third operational base (BOTP 3) located within the Beja Airbase area was planned, but it was never activated. As part of this, the RCP was disbanded and transformed in the BETP within the CTP. The dynamic structure of the CTP would consist of its operational parachute units, the great majority of them being concentrated in the new Paratroopers Light Brigade (Brigada Ligeira de P√°raquedistas) or BriParas. The BriParas organization included the following units: * Paratroopers Battalion 11 (Batalh√£o de Paraquedistas n.¬∫ 11) or BP 11, at BOTP 1 (Monsanto) * Paratroopers Battalion 21 or BP 21, at BOTP 2 (S√£o Jacinto) * Paratroopers Battalion 31 or BP 31, at BETP (Tancos) * Air-Land Operational Group, at BETP (Tancos) * Service Support Operational Group, at BOTP 2 (S√£o Jacinto) * Anti-Tank Company, at BOTP 1 (Monsanto) * Signals Company, at BOTP 1 (Monsanto) * Heavy Mortar Company, at BOTP 2 (S√£o Jacinto) The CTP was responsible for changing the Paratroopers from a counter- guerrilla force to a conventional airborne force capable of fighting in a possible NATO vs Warsaw Pact war. =Army integration= alt= In 1993, further changes in the organization of airborne forces took place when the Defense Minister decided that the entire corps should leave the Portuguese Air Force and become part of the Portuguese Army. This meant also that the Army Commandos Regiment would be disbanded and the commandos that had taken the parachute course would be part of the new airborne brigade which was named Brigada Aerotransportada Independente (Independent Airborne Brigade) or BAI. The BETP then changed its name again to Escola de Tropas Aerotransportadas (Airborne Troops School) or ETAT, the Parachute Troops Corps changed to the Comando de Tropas Aerotransportadas (Airborne Troops Command) and all three Paratrooper battalions changed to Airborne infantry battalions (BIAT). This new Army Airborne Brigade meant to be larger and more powerful than the previous Air Force Paratroopers Light Brigade. As part of its strengthening, the new brigade received 105 mm guns (replacing the heavy mortars as its main artillery) and wheeled armored vehicles. In territorial terms, the BOTP 1 was closed (still under the Air Force) and BOTP 2 changed its name to S√£o Jacinto Military Area. The units of the brigade that were not at Tancos (Airborne Support Battalion) or S√£o Jacinto (2nd BIAT) were now garrisoned at Army barracks (Regiments) like the 15th Infantry Regiment at Tomar (1st BIAT), 3rd Infantry Regiment at Beja (3rd BIAT), 4th Artillery Regiment at Leiria (Grupo de Artilharia de Campanha ‚Äì Field Artillery Battalion), 3rd Cavalry Regiment at Estremoz (Esquadr√£o de Reconhecimento Aerotransportado ‚Äì Armoured Recon Squadron) and others. The BAI structure was: * 1st Airborne Infantry Battalion, at the 15th Infantry Regiment * 2nd Airborne Infantry Battalion, at the S√£o Jacinto Military Area * 3rd Airborne Infantry Battalion, at the 3rd Infantry Regiment * Anti-Tank Company, at the S√£o Jacinto Military Area * Air- Land Support Battalion, at the ETAT * Field Artillery Battalion, at the 4th Artillery Regiment * Signals Company, at the Tancos Military Airfield * Engineering Company, at the Engineering Practical School * Armored Reconnaissance Squadron, at the 3rd Cavalry Regiment * Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battery, at the 1st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment * Service Support Battalion, at the 15th Infantry Regiment It was envisaged that all BAI be fully staffed by paratrooper qualified personnel, including its combat support and service support units. However, due to various difficulties, this objective was never fully achieved. Moreover, it was never possible to maintain the 3rd BIAT continuously active, this unit being inactive much of the time. In November 2007, a Paratrooper was killed in a vehicle accident in Afghanistan. =Rapid Reaction Brigade= The last reorganization of the Army though, changed the ETAT designation again to ETP ‚Äì Escola de Tropas Paraquedistas (School of Parachute Troops) with the BAI being renamed and reorganized as BRR ‚Äì Brigada de Reac√ß√£o R√°pida . The Airborne Troops Command was disbanded. Currently, airborne forces are under direct control of regular army commands, such as Land Forces Operational Command (operational units) or the Instruction Command (ETP ‚Äì Paratrooper School). The Elite Forces brigade is no longer a full deployable brigade, but rather an organizational structure that controls all the special trained army units. The 3rd Airborne Infantry Battalion and Anti-Tank Company were disbanded and the other two BIAT were renamed Paratrooper Infantry Battalions (BIParas), the S√£o Jacinto Military Area was renamed 10th Infantry Regiment, the Airborne Artillery Group and the Services and Support Battalion were transferred to the Intervention Brigade and their no longer Airborne capable and the Engineering Company and the Anti- Aircraft Artillery Battery were reduced to platoon size. This new Rapid Reaction Brigade joined all remaining Paratrooper units together with Army Special Operations and the reborn battalion-size Army Comandos unit. Finally a newly formed unit has joined BRR: UALE (Army Light Aviation Unit), which is waiting to be equipped with NH-90 TTH and a still-to-be-chosen light utility helicopter, possibly the Eurocopter EC-135 or the AgustaWestland AW109. BRR forces include: * 15th Infantry Regiment: 1st BIPara * 10th Infantry Regiment: 2nd BIPara * ETP: Aeroterrestrial Battalion * Commandos Troop Center: Commando Battalion * Special Operations Troop Center: Special Operations Forces * Army Light Aviation Unit: Army Helicopter Group, Signals Company * 3rd Cavalry Regiment: Recon Squadron * Engineering Practical School: Engineering Platoon * 1st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment: Air Defence Platoon Candidate selection and training =General conditions= * A volunteer * A Portuguese citizen * At least 18 years old and 24 at the most for enlisted ranks * Psycho-physically and physically fit * Minimum height is 1.60m for males and 1.56m for females * Clean criminal registry * Minimum school grade required is the 9th for enlisted, 12th for NCOs and a college degree to officers = Admission tests = * Medical exams * Sensorial exams * Psychiatric and physical exams * Biographic questionnaire * Psychological interview * Physical tests =Training courses in the ETP= * Basic Instruction. * Complementary Instruction. ** Pathfinder Auxiliary Course. ** Parachute Maintenance Course. ** Air Supply Operator Course. ** Trainer of Military dogs. =Qualification Courses= * Parachute Course. * Airborne Basic Course. * Airborne Operations Course. * Parachute Instructor Course. * Free Fall Course. * Operational Free Fall Course. * Free Fall Instructor Course. * Manual Jump Master Course. * Pathfinder Course. * Air Supply Instructor Course. * Air Supply Inspector Course. * Airborne Equipment Tecnic Course. * Airborne Equipment and Parachutes Maintenance Course. * Complementary Paratrooper Course (officers and sergeants). * Complementary Paratrooper Course (soldiers).

It was recognised by the Direc√ß√£o-Geral de Veterin√°ria of Portugal in 2004. It is not recognised by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale.  History  The Barbado da Terceira derives from the various dogs brought to the Azores by colonists and visitors since settlement of the islands began in the fifteenth century, particularly from those with an aptitude for cattle herding. It was used both as a herding dog and as a guard dog. It was recognised by the Direc√ß√£o-Geral de Veterin√°ria of Portugal in 2004, based on the results of a collaboration between the Clube Portugu√™s de Canicultura, the Direc√ß√£o Regional de Agricultura of Terceira and the University of the Azores. A census in 2005 found 222 of the dogs. It is not recognised by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale. Morphology The Barbado da Terceira is a medium-sized dog, with a voluminous and robust look. The heights and weights are 52 to 58 cm and 25 to 30 kg for males, 48 to 54 cm and 21 to 26 kg for females. Height has a tolerance range between 48 and 50 cm. The head is strong, with parallel axes. The muzzle is relatively short and wide, with abundant beards which name the breed. The nose is wide and cube-shaped, framing the face with a characteristic look. Their eyes are very expressive, showing intelligence and naughtiness; their color varies between honey and dark brown, but they should not be totally or partially blue. When not cropped, the ears are medium-sized, hanging and set high. The neck is short and well muscled. The body, bulky and with a deep chest, is just slightly longer than the height at the withers. The tail has a medium to low setting; it is usually long reaching at least the hock, but bobtails or cropped are accepted. The limbs are well muscled and broad boned; the posteriors are well angulated showing a good impulsion.

Tr‚àûpers, is a third-person shooter video game developed and published by Capcom for Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation 3. The game was released exclusively in Japan to retail customers on November 22, 2012 and later on Nintendo eShop and PlayStation Network on January 24, 2013. It is a spin-off of the Lost Planet series which Capcom describes as , rather than like prior console instalments or Lost Planet 3's . Gameplay The game features similar gameplay elements to previous Lost Planet games, including the presence of major boss battles, extreme terrain, and Vital Suits (VSs). The player controls the protagonist, Bren, from a third-person perspective as he is challenged to navigate through different areas by running, dashing, grappling, zip-lining, and using his jet pack to quickly boost over a short distance. Combat primarily focuses on shooting enemies using a primary and secondary weapon (typically a weaker and short-ranged firearm with more ammo and a stronger and more versatile weapon, respectively). The game also features melee combat, involving punching foes into the air to juggle them with firearms (much like Devil May Cry), kicking them away, and blocking their attacks. The jet pack can be incorporated into attacks to increase their strength and effectiveness. Experience is earned by eliminating enemies and completing objectives. As they gain levels from experience growth, player characters gain improvements like increased health points, stronger melee attacks, better defenses, and prolonged jet pack boosts. Occasionally, there are missions involving VS piloting, which enables limited flight as well as the ability to perform stronger ranged and melee attacks. Thermal energy (T-ENG) is now used for charging up special attacks and restoring the life bar, rather than for survival (represented numerically by the player's HUD in Lost Planet: Extreme Condition and Lost Planet 2) or as currency (used in Lost Planet 3). Players can tap into their T-ENG reserve to release numerous forms of an exothermic (EX-T) blast to deal large amounts of damage to enemies. Armour and weapon upgrades are created from gathering materials (sometimes from enemy remains, similar to Monster Hunter) and require paying vendors with points, which are rewarded after successful missions. Points can also be used to purchase food items that provide various short-term buffs. Mission-based mechanics allow players to take on core quests that progress the story-driven adventure, or sidequests from other characters during the campaign. The game also rewards players with medals, which require progressing through the main campaign, completing secondary objectives in VR training missions, or playing in a unique manner. Once the game has been beaten, additional VR missions are unlocked and the main campaign can also be replayed with the inclusion of secondary objectives, which may be attempted for more medals. Medals can be spent to obtain music tracks and costumes for the player to customize their avatar. =Multiplayer= Both the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation 3 versions of the game have multiplayer support, however the former only supports local play through wireless communication while the latter only supports online play through PlayStation Network. This allows players to play through the VR missions cooperatively in a group of up to three people. There is also a versus mode featuring team deathmatch and capture the beacon for up to six people split into two teams. Plot The game begins with the approach of spacecrafts transporting enlistees to Neo Venus Construction Inc. (NEVEC) Academy's educational institutions on the planet E.D.N. III. Bren Turner, a candidate from E.D.N. II, is on board among the new recruits when the fleet is suddenly attacked by mysterious VSs. To confront the hostile force, Instructor Walter Stingray selects Bren to pilot a prototype VS equipped with a next- generation AI, capable of even autonomous behaviour. As the new \\"master\\" of this state-of-the-art machine, Bren designates it with the name \\"Gingira\\" and joins Walter to defend the fleet. After a fierce and intense fight, Bren and Walter successfully destroy the attackers, but are forced to eject from Gingira during atmospheric entry to the surface of E.D.N. III - a planet with an unforgiving environment and the alien race known as Akrid (AK). Development While E.X. Troopers had a trademark that was filed in November 2011, it was originally teased in an issue of Famitsu as a new Capcom project with limited information and without a title in April 2012, the same month as Lost Planet 3s announcement. The mysterious game was officially announced in another issue of Famitsu during May 2012, and revealed to be an action shooter for the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation 3 headed by Shintaro Kojima (Monster Hunter producer). The game shares the same world as Lost Planet, but features an anime art style (using a cel-shaded design aesthetic) and a school-themed atmosphere akin to a science fiction version of Capcom‚Äôs Rival Schools: United by Fate or Project Justice. There is also manga-style storytelling used between stages, similar to the cutscenes in Gravity Rush. Famitsu also reported that E.X. Troopers would see a return of snow pirates, VSs and the Akrid aliens, and introduced the bases on E.D.N. III as well as Bren and TeeKee as new characters. At the time of announcement, E.X. Troopers was estimated to be approximately 60% complete and would be released later in the same year. The game's playable debut appearance occurred soon after at Capcom's Summer Jam exhibition event held at Tokyo Big Sight on June 30 and July 1, 2012. Capcom also announced on September 20 that Dai Sat≈ç (Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eureka Seven) was in charge of writing the script for the game during a presentation at Tokyo Game Show 2012 (TGS 2012). A free demo for the game, announced at TGS 2012, arrived on the Japanese 3DS eShop on October 17 and the Japanese PlayStation Network on October 18, prior to the planned November 22 launch date. The demo consisted of one single-player mission and two co-op VR missions. E.X. Troopers has visual similarities with the cancelled Mega Man Legends 3. Former senior manager of community, Seth Killian, denied that art assets from the game were reused, and confirmed that E.X. Troopers was already well into development before Mega Man Legends 3 was cancelled. The two games did not initially share development staff, although some team members may have worked on both projects after the cancellation. =Nintendo 3DS version= The Nintendo 3DS version of E.X. Troopers lacks online services for multiplayer, but supports local play and a bonus \\"AR Marker\\" feature that activates in response to images from the game's website. This feature displays one of six of the game's characters (Bren, TeeKee, Chris, Julie, Luan and Gingira) in Augmented Reality allowing the player to use inputs to have the chosen character perform emotes or attacks. Otherwise, the game utilizes the two screens with the top screen supporting Stereoscopic 3D at all times and the touch screen handling numerous user interface options including the minimap and the E.X. Thermal Blast inputs (mapped onto the L2 and R2 buttons for the PlayStation 3 version). Like Capcom's Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and Resident Evil Revelations, the game supports the Circle Pad Pro for additional control support. While the PlayStation 3 version has one save file assigned to each PlayStation 3 account, the Nintendo 3DS version has two save slots assigned to each cartridge, or game file in the case of the downloaded version. =PlayStation 3 version= HexaDrive supported the development of the release on PlayStation 3 to run at 720p HD. In addition to using high resolution assets and more detailed effects than the portable version, it supports online multiplayer and trophies. This version is compatible with the Sixaxis and Dualshock 3 controllers. =Soundtrack= Music for the game was composed by Yasumasa Kitagawa and published by Suleputer. The albums also include performances by Y≈´ Kobayashi (voice of W.I.Z), Miyuki Sawashiro (voice of Julie), and Saori Hayami (voice of TeeKee). A total of 23 songs were placed into E.X.TROOPERS - The Bounded Soundtrack, which received a physical release on November 21, 2012, a day before the game's official release. Capcom shared \\"Re@union with you\\" with fans on the first anniversary of E.X. Troopers launch, and a remix of \\"The Resonance\\" (along with English lyrics and artwork) on their second anniversary. The E.X. Troopers - Original Soundtrack (containing a total of 115 tracks from the game) and E.X.TROOPERS - END OF CONVERSATION - EP (containing a total of 6 original tracks) both went on sale in online-only form through the iTunes Store on November 20, 2015, two days before the game's third release anniversary. =Localization= Although Capcom Japan initially filed U.S. and European trademarks in November 2011 for E.X. Troopers, there were no intentions for its localization anywhere outside of Japan. No new plans for a localization of the game have been announced as of April 4, 2017. Marketing and release Japanese animation studio Satelight created a two- minute promotional anime advertisement for the game. Onsen Radio featured a biweekly segment, the E.X. Troopers Gingira broadcasting station, on Thursdays from August 23 to December 27, 2012. The program was hosted by Shintaro Kojima (producer) and Y≈´ Kobayashi (voice of W.I.Z). Alongside the standard edition of the game, there was a Limited Edition version of the game delivered on launch day through e-Capcom for both the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation 3. Each E.X. Troopers Limited Edition set contained a standard copy of the game, a 1/8 scale pre-painted TeeKee figure, and two rubber straps (one featuring TeeKee and an additional random character selected from Bren, Chris, Julie, or Luan). The game was released exclusively in Japan to retail customers for Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation 3 on November 22, 2012. Digital versions of the game were also released two months later, on January 24, 2013. =Downloadable content= A series of SP (Special Promotional) Missions were given to players weekly following the game's release through SpotPass for the Nintendo 3DS version and through the game's menu for the PlayStation 3 version. Currently, all five extra levels are readily available to players completely free of charge and be accessed through the VR Mission menu. Various \\"secret codes\\" were found on Capcom's own website, as well as on retail store signs and in cross-promotional products like magazines and comics (Weekly Famitsu, Dengeki PlayStation, Newtype Ace, Kerokero Ace). Players can use these codes by inputting them at the in-game console and unlock various items including costumes, weapon blueprints, and food. Many codes unlock content which is part of a collaboration between the game and other parties ranging from external companies like Zoff & Otsuka Pharmaceutical but also other Capcom franchises like Monster Hunter. Reception In the Japanese video game magazine, Famitsu, E.X. Troopers scored a rating of 34/40 (9/9/8/8) for the Nintendo 3DS version and 32/40 (8/8/8/8) for the PlayStation 3 version. However, since the title was only released in Japan, it was not professionally reviewed for English-speaking audiences. Impressions from available previews of the game were nonetheless largely positive, and players have expressed their interest in seeing it translated for a wider release. Kotaku explains that \\"Lost Planet is a serious sci-fi/action series with a plot built around drama and treachery. E.X. Troopers is a lighthearted \\"save the world\\" adventure in a school setting with mystical shamans and Gundam robots. While both take place in the same universe and even on the same world, the tone, plot, and much of the lore feels completely different\\". They also complimented the manga art style, saying \\"the bright cel-shaded graphics are a joy to look at and the manga framing of the cutscenes is a creative way to tell the story\\". It also said the game is \\"simple to pick up and play\\", and noted the \\"co-op supports the single player\\". The site has mixed responses to the fact that the game \\"takes everything about Lost Planet and twists it\\", and that you get the \\"same enemies again and again\\". NintendoLife wrote that \\"graphics don‚Äôt make a game, but they can help a good one become great. The presentation in E.X. Troopers is flawless, but most important of all it‚Äôs consistent and it enhances what was already there, highlighting the hot-blooded cast and underlining the plot in a way that just wouldn't work if it was done differently. E.X. Troopers is different, proud of it, and we‚Äôre all the better for having it.\\" BitParade concluded their review by saying that \\"the beautiful simplicity behind its combat, and its razor-sharp speed and progression, are the culmination of carefully designing a game from the ground up for the portable format\\", claiming that E.X. Troopers was a more effective big budget effort for the 3DS than Resident Evil Revelations (both being 2012 Capcom 3DS releases). =Sales= The game sold 17,402 copies on the Nintendo 3DS and 8,717 copies on the PlayStation 3 within the first week of release in Japan, marking it as the weakest debut for a Lost Planet title at the time. This may have been partially attributed from E.X. Troopers competing with the high-selling Call of Duty: Black Ops II, which was released during the same time period.

It was commissioned by the Camden London Borough Council and installed in Camden, London in 2012. It is designed specifically to influence the behaviour of the public by restricting undesirable behaviour and instead be usable only as a bench, a principle known as hostile architecture. Because the design is \\"defined far more by what it is not than what it is\\", the bench has been called the \\"perfect anti-object\\" and a \\"masterpiece of unpleasant design\\". The designers contend that: \\"Homelessness should never be tolerated in any society and if we start designing in to accommodate homeless then we have totally failed as a society. Close proximity to homelessness unfortunately makes us uncomfortable so perhaps it is good that we feel that and recognise homelessness as a problem rather than design to accommodate it.\\" \\"Feature sites\\" for introduction of the bench were on Great Queen Street and High Holborn. Produced by UK company Factory Furniture, the bench is designed to deter use for sleeping, littering, skateboarding, drug dealing, graffiti and theft. It attempts to achieve this primarily through angular surfaces (deterring sleepers and skateboarders), an absence of crevices or hiding places, and non- permeable materials (via a waterproof anti-paint coating). It is not secured to the ground and can be moved by a crane attaching to built-in anchor points. Due to its weight, it is also designed to function as a roadblock. A Camden bench has been used as part of an installation artwork by Roger Hiorns. Awards The design has achieved several awards: * Keep Britain Tidy \\"Best practice street cleansing\\" (2010) * Design Council \\"Best practice for reducing crime\\" (2012) It has also been accredited as: * Home Office \\"PAS68 approved\\" (a classification for vehicle security barriers) for counter-terrorism use. Criticism The Camden bench received criticism as being a prime example of a wider trend of urban design that is anti-homeless, known as hostile architecture. Critics claim it is emblematic of a society where freedom in public space has been curtailed and deviance from accepted forms of behaviour has been made impossible. Popular criticism focused on subverting restrictions imposed by the bench, such as by attempting to skateboard on it.

This county wide outdoor art exhibition is centered on Ludington, Michigan. \\"What originally started out as a sculpture park on the shores of Lake Michigan in Ludington has now expanded as a regional sculpture trail...\\" In 2012, it was inaugurated with the idea of using sculptures as a cultural attraction and economic stimulus to Mason County. The sculpture \\"trail\\" will eventually include sculptures in Scottville, Custer, Free Soil, and Fountain of Mason County. Nine sculptures are at the Ludington Waterfront Park, two at the Ludington Public Library, one at the Ludington State Park, and one at the Mason County Fairgrounds, just east of the downtown. Each outdoor sculpture has a name and tells a story relating to Mason County's history. A QR code that can be scanned by smart phones to get detailed audio and video information on each of the sculptures will be implemented later. The project is envisioned as a cultural destination including a total of 25 sculptures in Mason County. The Cultural Economic Development Plan Task Force of 11-members is organizing the Sculpture Trail for \\"a more cohesive and unified cultural experience\\". The Ludington Waterfront Park with the nine bronze sculptures has been a centerpiece for various downtown events. The Sculpture Trail is one of five named trails of the Mason County Cultural Trails. The other trails are: Agricultural; Lumber Heritage; Maritime History; and Quilt Barn.  Sculptures  = Waterfront Park = \\"The Spirit of Ludington\\" (The Sailor)  \\"The Spirit of Ludington\\"  The sculpture display overlooks the Ludington harbor and shows a weathered sea captain steering his ship. It was dedicated to Ludington native Charles F. Conrad, founder of the Lake Michigan Carferry Service which contained the automobile ferry SS Badger. The SS Badger, along with the SS Spartan and the SS City of Midland 41 car ferries, were purchased by Conrad in 1991 from the defunct Michigan-Wisconsin Transportation Company. He converted the Badger to a passenger and auto ferry. The Lake Michigan Carferry Service then functioned as an independent enterprise for ten years without government subsidies. The S.S. Badger has ferried 34,000 vehicles and 115,000 passengers between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin, from 1992 to 2014. The sculpture was created in 2000 and named \\"The Sailor\\" by the sculptor Kristin Kokkin. It was the first sculpture to be placed at Ludington's waterfront park. It honors those who were sailors and captains on Lake Michigan. \\"The Carferries of Ludington\\" The sculpture is a twelve-foot representation of a car ferry carrying automobiles. There were 113 local donations given for this bronze display. Ludington has a long history of car ferries. The S.S. Badger, traveling across Lake Michigan to Wisconsin every summer, is the last of the Ludington ferries carrying automobiles. There are several descriptive and history plaques around the 2007 main display by Tuck Langland of Granger, Indiana. \\"The Carferries of Ludington\\" display Plaque names of Carferry display \\"Hooked on Hamlin\\" with empty stump, photo opportunity waiting for a subject \\"Hooked on Hamlin\\" The sculpture dedicated in July 2009 is a life-size representation of a man and boy fishing at the nearby Hamlin Lake. It has meaning to those that grew up at Hamlin Lake or vacationed there. The older man is taking a fish from the young boy's hook. It is one of the most significant and recognizable sculptures in Ludington. The sculptor that created this multiple piece bronze sculpture display is W. Stanley Proctor, the artist who constructed the sculpture \\"Follow the Leader\\" which is another popular multiple piece bronze display. The 2009 adjacent descriptive plaque reads, \\"The many friends of Hamlin Lake dedicate this sculpture to the bond that links the generations of families with the natural wonders of our Great Lakes ecosystem. Wild and natural things make up our irreplaceable and fragile Hamlin Lake, and we pledge our commitment to the dream of sustainability for the lake we love.\\" It also gives an old Chinese Proverb, :::::::::::::::::::::::A father may teach his son to fish, but a grandfather teaches him to fish for his dreams. Posing in \\"Follow the Leader\\" display \\"Follow the Leader\\" The multiple piece sculpture is of five children and a puppy playing the game of follow the leader across a stepping stone bridge. In the middle is an empty stone tempting a person to be photographed with the bronzed children. The sculpture was purchased by the Don Birtwistle family and donated to the community to highlight children who are the beneficiaries of the world. The \\"Follow the Leader\\" display was the first of the sculptures for the Mason County Sculptor Trail. It was created by W. Stanley Proctor who has since done two additional which are called \\"Hooked on Hamlin\\" and \\"Double the Fun\\". It is a playful interactive sculpture and a favorite among children as they like to play with 'the bronze children.' There is a photo opportunity available with the empty stepping stone waiting for an imaginative person. It encourages people to shape their own image on the empty stepping stone. Display of logging wheels with horse  \\"Ludington's Lumbering Era\\"  The eleven foot bronze sculpture represents Michigan logging wheels and the lumbering industry of the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century. It shows a horse pulling logs as a typical Ludington event of that time period as its lumber industry played a historical role on the Great Lakes. The large stone display has Ludington's history etched into the wall. It explains how James Ludington set up a mill and lumber industry in 1859. The hamlet settlement changed its name from Pere Marquette to become the town of Ludington. The town was plotted out then and not only bear Ludington's names, but the names of his siblings and prominent lumber barons of the area at the time. The etched history goes on to explain that Ludington prospered because of the local lumber industry. It explains that a harbor was developed to allow large quantities of lumber shipments to go out of the port. There were fourteen mills operating around Pere Marquette Lake at the height of production. They thought that there was an unlimited amount of timber to harvest into lumber, however in less than forty years all the woods were cut down. The etched history on the stone wall explains that the local lumber industry had come to an end in 1917. \\"The Dummy Train\\" Dummy train display The sculptor of this multi-piece display is George Lundeen. The bronze sculpture display represents the day when the Ludington railroad connected to the nearby resort of Epworth Heights. It is of a lady and her children near rails on a railroad platform. There is a crossing sign there. The display was purchased by the residents at Epworth Heights and presented to the city. The Ludington and Northern Railway was also known as the Dummy Train. It transported thousands of passengers to Epworth Heights from Ludington during the summertime from 1874 to 1919. The sculpture rails in the display are from the actual Ludington and Northern railway.

It is of a man and a child sitting in a wheel- borrow. It has a woman standing with a basket of fruit. In the center of the display is a sack of vegetables, a milk can, and box of cherries. These fruits and vegetables represent the farming products produced in Mason County for its heritage of farming. This, the ninth sculpture of the Mason County Sculpture Trail, was added mid-summer 2010. Lundeen also constructed \\"The Dummy Train\\" sculpture display. Lundeen is from Holdrege, Nebraska. He was a Fulbright- Hayes Scholar studying at the Academia de Belle Arte in Florence, Italy. Lundeen has various degrees related to art from the University of Nebraska and the University of Illinois. He also holds a bachelor of arts from Hastings College. Lundeen lives and works in Loveland, Colorado. He has a sculpting studio there that he established in the 1970s. Lundeen has done commissioned work to sculpt portraits and interpretive works for universities, municipalities, foundations, and corporations. He is a member of the National Academy of Design and the National Sculpture Society. \\"Put Me in Coach\\" The Ludington Mariners, a past semi-pro baseball team of 1912-1924, is represented by a bronze display of a crouched baseball player with a bat in hand. They played at Culver Park and were not associated with any major league team. The sculptor that created the bronze sculpture is Mark Lundeen. It was donated by the Anderson family and the Reed family. The Ludington Mariners Old Time Base Ball Team started in 1912. In 1915 they took a break during the World War I. The team resumed again in 1920 and played for two years. They discontinued play, but resumed again in 1926 and renamed the Ludington Tars. The team played where the Ludington municipal marina is now located. The team was reassembled in 1993. Their home location they play at now is White Pine Village outside of Ludington. They sometimes play at Mackinac Island and Greenfield Village. The revived team, including the umpires, dress in the 1860s outfits. They play by the rules of that time period. The fans that watch the games sometimes dress in this spirit and wear period pieces. Some game players participate year after year and they are always looking for new ones. \\"Reflections\\", stainless steel  \\"The Reflections\\"  The seventeen-foot stainless steel sail abstract sculpture symbolizes when timber was carried by schooners to Great Lakes ports from Ludington. It is the first sculpture seen from boaters who spend leisure time on the waters of Lake Michigan as they come back into the Ludington harbor. The abstract sculpture was created by Russian-born sculptor Irina Koukhanova. The Schoenherr family purchased the sculpture and donated it to the WaterFront Park at the Ludington harbor. Irina Koukhanova, the sculptor, was educated at the Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry, the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and the University of Notre Dame. She has participated in United States exhibitions and international exhibitions. Koukhanova does two-dimensional work in printing techniques with drawings and three- dimensional sculptures. She was awarded Best of Show in Box Heart Gallery's \\"Art Inter/National\\" exhibition and had in 2010 an exhibition at DKO Galerie in Zurich, Switzerland. She has won awards at exhibitions at Boston Sculptors Gallery, Owensboro Museum of Art, Marlboro Gallery in Maryland, and the Indianapolis Art Center in Indiana. The stainless steel sculpture of a rendering of three sails was the sixth put in the Ludington Waterfront Park. The plan is up to ten sculptures for the park at the harbor near downtown. It was officially dedicated on August 12, 2006. Joan Schoenherr, one of the donors of the sculpture, is the chair of the sculpture selections group. = Mason County Fairgrounds =  \\"Rearing Horse Memory Pole\\"  The Mason County Fairgrounds just east of downtown Ludington on US-10 is the sculpture called \\"Rearing Horse Memory Pole.\\" This hand-carved wooden rearing horse was created by Craig Convissor, a Scottville artist. It was purchased by the Mason County Saddle Club and donated to the Mason County Fairgrounds where dozens of horse shows take place each year. Thousands of spectators see the memorial at the fairgrounds entrance each spring, summer and fall. = Ludington Public Library = \\"Flights of Learning\\", Ludington Public Library  \\"Flights of Learning\\"  The new Keith Wilson Children's Center addition in 2012 was completed with installation of the bronze sculpture \\"Flights of Learning\\" at the Ludington Public Library front exterior entrance. John and Anita Wilson first saw this sculpture at a Grand Rapids art prize competition. They decided to purchase the seven-and-a-half-foot 800-pound sculpture and donate it to the Ludington library. It was unveiled in June 2012. The creator and artist is Bryce Pettit of Monticello, Utah. The sculpture took Pettit about six months to complete. The Keith Wilson Children's Center back addition was named for John's father. Pettit wrote that his sculpture ‚ÄúFlights of Learning‚Äù represents the mission and purpose of a library. The model for the bronze sculpture was the sculptor's eleven-year-old daughter. The open bronze book at the statue explains that parents have the responsibility to make the world better through their children. The members of the community carry the responsibility of giving children the proper education to become outstanding citizens. The book represents a portal to knowledge. The birds represent the information that can be learned in the books. Knowledge is released and flies to new horizons to enrich and enlighten the lives of people through learning. Freedom is gained through the opportunity of \\"Flights of Learning\\". Different birds represent different areas of knowledge. The knowledge of science and mathematics is through the wise owl. The knowledge of history is represented by the falcon. The knowledge of literature is shown through the jay bird. The appreciation of music is given by the meadowlark. Fantasy is portrayed by the hummingbird. The skills of art is illustrated in the tern. \\"Double the Fun\\" sculpture at the rear of the Ludington Public Library  \\"Double the Fun\\"  This sculpture represents Sallie Peterson Ferguson reading to a young boy and a young girl. She was raised on a fruit farm on Meisenheimer Road in Summit Township, Mason County, Michigan. Ferguson was a Ludington High School graduate of the class of 1961. She was a valedictorian. Ferguson went to college and became a high school English teacher. She was one of the founders of the Montessori School of Kalamazoo. Because of Ferguson's background in teaching Dr. Bill Anderson, chair of the Mason County Cultural Economic Development Task Force, proposed the idea that the sculpture be placed at the Ludington Public Library. The sculpture is at the Craig R. Rasmussen Outdoor Activity Area in the rear of the library. The sculptor that created this is W. Stanley Proctor, who also made the sculptures \\"Hooked on Hamlin\\" and \\"Follow the Leader\\" for the Mason County Sculpture Trail. right = Ludington State Park =  \\"Community Cooperative\\"  A sculpture entitled ‚ÄúCommunity Cooperative‚Äù by Colette Pitcher of Greeley, Colorado represents nature with small animals living in an old tree. It was funded by John J. Helstrom of Muskegon, Michigan. It is located across from the office of Ludington State Park on the walking path near the Sable River. The Ludington State Park manager noted that it represents the wildlife found in the park as it would not be unusual to find the scenario the bronze sculpture represents. The head of the Mason County Cultural Economic Development Task Force claimed that it was a great accomplishment for the Mason County Sculpture Trail project, a garden of public art started at Ludington's Waterfront Park, to have such a piece of sculpture art located in the queen of Michigan State Parks. \\"Helping Hand\\" = Mason County Sheriff's Office = =\\"Helping Hand\\"= This sculpture at the Mason County Sheriff's Office was created by Colette Pitcher. Dr. Terry and Sandy Luxford bought the sculpture and donated it. The sculpture shows appreciation and gratitude the citizens of Mason County have for the law enforcement personnel. Dr. Luxford has been a dean for several years of occupational and vocational programs and started both the law enforcement and nursing programs at the West Shore Community College in Mason County, Michigan. = Maritime Heritage Park = The Maritime Heritage Park, an area south of the Loomis Street Boat Ramp west of downtown Ludington has both the \\"Abby\\" sculpture and the \\"Sport Fishing\\" sculpture which is part of the Mason County Sculpture Trail. = The Abbie = The Abbie The \\"Abbie\\" bronze bas- relief sculpture is a representation of the last schooner built in Ludington in 1886 for merchant Rasmus Rasmussen. Due to a storm on November 8, 1905 the \\"Abbie\\" was forced ashore and wrecked off Portage Point near the entrance to Portage Lake in Manistee County, Michigan. The \\"Abbie\\" was a double-masted schooner that was 88 feet long. It was named after a nineteenth-century Ludington postmaster's wife. While the schooner was being built the postmaster asked Rasmussen if he would name the schooner after his wife. In exchange the postmaster would buy a windsock for the ship. The end result was that the schooner was named \\"Abbie\\" and Harry Scott, the postmaster, furnished a windsock. Jack Rasmussen and his wife Shirley donated the funds for the sculpture. Jack is the grandson of Rasmus Rasmussen. The Abbie was a double- masted schooner 88-feet long. Rasmus Rasmussen often sailed the schooner between Ludington and Chicago with merchandise. The bronze sculpture was created by artist Tyson Snow of Salem, Utah. = Sport Fishing = Sport Fishing Sculpture The \\"Sport Fishing\\" sculpture represents the popular sport of Ludington, Michigan. Coho and Chinook Salmon were introduced into Lake Michigan in the 1960s. Fishermen caught large numbers of mature fish starting in the Fall of 1967. This fish program influenced the growth of tourism in Ludington. Carol Polston bought and dedicated this sculpture to her late husband, Barry, an avid fisherman in Ludington and Northern Michigan. His boat that he fished from was called \\"Trust me.\\" Bryce Pettit of Durango, Colorado, created the sculpture.

Those devices can be equipped with a variety of sensors and work as transmitters to broadcast digital data, usually using Bluetooth Smart protocol. Thanks to that, those objects are able to provide mobile devices in range with information about their location, state and immediate surroundings. The word ‚Äònearables‚Äô is a reference to wearable technology - electronic devices worn as part of clothing or jewellery. The term ‚Äònearables‚Äô was first introduced by Estimote Inc. in 2014 as part of a marketing campaign associated with a product launch of next generation of Bluetooth Smart beacons.  History  Nearables are a further development of the Internet of Things (also referred to as Internet of Everything). It‚Äôs a vision of a wide, global network of interconnected devices, using the existing Internet infrastructure to provide advanced services beyond standard machine-to-machine communications. Although the term Internet of Things was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999, the idea can be traced to late 1980s, when Mark Weiser introduced the idea of ubiquitous computing. In 1990s location-based services started emerging, thanks to wide adoption of mobile phones and development of location and proximity-based technologies, such as GPS and RFID. This, in turn, led to first attempts at wireless proximity marketing in 2000s with early version of Bluetooth, NFC and Wi-Fi standards as predominant technologies. However, it was not until 2013, when Apple Inc. announced the iBeacon protocol for Bluetooth Smart-enabled devices, that the idea of creating smart objects by attaching wireless beacons to them really started gaining traction. In August 2014 Estimote Inc. launched Estimote Stickers: a new generation of small Bluetooth Smart-based beacons. The term ‚Äònearables‚Äô was inspired by wearable computers which were gaining increasing popularity throughout 2013 and 2014 thanks to products like Pebble smartwatch and Google Glass. Originally, the nearables were described as smart, connected objects that broadcast data about their location, motion and temperature.  Technology  In its first interpretation Nearables are not devices themselves. Any object (or a live being, like a human or animal) can become a nearable after a wireless, electronic sensor is attached to it and starts broadcasting data to nearby mobile devices. Due to continued miniaturization of sensor technology, a single transmitter could be equipped with a whole set of these, for example: accelerometer, thermometer, ambient light sensor, humidity sensor or magnetometer. In the second interpretation the actual nearable devices can be part of an infinite array of smart interconnected objects, programmed to improve an individual's vicinity in every way, usually to be used in a smart home environment. Making today's homes smart by having nearable technologies creating these devices to act intuitively depending on the needs of individuals through self learning software. First examples of nearables were objects tagged with Bluetooth Smart beacons supporting accelerometer and temperature sensor and broadcasting their signal in range of approximately 50 meters. They can communicate with mobile applications installed on devices with Bluetooth 4.0, compatible with Bluetooth Smart protocol on the software side. At the moment of their launch, it included mainly iOS 7 and high-end Android mobile devices.  Use cases  To create a nearable, one must attach an electronic device, working as both sensor and a transmitter, to an object. Since the only limitation is the size of the device, both items and living beings can act as nearables. The most often cited examples, however, include retail and home automation environment.

The battle took place in and around the town of ≈Åom≈ºa, on both sides of the Narew River. Polish forces successfully held a series of pre-First World War forts from repeated German attack before being forced to withdraw due to the position becoming untenable following their losses at the Battle of Wizna and Battle of Nowogr√≥d.  Background  The Narew River formed a natural barrier close to the southern borders of East Prussia. The town of ≈Åom≈ºa is located on the southern bank of the river, on a high escarpment. The lower, northern bank is mostly flat and swampy. During the 1939 invasion of Poland, the line of the river was manned by forces of Independent Operational Group Narew (SGO Narew), a corps-sized unit of two infantry divisions and two cavalry brigades. The Polish unit was tasked with defending the Narew river line with important bridgeheads at R√≥≈ºan, Ostro≈Çƒôka, Osowiec Fortress, Nowogr√≥d, ≈Åom≈ºa and Wizna, and to cover the right flank of the Modlin Army. The cavalry was tasked with organising delaying actions along the Polish-German border and the Biebrza River further to the north-east from ≈Åom≈ºa. Among the most important positions in the region was a fortified bridgehead of ≈Åom≈ºa, the so-called ≈Åom≈ºa Fortress. The position, consisting of three large forts in PiƒÖtnica (Forts I, II and III), on the northern side of the Narew, and two additional isolated forts (Fort IV and V) on the southern bank, was constructed by Imperial Russian Army between 1896 and 1914. Although outdated and unsuitable for modern warfare, the forts in PiƒÖtnica were upgraded with trenches, barbed wire obstacles, chevaux de frise and 12 reinforced concrete bunkers in 1939. Similarly the southern bank around ≈Åom≈ºa was reinforced with 9 more bunkers, though shortly before the war their machine guns were moved to PiƒÖtnica. The forts were manned by 1st Battalion of the 33rd Infantry Regiment (under Maj. Stanis≈Çaw Wyderko), part of 18th Infantry Division. The machine gun bunkers were manned by 1st MG Company, 1st Battalion, 42nd Infantry Regiment under Lt. Franciszek Zarƒôba while the trenches around them were manned by two rifle companies of the 33rd regiment. The frontal positions were supported by 1st platoon of 33rd regiment's anti-tank company (under Lt. Zygmunt Olkowski) and a platoon of outdated 76 mm wz. 1902 guns. The southern side of the river was manned by 3rd Rifle Company, 1st Battalion, 33rd Regiment (under Lt. Aleksander Siejak), supported by 3rd battalion, 18th Light Artillery Regiment (under Capt Stanis≈Çaw Krug) and a howitzer detachment of 18th Heavy Artillery Regiment (Lt. Col. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Brzozowski). Initially the Germans did not attack from East Prussia during the first week of World War II the front of SGO Narew was mostly stable. After 3 September the town of ≈Åom≈ºa was bombarded by the Luftwaffe several times and was set on fire, but the Polish forces suffered only negligible losses. However, after the Battle of the Border and the defeat of Polish forces in the Polish Corridor, elements of Nazi Army Group North broke through to East Prussia and were prepared to push southwards.  Battle  On 7 September, shortly after noon, the 21st Infantry Division of XXI Army Corps (Germany) (under Gen. Nikolaus von Falkenhorst) reached the forward outposts of the Polish positions in front of ≈Åom≈ºa. The German commander tried to take the Polish positions by a frontal unprepared attack, aimed towards forts I and II. The attack, carried out by 24th Infantry Regiment of the 21st Division reinforced with tanks of the 8th Panzer Regiment, 10th Panzer Division and artillery, was repelled by Polish machine gun crews and well- placed 37 mm Bofors anti-tank guns. The attacking infantry was repelled with significant losses, the Germans also lost 6 tanks. Fort I in PiƒÖtnica, modern view Several repeated attacks were repelled by the 1st Battalion, 33rd Infantry Regiment. In the evening the 21st Division tried to outflank the ≈Åom≈ºa bridgehead by fording the Narew, but the Germans were pushed back across the river by vigorous Polish counterattack. By the end of the day the Germans suffered significant losses, the Poles took 57 German soldiers prisoner. The 21st Division withdrew to the north, leaving only a small detachment in front of Polish positions. The following morning after a short artillery barrage the screening detachment surrendered. Overnight Lt. Col. Lucjan Stanek, the commanding officer of the 33rd Regiment, departed the ≈Åom≈ºa position to confer with SGO Narew's commanding officer, Gen. Czes≈Çaw M≈Çot-Fija≈Çkowski. Before noon the following day the Germans returned, this time attacking forts II and III. Four consecutive assaults were repelled by the defenders. Unable to take the forts, around 14:00 the German commander summoned Luftwaffe close air support. The air bombardment caused significant losses within fort II, it also damaged the bridge across Narew. However, the Polish positions remained impregnable and repeated German attacks in the afternoon were repelled by the defenders long before the German tanks could reach the vicinity of the bridge. Around that time a large part of the attacking force was withdrawn towards Wizna and Nowogr√≥d to force the river crossing there, while the remainder tried to attack Fort I under cover of artillery barrage and air strikes. Although this time Polish losses were higher, this renewed attack was also repelled. On 10 September the Germans repeated their attacks, again against forts no. II and III. Around noon German bombers arrived, yet the attack stalled. Despite repeated attempts, until the end of the day the Germans did not manage to destroy a single Polish bunker and had to retreat from within the range of Polish artillery.  Polish withdrawal Memorial stone to the soldiers of 33rd Regiment in ≈Åom≈ºa Despite three days of repeated German attacks and significant losses (roughly 30% in dead and wounded), Polish morale was still high. However, soon after 21:00 Col. Stefan Kossecki, commanding officer of the 18th Infantry Division, ordered the ≈Åom≈ºa position to be abandoned. The reason was that the Germans were victorious in the Battle of Nowogr√≥d and the Poles failed to retake the town. Around the time the Germans also broke through at Wizna and the Narew river line was untenable. The 33rd Regiment withdrew towards Bacze Mokre, the last unit crossed the Narew around 22:00. The following day the German forces captured ≈Åom≈ºa unopposed and on 29 September the town was handed over to their Soviet allies.

Csoon wrote \\"Synnergist maintains a good story line throughout the game, keeping the player's interest high in wanting to solve the mystery... Some of the puzzles can be a little difficult to figure out, and once you are stuck, the game can be slow.\\" The site gave the game a rating of 81%. In another positive review, Four Fat Chicks wrote \\"Here is a game that has an interesting plot with many twists and turns, nice graphics, unobtrusive sound and music, easy interface, and a good number of varied locations to explore. Synnergist has a similar mood and style to Noctropolis, with a little Gabriel Knight‚Äìtype understated tension thrown in... It's a shame that Vicarious Visions didn't follow up Synnergist with any other adventure games.\\" In a contemporary review, Petra Tsimberov of Hardcore Gaming 101 found the game interesting for being a notable example of outsider art, drawing attention to how much of its development cycle was spent while Vicarious Visions founders Karthik and Guha Bala were still in high school. She noted \\"Wherever it fails, it‚Äôs a shame, but almost to-be expected. But where it gets things right, it‚Äôs all the more enthralling.\\" The review went on to criticize the game's technical shortcomings but praised the game's ability to immerse and captivate the player through its painted backgrounds and atmosphere - \\"Objectively the whole game is really rather forgettable, but if you approach it with the same dream-oriented excitement the Bala brothers had back in 1991, it may just stick around for longer.\\" References Category:1996 video games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Europe-exclusive video games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Vicarious Visions games ","title":"Synnergist"},{"id":"43688844","text":"Jeumont may refer to: *Jeumont, a commune in the Maubeuge-Nord canton department in northern France * Forges et Ateliers de Construction Electriques de Jeumont, precursor to Jeumont-Schneider *Jeumont-Schneider, French electric and mechanical engineering group *Jeumont Electric, electric engineering company created from Jeumont-Schneider ","title":"Jeumont (disambiguation)"},{"id":"43688860","text":"Long Island is an island off the Kimberley coast of Western Australia.

In a racing career which lasted from October 1974 until October 1976 she won four of her thirteen races and was placed on seven occasions. She won her only race as a two-year-old but showed moderate form in the early part of her three- year-old season. In the late summer and autumn of 1975, however, she emerged as a top-class filly, winning the Yorkshire Oaks and the Park Hill Stakes and was subsequently rated the best British filly of her generation. She remained in training in 1976, but failed to win in five races. She was then retired to stud and had some success as a broodmare. She is commemorated in the May Hill Stakes a race for two-year-old fillies at Doncaster Racecourse. Background May Hill was a \\"well-made, good-quartered\\" bay mare with a white star and snip and three white socks bred in England by her owner Percival Williams. She was probably the best horse sired by the American horse Hill Clown, who won the Sunset Handicap in 1967 before being sent to the United Kingdom. May Hill was the third of four foals produced by her dam Mabel, a high-class racemare who won the Yorkshire Oaks in 1965 and was placed in the Oaks Stakes, 1000 Guineas and Park Hill Stakes. Like Williams' other good horses, which included Pasty, May Hill was sent into training with Peter Walwyn at Lambourn in Berkshire. Racing career =1974: two-year-old season= May Hill made her racecourse debut over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse on 9 October in the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes (not the current race of the same name) for two-year-old colts and fillies which had not run before 22 September. Ridden by the Welsh jockey Geoff Lewis, she started a 20/1 outsider but produced an impressive burst of acceleration in the closing stages to win by a length from the colt Red Lever, who was conceding eight pounds. =1975: three-year-old season= May Hill took time to reach her best form in 1975. On her seasonal debut she contested the Fred Darling Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April and finished second, beaten three lengths by the Italian-trained filly Carnauba. She bypassed the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse and reappeared in the Musidora Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse in May. As in her previous appearance, she looked short of peak condition and finished second, but produced a better performance and was only beaten a head by the winner Moonlight Night. On 7 June, May Hill contested the 197th running of the Oaks Stakes at Epsom. Looking unsuited by the firm ground, she turned into the straight in eleventh place and although she made sty progress in the closing stages she finished a distant fourth behind Juliette Marny, Val's Girl and Moonlight Night. The filly then returned to winning form in a minor race over a mile and a half at Haydock Park Racecourse, winning easily from her only opponent. In August at York Racecourse, May Hill faced Juliette Marny again in the Yorkshire Oaks, and started at odds of 4/1. Ridden by Pat Eddery, she won the race by one and a half lengths from Light Duty, with Juliette Marny in third. The result was only confirmed after a stewards' inquiry into possible interference caused when May Hill hung to the left in the closing stages. In September, May Hill was moved up in distance for the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Starting at odds of 13/8 she was restrained by Eddery for most of the race before taking the lead two furlongs from the finish and winning impressively by one and a half lengths from the Irish-trained filly Tuscarora. Later that month, May Hill was sent to France to contest the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp Racecourse. She started the 4/1 third favourite and ran well, but proved no match for the two leading French fillies and finished third, beaten one and a half lengths and eight lengths by Ivanjica and Nobiliary. =1976: four-year-old season= May Hill remained in training as a four-year-old, and was campaigned mainly in staying races, but failed to win in five attempts. On her seasonal debut she finished third to Marco Ricci and Major Green in the Paradise Stakes over two miles at Ascot in May and then ran second on her next appearance. She then sustained a serious injury when running third behind Mr Bigmore in the Lymm Stakes at Haydock. She was then off the racecourse until autumn, when the best of her two runs came when she finished third to Bright Finish and Shangamuzo in the Jockey Club Cup. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1974: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap May Hill was allotted a weight of 111 pounds, twenty pounds behind the top-rated filly Cry of Truth. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 102 p, (the \\"p\\" indicating that she was likely to make more than usual improvement) placing her twenty-seven pounds behind Cry of Truth and thirty-one behind the French-trained Broadway Dancer. In their annual Racehorses of 1974 Timeform argued at length that the official handicap had over-rated the filly and several other lightly-raced animals, and had become an exercise in attracting runners for the European Free Handicap (for which only horses given a rating were eligible) rather than an accurate assessment of the season's best juveniles. In 1975, the official British handicap rated May Hill the best three-year-old filly of the season, equal with Rose Bowl and nine pounds below the leading colt Grundy. Timeform gave her a rating of 124, nine pounds behind their top-rated three-year-old filly Rose Bowl. In 1976, May Hill was rated 106 by Timeform and did not receive a rating in the official British handicap. Breeding record May Hill produced at least five foals and three winners between 1981 and 1989: *Apodemus (gelding, foaled in 1981, sired by Record Token) *Picea (bay colt, 1983, by Mummy's Pet), won three races *Bint Naas (filly, 1986, by Lomond) *Rising Tempo (bay gelding, 1988, by Lomond), won four races *May Hills Legacy (bay filly, 1989, by Be My Guest), won three races Pedigree References Category:1972 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 15-a ","title":"May Hill (horse)"},{"id":"43688905","text":"The Union for Benin (, UB) is a political alliance in Benin led by Barnab√© Dassigli.Tom Lansford (2013) Political Handbook of the World 2013, CQ Press, p145 The alliance supports President Yayi Boni.

The Division 1 premiership was won by the Coburg Football Club, after it defeated Williamstown in the Grand Final on 18 September by 27 points; it was Coburg's fifth Division 1 premiership. The final Division 2 premiership was won by Oakleigh; it was the club's second Division 2 premiership, and the last premiership ever won by the club in either division. Association membership The Association contracted substantially in 1988. Between the end of 1987 and the end of 1988, a total of five teams left the Association: *Northcote and Caulfield, who were suspended by the Association in November 1987 *Berwick, which withdrew from the Association in November 1987 *Waverley, which folded in March 1988 *Mordialloc, which withdrew from the Association in May 1988 Additionally, Moorabbin, which had been suspended in May 1987 for the remainder of that season, did not seek re-admission for 1988. The controversial FORT review from December 1986 was considered instrumental in shaping the clubs' departures. The FORT review had recommended reducing the Association to 12 clubs in one division, with the second division operating as a suburban-level competition with no promotion or relegation between the levels; and, it explicitly named the eleven clubs it proposed to exclude from the rationalised competition. Even though the Association never received a mandate to enforce the FORT recommendations, all five of the clubs who departed saw the FORT review as partly responsible for their demise. =Caulfield= Caulfield, which had been relegated from Division 1 at the end of 1981, had struggled to remain competitive in Division 2. Its financial viability had been borderline throughout its time in Division 2, and the club occasionally struggled to field minor grade teams. The club was also not helped by a clubroom fire in 1985. Its situation deteriorated rapidly in 1987, when the club endured an exodus of 28 players, which it blamed on the uncertainty generated by its exclusion from the FORT blueprint, and from negative publicity generated when Association president Brook Andersen had compared the club to the struggling Geelong West ‚Äì it ran at a loss of $60,000 during the year and considered itself lucky to have survived. The club fell behind on its Association levies in July and August 1987, resulting in its suspension from the final match of the 1987 season. By November, the club still owed the Association $11,000 in levies and fines, and on 4 November, the Association executive suspended Caulfield for the 1988 season. The club did not dispute that it was behind on its levies, but believed that the Association suspended it, rather than showing lenience, because of its desire to achieve the FORT's vision of a rationalised competition. The club never returned to the Association, ending its 80-year affiliation which had begun in Brighton in 1908 before moving to Caulfield in 1962. The club merged with the Ashburton Football Club and played in the South East Suburban Football League in 1988. =Northcote= By November 1987, Northcote was found to no longer meet any of the Association's three minimum requirements for a club: it was not financially viable, as it lacked sponsors, had fewer than 100 members, and had no prospects of reversing this problem due to its small local population, and increased competition from soccer as the ethnic demographic in Northcote increased; it could no longer guarantee a home ground as the Northcote Council had been considering ending its tenancy of the Westgarth Street Oval; and it could not guarantee that it could muster enough players to field teams in all three grades. Officially, the club was suspended for the 1988 season on 4 November 1987, but Association president Brook Andersen commented that the club had \\"effectively resigned\\" by revealing all of these problems to the Association executive; although, there was some factional infighting within the club, and incoming club president Ian Galbraith, who wanted the club to stay in the Association, claimed that his factional enemies had exaggerated the magnitude of the club's problems in a deliberate attempt to bait the Association into expelling it. The club never returned, ending its 80-year affiliation with the Association, and soon disbanded. =Berwick= At its annual general meeting on 12 November 1987, Berwick discussed whether or not to withdraw from the Association and return to the South West Gippsland Football League. The club had not enjoyed any significant improvement in local support and its financial position had suffered since joining the Association from the SWGFL in 1983; and, there were concerns after the FORT review that Division 2 had an uncertain future. The motion to leave the Association was passed by a narrow majority at the meeting, and Berwick returned to the SWGFL in 1988, ending its five-year affiliation with the Association. The club also noted that it was faced with paying a $5,000 instalment of its affiliation levy in November, with Caulfield's suspension sending a clear message that the club faced suspension if it failed to pay. Some at the club believed this to be a cynical ploy by the Association to drive its weaker clubs out of the competition, further raising concerns about whether it could survive long-term in the competition. As of 2019, the club remains active in the South East Football League, a successor to the SWGFL. =Waverley= In early March 1988, Waverley announced that it was in financial trouble. It had not paid its players for 1987, nor had it paid its most recent $5,000 instalment of the affiliation levy, it was $58,000 in debt and it needed to raise $20,000 within two weeks to remain in operation. The club's supporters and members rallied, and developed a plan to use its small cash reserves to pay the affiliation levy, then pledged its commitment to raise the $20,000 it needed, as well as the $80,000 it would need to operate for the rest of the season; but, within two days, one of the club's creditors objected to the club using its cash reserves in this manner, and threatened legal action. The club expected to be suspended if failed to pay its levies, but had no other way of raising the necessary cash, so it ceased operations and folded on 11 March, ending its 28-year affiliation with the Association. =Mordialloc= After Round 4, Mordialloc met to decide whether to stay in the Association or not. The club was performing very poorly on the field, having lost its three games by a combined 428 points ‚Äì it struggled to recruit quality players, which it blamed on its proximity to the more successful Sandringham and Frankston and the uncertainty generated by the FORT review. Additionally, the immediate future of Division 2 was looking weaker than ever, as Brook Andersen had predicted to the media in late March that he expected the Association to have reduced to 14 teams in one division by 1989. The club was not in any immediate financial trouble, but it was concerned that a full year of continued uncompetitive performances in the uncertain Division 2 environment could cause financial trouble which would force the club to fold. As such, on 5 May, the club opted to withdraw immediately from the Association, ending an affiliation which had lasted just over thirty years. The following week, the club began playing in the South East Suburban Football League, where it believed it had greater long-term viability; and as of 2017, it is indeed still competing in the league's successor, the Southern Football League. =Administrative structure= In March, one of the FORT review's key recommendations was formally endorsed when the structure of the Association's Board of Management was changed; now, instead of being composed of delegates representing each of the clubs, a six- man independent board was elected at the beginning of the year. Under the new structure, which existed until 1993, the independent Board of Management had the power to make decisions on behalf of the Association; and, a separate Board of Directors, comprising one member from each club, was established and had the power to veto any Board of Management decision if it obtained a three- quarters majority in favour of doing so. The change brought an end to the club-based administrative model under which the Association had operated for 111 years since its establishment in 1877. Division 1 The Division 1 home- and-away season was played over eighteen rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system. The finals were played at the North Port Oval and the Grand Final was played at Windy Hill. =Ladder= =Finals= =Awards= *The leading goalkicker for the season was Jamie Shaw (Preston), who kicked 99 goals during the home-and-away season and 105 goals overall. *The J. J. Liston Trophy was won jointly by Brett McTaggart (Williamstown) and Gary Sheldon (Coburg), who both polled 19 votes. Barry Round (Williamstown) finished third with 18 votes. *Springvale won the seconds premiership. Springvale 12.15 (87) defeated Coburg 11.18 (84) in the Grand Final, held on Sunday 18 September. Division 2 The Division 2 fixture was originally drawn up with eight teams over eighteen rounds, including both Waverley and Mordialloc. Following Waverley's departure, the fixture was unchanged except that Waverley's opponent was scheduled for a bye each week. After Mordialloc's departure, the Association expunged Mordialloc's three games from the record entirely; the rest of the season's fixture was re-drawn to ensure each team played a total of eighteen games. The top four of the six remaining teams then contested the finals under the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system. The semi-finals and preliminary final were played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team in the match; the Grand Final was played at Windy Hill. =Ladder= =Finals= =Awards= *The leading goalkicker for Division 2 for the fourth consecutive year was Rino Pretto (Oakleigh), who kicked 91 goals for the season. *The J. Field Medal was won by Stephen Sells (Werribee), who polled 23 votes. Sells finished ahead of Peter Lindsay (Dandenong), who was second, and Michael Owen (Oakleigh), who was third. *Werribee won the Seconds premiership for the second consecutive season. Werribee 17.23 (125) defeated Camberwell 9.13 (67) in the Grand Final, played on Sunday 18 September. Notable events =Interleague matches= The Association competed in the second division of the 1988 Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival, held from 2 March to 5 March. The carnival was played under state of origin rules, so the Association was given permission to play up to five players from the VFL, SANFL or WAFL who began their senior careers in the Association, in addition to any currently-listed Association players regardless of their origin. It was the first time the Association had played representative games under origin rules. Barry Round (Williamstown) captained the Association team. The Association finished in second place after being defeated by Northern Territory in the Grand Final. Terry Wallace (, formerly of Camberwell) won the Dolphin Medal as the best player in Division 2 during the carnival, and he was the sole Association player selected in the All-Australian team. The Association then played two stand-alone interstate games, both under non- origin rules. The first was against Tasmania in Hobart. The second was against the West Australian Football League in Perth, and was played as a curtain- raiser to a state-of-origin match between Western Australia (which was composed of VFL and WAFL players of Western Australian origin) and Victoria. The VFA team also played a match against the Victorian Amateur Football Association on the evening of Wednesday 1 June at Skinner Reserve. This was not an official representative match, as both associations treated it as a practice match for their other representative fixtures. The VFA won the practice match by three goals. =Scheduling and television= After having televised Association finals matches in 1987, and having lost the rights to broadcast League football to the Seven Network during the off-season, the ABC substantially increased its Association coverage to broadcast the match of the round on a near-weekly basis throughout the 1988 season. It was the first time the Association had received weekly television coverage since 1981. As part of the arrangement, all of the televised matches were played on Saturdays instead of Sundays; and, the majority of the games were staged at North Port Oval, regardless of whether or not Port Melbourne was involved in the match ‚Äì although some other grounds, including Preston City Oval, Coburg City Oval and Frankston Park were used occasionally. The central ground arrangement was not popular with all clubs: Sandringham complained after its 16 April match against Brunswick that it lost $8,000 in takings as a result of playing its home game in front of 500 spectators at Port Melbourne, when it could have attracted 5,000 at Beach Oval. This arrangement extended to the first three weeks of the Division 1 finals, which were all played on Saturdays at North Port Oval after many years of having been played on Sundays at Junction Oval. The Division 1 Grand Final was also televised, but the deal with the ABC allowed the game to be played on Sunday, and did not require it to be played at Port Melbourne. The Association initially confirmed that Junction Oval would continue to serve as the Grand Final venue, but these plans were abandoned in July when the venue's ageing grandstands were declared a fire hazard by the MFB. Over the following six weeks, the Association negotiated with a number of councils to find a new Grand Final venue. Its first choice venue was Princes Park, and while it had the support of ground management, approval could not be gained from the Melbourne City Council to play on Sunday. Its second choice, Victoria Park, was likewise unable to gain approval for Sunday football from the Collingwood Council. The ground management at Western Oval, Footscray, was willing and able to host the entire finals series including a Sunday Grand Final, but the ABC television deal required the first three finals to be played at Port Melbourne, and Footscray was unwilling to host just the Grand Final. Eventually, on 19 August, the Association confirmed Windy Hill as the Grand Final venue, with the support of both the ground management and the Essendon Council for Sunday football. The Division 2 Grand Final continued to be played as a curtain-raiser to the Division 1 Grand Final, but the other three Division 2 finals matches were played as stand- alone games on Sundays. Rather than secure a central venue, these matches were played at the home ground of the higher-placed team. Other novel scheduling options were trialled to overcome the fact that the VFL was now playing nine Sunday home-and-away matches in Victoria during the season. This included: *Geelong West utilised newly installed lights at the Western Oval, Geelong to play a Saturday night match against Sunshine on 16 July, then a Friday night game against Camberwell on 22 July. They were the Association's first night premiership matches since 1958. Geelong West had planned to play all of its remaining home games on Saturday nights, but none of its other opponents would agree to do so. *A senior Association match was played as a curtain-raiser to a League senior match. Western suburban clubs Werribee and Sunshine played a match at the Western Oval, Footscray as a curtain-raiser to the League match between and Brisbane on Sunday 31 July; the curtain-raiser timeslot was usually filled by a VFL reserves game, but was available on this day because Brisbane did not field a reserves team. =Jamie Shaw state game controversy= In the lead-up to the Association's representative match against the WAFL on Tuesday 5 July, the Association announced that players in the representative team would be ineligible to play in their clubs' premiership matches on the weekend of 2‚Äì3 July. The board passed a resolution on 20 June stating that if a representative player played in that premiership game, he would be suspended for four weeks, and the club would be fined and stripped of any premiership points earned in the game; and, any players in the team who made themselves unavailable for selection would also be ineligible for their matches on 2‚Äì3 July, to guard against clubs intentionally making their star players unavailable to avoid losing them for the match. In the lead-up to the game, two players who were considered likely selections declared themselves unavailable, and both were made ineligible for the games on 2‚Äì3 June: these players were Jim McAllester (Brunswick), who was unable to secure time off work, and Jamie Shaw (Preston), who was unable to travel as he was caring for his seriously ill mother. In an act of defiance, Preston fielded Shaw anyway; he kicked eight goals, and Preston defeated eventual minor premiers Coburg by 16 points; Preston 19.8 (122) d. Coburg 15.16 (106). The Association decided not to suspend Shaw himself, but awarded the game to Coburg and fined Preston $500. Preston took the Association to court, seeking to have the original result of the game reinstated; and, in a decision handed down in the week before the finals, the courts found in Preston's favour and reinstated the win. Mr Justice Ormiston found that the Association's Board did not have the authority under its constitution to pass a resolution to impose bans on players for missing representative games; and, that because Shaw had lodged an affidavit declaring himself unavailable before Association selectors had formally selected the final team, the Association could not prove that Shaw would have been selected, and therefore could not demonstrate that the provisions within the 20 June resolution could be applied to him. Also considered was the double standard that Tony Pastore, who was not in the Association team but travelled to Perth as an emergency, had been allowed to play for Williamstown on the 2‚Äì3 July weekend. The finding was damaging to the credibility of the Association's new independent Board of Management. As a result of the court's decision, Preston moved from third to second on the ladder, relegating Williamstown from second to third, and forcing the Seagulls to play in the first semi-final three days later. =Other notable events= *Three new rules were introduced into the Association shortly before the start of the season, one week after the same three rules were introduced in the VFL. These were: **The length of the 15-metre penalty for wasting an opponent's time after he takes a mark was increased to fifty metres. **Players were required to take a kick if awarded a free kick; if the player played on by handpass, the ball would be returned for a ball-up. **The full-back was required to kick the ball over a distance of at least two metres when kicking in after a behind. *The financially struggling Geelong West Football Club, which was relegated at the end of 1987, was offered a $150,000 sponsorship over three years which was contingent upon it being returned to the top division. The Association would not re-promote the club to enable it to accept the sponsorship, forcing the club to turn it down. *On 29 May, Preston led Box Hill by 55 points late in the third quarter; 17.9(111) to 8.8(56). From that point on Box Hill scored 13.3 to Preston 0.4 to win by 22 points; Box Hill 21.11 (137) d. Preston 17.13 (115). *In the Division 2 first semi-final, Sunshine trailed Dandenong by 46 points at half-time, Sunshine 2.5 (17) vs Dandenong 9.9 (63); Sunshine then kicked 13 goals to two in the second half to win by 21 points. *The rules relating to ties in Liston Trophy and Field Medal voting were amended this year to eliminate the countback between two players finishing equal on votes; in previous years, in the event of a tie, the player with more first preferences would be ranked higher. This had an immediate effect, as Brett McTaggart (Williamstown) and Gary Sheldon (Coburg) were joint winners of the Liston Trophy after tying on 19 votes; Sheldon would have won under previous countback rules, having polled five first preference votes to four. *During 1988, the Geelong West Thirds team was composed largely of excess Box Hill Thirds players who could not command a regular place for the Mustangs; they were lent to Geelong West on the condition they be cleared back to Box Hill after the season. As a result, Geelong West's Thirds team was competitive for the first time in several years, after having been completely uncompetitive throughout the 1980s due to its inability to find Geelong-based juniors players willing and able to travel to away games in Melbourne.

Released in India on 22 August 2014, the film is shot in Kanpur city, which faces long power cuts, giving rise to the profession of Loha Singh, a local electricity thief or katiyabaaz in localities like Chaman Ganj. He provides illegal electricity connections to people, while Ritu Maheshwari, MD of KESCo, Kanpur Electricity Supply Company, tries to tackle the issue of rampant electricity theft. The film was premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival 2013 and later won the Best Film in the India Gold Section at the 15th Mumbai Film Festival. At the 61st National Film Awards the film won the ward for Best Investigative Film. Katiyabaaz premiered on American television on Independent Lens - PBS on 3 November 2014.  Plot  Katiyabaaz is a story of Kanpur's electricity crisis, resulting in loadshedding. Power cuts of up to 15 hours a day, cause great trouble to residents and factories alike. This gap in supply and demand becomes the bedrock of local electricity thieves like Loha Singh, who provide illegal power connection to people, by plugging into official supply through live wires. However such free connection causes heavy financial losses to the power supply company, whose MD struggles to fight the menace of power theft, and local fixers. The film follows Loha Singh, an electricity thief, and Ritu Maheshwari an official with Kanpur Electricity Supply Company. Production The film was made on a small budget of and had music by fusion rock band Indian Ocean who composed and sang the song Kanpoora for the film. The film was shot over a period of nearly two years, with a crew of 10-12 people. Instead of staying at hotels, the crew rented a bungalow and furnished it, which was economical. The film's co- director, Fahad Mustafa, originally from Kanpur, researched the subject for six months before he started filming. However, they came across Loha Singh, the \\"katiyabaaz\\" (electricity thief) around whom the film is based, only after the shooting had already started, and another katiyabaaz had backed out in the last moment. Loha Singh, himself was initially apprehensive about allowing himself be filmed, as he thought it to be a sting operation on his work or the crew to be of the Dabangg film series. The rumour about the latter, drew large crowds to filming locations, hampering production. The fact that some of the crew were foreigners also created much curiosity. Gradually Loha Singh and the locals became comfortable with the film crew. The crew shot candid conversations, several individual stories and the crippling effects of electricity crisis in the area on the common man, local industries as well as small business owners. Release After its premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival 2013, the film traveled to various film festivals including the Tribeca Film Festival, the Melbourne International Film Festival, the Motovun Film Festival and the London Raindance Film Festival. The film received backing for commercial released when Phantom Films, co-owned by filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane and Vikas Bahl, with funding from international sources, signed on to present the film. In end July, The film's trailer was released by director-producer Anurag Kashyap in Mumbai. The film was commercially released on 22 August 2014. It had a limited release across 50 screens in cities like Mumbai, Lucknow, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kanpur. Reception The film was very well received by both international and well as national press. The largest German national paper, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung gave Katiyabaaz a fantastic review after its premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival. According to Tom Brook from BBC's Talking Movies, \\"the filmmakers very effectively bring what could be rather dry subject to life\\". Aarti Virani wrote in The New York Times that the film was \\"a jarring glimpse at India‚Äôs rampant energy crisis\\". Abhimanyu Das wrote an extensive article about the film, Creatures of Light and Darkness in the Caravan magazine. Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost called the film a \\"beautifully- shot documentary\\". Leading film critics gave it glowing reviews. Rajeev Masand called it a \\"Slice of Life\\" film. Anupama Chopra referred to it as a \\"sad love letter to Kanpur\\". Mihir Fadnavis reviewed the film for DNA India, where he called it \\"more hilarious, insightful and gorgeous than a feature film\\". Mumbai's leading lifestyle website, Mumbai Boss, called Katiyabaaz a \\"crackling documentary!\\" On 28 August 2014, the Government of Uttar Pradesh exempted the film from entertainment tax, which also directed engineers of state power department to watch the film and \\"draw inspiration to stop illegal connections\\".

History The business started under the name Ricochet Couriers, providing same-day courier services in and around Slough. The business quickly expanded to four offices within the West London area and then commenced servicing contracts in the IT sector. All emergency calls were generally serviced from one major warehouse in the UK and it proved difficult to reach all of the UK from one location within four hours. The business decided to invest in setting up a number of strategic warehouses all over the UK to ensure any major city could be reached within two to four hours from these strategic warehouses. The parts delivered were to engineers servicing the retail and banking sector and as demand increased to facilitate clients within the server and various other sectors, more warehouses and PUDO‚Äôs (Pick up and Drop off centres) were introduced. The business could see that more and more of the critical parts required were becoming modular and could be swapped by smart technicians and thus decided to invest in offering technicians who could carry out the actual fix and exchange of the part at the customers‚Äô location. In 2002, Ricochet Couriers acquired Burnham LogisticsFulfilment & E-logistics magazine interview with Rico Logistics, Summer 2008 who provided peripheral technicians (200) plus moves and installations of IT equipment. Field Stock Locations (FSL) and In-Night parts distribution for service engineers in the IT industry. Ricochet developed the technical swap model rapidly and began using fully trained IT engineers to enhance and support their clients‚Äô requirements. In 2004, Ricochet realised that tracking of parts out bound and return was critical to ensuring an optimum supply chain loop and thus invested in a fully blown IT system ‚Äì called TRACE, that could interface with the clients and track parts at every stage of their movements. Interfaces were developed for major pan European clients and allowed for efficiencies and greater productivity. In addition, a network of over 250 Pick-Up and Drop Off (PUDO) locations were set up to allow clients‚Äô engineers to collect parts and drop off parts from a location close to their home or area in which they worked.

Between the mid-1920s and the early 1940s she achieved both popularity and critical success. In 1936 Prints magazine named her one of the best living printmakers and a critic said she was one of the foremost lithographers in the United States. Early life and education 1898 San Francisco Sketch Club Catalog cover by Mabel (Williamson) Dwight Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, she moved to San Francisco, California in the late 1880s. There, she studied with Arthur Mathews at the Mark Hopkins Institute. She joined and became a director of the Sketch Club, the city's artists' association for women and the club's tenth semi-annual exhibition in 1897 gave her the first opportunity to show her work to the public. In her mid-20s she traveled extensively, visiting Egypt, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), India, and Java (now Indonesia). Returning to the United States in 1903, she settled in Greenwich Village, then known as a locale friendly to artists. For the next few years she tried to establish herself as a professional artist and was listed in the American Art Annual from 1903 to 1906 as a painter and illustrator. She met and in 1906 married fellow artist Eugene Patrick Higgins. Although they were both socialists, and hence espoused equality of the sexes, Dwight fell into the role of help mate and stopped painting.She later wrote: \\"domesticity followed and for many years (my) career as an artist was in abeyance.\\" (Robinson, Susan Barnes, and John Pirog. Mabel Dwight: A Catalogue Raisonn√© of the Lithographs. Washington, D.C., Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997) In 1917 Dwight and Higgins separated and she resumed her painting career. The following year she joined Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's newly founded Whitney Studio ClubThe Whitney Studio Club was an organization for promoting modern American art that evolved into the present-day Whitney Museum of American Art and became secretary to Juliana Force, the club's director. Over the next few years she attended life drawing sessions and showed at annual exhibitions that the club held. Although she made some experiments with etching, she worked mainly in watercolor at this time.

Having been exposed to lithography when studying in San Francisco,Her instructor, Arthur Mathews, had learned lithography while working as a designer and illustrator in a litho shop. (A to Z of American Women in the Visual Arts, Infobase Publishing, 2002, pp. 56‚Äì57) she met the New York art print dealer Carl Zigrosser some time before the outbreak of World War I, and, with his encouragement, traveled to Paris, France in 1926 to spend two years studying lithographic art in the Atelier Duchatel.The Atelier Duchatel was a studio run by the widow of French lithographic printer √âdouard Duchatel. (Paul Anbinder, ed., An American Collection: Works from the Amon Carter Museum, Hudson Hills, 2001, p. 230) While in Paris, she made surreptitious sketches showing people engaged in everyday activities‚Äîwatching puppet shows, sitting in caf√©s, worshiping at church, browsing stalls by the Seine‚Äîand worked up the sketches into lithographic prints. In their posture and gestures as much as their facial expressions, the characters she depicted show their personalities and individual foibles. This aspect of Dwight's mature style is clearly seen in Boulevard des Italiens of 1927 where the temperament of each person is made distinct. From her earliest efforts onward, her pictures were artful celebrations of ordinariness. In them, Dwight's empathy for her subjects is apparent as well as her droll sense of humor. When she gave her monkey house print the title The Brothers she was not making fun of the apes or the workmen spectators, but rather the priest who, shown turning his back on the scene, makes the picture into a gentle Darwinian joke. While most of her prints were black and white, a few, including Guignolette (1927), were enhanced by muted colors. As she pulled them off the lithographic stone, she would send proofs to Zigrosser for his critical review and after she returned to New York in 1927 he put her in touch with printmaker George Miller, whose expertise was the equal of the master printers at the Atelier Duchatel. Within a year of her return, the Paris prints and the ones she began to make in New York established her as one of America's best lithographic artists. In 1928, Zigrosser gave her a first solo exhibit at the Weyhe Gallery. Reviewing this show, a critic acknowledged Dwight's growing reputation, noted that her prints showed aspects of the humor of city life, and praised her for a style that was \\"quite without manner or a self-imposed technique.\\" She would later say that she chose print making so as to make her art available to a broad audience at reasonable cost. In 1929 the Print Club of Philadelphia gave her a retrospective solo exhibition including all the prints she had made in Paris, Chartres, and New York through the end of the previous year. In a lengthy review, Margaret Breuning of the New York Evening Post wrote that the show contained \\"gay happy lithographs accomplished by a true artist, whose affectionate pulse is nicely attuned to the heart beats of those she so faithfully depicts.\\" Dwight liked to portray New Yorkers in public places and frequently worked in theaters. She would conceal her pencil and paper behind a large handbag in order to sketch performers and members of the audience. In 1928 she worked in Minsky's National Winter Garden, a burlesque theater in the Lower East Side to make a series of lithographs and also illustrated an article, \\"The Last Days of Burlesque\\", for the August 1929, issue of Vanity Fair. She made drawings of circus performances for an article in the April 1930 issue of Fortune magazine and two years later was given a second solo exhibition at the Weyhe Gallery. In the latter she showed watercolors and drawings as well as lithographic prints. Her subjects were dark ones‚Äîold, decrepit houses on Staten Island, a stalking black cat, and graveyards in New Mexico and Paris‚Äîas well as the more festive scenes of parties and circus acts for which she had become known. Her lithograph Night Work (1931) is literally dark, but the composition is pleasing rather than jarring and the tone is rather serene than despairing. She maintained radical political views throughout her adult life. During the 1930s, she joined one of the Marxist John Reed Clubs and supported another Popular Front organization, the American Artists' Congress. Nonetheless, not wishing to become a propagandist and fearing she would lose sales that she needed to support her precarious existence, she rarely produced works of an overtly political character.The anti-fascist, Danse Macabre (1933) and anti-capitalist Merchants of Death (1935) are her two best-known political works. (Robinson, Susan Barnes, and John Pirog. Mabel Dwight: A Catalogue Raisonn√© of the Lithographs. Washington, D.C., Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997) Dwight's Group in Central Park (1934) suggests the hardships endured by many citizens in the heart of the Depression, but its tone is gentle and the feeling conveyed to the viewer is an optimistic one. An untitled watercolor of 1936 showing an African American man and two women conversing while seated on a park bench is charming and lyrical; nothing about it suggests Depression conditions or the injustices racial discrimination. In 1936 she was listed as one of America's best printmakers in Prints magazine and that year produced what would become her most popular print, Queer Fish, which was one of a group of pictures made at the New York Aquarium in Battery Park. That same year a newspaper critic called her \\"a foremost American lithographer\\" who had \\"climbed to the top of a difficult and highly competitive field.\\" When, during the second half of the 1930s, Dwight made lithographs for federal arts projects,Between 1935 and 1939, she worked first for the Public Works of Art Project and then for the Federal Art Project of the Works Projects Administration. she retained her wry sense of humor and continued to show New Yorkers at their leisure. Mulberry Street Marionettes (1936), produced for the Federal Art Project, could just as well have been made in the prosperous years a decade earlier. While continuing to show her light touch in these years, her subjects also included wind-swept landscapes, laborers hard at work, and lonely and disconsolate individuals. Although not much is known about her personal life, Dwight seems increasingly to have suffered from poverty, deafness, and poor health. She retained nonetheless her sense of proportion and ability to empathize with others. In 1936 she wrote that \\"satire may play lightly with man's foibles‚Äîin kindly, ironic vein portray him not as such a bad fellow after all, but at times a rather absurd one.\\" The artist, she said, may view \\"people with sympathy and translate them into art just as tragic and humorous as he may wish.\\" This kindly attitude shows plainly in works of the time, including Silence (1939), which, like her caf√© scene of 1927 (Boulevard des Italiens), uses posture, gesture, and expression to show individual characteristics of each person who is depicted. In 1938 Weyhe Gallery gave her a retrospective solo exhibition of 93 works that proved to be very successful. Called \\"A Decade of Lithography\\", it covered the years from 1927 through 1937. Citing her \\"rich, healthy human commentary\\", a reviewer said the show revealed the \\"love of life in its sprawling actuality\\" that was the main force of her art. Included in the show were cityscapes like Ninth Avenue Church (1936) and a dramatic landscape with an improbable couple (Cliffs by the Sea, 1937), which give an idea of the range Dwight's artistic skill. Dwight liked to include cats in her work and Backyard (1938) puts one as the main focus of the composition. She was also an excellent portraitist as her self-portrait (1932) and Boy Resting (1939) make plain. Later life and work The last years of the 1930s proved to be the high point of Dwight's career. In the early 1940s her work continued to appear in New York group shows, including the Weyhe Gallery (1941, 1942), a collaborative dealers' show at the American Fine Arts Building (1941), and National Academy of Design (1942), but after 1942 there were practically none.This list of shows comes from articles appearing in the New York Times, 1940 to 1946, passim. Dwight was reported to appear in only one group show after 1942: at Grand Central Galleries in 1946. Although she was less productive, her Summer Evening of 1945 is a rare late work showing that she retained her ability to make excellent art at the age of 70. During the decade after 1945, however, Dwight's health and her financial condition continued to deteriorate. During her final years she was confined to a nursing home and, in 1955, suffered a stroke and died. Family and personal life Although she gave various dates of birth during the course of her adult life, Dwight was probably born on January 31, 1875 and named Mabel Jacque Williamson.For example, she gave her birth date as January 29, 1877, on returning to New York in 1909 (\\"New York, New York Passenger and Crew Lists, 1909, 1925-1957\\", index and images, FamilySearch, accessed 21 Aug 2014). Most sources say she was born January 31, 1875. She was the only child of Paul Huston Williamson (born ca. 1837) and his wife Adelaide, or Ada (born ca. 1845) Jacque . Paul Williamson owned a farm near Cincinnati in Colerain Township, Hamilton County, Ohio. While Dwight was still a child, the family moved to New Orleans and Dwight was put in a convent school in Carrollton, outside the city. A few years later the Williamsons moved to San Francisco where Dwight was privately tutored while attending high school. In the mid-1890s Dwight completed her secondary education and began studies under Arthur Mathews at the Mark Hopkins Institute. At the turn of the century she embarked on extensive travels to the Middle- and Far East. On returning in 1903 she settled with her parents in Greenwich Village, which was at that time a congenial neighborhood for young people who had both ambitions in the arts and progressive ideals. While at the Mark Hopkins Institute she had become attached to the cause of socialism and she would retain radical social beliefs for the rest of her life. Later in life she said that discovering radical politics was like \\"getting religion\\" and, judging from the subjects of some of her prints, it appears she was not an atheist, but retained an attachment to Christianity in general and Roman Catholicism in particular. Not long after settling in Greenwich Village she met Eugene Patrick Higgins, a young artist who shared her political beliefs. On October 3, 1906, the two were married in a religious ceremony. Although they had no children, Dwight became housewife and helpmate. Upon her marrying, she later wrote, \\"domesticity followed and for many years (my) career as an artist was in abeyance.\\" The two separated in 1917 and divorced in 1921. While they were separated, Dwight's friend Carl Zigrosser introduced her to Roderick Seidenberg, an architectural draftsman. He was, like Higgins, a militant socialist, but where Higgins was a year older than Dwight, Seidenberg was 14 years younger. Their relationship grew close and for some years they lived together. They became estranged after Seidenberg fell in love with, and then married another woman. Dwight and Seidenberg would become reconciled when Dwight suffered periods of illness during the 1930s and 1940s and Seidenberg and his wife Catherine took her into their home in order to care for her. Following her divorce from Higgins she neither kept her married nor resumed her maiden name, but rather, for reasons she did not disclose, chose the surname Dwight. Her reticence about her name was not unusual in her. Even though she wrote an (unpublished) autobiography, much about her life is unknown. Her ability to hear is an example. Most biographic summaries do not mention a hearing disability. Some say she was deaf, but do not specify the degree of hearing loss. One source says she was partly deaf and another says she was profoundly so. In 1929 or 1930 she traveled to New Mexico and this appears to have been the first and only time she traveled outside the Mid- Atlantic states after her return from Paris. At about this time she moved from Greenwich Village to Staten Island and some time later moved to Pipersville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. After Dwight turned 65 in 1940, her deafness, chronic asthma, and poverty worsened. Although she continued to work, her output dwindled, and she was confined to nursing homes in the period before her death following a stroke in 1955.

It is published independently but with the support of the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference. First published on 16 October 1920, it has appeared uninterrupted every week since. The current editor-in-chief is G√ºnther Simmermacher. Ownership The Southern Cross is published by the Catholic Newspaper & Publishing Company Ltd., which is based in Cape Town. The newspaper is financed by sales and advertising, as well as revenue from sales of books published under The Southern Cross Books imprint, international pilgrimages, and financial support from its Associates‚Äô Campaign. Publication and circulation Publication day is Thursday, but most issues are sold in churches at weekend Masses. The Southern Cross is also available by postal subscription and as a digital edition. It is not sold in retail outlets other than Catholic bookshops. Since 2012, circulation has fluctuated between around 9,000 and 11,000. Editorial The editor of The Southern Cross has full editorial independence, confirmed in 2009 by the President of the Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference, Archbishop Buti Tlhagale of the Archdiocese of Johannesburg. Global reception The Southern Cross editorials have frequently made worldwide news. In 2001 an editorial that argued that the Catholic Church should allow the use of condoms in marriages in which only one spouse is infected with HIV was picked up by the BBC World News,‚ÄúPleas to Church on condoms‚Äù, BBC, 17 July 2001. Voice of America, Time, and other publications. In 2011, an editorial that criticised the presence of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe at the beatification of Pope John Paul II in the Vatican was reported on widely, especially in the international Catholic press.‚ÄúCatholic paper: Dictator's Vatican welcome undermined Zimbabwe bishops‚Äù Catholic News Service, 19 May 2011 In 2014, an editorial calling on the Catholic Church to condemn controversial anti-gay laws in Nigeria and the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014 was picked up by the news service of the Vatican's missionary dicastery, the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. A Vatican analyst for the Italian newspaper La Stampa suggested that by picking up The Southern Cross‚Äô critical editorial but not a congratulatory statement by the president of the Nigerian bishop's conference, the Vatican had voiced its disapproval of the draconian policies which are tantamount to persecution, and called on African bishops to \\"speak out ... against the discriminatory legislation and violence directed at homosexuals, many of whom are fellow Catholics.\\" History The Southern Cross first published 16 October 1920 The idea for a national Catholic newspaper was first raised by two priests, Fr James Kelly of Cape Town and Fr L Sormany OMI of Durban. When the bishops of South Africa met in Durban in 1919, they decided to establish such a newspaper under the name The Crusader. Fr Kelly was appointed its first editor, and he proposed the name \\"The Southern Cross\\", after a defunct Anglican newspaper. The Catholic Newspaper & Publishing Company Ltd was floated in June 1920, with the bishops, as founders, holding 51% of the shares. The Southern Cross hit the churches on Sunday, 17 October 1920 (a day after the cover date), with a circulation of 3,500 and cover price of 3 pence. Within a few weeks, circulation had risen to 6,000. In the 1930s circulation had grown in excess of 10,000, but World War II brought circulation down again. Between 1953 and 1963, circulation increased by 57%. In 1956 it stood at 15,000, in 1964 at 18,500. That was in the midst of the Second Vatican Council. After that circulation started to drop, as it did at many other newspapers. In 1970 it was still around 16,000, two years later 14,000, and in 1974 it had decreased to 12,600. By the mid-1990s, circulation dipped to below 10,000 for the first time since the war. During the 2000s it stood steadily at above 11,000. During Vatican II, Archbishop Denis Hurley of Durban, a leading participant in the council, regularly wrote anonymous but well-informed articles for The Southern Cross. In 2001 he wrote a 17-part series of the council which formed the basis for a book of memoirs by Archbishop Hurley. Books In the 1930s the Catholic Newspaper & Publishing Company opened a Catholic bookshop in Cape Town, in part to sell its own titles. The company sold the bookshop to the Schoenstatt Institute in 1982. Since then The Southern Cross has sporadically published, including I Call You Companions by Fr Nicholas King SJ (1995, in association with the Catholic Bookshop in Cape Town), The Holy Land Trek by G√ºnther Simmermacher (2010),\\"The Holy Land Trek\\" a guide to the film The Passion of the Christ, and two anthologies by long- standing columnists, Any Major Sunday by Owen Williams and Moerdyk Files by Chris Moerdyk.\\"Southern Cross Books\\" Editors Until 1995 all editors were priests, assisted by lay editors (later named managing editors), who were professional journalists. With the two-stint editorship of Owen McCann, first in the 1940s and again between 1986 and 1991, The Southern Cross has been edited by a future and an existing cardinal. Michael Shackleton, a former priest who was appointed in 1995, was the first editor not to belong to the clergy.

Plot In 1958, Johann Radmann is a young and idealistic public prosecutor who takes an interest in the case of Charles Schulz, a former Auschwitz extermination camp commander who is now teaching at a school in Frankfurt am Main. Radmann is determined to bring Schulz to justice, but finds his efforts frustrated because of the many former Nazis who are serving in government and looking out for one another. Radmann's boss, the prosecutor-general Fritz Bauer, puts him in charge of investigating former workers at the Auschwitz camp. The U.S. occupation forces give him access to their files, and he discovers there were 8,000 workers. He goes after Josef Mengele, who lives in Argentina, but flies back to West Germany to visit his family. After the authorities block Radmann's attempt to issue an arrest warrant, his boss warns him off and orders him to concentrate on lower- profile suspects. The department invites Mossad agents to visit, and shares its information with them. As a result, Adolf Eichmann is kidnapped and spirited away to Israel where he is tried, convicted and executed for his crimes. Having pulled off this coup, Israel declines to pursue Mengele. Meanwhile, Radmann allows himself to be seduced by Marlene, a seamstress who, benefiting from Radmann's connections, starts a business as a dress designer. Radmann reaches a crisis when he discovers his own father was in the Nazi party. When he tells Marlene that her father too was in the party, she ends their relationship. By the end of the film, however, there is a chance she will have him back. He resigns his official post and goes to work for an industrialist. There he is again confronted with the dilemma: do what is right; or do what the system requires you to do? When he finds this means working with a colleague who had defended a former Nazi he was investigating, Radmann walks out. His idealism has suffered from hard encounters with the real world; at every turn, the \\"system\\" wants compliance, but he wants justice. He comes to understand that the only thing that can ease the horror is not justice, but attention to the lives and stories of those who suffered. Growing out of the simplistic right/wrong moralizing, he comes to understand life as more complex, and seeks to repair all the damage, large and small, he inflicted in his zeal. After going to Auschwitz to say kaddish, the Jewish mourning prayer, for a friend's two daughters who were killed there, he goes back to work for the West German state prosecutor. The film ends with the opening of the trial of several hundred former Auschwitz workers.

Later Uno carried out a joint study with Chihiro Hosoya, Hiroharu Seki, Sadako Ogata and Takashi Saito. Since the analysis of the International Military Tribute for the Far East was different from facts, Uno and the team re-identified and re-examined facts to scrutinize experimental study on the process to the Pacific War. Uno and the team conducted a study on the Pacific War based on the public documents just disclosed in those days. Uno and the team discovered unexplored data and detailed data including even fliers related to China. They took social-scientific methods by examining the data and discussing issues in interpretations from diverse perspectives. As a result, the ‚Äú Japan Association of International Relations published an eminent study, ‚ÄúThe way to the Pacific War‚Äù (The Asahi Shimbun Company, 1962‚Äì1963) =Study on the History of Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong= From the mid-1950s to the 1960s Uno also discovered data on Chinese Communist Party and edited vast volume of a collection of historical materials of the Chinese Communist Party in over 10 volumes together with the Japan Institute of International Affairs. At the same time while there is a question about what other possibilities were cut off from the official history of Chinese Communist Party by scholars of Chinese studies, Uno came up with a unique interpretation of the history of Chinese Communist Party by positioning it in the entire Chinese history. And as for Mao Zedong, Uno explored a new history of Chinese Communist Party by analyzing how the original data on Mao Zedong in those days was compiled in the context of the domestic environment and of international environment. Uno said the study on the history of Chinese Communist Party and the study on Mao Zedong were the most important case studies at a turning point in his own career. =Endogenous Development= In the wake of his participation in the experimental study on pollution issues of the Minamata disease along with Kazuko Tsurumi and other scholars, he embarked on a study on the Endogenous Development in the late 1960s. While conventional experimental study was based on written data, Uno thoroughly examined facts and substances before they were written for documentation and he discovered a direction, which he believes ‚Äúshould be thoroughly checked because ‚Äútradition does not exist as is; purely based on an interpretation a tradition is discovered and confirmed as a tradition and is given a meaning. The basis of the tradition per se should be thoroughly confirmed to check how it exists in people‚Äôs actual life and society.‚Äù In this way Uno has studied the process of a tradition evolving via extraneous stimulus and how heavier extraneous gravity becomes as the endogenous development [1]. Through this practice a sociological approach has been added to the conventional direction of international political science. At its heart Endogenous Development implies objections to modern high-growth economy or nation-centered politics by nature. ‚ÄúThe leaders of ‚ÄúEndogenous Development should clearly indicate the values and scope they are aiming at. While Modernization Theory advocates ‚Äòneutrality of values‚Äô, Endogenous Development demonstrates values explicitly\\" (Due to this nature such a bold problem presentation as ‚ÄúGenealogy of Endogenous Development ‚Äù by Kazuko Tsurumi was made). This Endogenous Development later became related with experimental study by both Japan and China for a decade, by Fei Xiaotong a founder of Chinese social science and Kazuko Tsurumi‚Äôs friend, along with Zhu Tonghua, the head of Study on Jiangsu Province, and the founder of Chinese social study; and a problem presentation was made as ‚ÄúEndogenous Development and Extraneous Development ‚Äî Crossover in Modern China‚Äù. =The way to Study on Northeast Asia= 2000: As its first president Uno founded a 4-year university, University of Shimane. Along with the opening of the post graduate school doctor‚Äôs course, he created a new academic field, Northeast Asian Study. At that time he introduced a new basic concept or theory, Mutual Inspiration Theory he has developed for Endogenous Development, i.e. ‚Äúwhile each factor is developing as a different factor, there is a sort of universal connections among them. While each one is developing as a different factor he wonders if new universal factors will be created when their mutual relations bump into each other. Vol.1 of the Series of the Northeast Asian Study Creation: ‚Äúthe Way to Northeast Asian Study‚Äù published in 2013 clearly explains the importance of ‚Äúpathos,‚Äù which scientism conventionally tried to rule out or treated as something to be resolved by rational methods, and places importance on it as a basic standard of regional research. He emphasized ‚Äúpathos‚Äù as if to balance out with scientism and clearly states it is required to prioritize the mutual relation between reason and pathos. Furthermore, Uno intentionally has not made any clear definition of the Northeast Asian region but presented a dynamic regional concept that as a result of the recent globalization a region changes by proactive mindsets of people living there. And an important operation for regional research is to correctly define reason and paths as the attributes of some region and to define their proper mutual relation. Uno is proposing multi-layered paradigm, i.e., to assign intelligence to handle the important operation for regional research. In regional research in the era of globalization, Northeast Asia Study indicates a model for proper multi-layered methods from now on (Kenichiro Hirano: ‚ÄúChina 21 Vol.40.‚Äù a book review P253-P260) References External links * Website for graduates of Uno Seminar, Seikei University, who studied the History of Oriental Political Science and Diplomacy, and International Relations there; the activities continue even after graduation, mainly by a lifelong study group composed of voluntary alumni and alumnae Category:Japanese political scientists Category:1930 births Category:2017 deaths Category:University of Tokyo alumni ","title":"Shigeaki Uno"},{"id":"43689474","text":"A coolant pump is a type of pump used to recirculate a coolant, generally a liquid, that is used to transfer heat away from an engine or other device that generates heat as a byproduct of producing energy.

The organization describes its mission as to \\"develop and disseminate new ideas that foster greater economic choice and individual responsibility\\". Its message is communicated through books, articles, interviews, speeches, op-eds, and through the institute's quarterly publication City Journal. In general, the Manhattan Institute promotes free-market economics. History  =Foundation years (1977‚Äì1980)= The International Center for Economic Policy Studies (ICEPS) was founded by Antony Fisher and William J. Casey in 1978. ICEPS changed its name to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research in 1981. The institute's first president was Jeffrey Bell, who was succeeded in 1980 by William H. Hammett, who served until 1995. In 1980, the institute (then ICEPS) began publishing its Manhattan Report on Economic Policy, a monthly periodical featuring briefs by leading market economists and analysts. David Asman was the first editor of the reports and continued the post until 1982. =Reagan- era activity (1981‚Äì1989)= The institute produced a number of highly acclaimed books during the early 1980s that introduced the concepts of supply- side economics and privatization of services to a wider audience. In 1981, Institute program director George Gilder published Wealth and Poverty, a best- selling book often referred to as the \\"Bible of the Reagan administration\\".Robert Asen, Visions of Poverty: Welfare Policy and Political Imagination (2012), p. 76. A New York Times reviewer called it \\"A Guide to Capitalism\\", arguing that it offered \\"a creed for capitalism worthy of intelligent people.\\" The book was a New York Times bestseller and eventually sold over a million copies. Other books on supply-side economics published during this era include The Economy in Mind (1982), by Warren Brookes, and The Supply-Side Solution (1983), edited by Timothy Roth and Bruce Bartlett. The latter declares in its first sentence: \\"As accepted economic theory, orthodox Keynesian economics is dead\\".Timothy Roth and Bruce Bartlett, eds., The Supply-Side Solution (1983), p. 1. The institute sponsored a documentary film, \\"Good Intentions\\", in 1983 based on the book, The State Against Blacks, by George Mason University professor Walter E. Williams. The film debuted on New York area public TV station WNET on June 27, and presented Williams's thesis that government policies have done more to impede than to encourage black economic progress. In 1982, the institute paid $30,000 to a then little-known social scientist named Charles Murray to write what became his landmark book, Losing Ground, published in 1984. The book paved the way for federal welfare reform in 1996. =The influence of City Journal (1990‚Äì2000)= In 1990, the institute founded its quarterly magazine, City Journal, in response to perceptions that New York City was in a downward spiral, and broader anxieties about the perceived decay of American cities generally. City Journal has been called \\"arguably America's best magazine\\" by economist Thomas Sowell, and \\"the great Fool Killer in the arena of urban policy\\" by novelist Tom Wolfe,Myron Magnet, The Millennial City: A New Urban Paradigm for 21st-century America (2000). City Journal has articulated and promoted ideas that have been credited with driving the urban renaissance of recent decades. The magazine was edited by Peter Salins and then Fred Siegel in the early 1990s. Fortune editor Myron Magnet was hired by the institute as editor of the magazine in 1994, where he served until 2007. , the magazine is edited by Brian C. Anderson. Lawrence J. Mone was named president of the institute in 1995, taking over from William H. Hammett. He joined the institute in 1982, serving as a public policy specialist, program director and vice president before being named the institute's fourth president. The institute established the Center for Education Innovation (CEI) in 1989, an organization devoted to transforming public education by shifting accountability from bureaucracies to schools as a means of creating public school choice. The CEI helped create a number of small, alternative public schools in New York and advised New York Governor George Pataki in crafting the state's landmark charter school law in 1998, which authorized the creation of autonomous public schools. The institute thereafter continued to work closely with school officials to promote the idea of school choice nationwide. Senior fellow Peter W. Huber published his first book, Liability: The Legal Revolution and Its Consequences, in 1990. The book described the transformation of modern tort law since the 1960s, and shows how the dramatic increase in liability lawsuits has had an adverse effect on safety, health, the cost of insurance, and individual rights. Later on, Walter Olson's work at the institute culminated in the highly influential book, The Litigation Explosion, in 1992. The book was one of the most widely discussed general-audience books on law of its time, and led the Washington Post to dub him \\"intellectual guru of tort reform\\". The institute enjoyed close ties to the administration of New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who had become a regular at Institute luncheons and lectures after his failed mayoral campaign in 1989. Violent crime in New York City had recently hit a peak of 2,245 homicides in 1990. The Spring 1992 Issue of City Journal was devoted to \\"The Quality of Urban Life\\", and featured articles on crime, education, housing, and the serious deterioration of the city's public spaces. The issue caught Giuliani's eye as he prepared to run for mayor again in 1993. The campaign contacted City Journal editor Fred Siegel to develop tutorial sessions for the candidate with experts on education, housing, and crime. Among the policies embraced by his administration was the \\"broken-windows\\" theory of policing, which had already begun to be adopted on some levels by leadership in the NYPD. During the 2000 election, candidate George W. Bush cited Myron Magnet's, The Dream and the Nightmare: The Sixties' Legacy to the Underclass (1993), as having a profound impact on how he conducted his approach to public policy. Bush went on to say \\"The Dream and the Nightmare by Myron Magnet crystallized for me the impact the failed culture of the '60s had on our values and society\\".Joel Spring, Political Agendas for Education (2014), p. 107. = Addressing the modern age of terrorism and social unrest (2001‚Äì2009)= After the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the institute formed the Center for Tactical Counterterrorism (CTCT), later renamed the Center for Policing Terrorism (CPT). The group was created at the request of the NYPD, to provide research into new policing techniques with the goal of retraining officers to become \\"first preventers\\" to future mass-casualty attacks. Led by executive director R.P. Eddy, the CTCT held a conference with highly regarded counterterrorism experts in the world and developed a strategy to transform the NYPD's approach to urban counterterrorism by blending intelligence gathering and analysis with traditional policing. One of the most visible components of this new approach was the overseas liaison program, which placed NYPD officers with police departments in foreign countries for the purposes of intelligence gathering, relationship building, and information sharing. Eddy brought on board Tim Connors, a West Point and Notre Dame Law School graduate, to oversee the day-to-day operations of the CTCT. The CTCT began publishing reports and white papers on intelligence fusion centers, local counterterrorism strategies, and intelligence-led policing. With the research assistance of institute staffers Mark Riebling and Pete Patton, the center produced rapid-response briefings on major terrorist attacks around the world and presented them at weekly meetings with the Counterterrorism Bureau. The institute's counterterrorism strategy also built upon Broken Windows and CompStat policing models by training police in problem-solving techniques, data analysis, and order maintenance. In January 2005, the CTCT cautioned against the construction of a new United Nations structure over the Queens Midtown Tunnel, which would have increased the value of the tunnel as a potential terrorist target. CTCT, and later CPT, continued publishing research until 2008 when it was absorbed into National Consortium for Advanced Policing. In other areas of policy concern, the institute's director of legal policy James R. Copland in 2003 began a long-running series of surveys on the civil litigation industry called Trial Lawyers, Inc. Building on previous work in civil litigation by fellows Olson and Huber, the series aims to survey civil litigation industry, highlight abuses by attorneys, and provide a readable source of information on current and trending practices. Since the 2000s, the institute has added a number of experts in infrastructure and municipal financing. Harvard professor Edward Glaeser and New York Post columnist Nicole Gelinas joined the institute in 2004 and 2005, respectively. =Promoting free-market thinking in modern politics (2009‚Äìpresent)= In 2010, Institute senior fellow Steve Malanga (a former Crain Communications executive editor) published Shakedown: The Continuing Conspiracy Against the American Taxpayer, warning that a self-interested coalition of public-sector unions and government-financed community activists would harm taxpayers. In 2013, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush called Malanga \\"the best thinker on state and local fiscal matters\\". After the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, senior fellow Nicole Gelinas wrote her first book, After the Fall: Saving Capitalism from Wall Street ‚Äî and Washington (Encounter, 2011). In the book, she argues that after over two decades of broken regulation and the federal government's adoption of a \\"too big to fail\\" policy for the largest or most complex financial companies eventually posed an untenable risk to the economy. The institute has also worked closely with other experts in financial policy, including Professor Charles W. Calomiris at Columbia Business School. Calomiris has written critically of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations passed in response to the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis, arguing that the law doubles down on \\"too big to fail\\" and does not prevent the government from subsidizing mortgage risk, which fueled the crisis. In 2011, Edward Glaeser released Triumph of the City, in which he makes an urgent case for the importance and splendor of cities. Healthcare expert Avik Roy joined the institute as a senior fellow in 2011. In that year, Roy's highly acclaimed healthcare policy blog \\"The Apothecary\\", begun in 2009 in response to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was picked up by Forbes and integrated into their website in 2011. Roy's blog went on to become one of the most influential conservative voices on health care policy. In 2014, the institute published Roy's replacement proposal for the Affordable Care Act, in a report called Transcending Obamacare. Paul Howard, the institute's director of health policy, has focused considerable attention on other medical issues including FDA reform and biopharmaceutical innovation. Howard is a member of the institute's Project FDA, which advocates for regulatory reform to allow private industry to advance innovation in medical devices and pharmaceuticals. In 2012, conservative social critical and Institute senior fellow Kay Hymowitz released Manning Up: How the Rise of Women Has Turned Men into Boys, arguing that too many American men in their 20s have started to prolong adolescence. Governing magazine columnist and urban-policy blogger Aaron Renn also joined the institute in 2012. Programs President Bush addresses a meeting of the Manhattan Institute at Federal Hall National Memorial on November 13, 2008. The institute founded its quarterly magazine on urban policy and culture called City Journal in 1990. , it is edited by Brian C. Anderson, and notable contributors include Heather Mac Donald, Theodore Dalrymple, Nicole Gelinas, Steven Malanga, Edward L. Glaeser, Kay Hymowitz, Victor Davis Hanson, Judith Miller, and John Tierney. It has been described as \\"one of America's most successful journals of urban affairs\\". The Adam Smith Society was founded by the institute in 2011. The organization is a nationwide chapter-based association of business school students to promote discussion about the moral, social, and economic benefits of capitalism. , the organization had nine professional chapters, located in Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, London, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington D.C., and 33 student chapters at most of the top business schools across the country, including the Stanford Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Created in 2006, the institute's Veritas Fund for Higher Education was a donor advised fund that invested in universities and professors who are committed to bringing intellectual pluralism to their institutions. The fund invested in courses related to western civilization, the American founding, and political economy. Carly Fiorina, Vanessa Mendoza, and Marilyn Fedak at the Adam Smith Society national meeting in New York City on February 21, 2014. The institute formed its Project FDA in 2006 to focus on ways to improve FDA regulations and create a faster, safer drug and medical-device pipeline. Notable members of the committee include former FDA commissioner Andrew C. von Eschenbach and former Oklahoma senator (now Institute senior fellow) Tom Coburn. In 2007, the institute introduced its Young Leaders Circle, providing New York's young professionals with a forum to discuss policy ideas, cultural issues, and public affairs. The group hosts regular events with prominent speakers which have included Rupert Murdoch, Tom Wolfe, Ken Mehlman, William Bratton, and many others. Economics21 (E21) joined the institute in 2013 as the organization's Washington-based research center focused on economic issues and innovative policy solutions, led by the former chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor during the Reagan administration, Diana Furchtgott-Roth. E21 has a partnership with the Shadow Open Market Committee, which was established in 2009, prior to its association with the institute. The independent group of economists meet twice a year to evaluate the policy choices and actions of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. E21 partners with the Shadow Open Market Committee (SOMC), an independent group of economists, first organized in 1973 by Professors Karl Brunner, from the University of Rochester, and Allan Meltzer, from Carnegie Mellon University, to provide a monetarist alternative to the views on monetary policy and its inflation effects then prevailing at the Federal Reserve and within the economics profession. Its original objective was to evaluate the policy choices and actions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), but has since broadened its scope to cover a wide range of macroeconomic policy issues. With members drawn from academic institutions and private organizations, the committee meets semi-annually and publishes position papers on its website. In 2015, the institute launched SchoolGrades.org, claiming that it was the only grading system that uses a rigorous, common standard to compare schools across the U.S.‚Äîaccounting for differences in academic standards across states and each school's unique economic profile to provide a comprehensive picture of school performance in core subjects. The institute also launched The Beat in 2015. The Beat is an email that focuses on issues that matter most to New York, drawing on the work of Manhattan Institute scholars: transportation, education, quality of life, and the local goings-on at City Hall. The Alexander Hamilton Award Dinner was created in 2001 to honor those individuals helping to foster the revitalization of our nation's cities.Robert A. Katzmann, Daniel Patrick Moynihan: The Intellectual in Public Life (2004), p. 194. It is named after Alexander Hamilton because, like the institute, he was a fervent proponent of commerce and civic life. Throughout the years, the institute has expanded the scope of the prize to celebrate leaders on local, state, and national levels, working in public policy, culture, and philanthropy. Past honorees include: Daniel Patrick Moynihan, William F. Buckley Jr., Rudolph Giuliani, Tom Wolfe, Rupert Murdoch, Raymond Kelly, Henry Kissinger, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Bobby Jindal, Paul Ryan, Jeb Bush, George Kelling, and Eva Moskowitz.  Policy positions and initiatives The institute's research seeks to develop and promote free-market ideas and is focused generally on urban policy, education, public finance and pensions, energy and the environment, health policy, legal reform, and economics. In all these spheres, the institute's fellows approach their work from the perspective that economic choice and individual responsibility are critically important to successful public policy. The institute's research is presented at conferences and in reports, op-eds, and testimony before government committees and panels. =State and local policy= The institute addresses both national and local issues, with state and local policy research focused on municipal finance, public pensions, infrastructure, welfare, policing, and housing. Helping municipalities and states manage their budgets and public- employee benefits systems have been a key part of the institute's research work. The institute's work has been especially influential in its home city of New York. At the 2006 Alexander Hamilton Award dinner hosted by the institute, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who oversaw the city's massive crime drop in the late 1990s, said, \\"If there was a charge of plagiarism for political programs, I'd probably be in a lot of trouble, because I think we plagiarized most of them, if not all of them, from the pages of City Journal and analysis of the Manhattan Institute\\". The institute was one of the key institutions that pressed for reform of the welfare system in the mid-1990s. Charles Murray, while an institute fellow from 1981 to 1990, wrote his groundbreaking book Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950‚Äì1980 (1984) argued that the welfare state had fostered a culture and cycle of dependency that was to the detriment of both welfare recipients and the United States as a whole. This launched a debate culminating in President Bill Clinton proposing to \\"end welfare as we know it\\" and the passage of landmark federal welfare reform in 1996. More recently, marking the 20th anniversary of federal welfare reform, the institute published a report by former senior fellow Scott Winship that evaluated the plight of the poor since 1996. He concluded that, contrary to popular opinion, reform was more successful than not, helping move many single mothers off the dole and into the workforce. Furthermore, he reported that children‚Äîin particular, those in single-mother families‚Äîwere significantly less likely to be poor today than they were before welfare reform. The institute has long focused on the health of American cities, a theme of its 1997 book, the Twenty-First Century City: Resurrecting Urban America, authored by then-Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, who later served as chairman of the institute's Center for Civic Innovation, More recently, the institute has begun an annual series of books featuring innovative ideas for urban policymakers. 2015's The Next Urban Renaissance featured proposals to expand affordable housing; improve urban transportation; implement entrepreneurship zones; rethink the economic anxiety around \\"brain drain\\"; and improve pre-k education. 2016's Retooling Metropolis featured proposals to use technology to improve the enforcement of public health regulations; to implement pricing mechanisms that could address urban parking shortages; to use microunits as a tool to promote affordable housing; and to improve procurement policies for municipal governments. Howard Husock joined the Manhattan Institute in 2006 as vice president of policy research and director of the institute's Social Entrepreneurship Initiative, which focuses on recognizing the best of America's new generation of nonprofit leaders. Husock has also written widely on housing and urban policy, including his book The Trillion-Dollar Housing Mistake: The Failure of American Housing Policy (Ivan R. Dee, 2003). Before joining the institute, Husock served as director of case studies in public policy and management at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government from 1987 to 2006. A former broadcast journalist and documentary filmmaker whose work won three Emmy Awards with WGBH in Boston, Husock was appointed to the board of directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 2013 by President Barack Obama. Steve Malanga has written for years warning that public-sector unions and poor political leadership have bankrupted once-rich states, like California and New Jersey, with unsustainable pension and benefits systems for their public employees. Malanga has also profiled cities facing budgetary problems, including Stockton, California; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; and Dallas, Texas. In 2013, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush called Malanga \\"the best thinker on state and local fiscal matters\\". Josh McGee, vice president at the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, joined the Manhattan Institute as a senior fellow in 2015. A leading expert in retirement plan design, McGee was appointed as chairman of the Texas State Pension Review Board by Governor Greg Abbott in late 2015. His appointment was vigorously opposed by public union groups and labor organizers in Texas. Senior fellow Daniel DiSalvo's 2015 book, Government Against Itself: Public Union Power and Its Consequences, argues that the dominance of public sector unions in state and local government allows for costly compensation packages that crowd-out essential government services. In 2016, the institute commissioned a report by transportation privatization expert Robert Poole (of the Reason Foundation) on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the bi-state agency that oversees bridges, tunnels, and airports in the New York metropolitan area. The report argues that the bi-state agency is plagued by \\"politicized decision-making, money-losing facilities and declining financial viability\\", and recommends a total reinvention of the Port Authority's business model, including divesting from real estate assets and financing new projects with public-private partnerships. =Community policing: the \\"broken windows\\" method= George Kelling stands with leaders of the Detroit Police Department and other local officials at a press conference in 2013. The Department partnered with Manhattan Institute for new ways to protect the neighborhoods in the area. The institute has pioneered reforms in policing, most notably the use of community policing methods and more specifically quality-of-life policing, also known as \\"broken windows theory\\" after the landmark 1982 Atlantic Monthly article \\"Broken Windows\\" by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling. Broken Windows posits that dealing more effectively and comprehensively with low-level quality of life crime would reduce more high- profile violent crime. Broken Windows policing was put to its first major large-scale test in the mid-1990s after the election of Rudolph Giuliani as mayor of New York City. Giuliani was an outspoken advocate of community policing, frequently citing the influence \\"Broken Windows\\" had on his thinking as mayor. Giuliani appointed Kelling's intellectual collaborator William J. Bratton as New York City Police Commissioner in 1994, saying, \\"I chose Bill Bratton because he agreed with the Broken Windows theory\\". In 1998, George Kelling and Catherine Coles expanded on this idea in their book, Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities, arguing that control of disorderly behavior in public places generally will lead to a significant drop in serious crime. Police chiefs like William Bratton (in both New York and Los Angeles) have implemented \\"broken windows\\" and related policies, and have reported falling crime rates. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani with New York City's former Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, former Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen and former Director of the Office of Emergency Management Richard Sheirer at a press briefing in 2002. Bratton took these methods to Los Angeles on being appointed Los Angeles Police Department chief of police. Newark, New Jersey Mayor Cory Booker was lauded for his Broken Windows-based approach to crime after taking office in 2006. Senior fellow Heather Mac Donald argues that crime prevention statistics from the 2008‚Äì2009 recession improved as a result of efficient policing, high incarceration rates, more police officers working, data-driven approaches such as CompStat which helps commanders target high-crime areas, and a policy of holding precinct commanders accountable for results. This research opposes the commonly-held notion that crime inevitably spikes when economic conditions worsen. She contends the decline of American cities, beginning during the 1960s, was a result of crime \\"spiraling out of control\\". Most recently, Mac Donald has been notable for her argument that crime rates (or, in some instances, murder rates) have spiked in many urban areas as a result of the \\"Ferguson Effect\\": the tendency, in the aftermath of 2014's riots in Ferguson, Missouri, for police officers to engage in less proactive policing for fear of generating backlash from local populations or the media. Mac Donald has argued that the consequences of this trend adversely affect African-American communities, stating that \\"there is no government agency more dedicated to the idea that black lives matter than the police\\". In the 2010s, Institute experts were embedded in the Detroit Police Department, helping the city implement Broken Windows policing in order to reduce a serious crime problem. The institute funded an outreach team that shared its expertise in criminology and policy implementation with the Detroit Police Department, focusing on the \\"broken windows\\" approach. The institute is closely associated with CompStat, a data-driven police management approach that uses crime analysis, information sharing, and accountability to ensure that police departments focus on preventing crimes. George Kelling, the institute's loaned executive to the City of Detroit, and Michael Allegretti, the institute's director of state and local programs, implemented two pilot programs in the Northwest neighborhood of Grandmont-Rosedale and the Northeast neighborhood of East English Village. These programs, implemented in collaboration with the police and community groups, aimed to stem the rise of home invasions by increasing the felt presence of the police, engaging community members in problem solving, and focusing special attention on the neighborhoods' most at risk offenders. One source reported that in the first year following implementation, \\"home invasions dropped 26 percent\\". =Education, charter schools and vouchers= In the higher education world, Institute senior fellow Beth Akers is a leading advocate for reform of the federal student loan and financial aid system. According to Akers, coauthor of Game of Loans: The Rhetoric and Reality of Student Debt (2016), the system is simply far too complex for the average student or parent borrower to navigate well. She argues that the department of education should simplify federal financial aid, adopt a single, income-driven repayment plan for federal student loans, and bring market discipline into student lending in innovative ways. Former senior fellow Jay P. Greene's research on school choice was cited four times in the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, which affirmed the constitutionality of school vouchers. In March 1989, the institute employed Seymour \\"Sy\\" Fliegel as a senior fellow and launched the Center for Educational Innovation (CEI). A former deputy superintendent of East Harlem's Community School District 4, Fliegel had launched a program in September 1970 to transform failing schools in District 4 into thriving, small, community-based schools. Fliegel and Institute senior fellow James Macguire wrote a book, The Miracle of East Harlem: The Fight for Choice in Public Education, to demonstrate how education reform can be achieved one school at a time. The Manhattan Institute has since launched a website, SchoolGrades.org, that ranks schools nationally based on a normed measure linked to the federal government's NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) exam. Institute senior fellow Marcus Winters is a nationally recognized expert on charter schools, accountability, and teacher quality. His research in New York and Denver has found that students with special needs were less likely to switch schools if they were attending a charter elementary school than a traditional public school, contrary to accusations from critics that charter schools ‚Äúcherry-pick‚Äù students. A 2017 study by Institute Senior Fellow Max Eden found that New York City students and teachers reported declining disciplinary environments on campus in the wake of reforms by Mayor Bill de Blasio that made it more difficult to suspend misbehaving students. A New York Post editorial described the findings as \\"disturbing ‚Äî not least because trouble is rising disproportionately at schools that mainly serve minority children\\". =Energy and environment= Institute fellows highlight how abundant and affordable power helps fuel growth and prosperity across the globe. The institute's energy policy research is focused on climate, geopolitics, regulations, and technology. In 2005, Institute senior fellows Peter Huber and Mark Mills released the book The Bottomless Well, which disputes several popular beliefs about energy. Bill Gates described it as \\"the only book I‚Äôve seen that really explains energy, its history, and what it will be like going forward\\". Published amid concern about \\"peak oil\\", the book points out that expanding energy supplies mean higher productivity, more jobs, and a growing GDP. Mills has written extensively on the geopolitical opportunities presented by the American energy sector. In a 2016 report, he argued that there has \\"never been a more opportune time for America to capture the geopolitical 'soft power' benefits from greater oil production and exports\\". Further, Mills makes the case that the U.S. is poised for a boom in the shale oil industry, driven by technological advancements‚Äîspecifically big-data analytics. Institute senior fellow Oren Cass argues that the popular conception of climate change as posing an existential threat to modern civilization is not supported by climate science or economics. Cass states in Foreign Affairs: In keeping with its commitment to free-market economic principles, the institute is opposed to high-cost, inefficient government mandates and subsidies. For example, Robert Bryce has written in favor of repealing both the Renewable Fuel Standard and the tax credit for electric vehicles. Bryce has argued at length that, even with exorbitant government subsidies, renewable energy sources are simply inadequate to meet America's energy needs. He has also argued for the expansion of U.S. nuclear energy as a clean fuel source with unsurpassed power density. The institute is a proponent of the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) method of extracting natural gas and oil from underground deposits. In response to calls to ban fracking in parts of New York, the institute released a report in 2011 projecting that allowing fracking could \\"inject over $11 billion into the state economy\\". In a 2016 Institute report, Jonathan Lesser analyzed the cost-benefit analysis undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency of the Clean Power Plan produced by the Obama Administration. Lesser wrote that \\"the EPA's cost-benefit analysis significantly overestimated the direct benefits of CO2 reductions and co-benefits of accompanying reductions in air-pollutant emissions; its analysis also significantly underestimated the specific costs of meeting future electricity demand\\". Moreover, Lesser contended that \\"the CPP will have no physically measurable impact on world climate\\". =Health policy= The institute's health policy team promotes policy reforms asserted to empower patients and consumers by encouraging competition, transparency, accountability, and innovation. The institute's research in this sphere is focused on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reform, the Affordable Care Act, and Medicare/Medicaid. Since 2006, the institute's Project FDA has advocated for FDA reform, asserting that with modern medicine \\"on the cusp of a radical transformation\\" due to breakthroughs in precision medicine, the FDA \\"has struggled to adapt its regulations to new scientific advances\\". Senior fellows Paul Howard, Peter Huber, and Tom Coburn have all argued that the FDA can be a bridge for innovation, rather than a barrier, getting better medicines to patients, faster, without sacrificing safety. In October 2015, the institute ran a full-page advertisement in the New York Times, reading, \\"Everyone will be a patient someday\\". The ad included the signatures of over a dozen industry leaders, all in support of the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law by President Obama just over a year later, in December 2016. The institute has taken a critical view of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) since its inception. In 2013, to enable policymakers, researchers, and everyday Americans to understand more fully the effects of the ACA, the institute released its Obamacare Impact Map, a joint project of health policy fellows Paul Howard, Avik Roy, and Yevgeniy Feyman. In 2014, the institute published then senior fellow Avik Roy's proposal for its replacement, titled \\"Transcending Obamacare\\". According to Roy, while the ACA delivers on the goal of reducing the number of uninsured Americans, it does so by increasing the cost of U.S. health coverage. More recently, in 2017, the institute released a report by Yevgeniy Feyman advocating the use of 1332 \\"state innovation\\" waivers giving states the flexibility to increase choice, competition, and affordability under the ACA. The institute's health care scholars oppose allowing the federal government to negotiate prices in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program and believe that drug price negotiating has adverse effects in the Veterans Administration. Paul Howard argues that the first step in reforming Medicaid is for Congress to enact per- capita spending caps. In 2016, Howard argued that California's Proposition 61‚Äìa measure that would have imposed price controls on some prescription drugs in the state ‚Äì was a flawed proposal that might have actually increased drug prices. Many of Howard's criticisms were echoed by newspaper editorial boards throughout the state and the measure, which had been favored by wide margins just a few months prior, ultimately failed by a 46‚Äì54 vote in the November 2016 election. Institute Senior Fellow Oren Cass goes has argued that the American social safety net's overwhelming emphasis on health care is the unintentional result of skewed incentives. States should therefore be allowed to reroute Medicaid funding to other programs that would more effectively meet the needs of the poor at no extra cost. In a 2017 article for National Review, Cass responded to accusations that repealing the Affordable Care Act would lead to otherwise preventable deaths by writing \\"In reality, the best statistical estimate of the number of lives saved each year by the ACA is zero\\". = Legal reform = The institute's legal scholars author policy papers on various aspects of legal reform. The Center for Legal Policy regularly writes on overcriminalization, corporate governance, and civil litigation reform. Corporate governance reports usually focus on proxy voting records. Overcriminalization issue briefs typically study the growth of the criminal law in state penal codes. Proposed reforms to America's lawsuit practice are published under the center's ongoing publication of Trial Lawyers, Inc. Institute legal policy fellows like James Copland contend that the rule of law in modern America is increasingly being eroded by trial lawyers, prosecutors, and socially oriented shareholder activists, who manipulate the law to achieve objectives outside normal legislative and administrative bounds. Overcriminalization In 2014, the institute began to study the issue of overcriminalization, the idea that state and federal criminal codes are overly expansive and growing too quickly. At the federal level alone, Institute fellows have identified over 300,000 laws and regulations whose violation can lead to prison time. The institute asserts that this puts even well-meaning citizens in danger of prosecution for seemingly innocuous conduct. From 2014 to 2016, the institute produced reports on the status of overcriminalization in five states (North Carolina, Michigan, South Carolina, Minnesota, and Oklahoma) and is continually adding more state- specific research. Prisoner reentry in Newark Cory Booker speaks about the City of Newark at a Manhattan Institute event in New York City on May 22, 2008. In Newark, New Jersey, the institute partnered with Mayor Cory Booker to implement a new approach to prisoner reentry, based on the principle of connecting ex-offenders with paid work immediately upon release.Andra Gillespie, The New Black Politician: Cory Booker, Newark, and Post-Racial America (2013), p. 134-135. As the mayor of Newark, Booker sought to remedy a problem familiar to those in the community: prisoner reentry. A study by William Eimicke, Maggie Gallagher, Stephen Goldsmith for the institute, Moving Men into the Mainstream: Best Practices in Prisoner Reentry, found that the most successful prisoner-reentry programs were those that employed the work- first model. Booker's staff, and Richard Greenwald, a specialist in the development of workforce, implemented Newark's Prisoner Reentry Initiative (NPRI). As of November 2011, the agencies that contracted with the city through NPRI had enrolled 1,436 program participants, exceeding the benchmark set by the Department of Labor. Provider organizations have placed more than 1,000 people in unsubsidized jobs, with an average hourly wage of $9.32. Governor Chris Christie thereafter announced his plan to reform the state's prison system, and sought the institute's analysis of the current system. The final report included a set of recommendations on addressing drug offenses and recidivism, and better aligning New Jersey agencies around a successful reentry strategy. =Economics= Given the concern about economic inequality among mainstream academics and commentators, especially since the Great Recession and the release of Thomas Piketty's bestselling Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the institute has produced several pieces of research on this and the related issue of economic mobility in the U.S. In 2014, former senior fellow Scott Winship produced a report, \\"Inequality Does Not Reduce Prosperity\\", which examined evidence from across the globe. This report concluded that larger increases in inequality correspond with sharper rises in living standards for the middle class and poor alike, while greater inequality in developed nations tends to accompany stronger economic growth. In a 2015 report, Winship examined the state of economic and residential mobility in the U.S., finding that people who move from their birth states fare better economically than those who stay put. He argues that the U.S. should focus on policies to improve mobility in order to expand opportunities among disadvantaged groups. Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow and director of Economics21, has written extensively in support of tax reform. She argues specifically for a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a move to a territorial tax system, in order to make the U.S. more economically competitive on the world stage. In 2015, Roth, together with former fellow Jared Meyer, published the book, Disinherited: How America Is Betraying America's Young, arguing that millennials' plight is the result of government policies that are systematically stacked against young Americans to the benefit of older generations. The book was praised by Elaine Chao: \\"This is the book you absolutely need to read if you are a millennial or if you care about one! Arm yourself with the numbers Washington would rather you didn't focus on\\". The institute is generally critical of the federal minimum wage. In 2015, it published a report by American Action Forum's Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Ben Gitis, which made the case that an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2020 would cost 6.6 million jobs. According to a 2016 issue brief by Oren Cass, these deleterious effects are mainly due to the fact that increases in the federal minimum fail to account for differences in local conditions: not all labor markets are the same. Cass has also argued for the introduction of a federal wage subsidy‚Äîadditional dollars per hour worked delivered via one's paycheck‚Äîas a better third way to help low-income workers. In 2015, he wrote that a wage subsidy is superior to both the minimum wage and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) because it incentivizes workforce participation and delivers benefits directly to workers, without distorting the labor market. Funding sources Foundations which have contributed over $1 million to the Manhattan Institute include the John M. Olin Foundation, Bradley Foundation, Sarah Scaife Foundation, Searle Freedom Trust, Smith Richardson Foundation, William E. Simon Foundation, the Claude Lambe Foundation, the Gilder Foundation, the Curry Foundation, and the Jaquelin Hume Foundation. In 2013, hedge fund managers Cliff Asness, Henry Kravis and Thomas McWilliams all cut ties with the Manhattan Institute due to the group's support of the abolition of defined benefit public pensions.

Events which she lived through include the Bar Confederation, which caused local upheaval, the work of the Great Sejm, Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, and the Napoleonic Wars. Biography She was the eldest daughter of Katarzyna Raczy≈Ñska, popular in Wielkopolska and J√≥zef Radoli≈Ñski (d. 1781), with sisters: Katarzyna (b.1762) and Antonina (b.1770). She was named for her maternal grandmother Wirydianna Bni≈Ñska (1718‚Äì1797). At the age of 25, she married Antoni Kwilecki, the son of Franciszek Antoni Kwilecki having chosen him over an older man, fearing that otherwise she would have become his nursemaid. They had two children: Anna (called Nina) (b.1789) and J√≥zef (b. 1791). The marriage was not particularly happy, mostly because of his alcoholism which at times made him turn violent. Fiszerowa nearly miscarried her daughter Anna after he hit her), and the hostility of his parents. However, he did defend her against them, although she credited this less to the love he held for her, than to the family custom of fighting. When he fell for a fourteen-year-old peasant girl, he divorced Fiszerowa. He was an envoy at the Four-Year Sejm, and she wrote speeches for her him and her cousins. In 1806 she married Stanis≈Çaw Fiszer, a general who fought with Napoleon in his campaign against Russia, who loved her, though for Fiszerowa this was more about rewarding him for his patriotic service and to bring herself closer to Ko≈õciuszko, who cared for Fiszer. Personally she was witty, called the \\"Voltaire in skirts\\", and spoke of her fellow citizens as \\"always brave and always beaten\\", believing that if they had banded together, they could have defended themselves from foreign aggression and prevented the partitions (this views is not shared by most modern historians. While living on a widow's pension in Warsaw after the formation of the Congress Kingdom, her mocking jokes about Grand Duke Constantine, the viceroy, reached his ears, and she received from him a threatening letter through his adjutant. She remained calm, saying only \\"Voil√† une lettre qui passera √† post√©rit√©\\" (This is a letter which will pass on to history), at which said adjutant left, having taken back the later which was to be the source of more amusement for her in the coming weeks. She wrote in French; the memoirs were only published in a Polish translation in 1975 by Edward Raczy≈Ñski, a kinsman who had been the Polish President in exile. In the meantime, it was widely unknown by historians, though mentioned in the pre-war Polish Biographical Dictionary with an entry by Adam Mieczys≈Çaw Ska≈Çkowski, who knew only the year of her death.

The fast-paced development of the digital world in the twenty-first century has contributed to the digital divide becoming a very real problem for a segment of the population for whom a lack of education of, interest in, or access to digital devices has left them excluded from the technological world and fearful of its growing omnipresence. Digital phobic is part of a growing dictionary of digital vocabulary exploring the social impact of the technological age. The phrase considers the fears associated with technological evolution and change, and acknowledges the possibility of exclusion as a result of a rising reliance on technology in day-to-day life. Discourse Everyday use of technology has increased dramatically since the turn of the century, significantly impacting both those embracing technological change as well as those reluctant to be a part of it. A sharp rise in technological innovations during the 21st century has been responsible for changing much of the way we work, socialize, and learn ‚Äì all of which can be at the foundation of distrust in the technological age. Psychologists, academics and researchers have begun to consider the base of these fears and consider the social, cultural and environmental circumstances which might catalyze someone to becoming 'digital phobic'. Technophobia is used to discuss a fear of advanced technology in a formal capacity and can stem from a number, and combination of, concerns. With the oncoming of the digital age, worries have broadened from the very earliest fears that technology would eradicate artisanship to concerns over data protection, financial security, identity theft, technical inability and invasion of privacy. There is no exhaustible list of reasons cited for fearing the digital world and, whilst research into both the cause and consequence of developing a digital phobia remains in its infancy, the presence of digital phobia regardless contributes towards an increasingly comprehensive picture of a series of profiles among digital users. Recent research from Foresters, an international financial services organization, found 2% of the UK population to fall into this category of internet user.Paul Gallagher. Digital Addict ‚Äì or just checking your Facebook page? A quarter of all men and women spend an 'unhealthy amount of time online'. The Independent. 8 June 2014. Accessed: 27 August 2014. A further breakdown of this statistic, sees the percentage of users in development of a digital phobia increase, with 4% fearful of online shopping for worrying that someone will steal their card details, and 12% fearful that using social media will make it easier for people to find their personal details. When asked to reason their attitude towards technology as part of this survey, a larger percentage of the UK population were revealed to be fearful of the impact it could be having on more traditional means of doing things. 31% believed technology was preventing us from communicating properly, while 32% thought advances in technology will result in long-held traditions being lost. This fear has only been exacerbated over time as more and more data-holding, services and opportunities are transferred to the digital realm, and both the perceived and real nature of security and vulnerability risks increases. Worrying levels of time spent on devices, the invasion of privacy or the possible misuse or abuse of personal data entrusted to online sources are all contributing towards the development of a digital phobia among a proportion of the population. Concerns about the negative, exclusionary or divisive consequences of living within a digital society are being voiced from various global platforms. April 2014 research conducted by Pew Research Center, in association with Smithsonian Magazine, revealed concerns about anticipated technological developments over the next half-century. 30% of Americans surveyed feared that technological changes would lead to a future in which people are worse off than they are at the time of being surveyed. Considered amid reports of dis-interest in the internet among Japan's residents despite its reputation as a high-tech nation, these reports contribute towards a growing understanding that high-tech advancements are not universally celebrated. Michael Fitzpatrick. Revealing Japan's Low Tech Belly. BBC News. 13 July 2010. Accessed: 20 August 2014. Moreover, the May 2014 \\"right to be forgotten\\" ruling put in place in the European Union which allows internet users to request for their internet history to be un-searchable if deemed incorrect, outdated or irrelevant, and the thousands of requests received in the first few days following its announcement documents a, perhaps previously hidden, widespread fear of leaving a digital footprint and/or being falsely represented online. Origins Digital phobia is part of a wider societal conversation on how we relate to, trust in, and interact with technology and considers the potentially negative implications of what otherwise appears to be a positive advancement of the modern world. This phrase has been developed by Foresters, the international financial services organisation, for the purpose of describing attitudes to technology among the UK population. Developed within a digital vocabulary consisting of four other phrases (digital addict, digital omnivore, digital agnostic, digital denier), digital phobic is part of a scale of social description for online behavior within the digital age. The phrase has been used as part of discussion on the more general use of technology within the 21st century and the importance of striking a balance between time spent on and offline. Research conducted by Foresters in association with Tech Timeout, a social communications initiative considering the role of technology in contemporary society, formed the basis of the descriptor and identified the key traits of each type of digital user based on answers from over 1,000 UK respondents. Both anecdotal and research- based evidence suggests categories of internet use, whilst they cannot be linearly divided, are able to loosely describe attitudes to technology in society. The developed phrases are able to be used to greater understand and contextualize how new and existing technology is viewed and have been cited in international online newspapers and blog posts. Whilst this phrase and definition were developed specifically from research on UK technology-users, the phrase is not UK-specific and is designed to be indicative of a global community of technology users who share in these characteristics. Social and cultural impact Digital phobia presents a real and pressing problem in the modern world where technology has become a central and essential resource. Internet culture has developed to become a part of the fabric of everyday life and is now even considered part of the make-up of national identity with a country's internet use and digital footprint an important modern index for international comparison, often associated with development and modernity. The consequences of non-participation in the digital world are far reaching, and can affect the economic, cultural, social, occupational and educational life of a non-user. For example, in 2009 Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated that UK households offline are missing out on savings of ¬£560 a year which could be saved if shopping or paying for bills online. Furthermore, in the United States older people without internet access or the skills to make the most of it are considered a disadvantaged proportion of the population as, amongst other important resources, vital healthcare information and initiatives conducted online are unavailable to those not a part of the digital world. Heightened fears of how technology may be affecting the human population stems from a, for some very logical, fear of how technology is adapting the world we live in and at the pace and price with which it is doing so. With such a significance placed on online participation, concerns about the role of the internet in everyday life are not unfounded and not exclusive to those who prefer to stay away from the internet, avoid certain activities online, or use the internet without enthusiasm and only as necessitated. A survey conducted by security firm Avira identified 84% of people fear social networking sites will steal or misuse their personal information, demonstrating the net majority of internet users share, at least partially, in distrusting the digital world. Whilst many will, despite this fear, adopt cautious optimism and still use social networking as part of their everyday lives this high percentage serves to demonstrate that a fear significant enough for some to avoid readily using online and digital services is a fear shared by a large number of internet users. Whilst some digital phobics have preferred to remain distanced from technology due to hypothetical concerns others have attempted to join in societal interest but find themselves unable to stay caught up with new technology or would like to see its progression halted as evolution of the digital world has reached new speeds. The 2013 Oxford Internet Survey recognizes this concern among UK users, identifying distinct categories of both non-users and ex-users of internet-based technology who, for a variety of reasons, have discontinued or refuse to access the online world. This is further supported by results from a 2013 survey of internet use in America which found 32% of non-internet users avoiding the online world because of finding the internet difficult or frustrating to use, being physically unable or worried about other issues such as viruses, threat of hacking or spam ‚Äì a figure considerably higher than in earlier years. Concern over the presence of a digital divide, whether locally or globally, is only exacerbated by the knowledge that access to many government and council services, job applications, and social and cultural resources are now largely internet based. Internet access has become a hurdle in contemporary society which, for those without the necessary desire to learn or knowledge of internet-based systems, can be difficult to navigate around, often resulting in key services and vital resources being less easily accessible, leaving non-users feeling isolated. Private and government campaigns to tackle this issue further demonstrate the severity and long-lasting impact of having a proportion of the population disinclined or disinterested in going online. As the online world becomes saturated, device options for connecting to the internet vary and news of technological inventions goes viral the exponential growth of the technological world is only contributing towards a growing number of 'digital phobic' tech-users amongst the global population.  Education  Digital phobia has had a negative impact on the field of education. Some teachers have expressed a fear that new and advanced technology is supplanting them as the masters of their fields of study and a study of teachers in Wilmington, Delaware has shown that educators in this area are acclimating to the new technology in their classrooms at a slower pace. The local researchers believe that there are many factors why that is the case and some of the things they have found are things such as a lack of technological education by the teachers, and also the lack of time, or incentive to adjust to the new technology. University Larry Cuban has stated that \\"The introduction of computers into school was supposed to improve academic achievement , and alter how teachers taught. Neither has occurred.\\" The constant infusion of new technology has many teachers fearing that they are losing their classroom. This new technology is essentially diminishing the role of a teacher in the classroom. Researchers believe that educators are slow to adapt to technology because they aren't given time to acclimate to the new technology, causing them to hesitate to use it in the classroom and express fear that these technologies may interfere with genuine learning particularly in humanities and creative subjects. In an article for the New Media Reader, Theodor H. Nelson wrote that people are opposed to the computer because they believe it is \\"cold\\" and \\"inhuman\\", but a human can be just as inhuman and maybe even more so than the actual machine itself.

On a petition by the losing Liberal candidate, WH Watson, a select committee found that Richard's agents' generous hospitality in providing free drinks for the electorate of Kinsale in Kiley's public house amounted to bribery. While Richard was personally exonerated, his election was voided. The committee comprised 3 hostile Liberal MPs and 2 fellow conservatives.EPPI file on Watson's petition, accessed 1 Sept 2014 At the next election the Liberal Benjamin Hawes took the seat by just 3 votes.

History The present parish church is dedicated to Saint Giles, the patron saint of cripples. Saint Giles, or Saint Egidus, who was born at Athens in 645, was a cripple, and though he had the means of obtaining all the comforts he wished, he would not, but devoted his life and his means in endeavouring to ameliorate the sufferings of the afflicted. Most churches dedicated to his name, are erected by the road side, the supposition for such being, that all weary travellers could enter and find rest and peace. Architecture and fittings The tower is an embattled specimen in the Perpendicular style and contains a clock, and a peal of six bells. The height of the tower from the battlements to the ground is 80 feet. In the year 1757 the chancel, or at least the east end of it, was found to be so very ruinous that it was necessary to be taken down, and being reduced a little in size, was rebuilt by Mr. Irons, of Warwick, and several years later, circa 1776, the church was rebuilt by Francis Hiorne, with the exception of the tower, which is the only part standing of the original structure. The building was reseated in 1866. It is a lofty building, and consists of a nave, two side aisles, a chancel, and galleries on either side. The beauty of the church is principally constituted in the plastered groined ceiling, which is supported by eight clustered columns of iron, cased in wood. In 1892, the old vestry at the west end, the basement of the tower, being found inadequate, two new vestries were built, adjoining the north side of the chancel. They were designed by E. Swinfen Harris, the contractors being Mansfield and Buttrum, of Stony Stratford. The vestries were opened in 1892 by the bishop of Reading. The vestries are English Gothic of the 13th century, the clergy vestry being apsidal on plan, and the choir vestry covers the remainder of the available space. The partition separating the old vestry from the church, was subsequently taken away, and the space now forms a baptistry. There are tablets at each corner of the church, all placed very high. The large oval one over the organ is very much worn, and the inscription nearly obliterated; it is to the memory of Leonard Sedgewick, a former vicar. Interior view The east window is a beautiful specimen of its kind, and contains representations of the 12 apostles with their names inscribed beneath. This was erected to the memory of the Rev. W. T. Sankey, who died in 1875, by his widow and son. There are two other large stained windows, the one on the north side . The large window on the south side is to the memory of Josiah Michael and Ann Smith. There are six small stained windows under the galleries, dedicated to former people, notably two to the memory of the late Rev. J. Spark, a former curate. It was this gentleman who devised by his will ^50 towards providing better vestry accommodation, and this money formed the nucleus of a fund for building the new vestries, before alluded to. Near the vestry door is an oil painting in a gilt frame, over which is a gilt dove, and the following inscription is appended to the frame : \\"This painting, illustrating the epistle for Quinquagesima Sunday, with the gilded dove which surmounted the pulpit in this church in the 18th and earlier part of the 19th century, and here placed by William Osborn Boyes, who died 25th May, 1896, and for many years churchwarden of this parish.\\" Organ The first record of an organ in the church is from 1812 when an instrument by Henry Lincoln was installed. This was later modified by Stringer around 1890 and Kirkland in 1902. The organ dates from 1967 when it was installed by Starmer Shaw of Northampton. The organ is originally by Henry Willis III using some parts from the organ formerly in St George's Church, Edinburgh. A specification of the current organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. Grounds Amongst the epitaphs to be found in St. Giles's churchyard. At each end of the family vault of the late William Boyes, may be seen flat gravestones to the memory of Mark Boyes and Elizabeth Boyes, who died in 1712, and these were brought from the old church yard of St. Mary Magdalene, where the bodies where buried.

Since the company's formation in 2007, the company has acquired and renovated numerous residential apartment buildings in the Philadelphia area. Post Brothers is responsible for the restoration and development of the historic Goldtex building in downtown Philadelphia and the renovation of Rittenhouse Hill, a 624-unit project in Northwest Philadelphia totaling over $250 million in value, purchased and is beginning the renovation of Garden Court, a 105-unit apartment building in University City, part of a $250-million investment strategy in the neighborhood; and Presidential City, a $200-million redevelopment of the historic 1,000-unit complex on City Avenue, among other projects. History Founded by brothers Matthew and Michael Pestronk in 2007, Post Brothers is a vertically integrated residential real estate company. In November 2011, Post Brothers began work on the rehabilitation of an existing building, known as Rittenhouse Hill, in Germantown, Philadelphia, which would eventually contain 624 housing units, including a mixture of studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments and over 30,000 square feet in retail space. Multimillion-dollar renovations were completed in July, 2013. The build was highlighted by Multi-Housing News for its implementation of many Green building features, including energy efficient lighting and a heating and air conditioning system utilizing a high efficiency electric heat pump. The building is completely powered by wind-generated power and became the first building in Philadelphia of this size to use wind energy as the sole source of energy. In 2012, Post Brothers announced that they would commence with the refurbishment of the Goldtex building, at an estimated cost of $40 million. When completed, the building would be home to approximately 160 loft-style apartments, ranging from studios to three-bedrooms; and 7,000 square feet of retail space. In January 2016, Goldtex received Philadelphia's first LEED Gold-level certification for a residential high-rise with Green building features such as 100% wind-generated power, Energy Star rated appliances, highly-efficient heating and air conditioning system balancing demand throughout the building.Philly.com: \\" Goldtex apartments get LEED gold-level tag\\" By Jacob Adelman January 14, 2016 Goldtex has a close proximity to Center City, Philadelphia and had previously been a shoe factory built in 1905. Shortly after the announcement of the building project, the company was criticized by several local unions as the project was offered to non-union contractors. In 2012, Post Brothers purchased a historic four-building, known as the Presidential City Apartments. After renovations are complete the complex will feature 1038 apartments, approximately 8,000 square feet of retail and an outdoor lounge and pool area. Post Brothers purchased a 320,000 square foot, partially vacant office building out of foreclosure located on 260 South Broad Street in Philadelphia for over $27 million in July 2012. Post Brothers is expected to convert the former office building into residential apartments or condominiums. Post Brothers‚Äô most recent redevelopment projects include the purchase of Garden Court Plaza, a 1920s-era, 13-story, 146-unit apartment complex located in University City and Roosevelt Apartments, located in Center City. Other Notable Projects Post Brothers Apartments has been responsible for a number of other notable building projects throughout Philadelphia. The company was responsible for the renovation of the historic Delmar Morris Apartments in East Falls, Philadelphia. Other projects in East Falls area include the 42-unit Pastorius Court Apartments that was gut renovated in 2010; Cloverly Park Apartments, finished in 2009; and a 92-unit Copley Manor Apartments that were sold in 2013. Non-union contractors In 2012, Post Brothers Apartments hired a number of non-union workers for a large downtown development project and was involved in an acrimonious battle with representatives of the local construction labor unions when the union- affiliated workers were awarded only 40% of the project, including demolition and electrical work. The two founders commented on the project, stating that they were \\"backed into\\" the situation of opening the project to non-union labor because of project costs rather than having political motives.

He was a co-founder of the Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information. Early life Erik Seidenfaden was born in Hasle, Denmark. He was the son of district attorney and Copenhagen‚Äôs chief constable Aage Valdemar Seidenfaden (1877‚Äì1966) and Anna Elise Reenberg Teilman Harck (1887‚Äì1928). He was a brother of diplomat and botanist Gunnar Seidenfaden (1908‚Äì2001). In 1928, Seidenfaden took the classical languages exam at Sor√∏ Akademi and went on to study comparative literature at Copenhagen University. In Paris, (Sorbonne) he attended a journalism school and, after considering a career in literature studies.  Career  =Early career= Erik Seidenfaden began working as an assistant to Nicolaj Bl√¶del (1882‚Äì1943), foreign correspondent at the daily Dagens Nyheder Later, in 1945, Seidenfaden would edit and publish Bl√¶del's work Forbrydelse og Dumhed. His first significant reporting job came when he was sent to cover Adolf Hitler's 1933 election campaign, where he was almost arrested writing against Nazi Germany. He began his series on Germany with a satirical article, published on 18 June 1933, which was about the \\"nazification\\" of Heidelberg University titled \\"200 Dueller om Ugen I Heidelberg\\". He then published \\"J√∏dehaderen\\", an interview with the Julius Streicher (1885‚Äì1946). Nazi and vehement anti-Semitic editor of Der St√ºrmer at a coffee house in Nuremberg. In 1935, he became the permanent foreign correspondent for Dagens Nyheder, working within the newsroom of The Times. He soon followed Nicolaj Bl√¶del to the more conservative Berlingske Tidende and Jydske Tidende until 1937. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, he compiled reports from the front on the government's side, in 1937 publishing the book Borgerkrig i Spanien. He then returned to Denmrk and joined the left leaning newspaper Politiken as a foreign editor in 1937. His militant attitude towards the Nazi threat often clashed with that of the influential social liberal Det Radikale Venstre party and the views of the several times foreign minister Erik Scavenius (1877‚Äì1962), and chairman of the board of Politiken. In an article titled Indre Frihed i Pant for Ydre published for the journal Kulturkampen in December 1937, written by him but signed by Peter Rohde (1902‚Äì1978), Erik Seidenfaden attacked the appeasing line of the government led by the social democratic prime minister Thorvald Stauning (1873-1942) and the foreign minister Peter Munch (1870-1948). = Second World War= When Denmark was invaded on 9 April 1940, Erik Seidenfaden was in Oslo reporting on the Allied minefield laying operations in Norwegian waters. After the German invasion, he then reached the front by Trondheim via Sweden but after the retreat of the Anglo-French expeditionary force, he returned to Copenhagen. He told the editor in chief of Politiken that he had joined the News Chronicle, and agreed to stay only after being offered a post as a correspondent in Rome to cover neutral Italy. After Italy entered the war in early June 1940 he returned to Denmark and began becoming active in illegal circles which, apart from Nicolaj Bl√¶del, included the journalists Merete Bonnesen (1901-1980), Jens S√∏ltoft-Jensen (1906-1964), Sten Gudme (1901-1961), the Gyldendal publisher Ingeborg Andersen (1887-1960), the philologist Lis Jacobsen (1882-1961), the physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962) and his brother mathematician Harald Bohr (1887-1951), the Politiken board member Herman Dedichen (1896-1958) and the jura professor Stephan Hurwitz (1901-1981). When the British military intelligence organization SOE-Special Operations Executive in their first mission in Denmark dropped parachutists Carl Johan Bruhn (1904‚Äì1941) and Mogens Hammer (1911‚Äì1946) by Haslev on 27 December 1941, they were given two contacts who, it was believed, would be prepared to assist them. The first of the contacts declined all help, but Seidenfaden did what he could to assist them and made arrangements to feed and assist them in order to enter the resistance circles. Sensing in September 1942 that he might get caught, in January 1943 Seidenfaden managed to be sent to Stockholm as a correspondent for Politiken. There, he forged contacts with the journalist and resistance organizer Ebbe Munck (1905‚Äì1974) and Sten Gudme, who in June 1941 left for London as a representative of the Danish resistance. In Stockholm, he was soon active in establishing a network of underground news informers in Denmark, with the help of his brother Gunnar Seidenfaden who worked in the Foreign Ministry, and his father, who at the time was the chief constable of Copenhagen's northern district. He tried to explain to the Allies the situation in occupied Denmark, where the sitting government wasn't a puppet but behaved like one. A situation which he later described in the book Hitler Beskyddar Denmark, published in Autumn 1943 under the pseudonym of Erik Ring in Stockholm by Tor Bonnier (1883‚Äì1976) at Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag, which in an abridged version was illegally distributed in occupied Denmark. In Stockholm, he forged close ties to the SOE-Special Operations Executive chief Ronald Turnbull (1914‚Äì2004) and became an SOE agent n.4388 with the rank of officer. Among the many Danes who flocked to the neutral Swedish capital and consolidated friendships were the writer and architect Poul Henningsen (1894‚Äì1967) and the journalist and writer Erling Bj√∏l (1918-). Among the Swedes in their circles, belonged writers like Eyvind Johnson (1900‚Äì1976) and Harry Martinsson (1904‚Äì1978). On 29 August 1943 the Germans took total administrative control of Denmark and, with Ebbe Munck, Seidenfaden established the news agency Dansk Presse Tjeneste, with paid staff servicing Swedish, British and American newspapers, radio stations and news agencies. The intelligence from Denmark, via DPT, involved several telegrams a day containing very valuable information, which also found its way to the BBC broadcasts directed at Denmark, where the censored local press did not carry stories which reflected negatively on the Nazi occupiers. Other beneficiaries were the SOE organisation, as well as the PWE, the Political Warfare Executive, which dealt with propaganda. The DPT service was particularly useful during the general strike in Copenhagen in July 1944, when all power was cut, nor the local press nor the Danish radio operated. As the Danish resistance movement gained strength and its activities became more incisive, he became involved in its decision-making, and repeatedly travelled to Denmark for negotiations with the Danish Freedom Council (Danmarks Frihedsr√•d). = Post Second World War= After the liberation in May 1945, the board of Politiken sought to appoint him as its editor, to distance themselves from an arguably collaborationist stance during the occupation. However, the newspaper's staff, loyal to Niels Hasager (1888‚Äì1969) who had led them since 1931, blocked it. In October 1945, with Sten Gudme, Seidenfaden started the foreign policy magazine Fremtiden to which he remained associated until 1968. He then joined forces with B√∏rge Outze (1912‚Äì1980), who had taken over the German-friendly printing press of F√¶drelandet to publish the daily Dagbladet Information. Both worked together for twenty years, in an association which influenced Danish press for its opinions, style, political independence and open debates. Many of their editorials were collected in the 1948 book Spidser. Information and Erik Seidenfaden probably exerted the strongest influence in the fields of defence and foreign policy, and his campaign for Denmark joining NATO in 1949 had crucial impact. But the newspaper was not pro-American all the time. Indeed, when its reporter Elsa Gress followed very critically phenomenon of McCarthysm in 1952 and 1954, Erik Seidenfaden gave a very unflattering presentation of McCarthy's career and even concluded by expressing the pious hope that somebody would eliminate the senator. = Later career = As a writer, lecturer and correspondent on the radio, he consistently advocated Denmark's position in the Western world and the European Community. His list of foreign policy writings include a book about Israel, Den hellige krig om det hellige land (1956), Atomv√•bnene og udenrigspolitiken (1958), Luft mellem magtblokkene? (1959) and Vejene til Europa (1970). Between 1965-75 he served as a member of the London-based Council of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and in 1976 of the Trilateral Commission. He was also a member of Det Udenrigspolitiske Selskab, a Danish foreign policy club. In 1965, he moved to Paris as the director of the Danish student house. There he initially worked as a correspondent for Information, but considering the paper to have become too left-wing for his liberal views, in 1967 he began to write for Berlingske Tidende. In 1980, again as a correspondent, he returned to Politiken and from 1975 worked for the Danish broadcasting company. His last book was Frederiksholm's Kanal og Verdenshavet (1982). At the end of WWII, he was awarded a British MBE. In 1974 he was awarded knighthood in the Dannebrog and in 1982 first degree.  Personal life  He married journalist Jytte Kaastrup Olsen (1913‚Äì2007) in 1935 in London and had two children: Annelise Kaastrup Seidenfaden (1937-) and Ebba Merete Seidenfaden (1940‚Äì1980), founder of the Publica√ß√µes Dom Quixote publishing house and life partner of Portuguese prime minister Francisco S√° Carneiro. He married second time around with the priest Lone Knutzon (1923‚Äì1978), with whom he had one child, T√∏ger Seidenfaden (1957‚Äì2011), who would later become editor-in-chief of Politiken. Erik Seidenfaden died in 1990 and was buried in Ordrup Cemetery in Copenhagen, Denmark.  References  Other Sources * Erik Seidenfaden.

Today, the company, founded in 1912 by Paul Craemer as Press-, Stanz- und Hammerwerke GmbH, employs a staff of around 1000 in metal forming, tool making and plastics processing and achieved a total operating performance of around 290 million Euros in 2019. The group consists of the umbrella company Craemer Holding GmbH, its subsidiary Craemer GmbH and the subsidiaries thereof.  Company profile  The Craemer Group is an internationally active family company specialised in metal forming, plastics processing and tool making. Their headquarters is the Craemer GmbH founded in 1912 and located in the German town of Herzebrock-Clarholz. Today, the group has five operating companies in Europe: the German headquarters with production in all three business activities, a metal factory in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°, Slovakia (Craemer Slovakia, s.r.o.Craemer Slovakia from craemer.sk) and in Attendorn, Germany (Craemer Attendorn GmbH & Co.

For the sales of its plastic programme, the Group also has an an independent sales office each in Lesquin (near Lille) (Craemer France Sarl.) and in Florida (Craemer US Corporation) as well as a branch office each in Poland and Dubai. In metal forming, Craemer develops, constructs and manufactures precision- stamped and large parts mainly for the automotive industry, in particular for the interior: primarily seat pans, but also seating components, elements for seatbelt systems and doors as well as crossbar beams. The focus of plastics processing lies in the development, production and marketing of plastic pallets, storage and transport containers as well as waste bins. In the field of \\"intelligent plastics pallets\\" Craemer supplies complete solutions to optimise logistics processes on the basis of RFID technology of the product brand Palcontrol. All the tools and moulds needed for production are made by Craemer's own toolmaking facility. With the production of their entire product range the company ranks among the leading European producers and is also recognised as one of the world's leading manufacturers of high quality plastic pallets.  History Company founder Paul Craemer In May 1912 the engineer Paul Craemer (1874‚Äì1940) founded the Press-, Stanz- und Hammerwerke GmbH for metal forming in the German town of Herzebrock, East-Westphalia. A rolling mill was established on the new premises on the outskirts of Herzebrock in 1928. After the Second World War, the eldest grandson of the company founder, Hans-Joachim Brandenburg, began the reconstruction of the company. In the 1950s the company was recognised as a major supplier of parts for agricultural machinery. In 1958, Craemer opened a new business activity for plastics processing and started with the injection moulding of large containers. In 1967, the company developed the worldwide first plastic pallet moulded in one shot, for which they received a patent in the same year. In the 1980s waste disposal containers were included in the plastic product range. In the business field of metal forming, 1978 marked the demolition of the hot rolling mill and thus the final change to the processing of cold rolling sheets. In the 1980s Craemer became established as an automotive supplier, manufacturing metal formed parts for cars. In 1997, the production started in the metal plant in Slovakia. In 2001, Craemer took over the Kliko-Entsorgunssysteme GmbH (Waste Disposal Systems), opened a plastics processing plant in Telford in 2006 and founded a distribution company in the Paris metropolitan area on May 1, 2009. In 2015, Craemer took over the SKA GmbH & Co. KG, a well-established, German metal processing company in Attendorn, Sauerland Region (Olpe district).

Datawatch was acquired by Altair Engineering for $13.10 a share at $176 Million. Technology Overview Datawatch's technology relies on in-memory OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes, which are displayed through a series of visualizations including treemaps. This allows the user to load data, select variables and hierarchical structures, and navigate through the resultant visualization, filtering, zooming and drilling (sometimes called slicing and dicing), to identify outliers, correlations and trends. Its streaming OLAP implementation takes an in-memory OLAP cube and allows data to be streamed through it. This combination makes the company's products attractive to industry verticals that require live streaming data, such as financial market data, utility grid monitoring and telecommunications network traffic analysis. This is very different than the vast majority of OLAP implementations in which cubes are rebuilt periodically for new batches of data.Be Your Own Rocket Scientist This support for streaming data with its products has allowed financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Citadel , and BlackRock to implement the Datawatch software within their real-time trading and risk applications.

As a young girl, Yonna and her older brother Stan were orphaned. When it was discovered that they possessed magical abilities, the villagers believed them to be cursed and they were persecuted and ostracized, eventually even exiled. A few years later, Stan has grown grim but still watches over Yonna. They now live alone in an isolated old fortress where there are no neighbors to cast stones at them. However, a government organization known only as \\"the Monarchy\\" is at odds with another organization known as \\"the Syndicate\\" and they both wish to capture the two magicians and use their powers to promote their own respective agendas. Nobody from the Syndicate appears in this film, but the Monarchy sends two agents under separate sets of instructions to try to take Yonna back to their headquarters. These orders put Piggot and Galda at odds with Stan, who will kill any intruders in his rage-fueled attempts to keep Yonna safe. Piggot tries to be clever and talk sense into Stan before approaching Yonna, while Galda takes a more direct approach and confronts Yonna. To his surprise, Yonna says she wants to stay in the tower, it is her choice because of the way people have treated her in the past. Even so, she has mixed feelings about her brother because he gets homicidally over- protective of her. But in the end, Galda plays the hero by giving Yonna her freedom instead of bringing her back to Monarchy HQ.http://www.crunchyroll.com/yonna-in-the-solitary-fortress/episode-1-yonna- in-the-solitary-fortress-505646 Reception It was shown at the 6th Waterloo Festival for Animated Cinema and at the 2008 Future Film Festival.

It is 32 metre wide and 12 metre high. It is surrounded by bronze sculptures of twelve lions, sirens, swans, and angels on the backs of dolphins. At the top of the fountain are three sculptures of female figures presenting Justice (towards the Cours Mirabeau), Agriculture (towards Marseille) and the Fine Arts (towards Avignon). They were sculpted by Joseph-Marius Ramus (1805-1888), Hippolyte Ferrat (1822-1882) and Louis-F√©lix Chabaud (1824-1902). The water first came from the Zola Canal built in 1854.

He is a practising lawyer. In 2013 his poetry collection The Sahara Testaments won the prestigious Nigeria Prize for Literature instituted by the Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG). In 2009, he won the Delphic Laurel in Poetry for his Yoruba poem \\"Songbird\\" at the Delphic Games in Jeju, South Korea.  Early life  Tade Layo Ipadeola was born in September 1970 in Fiditi, Oyo State. He graduated in Law at 21 from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife. Both his parents were teachers: his father taught literature at Fiditi Grammar School and retired as school principal; his mother taught Yoruba and English. Ipadeola started writing very early in life and won a regional prize when he was in the final year of his secondary school.  Literary career  After reading the works of J. P. Clarke and Christopher Okigbo, Ipadeola started writing poetry himself in 1990, and he says it took him 10‚Äì12 years of consistent practice to master the craft. His first collection was published in 1996. His second collection was A Time of Signs (2000). He self-published his third collection of poems, A Rain Fardel, in 2005. Ipadeola has also translated two classical Yoruba novels, by Daniel Fagunwa, into English: The Divine Cryptograph (Aditu); and The Pleasant Potentate of Ibudo (Ireke Onibudo), both in 2010, but they remain unpublished. In 2012 he translated W. H. Auden's first dramatic work Paid on Both Sides into Yoruba as Lamilami. Ipadeola feels great poetry cannot be produced without discipline, consistency and patience and bemoans the lack of patience in the new generation of Nigerian poets. He says: \\"Remember that poetry is like a baby. If you force it to come to this world before term, you have [a] premature [birth] and you have problems; you have to get an incubator, you have to get a specialist, you have to get special foods, so the best thing is to allow the child to come to term before you give birth to it. Some things in life cannot be forced and poetry is one of them.\\"  The Sahara Testaments  His third volume of poetry The Sahara Testaments, which won the Nigeria Prize ‚Äì the biggest literary prize in Africa that comes with $100,000 cash prize ‚Äì is a sequence of one-thousand quatrains on the nuances of the Sahara. The jury chaired by Prof. Romanus Egudu called The Sahara Testaments \\"a remarkable epic covering the terrain and people of Africa from the very dawn of creation, through the present, to the future.\\" It ‚Äúuses the Sahara as a metonymy for problems of Africa and indeed, the whole of humanity. It also contains potent rhetoric and satire on topical issues and personalities, ranging from Africa‚Äôs blood diamonds and inflation in Nigeria‚Ä¶\\" It was also noted that \\"Ipadeola‚Äôs use of poetic language demonstrates a striking marriage of thought and verbal artistry expressed in the blending of sound and sense.\\" Ipadeola‚Äôs work beat two other stiff contenders who made the final three, Ogochukwu Promise and Chidi Amu Nnadi, to clinch the prize. The poet Chiedu Ezeannah has observed that \\"it is like having Okigbo and Soyinka in one dizzying package\\". Ipadeola has said that he would use the $100,000 prize money to build a library in his hometown Ibadan in honour of the poet Kofi Awoonor, who was gunned down by terrorists at Kenya's Westgate Shopping Mall in September 2013. Ipadeola is the President of PEN Nigeria Centre. He lives in Ibadan with his wife and two children.

Troy Victor Post (February 3, 1906 ‚Äì May 24, 1998) was an insurance entrepreneur and executive who formed one of the largest insurance conglomerates in the United States in the early 1960s. In addition to being Chairman and President of his various insurance entities, Post was also Chairman of the Board of Dallas, Texas, based Braniff International Airways and National Car Rental beginning in 1964. Early years Troy Victor Post was born on February 3, 1906, in Haskell, Texas. His parents were Effie Mildred Hisie Post (1880‚Äì1974), a homemaker born in Dallas, Texas, and father John Sidney Post (1876‚Äì1970), born in Spearsville, Union Parish, Louisiana, was a real estate broker. Effie and John were married in 1897, and besides Troy, the Posts had another son, Virgil H. and two daughters, Ola M. and Fay Post. The family moved to Haskell, Texas in the early 1900s, where Troy was born. Education and military service During World War II he served in the military and after returning he formed a stock life insurance company, which is an insurance company owned by its shareholder's who elect a Board of Directors to conduct company business. Post's shrewd business acumen propelled the startup company to the forefront of the insurance business. Founder of Insurance Company Post married, Maurine Shook (1906‚Äì1990), of Fort Worth, Texas, in 1926 at the age of 20, and fathered a son, Troy Victor Post, Jr., who was born in 1930. In 1930, the family moved to Dallas, Texas, where he got his first full-time job with the First National Bank of Fort Worth. Mr. Post had shown an interest in banking and insurance, after he obtained the First National Bank position, and at the age of 27, Post formed his own insurance company in his hometown of Haskell, Texas. Post started his company with his meager savings of $130.00 USD. Post and his first wife divorced in 1935, and he moved to Houston, Texas. Post met Emma Louise \\"Lulu\\" Peavy (September 6, 1966 ‚Äì October 31, 2009) of Egewood, Texas in 1945. On January 10, 1946, the couple was married and maintained their residence in Dallas. The couple had one son, John A. Post, and two daughters, Jane Post Harelik and Judy Post Catalano. Greatamerica Corporation In 1962, Post formed Greatamerica Corporation, one of the nation's largest insurance conglomerates, that purchased controlling interest in Dallas based Braniff Airways, Inc., in 1964. Post was the principal shareholder of Greatamerica's stock and the company was headquartered on the top floor of Jim Ling's LTV Tower in downtown Dallas. In 1964, Mr. and Mrs. Post gave Lovers Lane United Methodist Church three acres to complete a nearly 10-acre parcel that became the church's home on the northeast corner of Northwest Highway and Inwood Road. Braniff Airways, Inc. On July 8, 1964, Greatamerica Corporation, one of the nation's largest life insurance and financial management companies, contracted to purchase the shares of Braniff's three largest shareholders that included a group of Dallas businessmen. The group, headed by J. Erik Jonsson, a cofounder and Mayor of the City of Dallas, had purchased a controlling interest in Braniff from former Texas Senator William A. Blakley. Senator Blakley, a close associate of Tom Braniff and developer of Exchange Park in Dallas, became the custodian of the Blakley- Braniff Foundation, after Mr. Braniff's death. The foundation owned all of Mr. and Mrs. Braniff's shares that they held in Braniff as a result of provisions in Mr. Braniff's Last Will and Testament. Greatamerica purchased 57.5 percent of Braniff outstanding shares which gave the insurance giant controlling interest in the Dallas-based international airline by a wide margin. The company paid approximately $41,000,000.00 USD for 1,665,000 shares of Braniff's stock. Greatamerica initially purchased 629,629 share of Braniff Airways Common Stock for the price of $25.00 USD per share. The company was able to purchase an additional 1.1 million shares, which gave it controlling interest, for the same $25.00 USD price per share. On August 12, 1964, the Braniff Airways, Inc., Board of Directors elected Troy Victor Post as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Post was Chairman and President of Greatamerica Corporation, who had purchased controlling interest in Braniff in July 1964. As a result of gaining controlling interest in Braniff Airways, he was elected to the Braniff Board along with two other Greatmerica officers. Ling Temco Vought Buys Greatamerica Dallas, based Ling Temco Vought, Inc, made tender offer to Greatamerica to purchase all of its stock on August 4, 1967. The acquisition was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board, on November 17, 1967, with stipulations that LTV greatly limit its business activities with Braniff International beyond ownership of the growing airline. At the time of the merger, Troy Post stepped down from the position of Chairman of the Board of Braniff Airways, Inc., and also relinquished his Board position. Braniff President Harding L. Lawrence replaced Mr. Post as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Board memberships In addition to his duties as Chairman of the Board and President of Greatamerica, Mr. Post also held the following positions: * American Life Insurance Company - Chairman of the Board and President * Gulf Life Insurance Company - Chairman of the Board * Franklin Life Insurance Company - Chairman of the Executive Committee * Amicable Life Insurance Company - Chairman of the Board * First Western Bank and Trust Company, of California - Chairman of the Board * National Bank of Commerce of Dallas - Chairman of the Board (owned 30 percent interest in the bank) * Wells, Rich, Greene, Inc. - Member, Board of Directors - 1966 Honors * In Process Publications As I See It - speech written by Mr. Post for the June 1966, Achievement Awards Dinner in Dallas, Texas.

History Garrick played between 1866 and 1878. They, along with the Wellington club, became the first clubs to play in the world's first two football competitions. In the Youdan Cup, Garrick lost by one goal and one rouge to nothing at the Cremorne ground on London Road. The following year they entered the Cromwell Cup and after beating Wellington (apparently borrowing seven players from Heeley to ensure victory) they met the newly formed Wednesday in the final at Bramall Lane. In front of around 500 spectators the two clubs fought out a goalless draw. It was agreed to play extra time with the first team to score being the victor (thus becoming the first use of the Golden Goal). Unfortunately Garrick were the losers when Wednesday scored a goal after 10 minutes. Garrick then withdrew from playing the more popular local teams, instead taking on the minor teams and playing the occasional out of town match (including one of Sheffield's first rugby matches against Manchester Free Wanderers) and also the occasional match against the local pantomime actors ‚Äì which were huge matches attracting crowds almost as big as the local cup finals.

The accident occurred at the Arizona Last Stop Gun Range (also known as \\"Bullets and Burgers\\") in White Hills, Arizona, where Vacca had worked for about eighteen months. According to county law officials the shooting is being viewed as an industrial accident. The minimum age set by the shooting range to fire a weapon is eight years old provided that the child is supervised by a parent, as the girl was. It was also legal for Arizona Last Stop to own the fully automatic Uzi because it was manufactured and purchased prior to the passage of the Firearm Owners Protection Act in 1986 and added to the NFA machine gun registry where all fully automatic civilian owned firearms are registered. Sequence of events According to the girl's father, their family had traveled from their Las Vegas hotel to the Last Stop at approximately 9:45 AM. The family then took a ride on a monster truck before arriving at the gun range. At the range, the girl's father was the first to shoot, followed by the girl herself. The girl's mother videotaped her daughter trying out the Uzi, and said she watched as the gun recoiled and her daughter lost control of it. The girl reportedly said the Uzi was \\"too much\\" for her after she fired the weapon and was unable to control the muzzle rise, causing the barrel to be directed at Vacca. Vacca is believed to have died from a single shot to the head. He was airlifted to a Las Vegas hospital, where he died. Reactions The shooting ignited a discussion regarding whether children should be legally allowed to handle fully automatic weapons such as Uzis. Mel Robbins, writing for CNN, argued that it should be against the law for such a young child to shoot an Uzi. She added that, in her view, the girl was not to blame for her instructor's death, but that the instructor and the girl's parents were at fault. The owner of Last Stop, Sam Scarmardo, said it was considered pretty standard to allow children onto the range, and that he was reconsidering this policy in light of the accident. Writing for National Review Online, Robert B. Young wrote that only one other incident had occurred in which a child killed someone with an automatic weapon, and therefore concluded that \\"two incidents in six years do not an epidemic make, not even a trend.\\" He also concluded that as gun ownership increased, the frequency of serious gun accidents involving children had decreased, attributing this to \\"improved education for young people becoming acquainted with firearms\\". =Vacca's family members= Vacca's family, including his ex-wife, Anamarie Vacca, have said they harbor no ill will toward the girl who accidentally killed Charles Vacca. Anamarie also said that her children want to write a letter to the girl, \\"knowing their family has to grieve through the same process.\\" In an interview aired on The Today Show on August 29, Vacca's daughter Ashley said that her father's death was a \\"tragic accident\\" and expressed her sympathy for the girl and her family. On September 12, Vacca's four children wrote a letter to the girl, in which they said that \\"Our dad would want you to know that you should move forward with your life.\\" On the one-year anniversary of the shooting, Charles Vacca's children launched the We Have A Voice initiative, which is an online petition aimed at building a coalition to support and pass legislation that prohibits young children from using fully automatic weapons. =The girl's family members= Members of the family of the girl who shot Vacca released a statement on September 2 saying they were \\"devastated\\" by the accident. The family's lawyer, Kevin Walsh, stated that the family \\"prayed day and night that [Vacca] would survive his injury, and they continue to pray for his family during this terribly difficult time.\\" =Legislators= In response to the shooting, Victoria Steele, a Democratic member of the Arizona House of Representatives, proposed a ban on allowing children under the age of sixteen to use machine guns. Steele told the Phoenix New Times that \\"I'm disgusted that we even need such a law -- that parents can't be trusted to not give a machine gun to a 9-year-old girl.\\" In addition, on September 4, 2014, Democratic senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (both from California) wrote a letter to the president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation urging him to help implement policies prohibiting children from shooting fully automatic weapons at shooting ranges. In February 2015, the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health recommended that a range-safety officer should be on site at the shooting range where Vacca was shot. They also recommended limiting weapons available to certain shooters and ensuring shooters are comfortable with weapons before they are switched into automatic. In March 2015, Barbara Norton, a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, introduced a bill to prohibit children under the age of twelve from using Uzis. Investigations The shooting was investigated by the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health, the state's workplace safety agency. It was also investigated by the Mohave County Sheriff's Office, which, after this investigation concluded, declined to pursue criminal charges against the girl. On September 2, police reports were released indicating that immediately after the shooting, the girl had said she felt the gun was too much for her and had hurt her shoulder. The report also indicated that the girl's family had been focused on her just after the shooting, because they thought she was injured, and had not realized that Vacca had been shot until one of his colleagues ran over to him.

History  The University of Iowa was founded on February 25, 1847‚Äîexactly 59 days after Iowa officially became a state. Five out of the first six graduates received teacher education degrees. In addition, the University of Iowa was the first university in the nation to create a college-level department of education. From its inception, many discoveries and innovations have come from the University of Iowa College of Education. In 1945, Professor E.F. Lindquist created the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, now called the Iowa Assessments, a standardized testing program for elementary and middle school students that is still used nationally today. In 1942, Professor Lindquist created the Iowa Tests of Educational Development, which tests high school students. Later in the 1950s, Professor Lindquist created the ACT, and also invented a machine that electronically scans and scores exams. Later, in the 1980s, The Connie Belin and Jacqueline N. Blank International Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development was created as Iowa‚Äôs first center for gifted education. The Belin-Blank Center has continued to pioneer research and programming for gifted education within the university, state, and country.  Impact  The University of Iowa College of Education places special emphasis on working with school districts and students all across the state and nation. Professors, graduate students, and undergraduate students all have components of their work outside of the University of Iowa and inside local classrooms. Additionally, professors serve as experts on many national topics involving education. * Talk to Text Program This is a two-day bootcamp for Cedar Rapids students to learn about technologies that can help students who have a challenging time with writing or typing. It is hosted by the Iowa Center for Assistive Technology Education and Research. * Innovation Institute This is a two-week program on the University of Iowa campus that teaches high school students entrepreneurship and technical skills. * African American Awareness Program This annual event is for Cedar Rapids middle school students who identify with African American culture. They tour the University of Iowa and participate in a book discussion. * Invent Iowa This event has occurred since 1987, and it is Iowa's oldest STEM program. Since its inception, it has engaged more than one million K-12 students. * Malik Henfield, professor in the Counselor Education and Supervision program, addressed the racial and equity gaps in ACT scores to Education Week. * John Westefeld, a professor in Counseling Psychology, shared his insight in suicide after the death of comedian, Robin Williams. * Deborah Linebarger, an associate professor and director of the Children's Media Lab, presented her research on the effects of TV programs on the learning of babies and toddlers. * David Tjaden was named to Forbes's 30 under 30 in education for his work leading the National Education Association Student Program. * Leslie Flynn, a science education professor, serves on a state task force to review the Next Generation Science Standards.

Primary technologies used to create them include: * Custom Elements: APIs to define new HTML elements * Shadow DOM: encapsulated DOM and styling, with composition * HTML Templates: HTML fragments that are not rendered, but stored until instantiated via JavaScript  Features  = Custom Elements= There are two parts to Custom Elements: autonomous custom elements and customized built-in elements. Autonomous custom elements are HTML elements that are entirely separated from native HTML elements; they are essentially built from the bottom up using the Custom Elements API. Customized built-in elements are elements that are built upon native HTML elements to reuse their functionality. = Shadow DOM = Shadow DOM is a functionality that allows the web browser to render DOM elements without putting them into the main document DOM tree. This creates a barrier between what the developer and the browser can reach; the developer cannot access the Shadow DOM in the same way they would with nested elements, while the browser can render and modify that code the same way it would with nested elements. The impact of CSS scoped within the Shadow DOM of a particular element is that HTML elements can be encapsulated without the risk of CSS styles leaking and affecting elements that they were not supposed to affect. Although these elements are encapsulated with regard to HTML and CSS, they can still fire events that can be picked up by other elements in the document. The scoped subtree in an element is called a shadow tree. The element the shadow tree is attached to is called a shadow host. Shadow DOM must always be connected to an existing element, either through attaching it as a literal element or through scripting. In JavaScript, you attach Shadow DOM to an element using \`Element.attachShadow()\`. The ability to scope HTML and CSS is essential to the creation of Custom Elements. If shadow DOM did not exist, different external Custom Elements could interact in unwanted ways. = HTML Template = HTML template is a way to insert chunks of HTML that are stamped at will. The syntax of HTML templates looks like this: # Scripts will not run, and resources that are inside a template will not be fetched until the template is stamped out.  Browser support  Web Components are supported by all major browsers. Backward compatibility with older browsers is implemented using JavaScript-based polyfills.  Libraries  There are several libraries that are built on Web Components with the aim of increasing the level of abstraction when creating custom elements. Some of these libraries are X-Tag, Slim.js, Polymer, Bosonic, Riot.js, and Smart HTML Elements. Two of these, Bosonic and Polymer, provide ready-made components that are free to use.

MateCat is released as open source software under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) from the Free Software Foundation.

CAT tools  The objective of MateCat is to create a tool to edit machine translation results and manage localization workflow. The system is able to learn from mistakes, automatically improve over time and specialize in field- specific language (for example, legal terminology) to provide the user the most accurate translation suggestions in a completely automatic and transparent manner.https://www.fbk.eu/en/result/matecat/ CAT tools provide access to translation memories (TMs), terminology databases, concordance tools and, more recently, to machine translation (MT) engines. A TM is basically a repository of translated segments. During translation, the CAT tool queries the TM to search for exact or fuzzy matches of the current source segment. These matches are proposed to the user as translation suggestions. Once a segment is translated, its source and target texts are added to the TM for future queries. The integration of suggestions from an MT engine as a complement to TM matches is motivated by recent studies, which have shown that post-editing MT suggestions substantially improves the level of accuracy in translations.  Technology  = Statistical MT = The MateCat tool runs as a web-server accessible through Chrome. The CAT web-server connects with other services via open APIs: the TM server MyMemory, the commercial Google Translate (GT) MT server, and a list of Moses -based servers specified in a configuration file. While MyMemory‚Äôs and GT‚Äôs servers are always running and available, customized Moses servers have to be first installed and set-up. Communication with the Moses servers extends the GT API in order to support self-tuning, user-adaptive and informative MT functions. XLIFF is the file format natively supported by the open source version of the MateCat tool; however external file converters can be added in the MateCat configuration file. The tool supports Unicode (UTF-8) encoding, including non-Latin alphabets and right-to-left languages, and handles texts embedding mark-up tags. MateCat leverages the growing interest and expectations in statistical MT by advancing the state-of-the-art along three directions: Self-tuning MT, User adaptive MT, Informative MT. Research along these three directions has converged into a new generation CAT software, which is both an enterprise level translation workbench as well as an advanced research platform for integrating new MT functions, running post-editing experiments and measuring user productivity. These include: i) an advanced API for the Moses Toolkit, customizable to languages and domains, ii) ease of use through a clean and intuitive web interface that enables the collaboration of multiple users on the same project, iii) concordances, terminology databases and support for customizable quality estimation components and iv) advanced logging functionalities. = MT support = The tool supports Moses-based servers able to provide an enhanced CAT-MT communication. In particular, the GT API is augmented with feedback information provided to the MT engine every time a segment is post-edited as well as enriched MT output, including confidence scores, word lattices, etc. The developed MT server supports multi-threading to serve multiple translators, handles text segments including tags and adapts from the post-edits performed by each user Nicola Bertoldi, Mauro Cettolo, and Marcello Federico. 2013. Cache-based Online Adaptation for Machine Translation Enhanced Computer Assisted Translation. In Proceedings of the MT Summit XIV, pages 35‚Äì42, Nice, France, September. = Context-aware translation = MateCat also provides suggestions by MT which are consistent with respect not only to the already edited segments but also, in theory, to the whole document. This context information will be embedded in the statistical models and should enable better disambiguation, for instance, between lexical alternatives. The context-based models will combine information about recurring terms and expressions extracted during the document analysis with the corresponding chosen and confirmed translations as soon as they become available. In particular, translation constraints related to inter-sentence and intra-sentence anaphoric expressions, to syntactic concordances, and to lexical coherence will be taken into account by means of specific statistical models. = Real-time processing = The core components of traditional MT systems, that is, the translation and the language models, are generally static: they never change after an initial training phase. This means that they are unsuitable for a dynamic environment like the one that MateCat is designing for translators. In order to model the dynamic changes depicted in the two previous tasks, MateCat developed innovative data-structures that can be rapidly and effectively updated as soon as a new translation is supplied by the user, and innovative, efficient algorithms for performing this adaptation in such a way that the whole process takes place in real time and is transparent to the translator. Moreover, efficiency will be improved by taking advantage of single CPU multithreading, as well as distributed computing facilities running on private clusters or computer clouds. = Edit log = Figure 1 - The MateCat Tool edit log page. During post-editing the tool collects timing information for each segment, which is updated every time the segment is opened and closed. Moreover, for each segment, information is collected about the generated suggestions and the one that has actually been post-edited. This information is accessible at any time through a link in the Editing Page, named Editing Log. The Editing Log page (Figure 1) shows a summary of the overall editing performed so far on the project, such as the average translation speed and post-editing effort and the percentage of top suggestions coming from MT or the TM. Moreover, for each segment, sorted from the slowest to the fastest in terms of translation speed, detailed statistics about the performed edit operations are reported. This information, with even more details, can be also downloaded as a CSV file to perform a more detailed post-editing analysis. While the information shown in the Edit Log page is very useful to monitor progress of a translation project in real time, the CSV file is a fundamental source of information for detailed productivity analyses once the project is ended.  Applications  MateCat has been used by the MateCat project to investigate new MT functionsBertoldi et al., 2013; Cettolo et al., 2013; Turchi et al., 2013; Turchi et al., 2014 and to evaluate them in a real professional setting, in which translators have at their disposal all the sources of information they are used to working with. Moreover, taking advantage of its flexibility and ease of use, the tool has been recently used for data collection and education purposes (a course on CAT technology for students in translation studies). An initial version of the tool has also been leveraged by the CasmaCat project to create a workbench,Vicent Alabau, Ragnar Bonk, Christian Buck, Michael Carl, Francisco Casacuberta, Mercedes Garca- Martiƒ±nez,, Jesus Gonzalez, Philipp Koehn, Luis Leiva, Bartolom√© Mesa-Lao, Daniel Oriz, Herv√© Saint-Amand, German Sanchis, and Chara Tsiukala. 2013.

Currently the tool is employed by the translation agency Translated.net for their internal translation projects and is being tested by several international companies, both language service providers and IT companies. This has made it possible to collect continuous feedback from hundreds of translators, which besides helping us to improve the robustness of the tool is also influencing the way new MT functions will be integrated to supply the best help to the final user.

The college is the seventh medical school established in Thailand by a royal command of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Phramongkutklao College of Medicine is an affiliated college of Mahidol University.  History  In 1939 the government of Thailand approved the establishment of the \\"Army Medic School.\\" The Army Medic School trained doctors serving in the Royal Thai Army until 1947 when the program was halted due to a lack of equipment and educators. The idea of reopening the school popped up various times from 1947 to 1973, but was rejected due to a lack of readiness. However, in 1973, in King Bhumibol Adulyadej's speech to medical students at Siriraj Hospital, the idea of reestablishing a medical cadet school was revived. On October 3, 1973, the Royal Thai Army approved the establishment of a \\"Medical Cadet College,\\" which was renamed \\"Phramongkutklao College of Medicine\\" one year later. The name \\"Phramongkutklao\\" was granted by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. It was the regal name of King Vajiravudh, King Bhumibol Adulyadej's uncle. The college was officially established on the 16th of June in 1975. Education Phramongkutklao College admits around 100 medical military cadets per academic year through the Consortium of Thai Medical Schools Examination (‡∏Å‡∏™‡∏û‡∏ó). The course of study is separated into three parts over six years. In the first (pre-medical) year, cadets study at the Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University. In the second and third (preclinical) years, cadets study at the college, while the clinical years (fourth, fifth and sixth) is taught at Phramongkutklao Hospital. The military training component is provided by the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy. Graduates from Phramongkutklao College of Medicine can apply for Royal Thai Army, Royal Thai Navy, Royal Thai Air Force, Royal Thai Armed Forces Headquarters as military doctors or for Ministry of Public Health (Thailand) as civilian doctors.

The original series was published in Italy monthly between September 1966 and January 1990, reached 281 numbers (mostly episodes on 64 black and white pages). Between 1990 and 2000, there were published 11 numbers of Mark Special, of 128 or 160 pages each. Comandante Mark was created, written and illustrated by the trio EsseGesse. It chronicled the adventurous exploits of the eponymous Commander Mark (an orphan raised by Ontario natives after a shipwreck) fighting against English 'redcoats' between 1773 and 1781. Aiding him in his struggle are several colorful comprimaries like the native Sad Owl, Mister Bluff (a former corsair and avuncular figure for Mark) and Bluff's faithful dog, Flok, 'El Gancho', and Betty (Mark's fianc√©e) . Plot Against the background of the American Revolutionary War, Comandante Mark is presented to the readers as a handsome, brave, sturdy and invincible young man, who nonetheless does not convey any trace of the aloofness that is often generated by a protagonist's sense of superiority over the surrounding world. Mark has just the right degree of self-confidence as a hero and he radiates a warm feeling of confidence; he has accumulated excellent experience in his field (pitched battles and uncompromising warfare against the soldiers of George III) and he uses his vast knowledge on every occasion and always succeeds. He moves together with the Ontario Wolves, a group of indomitable guerrilla fighters, composed of men and women from many different places, of all ages and from all social classes, people with different histories and past lives who have joined together.http://fantasy-world.awardspace.com/comics/ References External links *Official site of Sergio Bonelli Editore (English and Italian) Category:1966 comics debuts Category:1990 comics endings Category:2000 comics endings Category:Italian comics titles Category:Comics set during the American Revolutionary War Category:Comics set in Ontario ","title":"Comandante Mark"},{"id":"43690345","text":"Carlton R.

Quine, 1899 William Edward Quine (February 9, 1847 ‚Äì December 7, 1922) was a Manx American physician, academic, and philanthropist. Immigrating to Chicago, Illinois, United States in 1853, Quine attended the Northwestern University College of Medicine and accepted a professorship there upon his graduation. In 1883, he joined the College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he taught for the rest of his life. From 1892 until the merge with the University of Illinois in 1913, he served as dean. Quine donated funds to build a hospital and four schools in China and established a deaconess in Normal, Illinois. Biography William Edward Quine was born in Kirk St. Ann (now Santon), Isle of Man, British Isles on February 9, 1847. He immigrated with his parents to Chicago, Illinois, United States in 1853. He attended Chicago High School, then studied medicine independently while working as a drug store clerk. Quine matriculated at the Northwestern University College of Medicine in 1866. When he graduated in 1869, the school appointed him professor of materia medica and therapeutics. From 1871 to 1883, he was an attending physician to Cook County Hospital and Mercy Hospital. In 1883, he left the university to join the new College of Physicians and Surgeons. From 1892 to 1913, he was dean of the medical school. He argued on behalf of merging the school with the University of Illinois in 1913. He remained on the staff for the rest of his life. An honorary Legum Doctor was conferred upon him from the school in 1904. For 1910 to 1922, he was on the consulting staffs of St. Luke's Hospital and the Michael Reese Hospital. Quine was named president of the Chicago Medical Society in 1872. From 1885 to 1889, he was president of the Illinois State Board of Health. In 1904, he accepted the presidency of the Illinois State Medical Society. He founded the library at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Urbana in 1912, which bears his name. In memory of his daughter, who died in childhood, he founded the Ruth Quine Deaconess in Normal, Illinois. A devout Methodist, Quine donated his house to the Chicago Missionary and Church Extension Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Its intended use was as a community house for the African-American Methodist community. Like Edmund J. James, the president of the University of Illinois, Quine was interested in building ties with China. He built a hospital for women with 100 beds in Zhenjiang. He named it in honor of his wife, who had been a missionary to that nation. Quine also endowed four schools for girls throughout China, each bearing her name. Quine died in Chicago on December 7, 1922, from angina pectoris.
