The primary training aircraft were the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat and the Curitss-Wright AT-9 Jeep. At the end of hostilities in Europe, Altus AAF was inactivation and on 15 May 1945 placed on temporary inactive status. Between 1945 and 1953, Altus AFB served as a scrap yard for hundreds of World War II era military aircraft. In 1945 the famous B-17F \\"Memphis Belle\\" was discovered at Altus awaiting disposal. The aircraft was saved and transferred to the city of Memphis, Tennessee, where it was displayed until 2005, when it was relocated to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. =Cold War= The base sat idle for only a few years. The onset of the Korean War in June 1950 created the need for more men to fly and service aircraft. During the early years of the conflict, many World War II airfields were examined for reactivation. On 1 August 1953, Altus Air Force Base was reactivated as a training base for transport aircraft. The C-47 \\"Skytrain\\" and the C-45 \\"Expediter\\" were the main aircraft assigned to the base, run briefly by the 63d Troop Carrier Wing from 8 January until 15 October 1953 under the watch of the Tactical Air Command (TAC). During the 1950s, the base underwent many changes and changed hands from TAC to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). Later that year, on 18 November, the 96th Bombardment Wing, Medium (96 BMW), arrived and began operations with three bomber squadrons and one air refueling squadron. The squadrons eventually flew the first all jet-engined bomber, the B-47 Stratojet and the KC-97 Stratofreighter, a dual-purpose cargo and air- refueling aircraft. By the end of the decade, both of these aircraft would be replaced by aircraft still in the Air Force inventory, the KC-135 Stratotanker and the B-52 Stratofortress. The KC-135 was the first all jet-engined air- refueling aircraft and the B-52 still remains the backbone of the USAF bomber fleet. When the 96th BW moved to Dyess AFB, Texas, the 11th Bombardment Wing (Heavy) activated and stood on alert during the Cold War. June 1961 witnessed the activation of twelve Atlas ‚ÄúF‚Äù intercontinental ballistic missile sites within a 40-mile radius of the base. Controlled by the 577th Strategic Missile Squadron, the missiles sat inside a silo, constructed underground with a launch facility, and manned around the clock. The missile silos became operational on 10 October 1962, but the activation would be short-lived. By April 1965, the Atlas missile was outdated and was phased out of the national strategic defense plan. In August 1966, the 4th Mobile Communications Group transferred from Hunter AFB, Georgia, to Altus. The unit's mission consisted of providing mobile and transportable communication services, aiding navigation and air traffic control throughout the world. In 1967, the Air Force began searching for a base that could handle the training for its strategic airlift fleet, the C-141 Starlifter and its newest and largest transport aircraft, the C-5 Galaxy. Again, Oklahoma proved to be well suited for the mission. The Military Airlift Command (MAC) assumed command of the base from SAC and activated the 443d Military Airlift Wing (443 MAW), Training, to assume host wing responsibilities and to fly alongside the SAC aircraft that would become a tenant command at Altus. By the start of the 1970s, Altus AFB had three aircraft type/models assigned: KC-135s, C-141s, and C-5s. For the KC-135 aircraft at Altus still under SAC's control, the USAF activated the 340th Air Refueling Wing, which continued to operate the base's KC-135s. =Modern era= The post Cold War environment brought many changes to Altus AFB. On 1 June 1992, the Air Force reorganized and the Military Airlift Command (MAC) disestablished. In its place the new Air Mobility Command (AMC) was activated, which placed MAC's strategic and tactical airlift aircraft and SAC's aerial refueling aircraft under a single command. Second, the 443d Airlift Wing and the 340th Air Refueling Wing were inactivated, with the latter's aircraft transferred to the 19th Air Refueling Wing (19 ARW) at Robins AFB, Georgia. On 1 October, the first Air Mobility Wing (AMW), the 97th Air Mobility Wing (97 AMW), arrived at Altus without personnel or equipment, having formerly been designated as SAC's 97th Bombardment Wing and having been transferred from the deactivating Eaker AFB, Arkansas as a result of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action. The 97 AMW was tasked with flight crew formal training unit (FTU) responsibilities for the C-141 and C-5 aircrew, and with the closure of Castle AFB, California due to BRAC action, concurrently assumed FTU responsibilities for KC-135E/R/T flight crews. On 1 July 1993, the 97th was transferred from AMC to the newly established Air Education and Training Command (AETC) as part of a USAF initiative to move most FTU activities to AETC. More changes were on the horizon. In 1996, the latest addition to Altus AFB, the new C-17 Globemaster III, arrived. Even before its arrival, the base began training pilots and loadmasters to operate and fly the aircraft. In August 2002, the mission of the wing grew when the Air Force moved the basic loadmaster course from Sheppard AFB, Texas, to Altus. This initiative combined similar training programs to reduce the number of moves required by trainees while cutting overall costs. Additionally, during that same month, the wing reorganized as a \\"combat wing\\": the 97th Support Group became the 97th Mission Support Group, gaining the new 97th Logistics Readiness Squadron (comprising the former 97th Supply Squadron, 97th Transportation Squadron and logistics plans flight) and the 97th Contracting Squadron. Also, the 97th Logistics Group inactivated and the 97th Maintenance Directorate was activated. The directorate comprises civil-service personnel, who are responsible for the care and maintenance of all three airframes at the base. The 97 AMW discontinued FTU responsibilities for the C-141 concurrent with that aircraft's retirement from the USAF inventory in 2006. On 1 July 2007, the Air Force Reserve Command's (AFRC) 433d Airlift Wing (433 AW) at Lackland AFB/Kelly Field (former Kelly AFB) assumed responsibility for all flying training and academic training for the C-5 aircraft for all Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) aircrews, leaving the 97 AMW and Altus to concentrate on C-17 and KC-135 training for AMC, USAFE, PACAF, AFRC and ANG aircrews. =Previous names= * Established on 17 June 1942 as: AAF Advanced Flying School, Altus, Oklahoma * Altus Army Airfield, 8 April 1943 * AAF Pilot School (Advanced TE), Altus Army Airfield, 6 August 1943 ‚Äì 23 April 1946 * Inactivated 23 April 1946 ‚Äì 3 March 1953 * Altus Air Force Base, 3 March 1953 ‚Äì present =Major commands to which assigned= * AAF Gulf Coast Training Cen, 26 June 1942 * AAF Central Flying Training Comd, 31 July 1943 * AAF Technical Service Comd, 16 May 1945 * Air Technical Service Comd, 1 July 1945 ‚Äì 9 March 1946 * Tactical Air Command, 11 June 1952 * Strategic Air Command, 21 June 1954 * Military Airlift Command, 1 July 1968 * Air Mobility Command, 1 October 1992 * Air Education and Training Command, 1 July 1993 ‚Äì present =Base operating units= * 453rd Base HQ and Air Base Squadron, 6 October 1942 ‚Äì 1 May 1944 * 2508th AAF Base Unit (Pilot School), 1 May 1944 ‚Äì 16 May 1945 * 4124th AAF Base Unit, 16 May ‚Äì 13 December 1945 * 63d Air Base Group, 8 January 1953 * 4037th Air Base Group, 15 October 1953 ‚Äì 18 November 1953 * 96th Air Base Group, 18 November 1953 * 11th Combat Support Gp, 1 March 1959 ‚Äì 8 July 1968 * 443rd Air Base (later Combat Support) Group, 8 July 1968 * 97th Mission Support Group 1 October 1992 ‚Äì present =Major units assigned= * Army Air Force Pilot School (Advanced Training), 26 June 1942 ‚Äì 15 May 1945 * 4124 Army Air Force Base Unit, 15 May 1945 ‚Äì 13 December 1945 * 63d Troop Carrier Wing, 8 January 1953 ‚Äì 14 October 1953 * 96th Bombardment Wing, 18 November 1953 ‚Äì 7 September 1957 * 11th Bombardment Wing, 13 December 1957 ‚Äì 25 March 1969 * 340th Air Refueling Wing, 1 July 1977 ‚Äì 1 October 1992 * 443d Military Airlift Wing, Training, 5 May 1969 ‚Äì 1 October 1992 * 97th Air Mobility Wing 1 October 1992 ‚Äì present * Jackson County Composite Squadron Civil Air Patrol =SM-65F Atlas Missile Sites= SM-65F Atlas Missile silos The 577th Strategic Missile Squadron operated twelve missile sites, of one missile at each site: * 577‚Äì1 2.2 mi NNE of Lugert, OK * 577‚Äì2 3.8 mi SSE of Cambridge, OK * 577‚Äì3 0.8 mi SE of Mountain Park, OK * 577‚Äì4 2.1 mi WSW of Cache, OK * 577‚Äì5 4.0 mi NNE of Manitou, OK * 577‚Äì6 2.2 mi NNE of Frederick, OK * 577‚Äì7 4.8 mi SE of Ranchland, TX * 577‚Äì8 0.6 mi NE of Creta, OK * 577‚Äì9 3.7 mi NNW of Gould, OK * 577‚Äì10 6.2 mi SW of Mangum, OK * 577‚Äì11 1.0 mi NE of Willow, OK * 577‚Äì12 2.7 mi WSW of Granite, OK Note: The missile at the Frederick, OK, site exploded in May 1964.

A defender, Cherry also played for Huddersfield Town and Bradford City, and managed the latter club. Born in Huddersfield, he started his career at his hometown team before he made his name at Leeds United during the 1970s, making 486 appearances and winning the Championship title in 1973‚Äì74. He won a total of 27 international caps and captained the England team on one occasion. Playing career =Huddersfield Town= Born in Huddersfield on 23 January 1948, Cherry joined his hometown club Huddersfield Town as part of the groundstaff in July 1963 as a 15-year-old from the Huddersfield YMCA, before signing a full-time professional contract in 1965. He made his debut in 1965, aged 17, establishing himself as a classy defender who could play anywhere across the back line, and helped Huddersfield win the Second Division title in the 1969‚Äì70 season. They were relegated after two seasons in the top flight and in 1972 Cherry left for local rivals Leeds United after making a total of 188 appearances; he had impressed Leeds manager Don Revie enough for him to consider him a potential replacement for Jack Charlton. =Leeds United= Cherry ‚Äì along with teammate Roy Ellam ‚Äì moved along the M62 in 1972 when Leeds paid ¬£100,000 to Huddersfield for his services. He ended up playing both alongside and instead of Charlton in his first season but predominantly at left back, replacing broken leg victim Terry Cooper. By the end of the season Cherry had amassed 38 League appearances and was selected by Revie for the 1973 FA Cup final, which Leeds lost to Sunderland. He did, however, win the League championship with Leeds in 1973‚Äì74, as the team went on a record 29-match unbeaten run at the start of the season to make sure the title would be theirs; Cherry spent much of the season at left back, playing 38 times in total. The following season, 1974‚Äì75, was a mixed year for Cherry. Injury curtailed half of his season, but he recovered in time to help Leeds in their European Cup campaign as it progressed towards the semi-finals and a game against Barcelona. Cherry marked Dutch legend Johan Cruyff out of each leg as Leeds reached the final, but after missing subsequent League matches through suspension, manager Jimmy Armfield placed him on the substitute's bench for the final against Bayern Munich, and he did not play. In 1976, Cherry became Leeds captain after Billy Bremner left, and won his first England cap. He continued to play for Leeds until 1982, the year that the club were relegated to the Second Division, and won the club's Player of The Season award in 1981. In 2000, Cherry was voted the 30th best Leeds United player by its fans. =Bradford City and management= Cherry played three months of Second Division football for Leeds before leaving for another neighbouring club, Bradford City, where he became player-manager. He played for three years until he retired to concentrate on management. His final game in football was City's 2‚Äì0 win against Bolton Wanderers on 6 May 1985 which captured the Division Three title. Cherry also won the Third Division manager of the season award. However, Cherry's own personal success paled into insignificance when the Valley Parade ground was devastated by the Bradford City stadium fire during the final game of the season on 11 May 1985, killing 56 people. The subsequent appeal to raise money for the bereaved families and injured supporters raised more than four million pounds, and Cherry was among the mourners at many funerals. He steered Bradford to 13th place the following season despite the club having to play home games at three other grounds; Odsal Stadium, Bradford and his former home grounds of Elland Road and Leeds Road. Cherry was manager when City returned to Valley Parade in December 1986 but was sacked the following month when the club was struggling ‚Äì a surprise decision that provoked angry demonstrations against the board. International career Cherry won his first English cap on 24 March 1976 against Wales. He became the first England player to be sent off in an international friendly, when he was sent off against Argentina in 1977. Cherry lost two teeth after being punched in the mouth by Daniel Bertoni, whom Cherry had felled with a nasty tackle from behind; Bertoni also received a red card. England did not qualify for the 1978 World Cup, but did so for the 1980 European Championships, and Cherry was included in the squad of 22 to travel there. In a warm-up game just before the tournament, Cherry captained his country for the only time in a 2‚Äì1 win against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His tournament was limited, however, to a single substitute appearance against Spain. It was to be his 27th and final cap. Post-football After he was sacked by Bradford City, Cherry gave up football in general for a number of years. He ran a promotions and hospitality company in Huddersfield, a waste paper company and a five-a- side football centre. In 2004, he also made a bid to buy into Leeds United. He was also given an honorary degree by the University of Huddersfield in November 2005. Cherry died suddenly on 29 April 2020, aged 72. He was survived by his wife Sue, with whom he had two sons and a daughter, and five grandchildren.

Early life Tillstrom was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Bert and Alice Burr Tillstrom. He attended Senn High School in Chicago and later the University of Chicago. While still a freshman, he accepted a job offer from the WPA-Chicago Parks District Theatre to set up a marionette theater. Career Tillstrom turned his attention to puppetry in the early 1930s and created Kukla in 1936. Kukla remained nameless until the Russian ballerina Tamara Toumanova referred to him as kukla, the Russian word for \\"doll\\". Other famous puppets from Tillstrom's group included Ollie (Oliver J. Dragon), Beulah Witch, Goultar, Cecil Bill, and Fletcher Rabbit. In 1939, Tillstrom was invited to present his Kuklapolitan Players at the New York World's Fair. The following year, RCA sent him to Bermuda to perform on the first ship-to-shore broadcast. From 1947‚Äì1957, Tillstrom was involved with the Kukla, Fran and Ollie show, which starred his puppets and Fran Allison. It is widely regarded as being the first children's show to appeal to both children and adults, and counted Orson Welles, John Steinbeck, Tallulah Bankhead, Adlai Stevenson and James Thurber among its many adult fans. With only a few exceptions, all of the shows were improvised. Tillstrom and Fran Allison with Kukla and Ollie, 1968 After the original series ended in 1957, Tillstrom continued to work with the Kuklapolitans. Early in 1958, Tillstrom appeared with the puppets on Polly Bergen's short-lived NBC variety show, The Polly Bergen Show. Tillstrom, Kukla and Ollie reunited with Fran Allison to host the CBS Children's Film Festival from 1967 to 1977. In 1970, Kukla, Fran and Ollie appeared on National Educational Television, taped at WTTW in Chicago, for two seasons. In 1975, Kukla, Fran and Ollie began another run on television with 13 new episodes. In 1977, The Kukla and Ollie Retrospective Stage Show tours began, a creation of the Artist-in-Residence program at Hope College. In 1978 Kukla, Burr and Ollie joined the Broadway cast of Side by Side by Sondheim, a revue of Stephen Sondheim songs. Tillstrom continued to perform with his Kuklapolitan Players until his death in Palm Springs, California in 1985. Honors On March 23, 1986, Burr Tillstrom was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame for his creativity and innovation in the medium. The Saugatuck Douglas Art Club in Saugatuck, Michigan (the location of Tillstrom's longtime summer home) dedicated a memorial to Tillstrom in 1988. The Burr Tillstrom Collection and Archives are maintained at the Chicago History Museum. In 2013 Tillstrom was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

Unlike surface micromachining, which uses a succession of thin film deposition and selective etching, bulk micromachining defines structures by selectively etching inside a substrate. Whereas surface micromachining creates structures on top of a substrate, bulk micromachining produces structures inside a substrate. Usually, silicon wafers are used as substrates for bulk micromachining, as they can be anisotropically wet etched, forming highly regular structures. Wet etching typically uses alkaline liquid solvents, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) or tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to dissolve silicon which has been left exposed by the photolithography masking step. These alkali solvents dissolve the silicon in a highly anisotropic way, with some crystallographic orientations dissolving up to 1000 times faster than others. Such an approach is often used with very specific crystallographic orientations in the raw silicon to produce V-shaped grooves. The surface of these grooves can be atomically smooth if the etch is carried out correctly, and the dimensions and angles can be precisely defined. Pressure sensors are usually created by bulk micromachining technique. Bulk micromachining starts with a silicon wafer or other substrates which is selectively etched, using photolithography to transfer a pattern from a mask to the surface. Like surface micromachining, bulk micromachining can be performed with wet or dry etches, although the most common etch in silicon is the anisotropic wet etch. This etch takes advantage of the fact that silicon has a crystal structure, which means its atoms are all arranged periodically in lines and planes. Certain planes have weaker bonds and are more susceptible to etching. The etch results in pits that have angled walls, with the angle being a function of the crystal orientation of the substrate. This type of etching is inexpensive and is generally used in early, low-budget research.

Between the main transmission mast and the reflector mast there are the two small grey masts, which can be hardly seen in the picture and which carry the shortwave antenna The M√ºhlacker Broadcasting Transmission Facility is a radio transmission facility near M√ºhlacker, Germany, first put into service on November 21, 1930. It uses two guyed steel tube masts as aerials and one guyed steel framework mast, which are insulated against ground. It has two transmission aerials for shortwave and one free standing steel framework tower for directional radio services. The shortwave transmitter was shut off on October 19, 2004. The medium wave transmitter was switched off in January 2012. Description At time of inauguration in 1930 the transmitter, which had a power of 60 kW, used a T-type antenna spun between two 100 m high wooden lattice towers placed 310 m apart. As this antenna produced large amounts of skywave, the area of undistorted fading-free reception - was in spite of its high transmission power - at night not as large as planned and so it was planned to replace this antenna by an aerial with better skywave suppression. So in 1933-34, a 190 m high wooden tower - the tallest structure ever built of wood - was built, in which a vertical wire antenna, which was electrically enlengthened by a metal ring with 10.6 metres diameters on the top of the tower, was hung up. At this time transmission power was also increased from 60 kW to 100 kW. After inauguration of this antenna, the two original wooden towers were dismantled. One of them was rebuilt at Koblenz, the other at Frankfurt-Heiligenstock. In 1939/1940 a second 100 kW transmitter was installed. It used as antenna a system of 3 T-antennas, which were mounted on 3 50 metres tall guyed masts arranged in a triangle. In opposite to the first transmitter, it was including its aerial designed for a quick change of broadcasting frequency, which was done in case of air attacks in order to form a single frequency network with other transmitters, which hindered hostile aircraft using the signals for navigation purpose. On April 6, 1945, the wooden tower and the masts carrying the system of T-antennas were blown up by the SS to prevent its capture by the Allies in World War II. Today, the most important aerial mast in M√ºhlacker is a 273 m high guyed steel tube mast with a diameter of 1.67 m, located at . This mast, which was built in 1950, is used as a transmitter for the mediumwave frequency 576 kHz and is therefore insulated against ground. It is designed as an antifading aerial and is therefore double-feedable and insulated. The mast is topped with a butterfly aerial for FM-broadcasting transmitters. There are flight safety lamps near the ground end of the guy ropes, to make the span of the guy ropes more visible. Two other radio masts, with heights of 130 m and 80 m, were located at the M√ºhlacker site. *The 130 m high mast, situated at , was a steel tube mast, insulated against ground. Before 1996, it was used as a director during nighttime and a spare during daytime. Transmission power was reduced to 100 kW in 1996 and the mast was obsolete and used only as a spare aerial. It was demolished in 2013. *The 80 m high radio mast, located at , is an insulated guyed steel framework mast with a triangular cross section. It was built in 1977 in order to improve transmission towards the south. It was also used to carry aerials for mobile phone services. It has been demolished. The three masts are arranged in a nearly straight line on the site. A T-type aerial for shortwave transmission is fixed between two small guyed steel framework masts, but was shut down on October 19, 2004. It was later dismantled. In 1948, a 110 m tall guyed steel framework mast was built on the site at This served as a transmission aerial for the American Forces Network (AFN) until 1963. From 1963 until its demolition in November 1993, the mast was used as part of a directional aerial for a mediumwave transmitter. It also served as a spare FM transmitter with a butterfly aerial installed on top. The mast was demolished because it was in poor repair and was deemed no longer necessary. Plans for a new mast have not been realized. Also located here at was a 50 m steel framework mast insulated against ground. It was part of the directional aerial for the AFN transmitter described above. After 1963, it was only used as an aerial for the internal mobile radio service of the transmission facility. It was demolished in April, 2004 and replaced in the summer of 2004 with a 93 m high freestanding steel framework tower carrying aerials for directional services.

It was described by Patricia Vickers-Rich and her husband Tom Rich in 1999 after a find near Inverloch, and named after Qantas, the Australian airline. Description > :\\"The jaw is unique because it is short and stocky, whereas other jaws ... > are long and slender\\" ::-- Patricia Vickers-Rich Qantassaurus was probably about 1.8 meters (6 feet) long, and about one meter (3 feet) high. If it resembled its relatives, it had short thighs and long shins, and probably was a fast runner. Its feet had claws for traction, and a long tail probably helped with turning, stiffened by ossified tendons. One characteristic of the \\"Polar Victorian\\" euornithopods are distinctive spurs, or trochanters, on the upper surface of the thigh bone (or femur), where muscle was attached. Jaw of Qantassaurus intrepidus at the Melbourne Museum Qantassaurus is only known from jaw fragments. These are foreshortened compared to related species so its face was probably short and stubby. It had ten teeth in each lower jaw. It probably had a beak, and possessed leaf-shaped teeth back in its cheek, which were shed as they wore down, and replaced by new teeth growing up from the jaw. The teeth had eight distinctive vertical ridges on the outer side with a single larger primary ridge in the centre. Qantassaurus lived 115 million years ago in Australia, during the late Aptian/early Albian age of the early Cretaceous period. At the time, Australia was part of the supercontinent of Gondwana, and partly within the Antarctic Circle, although the significance of polar conditions during the warm Cretaceous were greatly different from conditions in this region today. The average temperature of the region is contentious, with estimates ranging from -6 to well over 5 ¬∞C (21 to 37 ¬∞F). Conditions were likely to be at their coldest during the polar nights, which lasted up to three months. One interpretation of the fossil material is that small ornithopods had adaptations to survive cooler conditions. Bone growth of presumed related taxa shows they were active all year round, so they did not hibernate through the winter. The structure of these bones also suggests warm-bloodedness, which would help maintain its body heat. Qantassaurus was probably a browser, who grabbed ferns and other vegetation with its hands, and ran away from predators like a modern gazelle. Classification Size of Qantassaurus (in green) compared to other Australian ornithischians Qantassaurus is a basal iguanodont ornithopod that was originally assigned to the Hypsilophodontidae. Today, this is understood to be an unnatural (paraphyletic) group, and Qantassaurus was recently recovered as a basal iguanodont by Boyd (2015), and more specifically as a member of the iguanodontian clade Elasmaria by Rozadilla et al. (2016) and Madzia et al. (2017).Boyd C. A. (2015). The systematic relationships and biogeographic history of ornithischian dinosaurs. PeerJ, 3, 1‚Äì62.Sebasti√°n Rozadilla, Federico L.

In this regard, it is one of four ornithischian species once considered hypsilophodontids from southeast Australia, along with Leaellynasaura amicagraphica, Atlascopcosaurus loadsi, and Fulgurotherium australe. The four taxa are mostly known from isolated bones and teeth; however the thigh bones of F. australe are very diverse and may belong to three genera. History Model of Qantassaurus at the Melbourne Museum Qantassaurus was discovered on 27 February 1996, during the third annual field season of the Dinosaur Dreaming project, a dig jointly run by Monash University and the National Museum of Victoria. The dig occurs on the beach of the Bunurong Marine Park at the intertidal site known as Flat Rocks, near Inverloch, in southeastern Victoria, Australia. The rock outcrops at this site are part of the Wonthaggi Formation of the Strzelecki Group, which during the Aptian stage were deposited in floodplains with braided river channels.Bryan, S.E. , Constantine, A.E. & Stephens, C.J. 1997 \\"Early Cretaceous volcano - sedimentary successions along the eastern Australian continental margin: Implications for the break-up of eastern Gondwana\\" Earth and Planetary Science Letters 153 p.85-102 The holotype specimen, NMV P199075, a fifty-six millimetres long single left dentary of the lower jaw, containing ten teeth (three unerupted), was found by Mrs Nicole Evered, a long time participant of the dig. Two other jaws, specimens NMV P198962, a left dentary, and NMV P199087, a right dentary, found at the same site the same year have also been tentatively associated with, or referred to, the species. It was named Qantassaurus intrepidus by Patricia Vickers-Rich and Tom Rich, in honor of the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, which shipped fossils around the country as part of the Great Russian Dinosaurs Exhibit between 1993 and 1996, and sponsored expeditions to South America and Eastern Europe. QANTAS is an acronym, which is why a u does not follow the q in Qantassaurus. The specific name means \\"intrepid\\" in Latin, referring to the climatic challenges the small dinosaur had to face.

Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise, are East 149th Street to the north, the Bruckner Expressway to the east, the Bronx Kill waterway to the south, and the Harlem River to the west. East 138th Street is the primary east‚Äìwest thoroughfare through Mott Haven. The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 1, and is located within ZIP Codes 10451, 10454, and 10455. Mott Haven is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 40th Precinct. The local subway line is the IRT Pelham Line (), operating along East 138th Street. The local buses are the . Mott Haven is served by the Triborough Bridge, the Third Avenue Bridge, the Madison Avenue Bridge, the 145th Street Bridge, and the Willis Avenue Bridge. The closest Metro-North Railroad stops are Harlem ‚Äì 125th Street and Yankees ‚Äì East 153rd Street.  History  = Settlement by Jonas Bronck = Mott Haven station of New York Central, 138th St Mott Haven Canal in 1893 Looking east across Bruckner Blvd and Third Avenue at Bruckner Bar & Grill The Bronx was named after the Swedish sea captain Jonas Bronck. In 1639, the Dutch West India Company purchased the land of today's Mott Haven from the Wecquaesgeek (groups of Lenape tribe). Bronck built his farm on this land and named it \\"Emmanus\\". The house was located close to what is today the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street. The peace treaty between Dutch authorities and the Wecquaesgeek chiefs Ranaqua and Tackamuckwas was signed in Bronck's house. This event is portrayed in a painting by the American artist John Ward Dunsmore (1856‚Äì1945). Even though Bronck only lived in the area for four years, the land became known as \\"Broncksland\\" and the river that bordered his land kept the name Bronck's River. The first time the spelling \\"Bronx land was used, was in 1697 in the First Legislature outlined the County of West Chester. = Development = The area that is now called Mott Haven was sold to the Morris family in 1670. A small part of the larger swath of land known as Morrisania, it was purchased by Jordan Lawrence Mott for his iron works in 1849. A vestige of the iron works can be seen just west of the Third Avenue Bridge on East 134th Street at St. Ann's Church (ECUSA) on St. Ann's Avenue is the resting place of Lewis Morris, Gouverneur Morris and other members of that powerful colonial family, and a Registered Historic Place. As the city below grew, the area quickly developed residentially. At the same time, an upper- middle class residential area, marked by brownstones built in an elaborate and architecturally daring fashion, started to grow along Alexander Avenue by the 1890s (Doctors' Row, aka the Irish Fifth Avenue). A series of brownstones on E. 134th St, east of Willis Ave., was known as Judges' Row. Soon after, the Bronx grew more quickly, especially with public transit into the area, including the Third Avenue Elevated Line. By the early 20th century, the population density of the area supported the construction of many tenement- style apartment buildings. From the end of the 19th century through the 1940s, Mott Haven was a mixed German-American (north of E. 145th St.) and Irish- American neighborhood (south of E. 145th St), with an Italian enclave west of Lincoln Ave. The first Puerto Rican settlements came in the late 1940s along the length of Brook Avenue. African-Americans came into the area when Patterson Houses were built. One of the largest parades in New York City took place here in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was organized by the veterans of the Irish Republican Army, who marched every Easter Sunday, down Willis Avenue from the Hub to E. 138th Street, then west to St. Jerome's. The Star of Munster Ballroom at the northeast corner of Willis Avenue and E. 138th Street was a center of Irish music for decades. It was speculated at one time that there were more bars on Willis Avenue than on any other city street, given its short length. More recorded Irish musicians lived in Mott Haven than in any place outside Ireland. = \\"South Bronx\\" and late 20th century = North Side Board of Trade North New York Congregationalist Church Mott Haven and Port Morris were the first neighborhoods to give rise to the term \\"South Bronx\\". Together, they were earlier known as the North Side or North New York. This area was part of New York County after the incorporation of Greater New York in 1898. The Chase Manhattan Bank at Third Avenue and E. 137th Street was originally the North Side Board of Trade Building (1912). It later became the North Side Savings Bank, which became Dollar Dry Dock, which became Chase. In the 1940s when the Bronx was usually divided into the East Bronx and West Bronx, a group of social workers identified a pocket of poverty on East 134th Street, east of Brown Place, and called it the South Bronx. This area of poverty would spread in part due to an illegal practice known as blockbusting and to Robert Moses building several housing projects in the neighborhood. The poverty greatly expanded northward, following the post-war phenomenon colloquially referred to as white flight, reaching a peak in the 1960s when the socioeconomic North Bronx-South Bronx boundary reached Fordham Road. At this time a wave of arson destroyed or damaged many of the residential, commercial, and industrial structures in the area. Today the North Bronx-South Bronx distinction remains more common than the traditional East Bronx-West Bronx distinction, and some still regard Fordham Road as the boundary. Though crime has declined versus the highs of the crack epidemic and revitalization of former abandoned properties is taking place, the neighborhood continues to deal with serious crime issues, which some speculate is due to persistent poverty among the population. During the course of Mott Haven's growth, the communities of Wilton and North New York were incorporated into it. Later attempts to market Mott Haven as the \\"Piano District\\" and the South Bronx as \\"SoBro\\" have not found traction.Hughes, C. J. (March 6, 2020) \\"The Neighborhood Name Game\\" The New York Times = Development and gentrification = There have been significant strides to increase gentrification of the neighborhood, and the most changes are seen on Bruckner Boulevard, Alexander Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue. E. 138th Street has seen minor changes with apartment buildings under new renovations, and the arrival of new businesses. Mott Haven is home to a community-supported agriculture program hosted at Brook Park. Recent development plans include two affordable rental buildings and a Hampton Inn by Monadnock Development and Signature Urban Properties, and the so-called Piano District. Demographics Mott Haven is a high-density and mainly low-income neighborhood. Like most neighborhoods in New York City, the vast majority of households are renter-occupied. The neighborhood is largely Puerto Rican, with smaller numbers of African Americans, Mexicans and Dominicans present. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Mott Haven and Port Morris was 52,413, a change of 3,383 (6.5%) from the 49,030 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 1.7% (867) White, 24.7% (12,927) African American, 0.2% (95) Native American, 0.4% (214) Asian, 0% (7) Pacific Islander, 0.2% (124) from other races, and 0.6% (310) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 72.3% (37,869) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The entirety of Community District 1, which comprises Mott Haven and Melrose, had 98,403 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 77.6 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 28% are between the ages of between 0‚Äì17, 28% between 25‚Äì44, and 21% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 12% and 10% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 1 and 2, including Longwood, was $20,966. In 2018, an estimated 29% of Mott Haven and Melrose residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (12%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 58% in Mott Haven and Melrose, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Mott Haven and Melrose are considered to be low-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.  Land use and terrain  Bertine Block - 136th Street Mott Haven is dominated by tenement-style apartment buildings and large public housing complexes. There are three historical districts consisting of brownstone-style rowhouses. In the last two decades, construction of modern 2- and 3-unit rowhouses and apartment buildings has increased the percentage of owner-occupiers. The neighborhood contains one of the highest concentrations of NYCHA projects in the Bronx. The total land area is roughly one square mile. The terrain is low-lying and flat except around St. Mary's Park where it is somewhat hilly. =Historical districts and landmarks= Three Historic Districts are located in Mott Haven: Mott Haven, Mott Haven East and the Bertine Block. * The Mott Haven Historic District is located on Alexander Avenue between East 138th Street and East 141st Street. The district is primarily residential in character with four and five-story row houses dating to the last half of the 19th century, and contains the row of handsome brownstones known historically as Doctors' Row and Irish Fifth Avenue. It also has the 40th Precinct police station, the 1905 neo-renaissance Mott Haven Branch of the New York Public Library, and Saint Jerome's Roman Catholic Church. See also: It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. * The Mott Haven East Historic District is located on East 139th and East 140th Street between Brook and Willis Avenues. The district contains rows of handsome brownstones designed by William O'Gorman and William Hornum in 1883 combining Dutch and Flemish architectural aspects on the north side of E. 140th Street and neo-Grecian aspects on the south side of E. 140th Street and on E. 139th Street. * The Bertine Block Historic District is located on East 136th Street between Brook and Willis Avenues. The district contains yellow- faced brick brownstones designed by Edward Bertine between 1891 and 1895. St. Ann's Episcopal Church is located on the west side of St. Ann's Avenue between East 139th and East 141st Streets. It is the Bronx's oldest church, having been built in 1841 and dedicated to Gouverneur Morris's mother Ann. Notable figures buried there include Lewis Morris, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; Gouverneur Morris; and former mayor of New York, R. H. Morris. = Public housing projects = NYCHA Betances Houses on Brook Avenue The seventeen NYCHA developments in Mott Haven illustrate the various types of public housing initiatives in vogue in New York City over the decades. # Dr. Ramon E.

Increase in adjunct labor Colleges and universities began to employ greater numbers of non-tenure-track faculty in the 1970s. In 1975, adjuncts represented roughly 24% of instructional staff at degree- granting institutions, whereas in 2011 they represented over 40% of instructional staff. Various explanations have been given for this shift. Some \\"trace the practice of hiring part-time instructors to a time when most schools didn‚Äôt allow women as full professors, and thus adjunct positions were associated with female instructors from the start.\\" Many non-tenure-track faculty were married to full-time, tenure-track professors, and known as \\"the housewives of higher education.\\" The majority of non-tenure-track professors are still women. Some have argued that the increase in the use of non-tenured faculty is the result of ‚Äúfinancial pressures, administrators‚Äô desire for more flexibility in hiring, firing and changing course offerings, and the growth of community colleges and regional public universities focused on teaching basics and preparing students for jobs.‚Äù Others have argued that universities hire non-tenure-track faculty to \\"offset ... administrative bloat with cheaper labor\\" to the detriment of students: \\"while college tuition surged from 2003 to 2013 by 94 percent at public institutions and 74 percent at private, nonprofit schools, and student debt has climbed to over $1.2 trillion, much of that money has been going to ensure higher pay for a burgeoning legion of bureaucrats.\\" Paying some instructors less than others for the same teaching duties may be illegal. Compensation and academic use In past decades, adjunct faculty helped universities and colleges expand the range of their course offerings to prospective and existing students. In this respect, adjuncts can also be a way to inform the predominantly theoretical, and therefore somewhat limited, focus of full-time academics with the more pragmatic perspective of those who actually practice a given discipline in business, government or nonprofit organizations. For instance, as of the early 1990s Marvin Kaye, a prolific fiction author, editor and anthologist, also worked as part-time adjunct faculty of creative writing at New York UniversitySee Kaye's short bio in his collection Masterpieces of Terror and the Unknown (1993), Guild America Books Another example is Edward H. Shortliffe, a pioneer in medical informatics, who was an adjunct faculty member at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons circa 2011.https://www.amia.org/staff/eshortliffe/docs/EHS-NIH-style_biosketch.pdf Marilyn Milian, a retired Florida judge and star of The People's Court, taught litigation skills as an adjunct faculty at the University of Miami as of 2013; and musician Wayne Horvitz has worked as adjunct faculty teaching composition at Cornish College of the Arts. Since the 1980s, however, colleges and universities have increasingly utilized adjunct labor, whether full-time or part-time, simply to save money, giving them core undergraduate courses to teach (e.g., introductory math, or freshman-level English composition). Though adjuncts hold at least a master's degree, if not a PhD, the salary for these positions is relatively low. Many adjuncts must work at several schools at once in order to earn a living in academia. Non-tenure-track faculty earn much less than tenure-track professors; median pay per course is $2,700 and average yearly pay is between $20,000 and $25,000. Adjunct pay in state and community colleges varies; however, it can be as little as US$1,400 for a 3-credit hour lecture-based course. At many private institutions on the East Coast, payment for a 3-credit hour course hovers around US$3,000‚Äì4,000, with average pay nationwide as of 2014 estimated at around US$2,000‚Äì3,000. English professor William Pannapacker noted that adjunct faculty often earn less than minimum wage, when factoring in hours spent on classroom teaching, lesson preparation, office hours, grading of assignments, and other duties.Pannapacker, William. (2009) Just Don't Go, Part 2\\" 25% of adjuncts receive public assistance. Some adjunct faculty have remained with the same employer for as long as 25 years without receiving health insurance or retirement benefits. In 2014, Mary-Faith Cerasoli, a homeless female adjunct professor of Spanish and Italian, conducted a protest on the steps of the New York State Education Department Building. Groups supporting the efforts of adjuncts to organize for improved wages and working conditions include the Service Employees International Union, the United Steelworkers, and the New Faculty Majority Foundation. Unionization efforts Increasingly, non-tenure-track faculty are turning to unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International Union, and United Autoworkers, to improve their wages and working conditions. Adjunct faculty have successfully pushed for contracts at American University, Georgetown University, George Washington University, Howard University, Montgomery College, Trinity Washington University, and Loyola University Chicago. At other colleges and universities, such as Boston University, Lesley University, Northeastern University, and Tufts University, adjuncts have voted to unionize.

It is one of the U.S. Air Force's nine major commands and reports to Headquarters, United States Air Force. AETC is headquartered at Randolph Air Force Base, Joint Base San Antonio Texas. AETC is the primary training and professional education command in the Air Force. More than 48,000 active duty and Air Reserve Component members and 14,000 civilian personnel make up AETC. The command has responsibility for approximately 1,600 aircraft. AETC's mission is to \\"recruit, train and educate Airmen to deliver air power for America.\\" Air Force Recruiting Service AETC's mission begins with the Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS), an AETC activity also headquartered at Randolph AFB, Texas. AFRS comprises three regional groups and 24 squadrons with more than 1,400 commissioned officer and enlisted recruiters assigned throughout the United States, England, Germany, Japan, Puerto Rico and Guam. Recruiters in more than 1,000 offices worldwide recruit the young men and women needed as both enlisted airmen and commissioned officers to meet the demands of the U.S. Air Force. AFRS recruitment of commissioned officers is limited to 4-year college/university graduates via Air Force Officer Training School (OTS). Individuals who desire to become commissioned USAF officers and enter the service via the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) and Air Force ROTC (AFROTC) are not recruited by AFRS and are instead accessed via recruitment and application activities of USAFA and AFROTC, respectively. Basic Military Training and Technical Training Second Air Force (2 AF), with headquarters at Keesler AFB, Mississippi, is responsible for conducting basic military and technical training for Air Force enlisted members and technical training for non-flying missile launch officers and support officers. The first stop for all Regular Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command enlisted personnel is Basic Military Training (BMT) at Lackland AFB, Texas. More than 36,000 new airmen complete this recently lengthened eight-and-a-half-week program each year. After completing BMT, airmen begin technical training in their career field specialties, primarily at five installations: Goodfellow AFB, Lackland AFB, and Sheppard AFB in Texas; Keesler AFB, Mississippi; and Vandenberg AFB, California. There are also several cross-service schools such as Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California and the U.S. Army CCBRN School at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri that select USAF enlisted personnel will also attend. A recently established technical training institute at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, also conducts training in several medical career fields. Each base is responsible for a specific portion of formal technical training airmen require to accomplish the Air Force mission. Instructors conduct technical training in specialties such as aircraft maintenance, electronic principles, air transportation, civil engineering, medical services, computer systems, security forces, air traffic control, personnel, intelligence, fire fighting, weather forecasting and space and missile operations. Commissioned officers not assigned to flight training as prospective pilots, combat systems officers or air battle managers attend technical training courses for similar career fields at the same locations. 2 AF also conducts specialized training for military working dogs and dog handlers at Lackland AFB, Texas, for the entire Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration. Additionally, the Inter-American Air Forces Academy at Lackland AFB hosts more than 160 courses in aviation specialties, taught in Spanish, to students from 19 Western hemisphere countries. =Training in core values= In 1995, then- Secretary of the Air Force Sheila E. Widnall and then-Air Force Chief of Staff General Ronald R. Fogleman approved the following core values for the United States Air Force:USAF Academy, (2006). United States Air Force Core Values . Retrieved 5 September 2006. *Integrity First. *Service Before Self. *Excellence in All We Do. The Air Education and Training Command, along with the USAF Academy, are responsible for teaching these principles throughout the Air Force. Flying training When AETC was established in 1993, Nineteenth Air Force (19 AF) was also established as a companion numbered air force to 2 AF within AETC. While 2 AF focused on ground-based technical training, 19 AF focused on all undergraduate flying training and those formal training units (FTU) under its claimancy from 1993 until 2012, and again from 2014 to present. On 12 July 2012, 19 AF was temporarily inactivated for budgetary reasons in an effort to gain efficiencies. By 2014, these efficiencies had failed to materialize and the then-Commander of AETC, Gen Robin Rand, directed reestablishment of 19 AF effective 1 October 2014 for the oversight of all flight training operations under AETC's claimancy. =Pilot Training= Air Force pilot candidates begin their flying careers with Initial Flight Training (IFT) at Pueblo Memorial Airport, Colorado. In IFT, civilian flight instructors working under contract to AETC and the command's 306th Flying Training Group (306 FTG) provide up to 25 hours of flight instruction to commissioned officer and enlisted student pilots accessed via the U.S. Air Force Academy, Air Force ROTC and Air Force OTS. Following successful completion of IFS, student pilots attend either: * Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) * Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) Primary Training ‚Äì SUPT SUPT students accomplish primary training in the T-6A Texan II at one of three Air Force bases: * Columbus AFB, Mississippi * Laughlin AFB, Texas * Vance AFB, Oklahoma Between 1994 and 2013, SUPT was titled JSUPT for \\"Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training\\" and 100 USAF students annually accomplished primary training in the T-34C Turbomentor and later the T-6B Texan II with Training Air Wing FIVE at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, Florida via a combination of USN, USAF, USMC and USCG flight instructors while 80 USN and 20 USMC students annually accomplished primary training in the T-6A Texan II with the 71st Flying Training Wing at Vance Air Force Base. This program was terminated on 25 July 2013 with the graduation of the final USAF student pilot from primary training at NAS Whiting Field. Primary Training ‚Äì ENJJPT ENJJPT students accomplish primary training in the T-6A Texan II at the following location: * Sheppard AFB, Texas The entire ENJJPT course lasts about 54 weeks and students learn with, and are taught by, officers of the U.S. Air Force and various European air forces. During the primary phase, students master contact, instrument, low-level and formation flying. Advanced Training ‚Äì Fighter/Bomber (ENJJPT + SUPT) After the primary phase of SUPT and ENJJPT, student pilots elect one of three advanced training tracks based on their class standing. Those qualified for fighter or bomber assignments are assigned to the fighter/bomber track and train in the T-38 Talon at the SUPT and ENJJPT bases. Following completion of the fighter/bomber track, graduates will be assigned to the A-10, F-15 Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16, F-22 and F-35, B-1, B-2 or B-52. NOTE: The U-2 is not an option for new graduates of the Fighter/Bomber track. Prospective U-2 pilots must be qualified in another fighter, bomber, reconnaissance or mobility aircraft before applying to fly the U-2. First Assignment Instructor Pilots (FAIPs) are also eligible to apply following their FAIP assignment. Advanced Training ‚Äì Airlift/Tanker (SUPT only) Prospective airlift, tanker and \\"big wing\\" reconnaissance and special mission pilots are assigned to the airlift/tanker track and train in the T-1A Jayhawk at JSUPT bases only. Following completion of the Airlift/Tanker track, graduates of this track will fly the C-5, C-17, C-21, C-130, AC-130, EC-130, HC-130, LC-130, MC-130, WC-130, KC-135, KC-10, KC-46, E-3, E-8, RC-135 and OC-135. Prior to mid-2012, some USAF student pilots selected for the airlift/tanker track with specific assignment to the C-130 Hercules or its variants (special operations, electronic warfare, combat rescue, weather reconnaissance, etc.) were assigned to a multi-engine turboprop track flying the T-44 Pegasus and/or TC-12B Huron at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas in a cooperative arrangement between AETC and the Naval Air Training Command / Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). These USAF students received instruction from a combination of USN, USAF, USMC and USCG flight instructors with Training Air Wing FOUR at NAS Corpus Christi. This program was discontinued in 2012 and all USAF student pilots slated for the C-130 and its variants now train in the T-1A at one of the three JSUPT bases. NOTE: The 55th Wing's (55 WG) E-4B National Air Operations Center (NAOC) aircraft and any of the Special Air Mission (SAM) aircraft operated by the 89th Airlift Wing (89 AW), e.g., VC-25/Air Force One, C-32, C-40, etc., are not options for new graduates of the Airlift/Tanker track. Prospective E-4 and VC-25/C-32/C-40 pilots must be qualified in an airlift, tanker, or other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft before applying to fly the E-4 or any SAM aircraft. Advanced Training ‚Äì Helicopter (SUPT only) Those selected to fly helicopters or tilt-rotor aircraft are assigned after completion of the primary phase to AETC's 23d Flying Training Squadron at Fort Rucker, Alabama to train in the TH-1H Huey. Graduates will fly the UH-1N Twin Huey, HH-60G Pave Hawk or CV-22 Osprey. =Combat Systems Officer Training= Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training ‚Äì UCSOT Previously known as Navigators, the training pipeline for Combat Systems Officers has seen significant change since AETC's establishment. When AETC was first activated to replace Air Training Command (ATC), it inherited ATC's modernization effort of navigator training in the midst of a BRAC- directed closure of Mather AFB, California and the inactivation of its 323d Flying Training Wing, USAF's sole Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) wing, which also provided advanced training for USN Student Naval Flight Officers destined for land-based naval aircraft (e.g., P-3 Orion, E-6 Mercury, etc.) under the dual-designation of Interservice Undergraduate Navigator Training (IUNT). T-43A of the 562d Flight Training Squadron taxiing at RAF Fairford, England As part of this transition, AETC opted to implement a dual training track whereby most USAF and all land-based USN and NATO/Allied officer student navigator training would transition to the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) at Randolph AFB, Texas utilizing the T45 navigation simulator and flying the T-43 Bobcat (both relocated from Mather AFB) and adding the T-1 Jayhawk for USAF students. The relocated programs were renamed Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training (SUNT) for USAF and USAF-sponsored NATO/Allied students, and Joint Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training (JSUNT) for USN and USN-sponsored NATO/Allied students. USAF students graduating from SUNT were assigned to B-52, C-130, AC-130, EC-130, HC-130, LC-130, MC-130, WC-130, KC-135, E-3, E-8, RC-135 and OC-135 aircraft. At the same time, a pre-selected cohort of USAF officer student navigators destined as weapon systems officers in the F-15E Strike Eagle, the B-1 Lancer, and, with the retirement of the EF-111 Raven, electronic warfare officers providing USAF manning of joint USN- USAF EA-6B Prowler squadrons, would complete a joint flight training program established between 19 AF and the Naval Air Training Command / Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) with Training Air Wing SIX at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. In this latter program, prospective USAF WSOs and EWOs would follow essentially the same training track as USN and USMC Student Naval Flight Officers destined for tactical fighter, strike and electronic attack aircraft, flying the T-34C Turbomentor in primary training until the T-34C's replacement by the T-6 Texan II, USAF T-1 Jayhawk aircraft on detached operations at NAS Pensacola, and USN/USMC T-39 Sabreliner aircraft in intermediate and advanced training under the tutelage of USN, USAF and USMC instructors. In 2009, with the transition of all USAF Navigators to Combat Systems Officers, the merger of SUNT into Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCSOT), and pursuant to additional BRAC directives, the 12 FTW established the 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG) with two flying training squadrons and an operations support squadron as a geographically-separated unit (GSU) at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Pursuant to USAF policy changes, AETC and CNATRA also discontinued joint training at Training Air Wing SIX with the establishment of the 479 FTG. Although NAS Pensacola remains the principal base for Student Naval Flight Officer (SNFO) training for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, the 479 FTG operates independently of this program with its own USAF T-6 Texan II and T-1 Jayhawk aircraft. Upon establishment of the 479 FTG at NAS Pensacola, the remaining \\"legacy\\" navigator training squadrons that had relocated from the former Mather AFB to Randolph AFB in 1992 were inactivated and the remaining T-43 Bobcat aircraft retired. Starting in the summer of 2010, following completion of Initial Flight Screening (IFS) at Pueblo Memorial Airport, Colorado with their USAF student pilot counterparts, all USAF CSO students undergo Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCSOT) with the 479 FTG. Merging the three previous USAF Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) tracks formerly known as Navigator track, Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) track and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) track into one coherent training cycle, the first UCSOT class (11-01) under the new syllabus commenced training on 5 May 2010 and graduated on 15 April 2011. Today, USAF CSOs continue to fill all of the previously mentioned multi- place USAF combat aircraft with the exception that the USN has since retired all of its EA-6B Prowlers and the USAF now provides a few CSOs to four of the USN's thirteen Electronic Attack Squadrons flying the EA-18G Growler. Those four squadrons are land based and do not deploy aboard aircraft carriers. =Air Battle Manager Training= Air Battle Managers (ABM) are non-pilot / non-CSO officer aircrew who operate mission systems in the E-3 Sentry \\"AWACS\\" and E-8 J-STARS. Since October 1999, they have been considered \\"aeronautically rated officers\\" on par with USAF pilots and Navigators-cum-CSOs. ABMs complete Undergraduate Air Battle Manager Training (UABMT), an academic and simulator- only program under AETC cognizance at Tyndall AFB, Florida. As of May 2010, a new training syllabus at Tyndall AFB allows ABMs to receive their wings at the conclusion of UABMT, finally bringing their undergraduate flight training in line with pilots and CSOs. Follow-on simulator and flying training in the actual E-3 or E-8 aircraft takes place under the cognizance of Air Combat Command at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma and Robins AFB, Georgia, respectively. =Enlisted Aircrew Training= AETC also provides enlisted aircrew training for a wide variety of aircrew specialties including flight engineers, air-to- air refueling boom operators, loadmasters, aerial gunners, and airborne communications specialists as follows: * Flight engineers, loadmasters, other aircrew (C-130, EC-130, LC-130, WC-130) ‚Äì Little Rock AFB * Flight engineers, loadmasters, other aircrew (AC-130, MC-130, HC-130) ‚Äì Little Rock AFB and Kirtland AFB * Flight engineers, aerial gunners, other aircrew (CV-22, HH-60, UH-1) ‚Äì Kirtland AFB * Aerial refueling boom operators (KC-135, KC-10) ‚Äì Altus AFB * Loadmasters (C-5) ‚Äì Lackland AFB / Kelly Field Annex * Loadmasters (C-17) ‚Äì Altus AFB * Airborne communications specialists (various aircraft) ‚Äì Lackland AFB * RPA Sensor Operator ‚Äì Randolph AFB =Formal Training Unit= Air Education and Training Command also provides follow-on training for most Air Force pilots, CSOs and enlisted aircrew in their assigned aircraft via Formal Training Units (FTUs). For those pilots and CSOs selected for assignment to fighter aircraft, they will complete the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) course, an AETC-administered program, at Randolph AFB, Texas, Columbus AFB, Mississippi, or Sheppard AFB, Texas, shortly following completion of undergraduate flying training and prior to reporting to their FTU. At IFF, pilots fly the AT-38B Talon. * Air Education and Training Command FTUs: ** F-15 Eagle (e.g., F-15C and F-15D) ‚Äì Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base, Oregon; conducted by an AETC-gained fighter wing of the Oregon Air National Guard *** Training at Kingsley Field is conducted by an AETC-gained fighter wing of the Air National Guard; this unit trains both active duty Air Force and Air National Guard personnel ** F-16 Fighting Falcon ‚Äì Luke AFB, Arizona (slated for relocation to Holloman AFB, New Mexico); Lackland AFB/Kelly Field Annex, Texas; and Tucson Air National Guard Base, Arizona *** Training at Luke is conducted by an AETC fighter wing and an AETC-gained fighter wing of the Air Force Reserve Command; *** Training at Lackland AFB/Kelly Field (former Kelly AFB) is conducted by an AETC-gained fighter wing of the Texas Air National Guard **** Both units at Luke AFB and Lackland AFB/Kelly Field train Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard personnel for the F-16C and F-16D *** Training at Tucson ANGB is conducted by an AETC-gained fighter wing of the Arizona Air National Guard focusing on international (NATO/Allied/Coalition) pilot training in support of the F-16 Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program ** F-35 Lightning II ‚Äì Eglin AFB, Florida (slated for additional site at Luke AFB, Arizona following relocation of F-16 training) ** C-5 Galaxy ‚Äì Lackland AFB/Kelly Field Annex (former Kelly AFB) *** Training conducted by an AETC-gained airlift wing of the Air Force Reserve Command; this unit trains Air Force and Air Force Reserve personnel for the C-5 and previously trained Air National Guard personnel for the C-5 until retirement of the C-5 from the ANG ** C-17 Globemaster III ‚Äì Altus AFB, Oklahoma ** C-21 Learjet ‚Äì Keesler AFB, Mississippi ** C-130 Hercules ‚Äì Little Rock AFB, Arkansas ** KC-135 Stratotanker ‚Äì Altus AFB, Oklahoma ** KC-46 Pegasus ‚Äì Altus AFB, Oklahoma (establishment pending) ** MC-130 Combat Shadow/Combat Talon II/Commando II and HC-130 Combat King/Combat King II ‚Äì Kirtland AFB, New Mexico ** UH-1N Twin Huey ‚Äì Kirtland AFB, New Mexico ** HH-60G Pave Hawk ‚Äì Kirtland AFB, New Mexico ** CV-22 Osprey ‚Äì Kirtland AFB, Mexico ** T-6 Texan II, T-38 Talon and T-1 Jayhawk Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) ‚Äì Randolph AFB, Texas FTUs not under AETC claimancy are: * Air Combat Command ** A-10 Thunderbolt II ** E-3 Sentry ** E-4 NAOC ** E-8 J-STARS ** EC-130 Hercules (Compass Call) ** F-15E Strike Eagle ** F-22 Raptor ** OC-135 Open Skies ** RC-135 Rivet Joint ** U-2 Dragon Lady ** MQ-1 Predator ** MQ-9 Reaper ** RQ-170 Sentinel * Air Force Global Strike Command ** B-1 Lancer ** B-2 Spirit ** B-52 Stratofortress * Air Force Special Operations Command ** AC-130 Spectre, Spooky and Stinger ** EC-130 (Commando Solo) ** U-28 * Air Mobility Command ** KC-10 Extender ** C-20 Gulfstream IV ** C-21 Learjet ** VC-25 ** C-40 Clipper ** C-32 ** C-37 Gulfstream V Air University Air University (AU), headquartered at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, conducts professional military education (PME), graduate education and professional continuing education for officers, senior enlisted members and DoD and DAFC civilians throughout their careers. =USAF Commissioned Officer Accession & Training= Air University also has responsibility for all Air Force officer accession and training other than those officers accessed and commissioned the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). This is conducted via AU's subordinate activity, the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development (Holm Center), formerly the Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS). As an AU activity, the Holm Center oversees both the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC), with detachments at numerous colleges and universities across the United States, and the Air Force Officer Training School (OTS) at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. =Professional Military Education (PME) Schools= Air University's professional military education schools prepare students from the Air Force, its sister services and both NATO and other U.S.-allied nations as they progress through their careers. Emphasis in these programs includes leadership, military doctrine and air power. The three primary PME schools are: * Squadron Officer School (SOS), an approximately two-month leadership development program primarily for USAF company grade officers (First Lieutenants (O-2) and Captains (O-3)); attendance is also open to US civil service (primarily DAFC) in grades GS-11 and GS-12 * Air Command and Staff College (ACSC), an approximately year long joint \\"intermediate\\" service college program for officers of all services in the rank of (or selected for) Major (O-4), Lieutenant Commander (O-4) in the Navy and Coast Guard, other Allied military equivalents, or US civil service GS-13, primarily DAFC, DoD, DHS and NASA * Air War College (AWC), an approximately year long joint \\"senior\\" service college program for officers in the rank of (or selected for) Lieutenant Colonel (O-5), Commander (O-5) in the Navy and Coast Guard, other Allied military equivalents, or US civil service GS-14. Officers in the grade of Colonel (O-6), Captain (O-6) in the Navy and Coast Guard, and US civil service GS-15 (primarily DAFC, DoD, DHS and NASA) may also attend AWC in residence, although this is usually due to previous completion of AWC via correspondence or seminar, career timing, or early promotion. =Air Force Junior ROTC= Air University also oversees one of Air Force's two civilian participatory programs, Air Force Junior ROTC. Civil Air Patrol was moved under Air Combat Command in 2016: * The Air Force Junior ROTC program is a cadet program for high school students at more than 870 high schools in the United States and at Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) locations overseas. AFJROTC Instructors are retired USAF officers in the ranks of Major, Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel, assisted by retired USAF non-commissioned officers in the ranks of Technical Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant. ** As opposed to its college/university counterpart, Air Force ROTC (AFROTC), the AFJROTC program is not a military pre-commissioning program for prospective USAF officers, but is instead a citizenship program for youth similar to, but with an overall narrower age range than, the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program. AFJROTC are subordinate to the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development (Holm Center). Other academic support services at Air University include the Academic Instructor School, the Air Force Public Affairs Center of Excellence, the Muir S. Fairchild Research Information Center (formerly known as Air University Library) and the International Officer School. Bases AETC has claimancy and oversight of the following installations: * Altus AFB, OK * Columbus AFB, MS * Goodfellow AFB, TX * Keesler AFB, MS * Lackland AFB, TX (includes Kelly Field Annex) * Laughlin AFB, TX * Luke AFB, AZ * Maxwell AFB, AL (includes Gunter AFS) * Sheppard AFB, TX * Vance AFB, OK AETC is also a major tenant at Eglin AFB, FL; Kirtland AFB, NM; Little Rock AFB, AR; NAS Pensacola, FL; and Vandenberg AFB, CA. Medical services The Air Force's two largest medical facilities belong to AETC: the Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland AFB, Texas, and the Keesler Medical Center at Keesler AFB, Mississippi. History For a history prior to 1993, see Air Training Command On 1 January 1993, Air Training Command absorbed Air University and changed the command designation to Air Education and Training Command (AETC). AETC assumed responsibilities for both aspects of career development: training and education. Missions such as combat crew training, pararescue, and combat controller training, and (later) space training transferred to the new command, so that airmen would report to their operational units mission ready. Restructuring the command assumed priority among the issues facing the command staff. The introduction of three new training aircraft, the Raytheon T-1 Jayhawk, Slingsby T-3 Firefly, and Beech T-6 Texan II (JPATS); the addition of joint training; and the BRAC-mandated closures of Chanute AFB, Illinois (a major technical training center); Mather AFB, California (previously USAF's sole Undergraduate Navigator Training base) and Williams AFB, Arizona (an Undergraduate Pilot Training base) were major challenges following the establishment of AETC. In 1994, AETC adopted the Objective Wing Concept and stood up several wings responsible for crew training in the F-16, special operations aircraft, airlift aircraft, the KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft, and space and missile operations. AETC also began the first Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and Joint-SUPT courses. Lowry AFB, Colorado, a technical training center with closed runways that, like the previously closed Chanute AFB, no longer conducted flight operations but conducted both non-flying officer and enlisted technical training, was added to the list of AETC bases closed by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) in the mid-1990s. This was followed by the BRAC mandated closure of Reese AFB, Texas, an Undergraduate Pilot Training base, in 1995. The transition to SUPT was completed in 1996, the delivery of the first JPATS aircraft in 1999, and the discontinuation of the controversial T-3 as an initial flight screening aircraft in 2000 following a higher than average fatal mishap record. In response to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, AETC went on a war footing, activating a Crisis Action Team and supplying both fighters and tankers from its wings for combat air patrols in American airspace as part of Operation Noble Eagle. An operational test and evaluation of JPATS began in 2002 at Moody AFB and upgrades to its Training Integration Management System (TIMS) were begun the next year, resulting in retirement of the T-37 Tweet and full implementation of JPATS with the T-6 Texan II in 2007.

They are often treated as being two dialects of the same language, but they are very different and mutual intelligibility is low. The languages are Tundra Nenets, which has a higher number of speakers, spoken by some 30,000 to 40,000 people in an area stretching from the Kanin Peninsula to the Yenisei River, and Forest Nenets, spoken by 1,000 to 1,500 people in the area around the Agan, Pur, Lyamin and Nadym rivers. The Nenets languages are classified in the Uralic language family, making them distantly related to some national languages spoken in Europe ‚Äì namely Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian ‚Äì in addition to other minority languages spoken in Russia. Both of the Nenets languages have been greatly influenced by Russian. Tundra Nenets has, to a lesser degree, been influenced by Komi and Northern Khanty. Forest Nenets has also been influenced by Eastern Khanty. Tundra Nenets is well documented, considering its status as an indigenous and minority language. It has a literary tradition going back to the 1930s, while Forest Nenets was first written during the 1990s and has been little documented. Apart from the word 'Nenets', only one other Nenets word has entered the English language: 'parka', their traditional long, hooded jacket, made from skins and sometimes fur.\\"parka\\", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary  Common features of Nenets languages  Tundra Nenets has 16 moods, most of which reflect different degrees of certainty in what in English might be called indicative statements or different degrees of force in what in English might be called imperative commands. An overarching feature of the Nenets languages is the introduction of systematic palatalization of almost all consonants. This originates from contrasts between different vowel qualities in the Proto-Samoyedic language. * *C√§, *Ca ‚Üí *C ≤a, *Ca * *Ce, *C√´ ‚Üí *C ≤e, *Ce * *Ci, *C√Ø ‚Üí *C ≤i, *Ci * *C√∂, *Co ‚Üí *C ≤o, *Co * *C√º, *Cu ‚Üí *C ≤u, *Cu The velar consonants *k and *≈ã were additionally shifted to *s ≤ and *n ≤ when palatalized. Similar changes have also occurred in the other Samoyedic languages spoken in the tundra zone: Enets, Nganasan and the extinct Yurats.  Differences between Tundra and Forest Nenets  Tundra Nenets generally has remained closer to Proto-Nenets than Forest Nenets, whose phonology has been influenced by eastern Khanty dialects. Changes towards the modern languages include: * Tundra Nenets: ** Delabialization of /w ≤/ ‚Üí /j/ ** Lenition of initial /k/ ‚Üí /x/ ** Simplification of / îk/ ‚Üí /k/ * Forest Nenets: ** Initial /s/ ‚Üí /x/ ** Medial denasalization of /n ≤/ ‚Üí /j/ ** The change of rhotics to lateral fricatives: /r/, /r ≤/ ‚Üí /…¨/, /…¨ ≤/ ** Shortening of geminate nasals ** Breaking of geminate /lÀê/ ‚Üí /n…¨/ ** Phonemicization of palatalized velars /k ≤/, /x ≤/, /≈ã ≤/ due to vowel changes ** Raising of non-close vowels preceding a syllable with an original close vowel ** Loss of vowel distinctions in unstressed syllables ** Introduction of short/long contrasts for /a/ and /√¶/  References  = Note =  External links  * Tundra Nenets website * Forest Nenets ‚Äì English glossary * The Russian‚ÄìNenets Audio Phrasebook * Comparative Nenets‚ÄìNganasan dictionary (with Russian and English equivalents) Category:Northern Samoyedic languages Category:Languages of Russia ","title":"Nenets languages"},{"id":"1249296","text":"In cryptography, nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers are any numbers which, by their construction, are above suspicion of hidden properties. They are used in creating cryptographic functions such as hashes and ciphers. These algorithms often need randomized constants for mixing or initialization purposes. The cryptographer may wish to pick these values in a way that demonstrates the constants were not selected for a nefarious purpose, for example, to create a backdoor to the algorithm. These fears can be allayed by using numbers created in a way that leaves little room for adjustment. An example would be the use of initial digits from the number as the constants. Using digits of millions of places after the decimal point would not be considered trustworthy because the algorithm designer might have selected that starting point because it created a secret weakness the designer could later exploit. Digits in the positional representations of real numbers such as , e, and irrational roots are believed to appear with equal frequency (see normal number). Such numbers can be viewed as the opposite extreme of Chaitin‚ÄìKolmogorov random numbers in that they appear random but have very low information entropy. Their use is motivated by early controversy over the U.S. Government's 1975 Data Encryption Standard, which came under criticism because no explanation was supplied for the constants used in its S-box (though they were later found to have been carefully selected to protect against the then-classified technique of differential cryptanalysis).Bruce Schneier. Applied Cryptography, second edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1996, p. 278. Thus a need was felt for a more transparent way to generate constants used in cryptography. \\"Nothing up my sleeve\\" is a phrase associated with magicians, who sometimes preface a magic trick by holding open their sleeves to show they have no objects hidden inside.

They turned out to be far from random, but instead of being a backdoor they made the algorithm resilient against differential cryptanalysis, a method not publicly known at the time. * Dual_EC_DRBG, a NIST-recommended cryptographic pseudo-random bit generator, came under criticism in 2007 because constants recommended for use in the algorithm could have been selected in a way that would permit their author to predict future outputs given a sample of past generated values. In September 2013 The New York Times wrote that \\"internal memos leaked by a former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, suggest that the NSA generated one of the random number generators used in a 2006 NIST standard‚Äîcalled the Dual EC DRBG standard‚Äîwhich contains a back door for the NSA.\\" * P curves are standardized by NIST for elliptic curve cryptography.

Although not directly related, after the backdoor in Dual_EC_DRBG had been exposed, suspicious aspects of the NIST's P curve constantshttps://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ led to concerns that the NSA had chosen values that gave them an advantage in finding private keys. Since then, many protocols and programs started to use Curve25519 as an alternative to NIST P-256 curve. Limitations Bernstein and coauthors demonstrate that use of nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers as the starting point in a complex procedure for generating cryptographic objects, such as elliptic curves, may not be sufficient to prevent insertion of back doors. If there are enough adjustable elements in the object selection procedure, the universe of possible design choices and of apparently simple constants can be large enough so that a search of the possibilities allows construction of an object with desired backdoor properties.How to manipulate curve standards: a white paper for the black hat Daniel J.

Barbara, a great beauty and already widowed, became a royal mistress most likely in 1543 and they married in secret in July or August 1547. The marriage caused a scandal; it was vehemently opposed by Polish nobles, including Queen mother Bona Sforza. Sigismund Augustus, assisted by Barbara's cousin Miko≈Çaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and brother Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, worked tirelessly to gain recognition of their marriage and to crown Barbara as Queen of Poland. They succeeded and Barbara's coronation was held on 7 December 1550 at Wawel Cathedral. However, her health was already failing and she died just five months later. Even though it was brief, her reign propelled the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family to new heights of political power and influence. Her contemporaries generally viewed Barbara in a negative light, accusing her of promiscuity and witchcraft. Her life became surrounded by many rumors and myths. She was a heroine of many legends in a wide range of literary works. From the 18th century, the life of Barbara became romanticized as the great tragic love affair. It has been used as an example of \\"love conquers all\\" with Bona Sforza often acting as the chief villain. It caught public imagination and has inspired many artists to create poems, plays, films, and other works. That made Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç one of the best known and most recognized women in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland.  Marriage to Stanislovas Go≈°tautas Barbara was the youngest child of Jerzy Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Voivode of Trakai and Vilnius and Great Lithuanian Hetman, and his wife Barbara Kolanka, daughter of Voivode of Podolia. Her exact birth date is unknown. It is known that she was born on 6 December, but the year is not known. Historians usually provide either 1520, as recorded in Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç genealogy found in Nesvizh, or 1523, as recorded on a plaque found in her tomb. Details of her education are unknown, but it is unlikely that it was extensive. From her correspondence, it is known that she could speak and write in Polish. From a February 1549 letter it could be inferred that she understood at least some Latin, but her letters to Sigismund Augustus had not a single Latin phrase. According to her contemporaries, Barbara was very beautiful. Moreover, Barbara had an interest in fashion and cosmetics; she used perfumes and face powder. In 1536, Stanislovas Go≈°tautas, Voivode of Nowogrodek, canceled his betrothal to Anna El≈ºbieta Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, elder sister of Barbara. Jerzy Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç then offered the hand of Barbara even though it was against custom for a younger sister to wed first. The wedding treaty was signed on 20 October 1536 in Radun. Another plan to wed either Anna El≈ºbieta or Barbara to Ilia Ostrogski, the only son of Great Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski, fell through. The wedding of Barbara and Stanislovas Go≈°tautas took place on 18 May 1537 in Go≈°tautas' residence in Hieraniony. Her dowry included numerous silver and gilded tableware items, 24 fine horses, dresses of satin and damask decorated with gold and precious stones. In exchange, Stanislovas transferred property worth 8,000 kopas of Lithuanian groschens to Barbara. Their marriage was childless. Stanislovas died unexpectedly after a brief illness on 18 December 1542. Marriage to Sigismund Augustus =Love affair and secret marriage= Sigismund II Augustus and Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç in Vilnius by Jan Matejko Stanislovas Go≈°tautas was the last male member of the Go≈°tautai family and, according to law regarding childless widows, the majority of his possessions were inherited by Sigismund I the Old, Grand Duke of Lithuania. On 15 June 1543, Sigismund transferred the property to his son Sigismund II Augustus who visited Hieraniony in October 1543 to take over the estate. It is likely that it was when Barbara and Sigismund Augustus became lovers, though there is no evidence of the affair until after the death of Sigismund Augustus' first wife. In July 1544, Sigismund Augustus traveled to Brest and returned with his wife Elizabeth of Austria in October to Vilnius, where Barbara resided with her mother. On 15 June 1545, Elizabeth died from epileptic seizures. Sigismund Augustus and Barbara were free to enjoy each other's company ‚Äì rumors spread about their romantic rendezvous, hunts, and parties. Sigismund Augustus spent 223 days in 1546 hunting. It was said that Sigismund Augustus ordered construction of a secret tunnel connecting the Royal Palace with the nearby Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç Palace so that the couple could meet frequently and discreetly. At the same time, Sigismund Augustus and his parents searched for a new bride. Sigismund I the Old contemplated a marriage to Anna Sophia, daughter of Albert, Duke of Prussia. Other candidates included Anna d'Este of Duchy of Ferrara, widowed Anna of Lorraine, Princesses Mary I of England and Margaret of France. Sometime in 1547, Sigismund Augustus and Barbara wed in secret. Neither exact date nor circumstances are known. The Lithuanian Chronicles recorded the doubtful claim that Sigismund Augustus was forced into the marriage when he was caught with Barbara by the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç cousins. According to research by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Pociecha, the wedding probably took place between 26 July and 6 August. Her cousin Miko≈Çaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç was sent to Krak√≥w to inform the Polish court that Sigismund Augustus and Barbara were married since 25 November 1545. It seems he failed the assignment and Sigismund Augustus had to travel to Poland himself. He departed Vilnius on 15 November; Barbara was sent to the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç estate in Dubingiai. In a letter dated 20 November, courtier Stanis≈Çaw Dowojno, starosta of Merkinƒó, informed Sigismund Augustus that due to the difficult journey Barbara had a miscarriage. If that indeed was true, and not an elaborate intrigue by the Radziwi≈Ç≈Çs, it would explain the secret marriage ‚Äì an attempt to provide legitimacy to the child. Another explanation could be that the bleeding was caused by a rupture of an internal abscess, an early sign of her terminal illness. =Political struggle for recognition= Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç in coronation robes and pearls that became her signature jewelry. 18th-century copy of an original 16th-century portrait. Sigismund Augustus informed his parents of the marriage on 2 February 1548 in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. The news caused an uproar among Polish nobles as Sigismund Augustus wed without the approval of the Senate. What was worse, Barbara was his subject and lover. Queen mother Bona Sforza was one of the most vocal opponents. In the ensuing campaign against recognizing the marriage, Barbara was widely accused of promiscuous behavior and of using witchcraft or poison to seduce Sigismund Augustus. Various authors, including Stanis≈Çaw Orzechowski and Miko≈Çaj Rej, published and distributed various derogatory pamphlets. The charge of promiscuity often enters works of modern historians though it is not based on any actual evidence. Lithuanian nobles did not openly protest the marriage, but were distrustful of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Çs and their rise to power. King Sigismund I the Old died on 1 April 1548. Sigismund Augustus, who briefly returned to Vilnius, had to travel back to Krak√≥w to attend the funeral and secure himself on the Polish throne. Barbara stayed in Vilnius. It seems that around the same time Barbara informed him of another pregnancy; it too ended in a miscarriage. Since it is known only from Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç reports, it is unknown whether it was a real pregnancy or another intrigue. In September 1548, Sigismund Augustus invited Barbara to Poland to show the strength of their marriage. The issue was discussed by the general sejm on 31 October ‚Äì 12 December in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. The sessions were loud and rowdy. The nobles, including voivodes Piotr Kmita Sobie≈Ñski, Jan Gabriel Tƒôczy≈Ñski, and Piotr Boraty≈Ñski, pleaded the King to abandon the marriage and even threatened to take up arms. Sigismund Augustus steadfastly refused and stood by his wife; reportedly he even considered abdication. The sejm ended in a stalemate. After the sejm, Sigismund and Barbara entered Krak√≥w on 13 February 1549. In Wawel, Barbara enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle and expensive gifts. In May 1549, she received large territories in the Trakai Voivodeship, including Kaunas Castle, Rum≈°i≈°kƒós, Alytus, Merkinƒó, Nemunaitis, Bir≈°tonas, ≈Ωie≈æmariai, Stakli≈°kƒós, Karmƒólava, Vilkija, Skirsnemunƒó, Veliuona, Dars≈´ni≈°kis. While she had immense influence on Sigismund Augustus, she showed no interest in politics unlike her ambitious cousin Miko≈Çaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and brother Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. While they worked with her husband to secure her the Polish crown, she made no gestures to win support from the nobles or favor from the people. When a compromise solution was offered ‚Äì recognize Barbara as Sigismund Augustus' wife but not to crown her as Queen of Poland ‚Äì Sigismund Augustus refused because that would cast a doubt on legitimacy of any future children. In summer 1549, to protect himself from a possible armed rebellion, Sigismund Augustus concluded an alliance with Ferdinand, King of Hungary, leaving his sister Isabella Jagiellon to fend for herself in the succession disputes in the Kingdom of Hungary. To obtain papal brief allowing Barbara's coronation, Sigismund Augustus issued an edict prohibiting heresy ‚Äì a controversial move in a country that had many Eastern Orthodox believers in the east. He also worked to threaten, bribe, or otherwise persuade Polish nobles not to oppose the marriage. His mother and one of the most vocal opponents, dowager Queen Bona Sforza, was removed from the court and moved to Mazovia. =Illness and death= Death of Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç by J√≥zef Simmler At the next sejm in May‚ÄìJuly 1550, no one objected to the marriage. Therefore, while neither the sejm nor the senate gave an express permission, Barbara was crowned as Queen of Poland on 7 December 1550 in Wawel Cathedral by Miko≈Çaj Dzierzgowski, Archbishop of Gniezno. However, her reign lasted only five months. Almost since her wedding in 1547, she complained of poor health, particularly of stomach pain or \\"internal stones\\". After the coronation her health took a turn for worse. She had fever, stomach pain, lost appetite. A lump appeared on her stomach full of pus. Sigismund Augustus asked to send women healers, including a Jewish woman, from Lithuania. In March 1551, her condition improved somewhat and she was able to receive a messenger from Bona Sforza who informed her that Bona recognized her marriage to Sigismund Augustus. It was described as her last victory. Her health continued to decline and she had fever, diarrhea, nausea. Sigismund Augustus personally tended to his sick wife even though reportedly she stank of pus. He wanted to take her to Niepo≈Çomice where he hoped that spring weather would lessen her suffering. When there was a doubt whether a special wagon to transport Barbara could fit through the city gates, Sigismund Augustus ordered the gate demolished. Barbara died on 8 May 1551 in Krak√≥w. She asked to be buried in Vilnius and her body was transported to Vilnius Cathedral, where she was buried on 23 June next to Sigismund Augustus' first wife Elizabeth of Austria. Her death was a severe loss to the King; it is said that for a good portion of the journey he followed her coffin on foot. It was said that Sigismund Augustus became more serious, avoided parties, and liked to dress black for the rest of his life. The cause of her illness has been debated by contemporaries and historians. Secretary of Giovanni Francesco Commendone claimed that her illness was caused by her use of contraceptive measures. Radziwi≈Ç≈Çs in their letters debated whether she had a sexually transmitted disease. There were persistent rumors that she was poisoned by Bona Sforza. Modern historians tend to think it was cervical or ovarian cancer. Physical remains Remains of Barbara (painting by Ludomir Sle≈Ñdzi≈Ñski) Her remains were found in Vilnius Cathedral after a flood in 1931. To preserve her body during the long summer trip from Krak√≥w to Vilnius, it was covered in a mixture of ash and burnt lime. While the wooden coffin rotted away, the lime hardened and formed a protective shell that preserved her bones rather well. She was buried with regal symbols (silver gilded crown, silver scepter, golden orb with a cross) and jewelry (long gold necklace, three gold rings; one of them, gifted to her by Sigismund Augustus, was covered with black vitreous enamel and had three stones ‚Äì brilliant, ruby, and emerald). These and other artifacts were kept at Vilnius Cathedral, but they disappeared during World War II. Her skeleton was cleaned, conserved, and glued together by Micha≈Ç Reicher and Witold Sylwanowicz, professors at Stefan Batory University. They calculated her height at , which was rather tall for her times. Her teeth were white and straight; her body was slim; her face and nose were narrow. They also noted anatomical abnormalities ‚Äì a cervical (extra) rib and particularly flat sacrum, which could indicate rickets, but the rest of her skeleton showed no signs of the disease. However, they were unable to complete their monograph on the subject due to World War II. Barbara's remains were moved to a crypt under the Chapel of Saint Casimir and remained untouched until 2001. Her height was recalculated at . Using methods developed by Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov, Vytautas Urbanaviƒçius reconstructed her facial features and revealed that she had an aquiline nose, a feature absent from her portraits. Personal correspondence In total, there are 53 surviving letters from Barbara. 44 of them were published by Alexander Przezdziecki in Jagiellonki polskie x XVI wieku (1868). They are addressed to her family (41 letters to her brother Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, two letters to her nephews, one letter to her father Jerzy Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, one letter to her mother Barbara Kolanka), her husband (8 letters), and Albert, Duke of Prussia (one letter in Latin). It is known that she wrote many more letters to a wider circle of recipients, including Polish nobles and Isabella Jagiellon of Hungary. The surviving letters do not represent actual number or frequency: Sigismund Augustus in his last will asked his sister Anna Jagiellon to destroy his personal correspondence, while Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç was particularly careful to preserve all his correspondence. 52 letters are in Polish (15 of them written by Barbara herself; the rest were written by her secretary Stanis≈Çaw Koszutski). Her eight letters to Sigismund Augustus, all written between November 1547 and March 1548 from Dubingiai, are the only surviving love letters of the period. However, they are formulaic and use flowery language. Above all, her letters show her humility and subservience to her husband. Barbara habitually refers to herself as his most humble and smallest servant. She inquires about his health, thanks him for any sign of his good grace and favor, asks him not to forget her. Letters written to others, particularly those by her secretary, are similarly standard though she manages to include more honest and warm greetings and wishes. Initially, Sigismund Augustus lectured her on the proper use of the royal \\"we\\" after she sent letters with singular \\"I\\". She rarely writes about herself or politics. She often inquired about the recipients' health and wished them good health, trusting God and His good grace. Her correspondence with her brother was controlled by Sigismund Augustus; therefore she wrote several letters to him in secret from her husband. In popular culture Pan Twardowski summons Barbara's ghost. Painting by Wojciech Gerson. Barbara's life and death have inspired legends, paintings, literary works and film. The popular legend of Pan Twardowski has that Faust-like figure summoning Barbara's ghost for King Sigismund August. In 1817 Alojzy Feli≈Ñski wrote a tragedy, and in 1858 Antoni Edward Odyniec a drama, Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç√≥wna. A 19th-century lithograph by Micha≈Ç Kulesza depicting her with pearls is considered among the painter's notable works. In 1983 Janusz Majewski directed a film, Epitafium dla Barbary Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç√≥wny (Epitaph for Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç) about Barbara's romance with King Sigismund August, her death and her posthumous return to Vilnius. Anna Dymna starred as Barbara, and Jerzy Zelnik as King Sigismund August. Barbara has also appeared as a major character in Kr√≥lowa Bona (Queen Bona), TV series on Telewizja Polska. In Lithuania, two plays Barbora Radvilaitƒó were written, by Balys Sruoga in 1946 (unfinished) and Juozas Gru≈°as in 1972. The latter was staged by the Kaunas State Drama Theater and directed by Jonas Jura≈°as. It was also turned into a film, directed by Vidmantas Baƒçiulis, in 1982. In 2012, musical ≈Ωygimanto Augusto ir Barboros Radvilaitƒós legenda by An≈æelika Cholina was described as the biggest and most expensive in Lithuania. The story of Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç served as an inspiration for the title track from the 2013 album Czornaja Panna by the Belarusian folkmetal band Litvintroll, a lyrical account of Sigismund's pain and grief after Barbara's death. The band claims the song not only to have given the name to the album but also to have \\"set its whole outline.\\"litvintroll.com (date of access: 11 Jul. 2013) On October 6, 2018, a musical titled \\"The Legend of Zygimantas Augustas and Barbora Radvilaite,\\" was performed at the Auditorium Theater in Chicago.

The original transmitter was destroyed at the end of World War II, but was later rebuilt. It had two guyed steel framework masts, one with a height of 265 metres and another with a height of 120 metres. Both masts were insulated against ground. The higher mast, which was the tallest construction of Austria before demolition, was designed for use on 585 kHz, while the smaller one was designed for 1476 kHz. From January 1, 1995 to July 1, 1997, the installation was shut down, with the 1476 kHz transmitter being reactivated on July 1, 1997. The masts were demolished with controlled explosions on February 24, 2010; this decision by the city of Vienna was based on that maintenance of the technologically obsolete masts as historical monuments would have been too costly. As of February 24, 2010, the Danube Tower is the tallest structure in Austria.

It is located in the Sorbian settlement area of Upper Lusatia, a region where some people speak the Sorbian language in addition to German. Hoyerswerda is divided into the Old Town and the New Town surrounded by village areas. The Old Town is the historical centre with many old houses and sight-seeing attractions, the New Town is more modern and varicoloured. Prior to the renovation of the town, prefabricated apartment blocks predominated in this area. The town has many lakes, marshes and waterways in its surrounding area, because of its situation in Lusatia. This brings many tourists to spend their holidays there. It is attractive for cyclists and inline skaters who use recently created paths meandering among the lakes. Geography The town is situated in the north of the District of Bautzen, close to the borders of Saxony with Brandenburg. Major cities and towns in proximity are Cottbus in the north-west, Dresden in the south-west and Berlin in the north. Hoyerswerda is part of Upper Lusatia and lies on a rural plain characterised by the presence of several lakes and some marshes. =Districts= Hoyerswerda is divided beside the Old Town and New Town into the following districts: * Br√∂then-Michalken (Upper Sorbian: Brƒõtnja/Micha≈Çki) * D√∂rgenhausen (Upper Sorbian: Nƒõmcy) * Knappenrode (Upper Sorbian: H√≥rnikecy) * Schwarzkolm (Upper Sorbian: ƒåorny Cho≈Çmc) * Zei√üig (Upper Sorbian: ƒÜisk) Old Town The old town of Hoyerswerda is divided into eleven districts: Neida, Dresdner Vorstadt, Am Bahnhof ('At the Railway Station'), Am Stadtrand ('On the Outskirts'), an der Neupetershainer Bahn, An der Thrune, Innere Altstadt ('Inner Historic Centre'), Senftenberger Vorstadt, Spremberger Vorstadt, N√∂rdliche Elsteraue, S√ºdliche Elsteraue. View at the New Town's Lusatian Square (Lausitzer Platz) New Town The new town of Hoyerswerda is divided into 14 districts: Neustadt Zentrum ('New Town Centre'), K√ºhnicht, Gr√ºnewaldring, Gondelteich ('Gondola Lake'), Wohnkomplex I, Wohnkomplex II, Wohnkomplex III, Wohnkomplex IV, Wohnkomplex V/VE, Wohnkomplex VI, Wohnkomplex VII, Wohnkomplex VIII, Wohnkomplex IX, Wohnkomplex X. Sources: History =Early history= The first settlers arrived in this area in 700 AD. They were Milceni Slavs. Many artifacts from this old culture have been found in the Hoyerswerda area. 1000 AD saw the construction of the first church in the town; the Heilige Familie ('Holy Family') which is still standing today in the historic centre of Hoyerswerda. In 1150, Hoyerswerda first appeared on a map of Lusatia. The city was first mentioned in 1268. At the time the mayor was Hoyer von Vredeberg. In 1371 it was designated an official market town. Before this Hoyerswerda was a very little town with few structures, but the city then grew under the leadership of the new mayor Karl IV. It received municipal rights from Freiherr von Duba on 19 December 1423, as well as the right to elect its own council. In the 17th century, the city experienced many problems due to the 30 Years War. The Number of inhabitants dropped drastically, but recovered by the end of the century. In 1624, Hoyerswerda became the capital of the Spremberg district. A few years later the district took the name Hoyerswerda because of the growing importance of the city. Hoyerswerda Castle in the 18th century In the middle of this century Hoyerswerda had become the largest town in the Lusatian region. In the 18th century the Polish King and Elector of Saxony, Augustus II the Strong, gave the Duchy of Hoyerswerda to Ursula Katharina Lubomirska, who helped the town develop trade and manufacturing. In 1737, King Augustus III of Poland bought the town from Lubomirska. The King used to stop in the Hoyerswerda Castle during his travels from Dresden to Warsaw. The Battle of Hoyerswerda occurred nearby in 1759 during the Seven Years' War. In 1815, Hoyerswerda became part of the Prussian Province of Silesia. In 1871, with Prussia it became part of the German Empire. In 1873 a new railway between Hoyerswerda and Ruhland opened. It had a positive effect on the economic development of the city. In 1912, the Domowina, the organisation of the Sorbs, was founded in the city. In 1918, the Sorbs protested here against the policy of Germanisation. The town became part of the Prussian Province of Lower Silesia in 1919. =Recent history= GDR type housing built in the 1950s At the end of the Second World War the town was declared a core centre of German defence and was therefore heavily damaged. The invading Soviet Red Army set the town on fire. It became part of Saxony again after the war, but from 1952 until 1990, when the states of East Germany were abolished, it was administered by the Bezirk (Region) of Cottbus. During the GDR period, Hoyerswerda became an important industrial town. The lignite processing enterprise \\"Schwarze Pumpe\\" was established in 1955 (it is today in the federal state of Brandenburg). From 1957, the demand for new living space rose dramatically. In the following years, 10 new living areas were established with tens of thousands of apartments being built. In 1981, the city reached its maximum number of inhabitants, with 71,054 residents. At that time, more children per inhabitant were born in Hoyerswerda than anywhere else in the GDR. Upon reunification in 1990, the people of the city decided to become part of the reconstituted state of Saxony. With the end of the GDR and the reorganisation of the East German economy, many enterprises in the industrial region of Hoyerswerda were scaled down or closed. In 1991 multiple xenophobic attacks targeted immigrant workers from the Far East as well as asylum seekers from Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe. A hostel accommodating asylum seekers was attacked and petrol bombs were thrown. Media coverage of the unrest shocked many in Germany and abroad, provoking much public debate. Between 1993 and 1998, several smaller villages became part of the city, but the number of overall inhabitants declined rapidly, from about 70,000 people in the 1980s to about 35,000 people by the end of 2012. There have been attempts to renovate the city. Many of the apartment blocks built during the time of the GDR have been demolished or renovated.Layer, Till. \\"Born in the east, young Germans still forced to head west.\\" CNN. 24 October 2009.

With the reunification of Germany and the subsequent demise of a centrally planned economy, the city lost many jobs as the glassworks and artillery range were closed, and the power plant reduced its payroll. The industries on the secondary sector disappeared nearly completely. It is, however, expected that new houses must be built in Hoyerswerda, because of an anticipated increase in population due to copper mining at Schwarze Pumpe. There is also a thermal power plant planned for Hoyerswerda, because the district heating contract with Schwarze Pumpe will end in 2016. Unemployment remains at 13%.

It was published first in English in 1733 and then in French the following year, where it was seen as an attack on the French system of government and was rapidly suppressed. A revised edition appeared in English in 1778 as Lettres philosophiques sur les Anglais (Philosophical Letters on the English). Most modern English editions are based on the one from 1734 and typically use the title Philosophical Letters, a direct translation of that version's title. In some ways, the book can be compared with Democracy in America by Alexis De Tocqueville, in how it flatteringly explains a nation to itself from the perspective of an outsider, as Voltaire's depictions of aspects of English culture, society and government are often given favourable treatment in comparison to their French equivalents. Summary Lettres anglaises consists of twenty-four letters: *Letter I: On The Quakers *Letter II: On The Quakers *Letter III: On The Quakers *Letter IV: On The Quakers *Letter V: On The Church of England *Letter VI: On The Presbyterians *Letter VII: On The Socinians, or Arians, or Antitrinitarians *Letter VIII: On The Parliament *Letter IX: On The Government *Letter X: On Trade *Letter XI: On Inoculation *Letter XII: On The Lord Bacon *Letter XIII: On Mr. Locke *Letter XIV: On Descartes and Sir Isaac Newton *Letter XV: On Attraction *Letter XVI: On Sir Isaac Newton's Optics *Letter XVII: On Infinites in Geometry, and Sir Isaac Newton's Chronology *Letter XVIII: On Tragedy *Letter XIX: On Comedy *Letter XX: On Such of The Nobility as Cultivate The Belles Lettres *Letter XXI: On The Earl of Rochester and Mr. Waller *Letter XXII: On Mr. Pope and Some Other Famous Poets *Letter XXIII: On The Regard That Ought to Be Shown to Men of Letters *Letter XXIV: On The Royal Society and Other Academies =Religion= Voltaire first addresses religion in Letters 1‚Äì7. He specifically talks about Quakers (1‚Äì4), Anglicans (5), Presbyterians (6), and Socinians (7). In the Letters 1-4, Voltaire describes the Quakers, their customs, their beliefs, and their history. He appreciates the simplicity of their rituals. In particular, he praises their lack of baptism (\\"we are not of opinion that the sprinkling water on a child's head makes him a Christian\\"), the lack of communion (\\"'How! no communion?' said I. 'Only that spiritual one,' replied he, 'of hearts'\\"), and the lack of priests (\\"'You have, then, no priests?' said I to him. 'No, no, friend,' replies the Quaker, 'to our great happiness'\\"), but still expresses concern regarding the manipulative nature of organized religion. Letter 5 is devoted to the Anglican religion, which Voltaire compares favourably to Catholicism (\\"With regard to the morals of the English clergy, they are more regular than those of France\\"), but he criticizes the ways in which it has stayed true to the Catholic rituals, in particular (\\"The English clergy have retained a great number of the Romish ceremonies, and especially that of receiving, with a most scrupulous attention, their tithes.). In Letter 6, Voltaire attacks the Presbyterians, whom he sees as intolerant (\\"[The Presbyterian] affects a serious gait, puts on a sour look, wears a vastly broad-brimmed hat and a long cloak over a very short coat, preaches through the nose, and gives the name of the whore of Babylon to all churches where the ministers are so fortunate as to enjoy an annual revenue of five or six thousand pounds, and where the people are weak enough to suffer this, and to give them the titles of my lord, your lordship, or your eminence\\") and overly strict (\\"No operas, plays, or concerts are allowed in London on Sundays, and even cards are so expressly forbidden that none but persons of quality, and those we call the genteel, play on that day; the rest of the nation go either to church, to the tavern, or to see their mistresses\\"). Finally, in the Letter 7, he talks about the \\"Socinians,\\" whose belief system is somewhat related to Voltaire's own deist viewpoint. Voltaire argues that while this sect includes some of the day's most important thinkers (including Newton and Locke), this is not enough to persuade the common man that it is logical. According to Voltaire, men prefer to follow the teachings of \\"wretched authors\\" such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, or Huldrych Zwingli. =Politics= In Letters 8 and 9, Voltaire discusses the English political system. Letter 8 talks about the British parliament, which he compares to both Rome and France. In terms of Rome, Voltaire deprecates the fact that England has entered wars on account of religion (whereas Rome did not), but he praises England for serving liberty rather than tyranny (as in Rome). In terms of France, Voltaire responds to French criticism concerning the regicide of Charles I by highlighting the British judicial process as opposed to the outright murders of Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII or Henry III of France, or the multiple attempts on the life of Henry IV of France. In Letter 9, Voltaire gives a brief history of Magna Carta, talks about the equal dispensing of justice, and the levying of taxes. =Trade and commerce= In Letter 10, Voltaire praises the English trade system, its benefits, and what it brings to the English (from 1707, British) nation. According to Voltaire, trade greatly contributed to the liberty of the English people, and this liberty in turn contributed to the expansion of commerce. It is trade as well that gave England its naval riches and power. In addition, Voltaire takes the opportunity to satirize the German and French nobles who ignore this type of enterprise. For Voltaire, nobles are less important than the businessman who \\"contributes to the felicity of the world.\\" =Medicine= In Letter 11, Voltaire argues in favour for the English practice of inoculation, which was widely mistrusted and condemned in continental Europe. This letter is probably in response to a 1723 small pox epidemic in Paris that killed 20,000 people. =Famous Britons= Letter 12 speaks of Francis Bacon, author of Novum Organum and father of experimental philosophy. Letter 13 is about John Locke and his theories on the immortality of the soul. Letter 14 compares British philosopher Isaac Newton to French philosopher Ren√© Descartes. Upon his death in 1727, Newton was compared to Descartes in a eulogy performed by French philosopher Fontenelle. While the British did not appreciate this comparison, Voltaire argues that Descartes, too, was a great philosopher and mathematician. Letter 15 focuses on Newton's law of universal gravitation. Letter 16 talks about Newton's work with optics. Letter 17 discusses Newton's work with geometry and his theories on the chronology of history. =Art= In Letter 18, Voltaire talks about British tragedy, specifically in the hands of William Shakespeare. Voltaire presents his readers with the famous \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy in Hamlet along with a translation into French rhyming verse. He also cites a passage from John Dryden and gives a translation. In Letter 19, Voltaire addresses British comedy, citing William Wycherley, John Vanbrugh, and William Congreve. Letter 20 speaks briefly of the belles lettres of the nobility, including the Earl of Rochester and Edmund Waller. Letter 22 references the poetry of Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. In Letter 23, Voltaire argues that the British honour their Men of Letters far better than the French in terms of money and veneration. The last letter, letter 24, discusses the Royal Society of London, which he compares unfavourably to the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. Letter XXV =Philosophy= In the letter 25, which was not included with the original twenty-four, Voltaire criticizes certain ideas of Blaise Pascal by taking citations from his Pens√©es and giving his own opinion on the same subject. The most important difference between the two philosophers is in their conception of man. Pascal insists on the miserable aspect of man who must fill the emptiness of his life with amusements, while Voltaire accepts the optimistic Enlightenment view.

The plot of Cinema Paradiso is loosely based on the story of the Protti family, who have owned a movie theatre in Mantua, Italy, since 1904. The film stars Jacques Perrin, Philippe Noiret, Leopoldo Trieste, Marco Leonardi, Agnese Nano and Salvatore Cascio, and was produced by Franco Cristaldi and Giovanna Romagnoli, while the music score was composed by Ennio Morricone along with his son, Andrea. It won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards. Plot In 1988 Rome, famous film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in thirty years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. A few years after World War II, eight-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the middle-aged projectionist, Alfredo, who often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. Alfredo eventually teaches Salvatore how to operate the film projector. Cinema Paradiso catches fire as Alfredo is projecting The Firemen of Viggi√π after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before a reel of nitrate film explodes in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The movie house is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines. About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the \\"Nuovo Cinema Paradiso\\". His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help ‚Äì advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films. Salvatore has been experimenting with film, using a home movie camera, and he has met, and captured on film, Elena, daughter of a wealthy banker. Salvatore woos ‚Äì and wins ‚Äì Elena's heart, only to lose her due to her father's disapproval. As Elena and her family move away, Salvatore leaves town for compulsory military service. His attempts to write to Elena are fruitless; his letters are returned as undeliverable. Upon his return from the military, Alfredo urges Salvatore to leave Giancaldo permanently, counseling that the town is too small for Salvatore to ever find his dreams. Moreover, the old man tells him, once Salvatore leaves, he must pursue his destiny wholeheartedly, never looking back and never returning, even to visit; he must never give in to nostalgia or even write or think about them. They tearfully embrace, and Salvatore leaves town to pursue his future as a filmmaker. Salvatore has obeyed Alfredo, but he returns home to attend Alfredo's funeral. Though the town has changed greatly, he now understands why Alfredo thought it was important that he leave. Alfredo's widow tells him that the old man followed Salvatore's successes with pride and he left him something -- an unlabeled film reel and the old stool that Salvatore once stood on to operate the projector. Salvatore learns that Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished to make way for a parking lot. At the funeral, he recognizes the faces of many people who attended the cinema when he was the projectionist. Salvatore returns to Rome. He watches Alfredo's reel and discovers it comprises all the romantic scenes that the priest had ordered Alfredo to cut from the movies; Alfredo had spliced the sequences together to form a single unreduced film of aching desire and lustful frenzy. Salvatore has made peace with his past with tears in his eyes. Cast * Philippe Noiret as Alfredo * Salvatore Cascio as child Salvatore Di Vita ** Marco Leonardi as teenage Salvatore Di Vita *** Jacques Perrin as adult Salvatore Di Vita * Agnese Nano as Elena Mendola ** Brigitte Fossey (Extended cut) as adult Elena Mendola * Antonella Attili as Maria Di Vita ** Pupella Maggio as old Maria Di Vita * Enzo Cannavale as Spaccafico * Isa Danieli as Anna * Leopoldo Trieste as Father Adelfio * Nino Terzo as Peppino's father * Giovanni Giancono as the Mayor Production Cinema Paradiso was shot in director Tornatore's hometown Bagheria, Sicily, as well as Cefal√π on the Tyrrhenian Sea. The famous town square is Piazza Umberto I in the village of Palazzo Adriano, about 30 miles to the south of Palermo. The ‚ÄòParadiso‚Äô cinema was built here, at Via Nino Bixio, overlooking the octagonal Baroque fountain, which dates from 1608. Told largely in flashback of a successful film director Salvatore to his childhood years, it also tells the story of the return to his native Sicilian village for the funeral of his old friend Alfredo, the projectionist at the local \\"Cinema Paradiso\\". Ultimately, Alfredo serves as a wise father figure to his young friend who only wishes to see him succeed, even if it means breaking his heart in the process. Seen as an example of \\"nostalgic postmodernism\\",Marcus, p. 99 the film intertwines sentimentality with comedy, and nostalgia with pragmaticism. It explores issues of youth, coming of age, and reflections (in adulthood) about the past. The imagery in the scenes can be said to reflect Salvatore's idealised memories of his childhood. Cinema Paradiso is also a celebration of films; as a projectionist, young Salvatore (a.k.a. Tot√≤) develops a passion for films that shapes his life path in adulthood. Releases The film exists in multiple versions. It was originally released in Italy at 155 minutes, but poor box office performance in its native country led to its being shortened to 124 minutes for international release; it was an instant success.Bondanella, p. 454 This international version won the Special Jury Prize at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and the 1989 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. In 2002, the director's cut 173-minute version was released (known in the U.S. as Cinema Paradiso: The New Version). =Director's cut= In the 173-minute version of the film, after the funeral, Salvatore glimpses an adolescent girl who resembles the teenage Elena. He follows the teen as she rides her scooter to her home, which allows Salvatore to contact his long-lost love Elena, who is revealed to be the girl's mother. Salvatore calls her in hopes of rekindling their romance; she initially rejects him, but later reconsiders and goes to see Salvatore, who was contemplating his rejection at a favorite location from their early years. Their meeting ultimately leads to a lovemaking session in her car. He learns that she had married an acquaintance from his school years, who became a local politician of modest means. Afterwards, feeling cheated, he strives to rekindle their romance, and while she clearly wishes it were possible, she rejects his entreaties, choosing to remain with her family and leave their romance in the past. During their evening together, a frustrated and angry Salvatore asks Elena why she never contacted him or left word of where her family was moving to. He learns that the reason they lost touch was because Alfredo asked her not to see him again, fearing that Salvatore's romantic fulfillment would only destroy what Alfredo sees as Salvatore's destiny ‚Äì to be successful in film. Alfredo tried to convince her that if she loved Salvatore, she should leave him for his own good. Elena explains to Salvatore that, against Alfredo's instruction, she had secretly left a note with an address where she could be reached and a promise of undying love and loyalty. Salvatore reveals that he never knew of her note, and thus lost his true love for more than thirty years. The next morning, Salvatore returns to the decaying Cinema Paradiso and frantically searches through the piles of old film invoices pinned to the wall of the projection booth. There, on the reverse side of one of the dockets, he finds the handwritten note Elena had left thirty years earlier. The film ends with Salvatore returning to Rome and, with teary eyes, viewing the film reel that Alfredo left. Home media A special edition of Cinema Paradiso was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in September 2006. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the theatrical trailer, the Director's Cut version, scenes from the Director's Cut, the Ennio Morricone soundtrack and a documentary on Giuseppe Tornatore. An Academy Award edition of Cinema Paradiso was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in February 2009. It is also compatible with all region codes and includes different special features such as Umbrella Entertainment trailers, cast and crew biographies and the Director's filmography. In July 2011 Umbrella Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray. Arrow released a remastered special edition Blu-ray of the film, with both theatrical and extended cuts, in 2017. In June 2020 Arrow Films announced a 4K UHD Blu-ray release with both of the aforementioned cuts due for September of that year, although only the 124 minute theatrical cut will be a 4K UHD presentation, the 174 minute Director‚Äôs Cut will be included as a blu-ray presentation only. Reception Cinema Paradiso was a critical and box-office success and is regarded by many as a classic. It is particularly renowned for the 'kissing scenes' montage at the film's end. Winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1989, the film is often credited with reviving Italy's film industry, which later produced Mediterraneo and Life Is Beautiful. Film critic Roger Ebert gave it three and a half stars out of four and four stars out of four for the extended version, declaring \\"Still, I'm happy to have seen it--not as an alternate version, but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes.\\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 89% of critics have given the film a regular review based on 75 reviews, with an average score of 8.02/10. The film also holds a score of 80 based on 20 reviews on Metacritic. The film was ranked #27 in Empire magazine's \\"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\\" in 2010. The famed \\"kissing scene\\" montage at the end of the film was used in \\"Stealing First Base\\", an episode of The Simpsons that aired on March 21, 2010, during its twenty-first season. The scene used Morricone's \\"Love Theme\\" and included animated clips of famous movie kisses, including scenes used in Cinema Paradiso as well as contemporary films not shown in the original film. American progressive metal band Dream Theater 1992 album Images and Words's song \\"Take the Time\\" features in the lyrics the sentence spoken by Alfredo after the fire ora che ho perso la vista, ci vedo di pi√π! (I can see much clearer now I'm blind).

The range of inquiry in this field is quite broad and can include studies as diverse as works of video game theory to a quantitative study of first-year college students using Microsoft Word. Some frequently addressed topics include hypertext theory, visual rhetoric, multimedia authoring, distance learning, digital rhetoric, usability studies, the formation and lifecycles of online communities, and how various media change reading and writing practices, textual conventions, and genres. Other topics examine social or critical issues in computer technology and literacy, such as the issues of the \\"digital divide\\", equitable access to computer-writing resources, and critical technological literacies. \\"Computers and Writing\\" is also the name of an academic conference (see below). The field The field, which (in the United States, at least) has grown out of rhetoric and composition studies, is inter- disciplinary, and members also do scholarly work and teaching in such allied and diverse areas as technical and professional communication, linguistics, sociology, and law. Important journals supporting this field are Computers & Composition, Computers & Composition Online, and Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy.Though there is no single professional organization covering this field, an information resource portal exists at https://web.archive.org/web/20160422020552/http://computersandwriting.org/. The professional organization Conference on College Composition and Communication has a committee, known as the 7Cs committee (CCCC Committee on Computers in Composition and Communication), that selects onsite and online hosts for the Computers & Writing conference and coordinates the \\"Technology Innovator Award\\" presented at that annual conference.  Conference and conference history  The conference \\"Computers and Writing\\" was established in 1982 in Minneapolis, Minnesota by Donald Ross and Lillian Bridwell. The conference was informal at first, but over the years, it has grown from a grassroots organized conference to an established, mainstream conference that examines the ways in which computers change writing practice and pedagogy. In earlier conferences, the scholarship presented often explored how computers influenced individual writers, but during the late 1980s and 1990s, scholarship shifted to hypertext and hypermedia, and therefore, the social nature of computer mediated writing. The conference originally presented original or \\"homemade\\" software design associated with word processing and editing, but eventually switched to commercial software as commercial software became more common for both individual students and educational institutions. The conference has a history of technological optimism, and often, scholarship presented is optimistic regarding technology's influence on writing. However, the conference also has a history of examining and voicing fears and concerns related to computer technology, and some of these fears are related to institutional policies and control as well as the fear of being overwhelmed by the constant march of technological innovation. The conference has also traditionally explored how computer-mediated writing can be used in socially responsible ways, as is evident by the feminist roots of the conference and subfield. The conference's feminist roots are evident in its support of minority scholars and scholarship. Awards such as the Hawisher and Selfe Caring for the Future Scholarship provide opportunities for new presenters in Computers and Writing related fields to attend the conference. This scholarship is preferably awarded to minority scholars who are involved in the field. While the conference was originally more focused on software and hardware decisions and use, the conference has steadily become more concerned with the theoretical application of computers in writing pedagogy and practice. This attention to theory mirrors a shift to embrace multimodal compositions as texts and interdisciplinary growth as the conference became more mainstream and established in the 1990s and early 2000s. The conference has been held annually since 1988, which is the year that the CCCC Committee on Computers established a subcommittee to support the Computers and Writing Conference. While the journal Computers and Composition, founded by Cynthia Selfe and Kate Kiefer in 1983, is not officially connected to the Computers and Writing Conference, both began around the same time and explore the subfield within the larger fields of composition studies and rhetoric. Pedagogy Computers and writing pedagogy allows students to learn practical applications and implications of writing by exploring complex concepts such as visual rhetoric, issues of access, and the social implications of online writing. Students and teachers, together, interrogate the computer as an environment where writing can be facilitated in a variety of ways. Particular attention tends to be paid to the production and consumption of digital, multimodal, and new media texts. The majority of computers and writing scholars seem to agree that engaging students in the production of such multimodal/digital texts are crucial to the learning process in our digitally infused moment, but how best to do this is somewhat controversial. During the 1960s and 1970s, which was also known as the \\"Birth of Composition\\", computer- assisted instruction was used to \\"observe\\" students and provided instant positive, negative, or constructive feedback.Whithaus, Carl. \\"The Development of Early Computer-Assisted Writing Instruction (1960-1978): The Double Logic of Media and Tools\\". Computers & the Humanities, vol. 38, no. 2, May 2004, pp. 149-162. However, there was initial criticism from anti-technology groups. Many teachers thought that the technology needed improvement because the programs did not allow for the creative expression of the students since the programs only acted as an evaluator, reader, and feedback agent. Since that time the technology has improved immensely. Now the programs require multimodality, creativity, and technical complexity.Edwards-Groves, Christine. \\"Interactive Creative Technologies: Changing Learning Practices and Pedagogies in the Writing Classroom\\". Australian Journal of Language & Literacy, vol. 35, no. 1, Feb. 2012, pp. 99-113. The problems the students face in these programs now require much more comprehensive thinking and creativity to the point that it is difficult to still call the subject \\"writing\\" because the students are required to know much more. Computers and writing pedagogies must be dynamic and adaptable to how technology, media, and the sociopolitical spaces operate in a constant state of flux. Discussions about negotiating paradigm shifts abound in disciplinary journals, and teachers continually develop new approaches that engage with and build upon developments in digital technology and new media texts. Because most scholars in this area work within a university system that privileges print-media over digital text, much of the work produced and assigned by these teachers and scholars continue to be relatively traditional. While a Computers and Writing pedagogy should encourage the use of sampling, remixing, and file sharing that invites students to conceive themselves as reproducers or co-authors of digital compositions as well as consumers, this is not always an achievable goal. In the pedagogical paradigm shift that computers and composition scholars strive for, students play a vital role in the construction and transformation of knowledge. Writing in the age of communication technology In the age of communication technology, amateurs and experts collaborate to create, sustain, and develop virtual communities based on what James Paul Gee and Elisabeth Hayes have called \\"passionate affinity spaces\\", or communities organized around \\"a shared endeavor, interest, or passion\\". Technology, specifical blogs, can be a way to build learning communities and help students learn to write authentically for and respond to various audiences by making their writing public. On the virtual playing field, knowledge and talent matter more than degrees and professional memberships, so these spaces offer students a new learning environment and space to collaborate on the production and distribution of knowledge. Aligning with the notion of \\"affinity space\\", composition scholars have coined the term \\"cultural ecology\\" to examine the complex social and cultural contexts that shape the development of technological literacy. Drawing from the literacy narratives of two participants, Hawisher, Selfe, Moraski, and Pearson theorized five themes emergent from the cultural ecology of literacy, namely the \\"cultural, material, educational, and familial contexts\\" that shape and are shaped by literacy development. The five themes of cultural ecology emphasize that technological literacy goes through life spans, that literacy provides the medium for people to exert their agency, that literacy occurs and develops both within and outside of school contexts, that the conditions of access influence people's literacy development, and that literacy practices and values transmit via family units. Kristine Blair pointed to the positive impacts of cultural conflicts in constructing online discourses and political discussions, while at the same time warning that students may not transform exposure to the conflicts. Also looming behind the issue of culture in computer and writing is the digital divide. Cynthia Selfe showed that unequal access to technological literacy is situated in unequal social, cultural, economic, and political situations. As Selfe wrote, \\"computers continue to be distributed along the related axes of race and socioeconomic status and this distribution continues to ongoing patterns of racism and to the continuation of poverty.\\" To address the digital divide, Selfe called upon educators and compositionists to rethink computer literacy as a political act that requires paying critical attention to inequality issues and acting politically in specific disciplinary contexts.

His work on the APE(X)C series was sponsored by the British Rayon Research Association.The British computer industry: crisis and development By Tim Kelly, page 41Early British computers, Simon Hugh Lavington 1980 Although the naming conventions are slightly unclear, it seems the first model belonged to the BRRA.History of Computing:Learning from the Past, Arthur Tatnall Springer, 2010 According to Booth, the X stood for X-company.Book 495 in Origins of cyberspace: a library on the history of computing, Diana H. Hook, Jeremy M. Norman, Michael R. Williams. Norman Publishing, 2002 One of the series was also known as the APE(X)C or All Purpose Electronic X-Ray Computer and was sited at Birkbeck. Background From 1943 on, Booth started working on the determination of crystal structures using X-ray diffraction data. The computations involved were extremely tedious and there was ample incentive for automating the process and he developed an analogue computer to compute the reciprocal spacings of the diffraction pattern. In 1947, along with his collaborator and future spouse Kathleen Britten, he spent a few months with von Neumann's team, which was the leading edge in computer research at the time. ARC and SEC Booth designed an electromechanical computer, the ARC (Automatic Relay Computer), in the late 1940s (1947-1948). Later on, they built an experimental electronic computer named SEC (Simple Electronic Computer, designed around 1948-1949) - and finally, the APE(X)C (All-Purpose Electronic Computer) series. The computers were programmed by Kathleen. The APE(X) C series The APE(X)C series included the following machines: * APE(X)C: Birkbeck College, London, first time operated in May 1952, ready for use at the end of 1953 * APE(N)C: Board of Mathematical Machines, Oslo ('N' likely stands for 'Norway'), also known as NUSSE * APE(H)C: British Tabulating Machine Company (It is unclear what 'H' stands for - perhaps 'Hollerith' as the company sold Hollerith Unit record equipment * APE(R)C: British Rayon Research Association ('R' stands for 'Rayon'), ready for use in June 1952 * UCC: University College, London (circa January 1956) * MAC or MAGIC (Magnetic Automatic Calculator): \\"built by Wharf Engineering Laboratories\\" (February 1955) * The HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer), built by the British Tabulating Machine Company (later to become International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), then International Computers Limited (ICL)), a commercial machine sold in several models and later known as the ICT200 series. There were likely the derivatives HEC 1, HEC 2, HEC 2M - M for 'marketable' denoting the machine's orientation toward commercial rather than scientific customers, and HEC 4 (before 1955) Only one of each of these machines was built, with the exception of HEC (and possibly MAC) which were commercial machines produced in quite large numbers for the time, around 150. They were similar in design, with various small differences, mostly in I/O equipment. The APEHC was a punched card machine while the APEXC, APERC and APENC were teletypers (keyboard and printer, plus paper tape reader and puncher). Also, the UCC had 8k words of storage, instead of 1k word for other machines, and the MAC used germanium diodes in replacement of many valves. British Tabulating Machine Company machines BTM Hollerith Electronic Computer 1 Prototype In March 1951, the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) sent a team to Andrew Booth's workshop. They then used his design to create the Hollerith Electronic Computer 1 (HEC 1) before the end of 1951. The computer was a direct copy of Andrew Booth's circuits with extra Input/output interfaces. The HEC 2 was the HEC 1 with smarter metal casings and was built for the Business Efficiency Exhibition in 1953. A slightly modified version of the HEC 2 was then marketed as HEC2M and 8 were sold. The HEC2M was succeeded by the HEC4. Around 100 HEC4s were sold in the late 1950s. The HEC used standard punched cards; the HEC 4 had a printer, too, and it featured several instructions (such as divide) and registers not found on the APEXC. Technical description An emulator for the APEXC series has been developed by MESS. They describe its functioning as follows: > The APEXC is an incredibly simple machine. > Instruction and data words are always 32 bits long. The processor uses > integer arithmetic with 2's complement representation. Addresses are 10 bits > long. The APEXC has no RAM, except for a 32-bit accumulator and a 32-bit > data register (used along with the 32-bit accumulator to implement 64-bit > shift instructions and hold the 64-bit result of a multiplication). > Instructions and data are stored in two magnetic drums, for a total of 32 > circular magnetic tracks of 32 words. Since the rotation rate is 3750rpm > (62.5 rotations per second), the program execution speed can go from as high > as the theoretical maximum of 1 kIPS to lower than 100IPS if program > instructions and data are not contiguous. Nowadays, many say a pocket > calculator is faster. > One oddity is that there is no program counter: each machine instruction > includes the address of the next instruction. This design may sound weird, > but it is the only way to achieve optimal performance with this cylinder- > based memory. > The machine code is made of 15 instructions only, namely addition, > subtraction, multiplication, load (3 variants), store (2 variants), > conditional branch, right arithmetic bit shift, right bit rotation, punched- > card input, punched-card output, machine stop, and bank-switching (which is > never used on the APEXC, since it only has 1024 words of storage, and > addresses are 10-bit-long). A so-called vector mode enables to repeat the > same operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations. Note the lack > of bitwise and/or/xor and division. Also, note the lack of indirect > addressing modes: dynamic modification of opcodes is the only way one may > simulate it. > Another oddity is that the memory bus and the ALU are 1-bit-wide. There is > a 64 kHz bit-clock and a 2 kHz word-clock, and each word memory and > arithmetic operation is decomposed into 32 1-bit memory and arithmetic > operations: this takes 32 bit cycles, for a total of 1 word cycle. > The processor is fairly efficient: most instructions take only 2 word > cycles (1 for fetch, 1 for read operand and execute), with the exception of > stores, shifts and multiplications. The APEXC CPU qualifies as RISC; there > is no other adequate word. > Note there is no read-only memory (ROM), and therefore no bootstrap loader > or default start-up program whatsoever. It is believed that no executive or > operating system was ever written for the APEXC, although there were > subroutine libraries of sorts for common arithmetic, I/O and debug tasks. > Operation of the machine is normally done through a control panel which > allows the user to start, stop and resume the central processing unit, and > to alter registers and memory when the CPU is stopped. When starting the > machine, the address of the first instruction of the program to be executed > must be entered in the control panel, then the run switch must be pressed. > Most programs end with a stop instruction, which enables the operator to > check the state of the machine, possibly run some post-mortem debugging > procedures (a core dump routine is described in an APEXC programming book), > then enter the address of another program and run it. > Two I/O devices were supported: a paper tape reader, and a paper tape > puncher.

Nordic countries Popular socialism or people's socialism (Danish: Folkesocialisme) is a distinct socialist current in the Nordic countries. In that context the term can be said to represent a distinct ideological tendency, originating from Aksel Larsen's split from the Communist Party of Denmark in 1956. Larsen founded the Socialist People's Party (SF), which placed itself between communism and social democracy. In Norway a similar party, the Socialist People's Party, was formed by an anti- NATO/anti‚ÄìEuropean Economic Community split from the Labour Party and later became the backbone of Socialist Left Party (SV). Today, both the Danish SFhttp://sfunet.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/folkesocialisme-rc3b8de- skoleelever.pdf and the Norwegian SV identify their ideological base as 'popular socialism'. In Sweden the term has sometimes been used and there were at one point discussions within the rightist section of the Left Party on forming a political project with the Danish SF as model, but the split was eventually avoided. Inspired by green politics and democratic socialism, popular socialism places emphasis on grassroots democracy, social justice, and environmentalism. Popular socialist parties participate in democratic elections to gain clout and influence policy, but do not consider the power of government as their primary goal, preferring to work within participatory systems on a local level. United States The American People's Party was a populist farmer-labor movement that advocated a progressive income tax, federal farm credit, the nationalization of railroads, telegraphs, and banks, the eight-hour workday, the right to form labor organizations, and other demands typical of Popular socialist movements. Eastern European countries People's socialism in Eastern Europe originated in the 1890s as an effort to differentiate from traditional social democracy with basic ideological patterns from National-Social Association in Germany. The most promiment parties were People's Socialist Party in Yugoslavia, Russian Popular Socialists and National Socialist, understood as \\"people's socialist\\" Czech National Social Party in Czechoslovakia.

She is temporarily berthed at Alexandra Dock in Kingston upon Hull, England, pending completion of a new permanent location in the city's Museums Quarter. Exhibits and guides aboard the boat tell the story of Hull's deep-sea fishing industry. Description The Arctic Corsair is Hull‚Äôs last surviving sidewinder trawler, a type of ship that formed the backbone of the city‚Äôs deep sea fishing fleet. She was built in 1960, at Cook, Welton & Gemmell in Beverley, and was the second diesel-engined trawler built for the Boyd Line, the first being the Arctic Cavalier which was launched the previous month. She was designed for the harsh conditions encountered in the Icelandic grounds, having a rivetted rather than welded hull. History In September 1967 Arctic Corsair was holed on her starboard side in a collision off the coast of Scotland with the Irish collier Olive in thick fog. Attempting to reach harbour in Wick she was beached in Sinclair Bay but eventually repaired and refloated. In 1973, she broke the world record for landing of cod and haddock from the White Sea. On 30 April 1976 during the cod wars, she rammed the offshore patrol vessel in the stern, after √ì√∞inn had made three attempts to cut the Corsair's trawl warps. The skipper, Charles Pitts, said that Icelandic seamen were becoming \\"more ambitious and dangerous in their tactics\\". With his ship holed below the waterline, and patched up temporarily by the Royal Navy, Pitts decided to head for home for permanent repairs. Arctic Corsair was out of action for several months. In 2017, the vessels, now both museum ships, exchanged their bells as a gesture of cooperation. In 1978 she was converted for midwater trawling, and in 1981 laid up at Hull. In 1985 she was taken out of retirement and reconverted for normal fishing. She was renamed Arctic Cavalier in 1988. Museum ship In 1991, a campaign led by Adam Fowler of fishing heritage group STAND secured ¬£45,000 from the DTI Hull Task Force which enabled Hull City Council to purchase the trawler in 1993. The vessel immediately reverted to Arctic Corsair, and was berthed between Drypool Bridge and Myton Bridge in the River Hull as a museum ship. After being restored by trainees and volunteers from the STAND, the floating museum opened to the public in 1999. STAND entered into partnership with the City Council to provide volunteers to maintain and act as tour guides. Today, the floating museum is run entirely by volunteers but supported by Hull City Council. Arctic Corsair is temporarily closed during restoration work. In June 2018 to was announced that she was to move to dry-dock in September 2018 while flood defence work is undertaken on the River Hull. This was delayed while other flood defence work was undertaken but on 4 August 2019 was she moved to a temporary berth in Alexandra Dock. Later she will move to a new permanent berth in the redeveloped North End Shipyard in Dock Office Row as part of the Hull Maritime City project, back in the Museums Quarter.

Its population in 2017 was 1603.  History  The first wooden fortress on the coast of the Koporye Bay was built by the Teutonic Knights in the winter of 1240, only to be destroyed by Alexander Nevsky the next year. The second fortress was built in stone by Alexander's son Dmitry Alexandrovich in 1280. Enraged by the prince's independence, the Novgorodians razed the fortress two years later. The Swedes took advantage of the lack of a fortress and occupied the banks of the Narova river. The Novgorodians had to restore the stone fort in 1297. Koporye was the strongest stronghold in the region and survived numerous attacks during the Swedish- Novgorodian Wars. After Novgorod's incorporation into Muscovy, the fortress was strengthened and rebuilt to withstand cannon fire. Most extant structures belong to that period. Russian forces surrendered Koporye during the Livonian War but regained it under the Treaty of Tyavzino. During the Time of Troubles, Koporye was attacked by some 2000 Swedes. The Russian garrison had to surrender. In 1656, Russia unsuccessfully tried to retake the village. Koporye remained Swedish until 1703, known as Koporje or Caporie/Capurien, constituting an important part of Swedish Ingria. As the Gulf of Finland grew shallow and receded to the north, the site began to lose its maritime importance. In 1703, during the Great Northern War, a major Russian army under Boris Sheremetev regained Koporye, which was defended by 80 Swedish soldiers under the commandant, Captain Wasili Apolloff. Huge gaps in the walls from the disastrous fire of the Russian artillery may still be seen. Despite some repairs undertaken in the 19th century, the fortress survives in a ruined state. Today, it is a museum.

It is the sequel to 2001's Black & White. A Mac OS X port was released in January 2009, and released for download via the Mac App Store in November 2014.https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/black- white-2/id437519881?ls=1&mt;=12 The game blends real-time strategy and god game elements. Gameplay The player takes the role of a god called from the void (nothingness) to help the villagers who invoked them. The player must help develop their nature according to their good or evil desires. The player is physically represented in the world as an avatar-like creature, which takes the form of a giant anthropomorphic ape, lion, wolf, turtle, cow, or tiger. The creature can grow to an immense size, and adopt a good or evil persona. They develop their character as the player rewards or punishes their actions. In addition to the god simulation and city-building elements introduced in the original Black & White, Black & White 2 also features elements of real-time strategy gameplay, with the addition of controllable warfare and fighting units. Black & White 2 features a more conventional heads-up display (HUD) system than its predecessor. Rather than the experimental HUD-less gameplay seen in the original game, Black & White 2 features HUD notifications that inform players of their creature's state of mind, the effects of their actions on their creature, the status of villages, etc. The user interface is almost button-less. The player sees little else on the screen but the world, the player's hand, and toolbars which the player can make disappear. The only way the player can directly interact with this world is through the player's hand, which can be used to pick up people, trees, food, and influence the ground. The player can also cast miracles for a certain amount of \\"Prayer Power\\" (in essence, \\"Mana\\"), which comes from the player's believers. Two creatures battling in the Greek city. To do things such as cast miracles, the player moves the hand in such a way to make a symbol on the ground, referred to as a gesture. This activates the miracle, and if the player has enough Prayer Power, it appears in the player's hand ready to cast. Miracles have a variety of different uses. There are six ordinary miracles: fire, lightning, water, shield, heal, and meteor, (each of which can be thrown or poured), and four epic wonders: siren, hurricane, earthquake, and volcano. Black & White 2 can be played in three ways: Good, Evil, or combination of the two. Evil involves the use of fear, torture, conquest and destruction using armies along with the creation of building such as a pit of torture. Good involves benevolence, more positive city building, and looking after the populace, particularly defending it from attacks. Both of these require ore and wood, of which there is a limited amount. The player's tribe is the Greeks. Other tribes include Egypt, Norse, Aztec, and Japanese. As in Black & White, players can create disciples to do the player's job in certain areas of the game while the player tends to other business. For example, if the player needs to lead an invasion, they can set villagers, and even their creature to farm for them while they lead an invasion. =Creatures= The player can choose between several creatures, including the ape, lion, wolf, cow and tiger, although the tiger is not available in the base game. The player's creature can do most things the player can do, such as cast miracles. Since the player trains the creature, their personality can become whatever the player makes of it. Each tribe, like the player, owns creatures at some stage. As the game progresses, the enemies' creatures increase in strength and size. Unlike Black & White, in which the creature had to be taught miracles through repetition, Black & White 2 allows the player to 'buy' creature miracles with 'Tribute' currency. Along with this, Black & White 2 allows the player to revisit everything they've taught their creature in order to alter and fine-tune it at any time, while the original Black & White only allowed changes to be made as the creature repeated an action. Plot The player comes upon a scene of a Greek city being devastated by a huge Aztec army after being summoned from a \\"pure prayer\\". After the player saves a certain number of people, their people are transported to a new land with a handful of refugee worshipers, the player must re-establish a power base from which to eventually defeat the Aztec empire. To do so, the player must conquer the Norse, the Japanese and the Aztecs, either by peace or war. Throughout the game there is a theme of \\"The prophecy\\", which states that a tribe will be destroyed by the mightiest power in the world but will receive a god who will lead them to glory and dominance of the world. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Black & White 2 received a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Expansion pack An expansion pack, Black & White 2: Battle of the Gods, was released in April 2006. It includes a new creature, new lands, miracles, enemies, challenges and the tiger from the Black & White 2 Special Edition. The premise involves the player's return to Eden, where they discover that the Aztecs have raised their own evil deity which must be confronted head-on for control of the land. The player may choose how they will challenge this new god, either by countering the evil deity's actions with good deeds, or attempting to defeat through evil actions.

It is made from a mixture of copper pot still spirits produced at the company's Woodford Reserve Distillery, and column still spirits from the Brown Forman Distillery in Shively, Kentucky.http://www.drinkspirits.com/bourbon/scenes-woodford-reserve/ Retrieved December 24, 2014 Each 45.2% alcohol by volume (90.4 US Proof) bottle bears a unique batch and bottle number. The brand was introduced in 1996. History The Woodford Reserve Distillery, formerly known as the Old Oscar Pepper Distillery and later the Labrot & Graham Distillery, is approximately eight miles from the town of Versailles in north-central Kentucky, off U.S. Route 60 between Interstate 64 and Versailles. Distilling began on the site of the current day distillery in 1812. Although the site has not been continuously operational as a distillery since, the main structure, built in 1838, stands as one of the oldest distilleries in Kentucky. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is designated as a National Historic Landmark for its well-preserved distillery architecture and its role in the development of the bourbon industry. Originally established by Elijah Pepper, the distillery was passed on to his son and known as the Oscar Pepper Distillery when Dr. James Crow worked there in the mid-19th century. During this time Dr. Crow undertook a series of activities that improved and codified the understanding and quality of key bourbon-making processes such as sour-mash fermentation, pot still distillation and barrel maturation. After Oscar Pepper died in 1867 the distillery was passed to his son James E. Pepper. The Pepper family sold the property to Leopold Labrot and James Graham in 1878, who owned and operated it (except during Prohibition) until it was sold to the Brown-Forman Corporation in 1941. Brown-Forman operated it until the late 1960s, then sold the property and its accompanying acreage to a local farmer. Brown-Forman re-purchased the property in 1993, refurbished it, and brought it back into operation. The Woodford Reserve brand was introduced to the market in 1996. The distillery produces: Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve Straight Rye Whiskey, Woodford Reserve Straight Malt Whiskey, and Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey. It also distills some limited edition releases, including Woodford Reserve Master's Collection, Woodford Reserve Master's Collection Batch Proof, a Kentucky-only Distillery Series, and a special commemorative bottle it releases annually in conjunction with its official sponsorship of the Kentucky Derby. Reviews and accolades International Spirit ratings organizations and liquor review bodies have generally given Woodford Reserve solid scores. At the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Woodford Reserve's best performances have been in 2005 and 2013, winning a double gold medal each time. It has also won gold (2006‚Äì2007, 2011‚Äì2012) and silver (2008, 2010) medals at this annual event. The Beverage Testing Institute has given the Reserve scores of between 90 and 91 and Wine Enthusiast awarded it a 90‚Äì95 point rating. Spirits ratings aggregator proof66.com, which averages scores from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Wine Enthusiast, the Beverage Testing Institute, and others, ranks Woodford Reserve in its highest (\\"Tier 1\\") scoring category. Marketing activities The still room, where copper stills are used to produce spirits from the mash. The Woodford Reserve Distillery offers tours and is part of the American Whiskey Trail and the Kentucky Bourbon Trail promotional programs. In a contract arrangement with Churchill Downs, Woodford Reserve has been declared the \\"official bourbon of the Kentucky Derby\\" and is used in a $1,000 mint julep cocktail that is sold to patrons on Derby Day. (Although Woodford Reserve is the Derby's \\"official bourbon\\", its sister brand Old Forester serves mint juleps as the \\"official drink\\" and is featured in the more moderately priced juleps served at the event.) Woodford Reserve's parent company Brown-Forman has entered into a 5-year deal with Churchill Downs to become the title sponsor of the Kentucky Derby after Yum! Brands pulled their sponsorship.

He chose the name \\"Humus\\" based on the earthy, humus-like sound caused by sound degradation caused by the reduction mixing. During the late 1980s and early 1990s Beltran released five cassettes,http://loudriffsmex.blogspot.mx/2012/12/humus.html causing interest in the underground quarters of Mexico City, where there had been a long history of progressive rock. Jose Luis Garnica, a long time friend of Jorge's and a rock connoisseur, was very much impressed by the quality of sound of these recordings, but mostly by Beltran's musicianship, so he became producer of Humus's first LP, Tus Oidos mienten in June 1992.http://loudriffsmex.blogspot.mx/2012/12/humus.html The album finally gave recording status to Humus, and soon international reviews from the U.S., Germany, France, and in particular from Italy began to emerge, praising the new band from Mexico. =Second Album and Lineup Change= From the second album, called simply Humus (released Dec. 1994), the one man band concept changed to a live performing band, which included old time school friend and bass player Victor Basurto, with whom he had formed their first band, Stomago Sagrado in the late 1970s. Victor had designed the cover for Tus Oidos Mienten, and has been in charge for the art of all recordings both musicians have been involved with ever since. Several local tours took place, and the drum stool was occupied by no less than 8 drummers during the 1990s and well nigh into the 21st century. =Third and Fourth Albums and Side Project= A third album, Malleus Crease was released in 1995. This album, along with brother Project Frolic Froth's album Ouroboros were also released in Italy by the D-dabliu label in LP format.http://www.green-brain- krautrock.de/index.php?page=sql_detail&id;=7151 Humus 4 degrees, released in 1997, is the band's only album to exist only in CD format, all others were both CD and LP productions. This album was released through Smogless Records and newly formed Nuggetphase productions, and from there all albums produced by either of the bands led by Jorge and Victor have been released in the Nuggetphase label. Also in 1997 Humus found themselves in an international tour of England and Italy . In Exeter They recorded an album with American Dave Tor who became singer for the only vocal album ever made by either Jorge or Victor, and for this project a new name was devised: Euphoric Darkness, since it detached completely from the instrumental approach always favoured by Humus. The resulting album was named Colours You Can Hear and only 100 copies were made. =Fifth Album - Present Day= In Pesaro they recorded Humus's fifth album, Whispering Galleries, under the production of Italy's doom metal legend Paul Chain, who also contributed to the album. Three hundred numbered copies were made. Since 1998 Humus has recorded no less than five albums, though none has been released as of 2014.http://cultura.nexos.com.mx/?p=5107 The band continues to be active,http://loudriffsmex.blogspot.mx/2012/12/humus.html though members live in different continents: Jorge Beltran lives in Mexico and Victor Basurto lives in The Netherlands. The manage to continue playing together through the use of the new communication technologies. Because of their limited press runs, Humus albums have been rare, and some of them reach up to US$250 in international distributor listings. However, late in 2006 Smogless Records put out new CD editions of the first three Humus albums, Tus Oidos Mienten, Humus, and Malleus Crease.

Following that Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople established the Halych metropoly with a see in Halych, Halych-Volhynia. Maximos is known for his ecclesiastic trips to the Golden Horde and mediation between the quarreling princes of the Northeastern Russia (e.g., Dmitry of Pereslavl and Andrey of Gorodets, sons of Alexander Nevsky). In 1301, Maximos attended a patriarchal council in Constantinople. He supported the Prince of Tver and Vladimir Mikhail Yaroslavich in his struggle with Prince of Moscow Yuri Danilovich for the title of Grand Duke. He was canonised a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church, and his feast day is celebrated on December 6 (December 19, N.S.).

Haacke is considered a \\"leading exponent\\" of Institutional Critique. Early life Haacke was born in Cologne, Germany. He studied at the Staatliche Werkakademie in Kassel, Germany, from 1956 to 1960. In 1959 Haacke was hired to assist with the second documenta, working as a guard and tour guide.Haacke, H. (2016) Working Conditions. MIT Press. p. 223. He was a student of Stanley William Hayter, a well-known and influential English printmaker, draftsman, and painter. From 1961 to 1962 he studied on a Fulbright grant at the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in Philadelphia. From 1967 to 2002 Haacke was a professor at the Cooper Union in New York City. Condensation Cube, (1963-1965); Plexiglas and water; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden During his formative years in Germany, he was a member of Zero (an international group of artists, active ca. 1957-1966).Haacke, Hans. Framing and Being Framed. Halifax: Press of Nova scotia College of Art and Design, 1975. This group was held together with common motivations: the longing to re-harmonize man and nature and to restore art's metaphysical dimension. They sought to organize the pictorial surface without using traditional devices. Although their methods differed greatly, most of the work was monochromatic, geometric, kinetic, and gestural. But most of all they used nontraditional materials such as industrial materials, fire and water, light, and kinetic effects. The influence of the Zero group and the materials they used is clear in Haacke's early work from his paintings that allude to movement and expression to his early installations that are formally minimal and use earthly elements as materials. These early installations focused on systems and processes. Condensation Cube (1963‚Äì65) embodies a physical occurrence, of the condensation cycle, in real time. Some of the themes in these works from the 1960s include the interactions of physical and biological systems, living animals, plants, and the states of water and the wind. He also made forays into land art, but by the end of the 1960s his art had found a more specific focus. Systems work (1970‚Äìpresent) Haacke's interest in real-time systems propelled him into his criticism of social and political systems.Tate Collection.\\"Hans Haacke\\" Accessed October 14, 2010. In most of his work after the late 1960s, Haacke focused on the art world and the system of exchange between museums and corporations and corporate leaders; he often underlines its effects in site-specific ways. Haacke has been outspoken throughout his career about demystifying the relationship between museums and businesses and their individual practices. He writes, \\"what we have here is a real exchange of capital: financial capital on the part of the sponsors and symbolic capital on the part of the sponsored\\".Bourdieu, P. and H. Haacke. Free Exchange. Stanford: Stanford Univ Press, 1995. pg17. Using this concept from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Haacke has underlined the idea that corporate sponsorship of art enhances the sponsoring corporations' public reputation, which is of material use to them. Haacke believes, moreover, that both parties are aware of this exchange, and as an artist, Haacke is intent on making this relationship clear to viewers. In 1970 Hans Haacke proposed a work for the exhibition entitled Information to be held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (an exhibition meant to be an overview of current younger artists), according to which the visitors would be asked to vote on a current socio-political issue. The proposal was accepted, and Haacke prepared his installation, entitled MoMA Poll, but did not hand in the specific question until right before the opening of the show. His query asked, \\"Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon's Indochina Policy be a reason for your not voting for him in November?\\" Visitors were asked to deposit their answers in the appropriate one of two transparent Plexiglas ballot boxes. At the end of the exhibition, there were approximately twice as many Yes ballots as No ballots. Haacke's question commented directly on the involvements of a major donor and board member at MOMA, Nelson Rockefeller. This installation is an early example of what in the art world came to be known as institutional critique. In one of his best-known works, which quickly became an art historical landmark, Shapolsky et al. Manhattan Real Estate Holdings, A Real Time Social System, as of May 1, 1971, Haacke took on the real-estate holdings of one of New York City's biggest slum landlords. The work exposed, through meticulous documentation and photographs, the questionable transactions of Harry Shapolsky's real-estate business between 1951 and 1971. Haacke's solo show at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which was to include this work and which made an issue of the business and personal connections of the museum's trustees, was cancelled on the grounds of artistic impropriety by the museum's director six weeks before the opening. (Shapolsky was not such a trustee, although some have misunderstood the affair by assuming that he was.) Curator Edward Fry was consequently fired for his support of the work.Arthur C. Danto. \\"Art-Hans Haacke:Unfinished Business.\\" The Nation, February 14, 1987.Lawrence Alloway. \\"Art.\\" The Nation, August 2, 1971. Following the abrupt cancellation of his exhibition and the trouble it had caused with the museum, Haacke turned to other galleries, to Europe and his native country, where his work was more often accepted. Ten years later he included the Shapolsky work‚Äîby then widely known‚Äîat his solo exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, entitled \\"Hans Haacke: Unfinished Business\\".Michael Brenson. \\"Art: In political Tone, Works by Hans Haacke.\\" The New York Times, December 19, 1986. At the John Weber gallery in New York, in 1972, on two separate occasions, Haacke created a sociological study, collecting data from gallery visitors. He requested the visitors fill out a questionnaire with 20 questions ranging from their personal demographic background information to opinions on social and political issues. The results of the questionnaires were translated into pie charts and bar graphs that were presented in the gallery at a later date. They revealed, among other things, that most visitors were related in some way to the professions of art, art teaching, and museology, and most were politically liberal. In 1974, Haacke submitted another proposal that was subsequently rejected for an exhibition at the Wallraf‚ÄìRichartz Museum in Cologne. The work described a well-documented history of the ownership (with individual biographies of each of the owners) of Manet's painting Bunch of Asparagus in the museum's collection, narrating how it came into the collection, and in which the Third Reich activities of its donor were revealed. Instead, the work was exhibited in the Paul Menz Gallery in Cologne with a color reproduction in place of the original. In 1975, Haacke created a similar piece to the Manet project at the John Weber gallery in New York, exposing the history of ownership of Seurat's Models (Les Poseuses) (small version). In the same manner as the previous installation, this work showed the increase of the value of the work as it passed from one patron to another. Also In 1975, he created one of his most memorable installations, entitled On Social Grease. The work, which takes its title from a speech by a corporate head of one of the world's major oil companies, is made up of carefully factured plaques exhibiting quotes from business executives and important art world figures. These plaques display their opinions on the system of exchange between museums and businesses, speaking directly to the importance of the arts in business practices. In 1978 Haacke had a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, England, that included the new work A Breed Apart, which made explicit criticism of the state-owned British Leyland for exporting vehicles for police and military use to apartheid South Africa. His 1979 solo exhibition at Chicago's Renaissance Society featured paintings that reproduced and altered print ads for Mobil, Allied Chemical, and Tiffany & Co. =1980s= With extensive research Haacke continued throughout the 1980s to target corporations and museums in his work through larger scale installations and paintings. In 1982, at the documenta 7 exhibition, Haacke exhibited a very large work that included oil portraits of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in 19th-century style, facing on the opposite wall a gigantic photograph of the demonstration against nuclear arms held earlier that year‚Äîthe largest demonstration in Germany since the end of the Second World War. The clear implication, supported by Haacke's remarks, was that these two figures were attempting to roll back their respective nations to the socially and politically regressive, laissez-faire, and imperialist policies of the 19th century. In 1988 he was given an exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London at which he exhibited the portrait of Margaret Thatcher, full of iconographic references featuring cameos of Maurice and Charles Saatchi.C4 Contemporary Art. \\"Profile: Hans Haacke\\" Accessed October 14, 2010. The Saatchis were well known not only as art collectors on an aggressive scale, widely affecting the course of the art world by their choices, but also as the managers of Thatcher's successful, fear-based political campaigns as well as that of the South African premier, P. W. Botha. =1990s= Haacke's controversial 1990 painting Cowboy with Cigarette turned Picasso's Man with a Hat (1912‚Äì13) into a cigarette advertisement. The work was a reaction to the Phillip Morris company's sponsorship of a 1989‚Äì90 exhibition about Cubism at the Museum of Modern Art. Haacke has had solo exhibitions since, at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris. In 1993 Haacke shared, with Nam June Paik, the Golden Lion for the German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Haacke's installation Germania made explicit reference to the pavilion's roots in the politics of Nazi Germany. Haacke tore up the floor of the German pavilion as Hitler once had done. In 1993, looking through the doors of the pavilion, past the broken floor, the viewer witnesses the word on the wall: \\"Germania\\", Hitler's name for Nazi Berlin.The Village Voice. \\"The Art Libel\\" Online article by Richard Goldstein.

In 2014, it was announced that Haacke would be installing one of his works as part of the annual Fourth Plinth commission in 2015. His winning commission of a bronze sculpture of a horse‚Äôs skeleton, titled Gift Horse, comes with an electronic ribbon tied to its front leg that displays a live ticker of prices on the London Stock Exchange.Laurie Rojas (February 7, 2014), Hans Haacke and David Shrigley win Fourth Plinth commissions The Art Newspaper =Use of Law= Along with Adrian Piper and Michael Asher, Haacke uses a version of Seth Siegelaub and Robert Projansky's 1971 artist contract, The Artists Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement, in order to control the dissemination, display and ownership of his art works. Writing and publications On being considered a political artist Haacke says: \\"it is uncomfortable for me to be a politicized artist.... the work of an artist with such a label is in danger of being understood one dimensionally without exception.... all artwork have a political component whether its intended or not\\".ARTFORUM. \\"Germany Downsizes Culture; Hans Haacke Talks Politics ; More\\" Accessed October 14, 2010. Jack Burnham comments on Haacke's political growth and links its roots to exposure to a time of political unrest in the US surrounding the Vietnam War. Burnham also points to Haacke's joining the Arts Workers Coalition and the boycott of the S√£o Paulo Bienal in Brazil in 1969 as catalyst for the artist's work to take a political direction. Writing by Haacke and his close friends and colleagues, including documentation of his work, are collected in two separate books by the artist. Hans Haacke first published a book about the ideas and processes behind his and other conceptual art called Framing and Being Framed. Published in 1995, Free Exchange, is a transcription of a conversation between Haacke and Pierre Bourdieu. The two men met in the 1980s and, as Bourdieu states in the introduction, \\"very quickly discovered how much they have in common\\".

Demography According to the 2002 census by the National Statistics Institute (INE), it had a population of 2,392 inhabitants (1,518 men and 874 women), giving it a population density of . Of these, 1,952 (81.6%) lived in urban areas and 440 (18.4%) in rural areas. The province is the largest in Chile, yet it is also the least and most sparsely populated province in the country.

Territory recognition  Antarctica claim by Chile, as seen on a monument in Punta Arenas The South American portion of the territory is internationally recognized as part of Chile; however, the Commune of Ant√°rtica, which encompasses most of the area of the province, is disputed. It forms the Chilean claim to Antarctica, stretching south of the 60th parallel to the South Pole. The Commune of Ant√°rtica is practically uninhabited except for research stations of various countries, although Chile maintains a permanent civilian population at Villa Las Estrellas (near Frei Montalva Station), including women and children, a small school, and even a bank, in order to support its territorial claim of the area. The official population for the area as of the census 2002 is 130 (115 male, 15 female). This does not include the staff of non-Chilean bases in the area.The South Pole: Eduardo Frei Montalva Station (Chile) Chilean Antarctic Territory map in Spanish, Chilean names.

The Tordesillas Line established a west/east division of colonial territories between Portugal and Spain.The Treaty of Tordesillas - Geography On the first organization of the new conquered territories, Charles V, ruler of the Spanish Empire assigned to Pedro Sancho de la Hoz control over Terra Australis, which included the Southern part of South America, Tierra del Fuego Archipelago, and all southern undiscovered territories (Terra Australis Ignota). This gobernation eventually merged with other territories in the Captaincy General of the Kingdom of Chile. Prehistory Early settlement by prehistoric man is known to have occurred from archaeological recovery within this Province. Yaghans established many settlements on the islands of the present day province of the Ant√°rtica espana Province; for example, there is a significant early Yaghan archaeological site at Wulaia Bay, which C. Michael Hogan terms the Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham History Puerto Williams and Porvenir were established in the late 19th century, mainly by Western European immigrants (esp. from British Isles, Scandinavia and the former Yugoslavia) and navigators in cruise ships and fish boats. The Chilean government transplanted Chilean settlers from the central part of the country in the 20th century to increase the province's sparse population.

It lies east of the north end of City Island between City Island Harbor and Pelham Bay in Long Island Sound. It is connected to City Island by a sandbar that emerges at very low tide, as well as by a small private bridge. Previously used as a stone quarry and then a summer resort, the island today is used to support two radio station transmitters and antennas. History High Island was once known as Shark Island due to the many sand sharks which used to swim in the nearby waters of Pelham Bay. The island is comparatively high with a shape similar to a gumdrop, thus alluding to the origin of its present-day name. Elisha King purchased the island in 1829 to quarry stones. During the 1920s the Miller family operated a community of summer rental cottages catering to about 40 families. In 1961, it was purchased to use for radio transmission towers. Current use , the entire island and two transmitters are owned by Entercom. It houses the transmitters and antenna towers for WCBS (880 AM) and WFAN (660 AM; previously known as WNBC), both of which are owned by Entercom. Previously, the WCBS facility was located on nearby Columbia Island in Westchester County, New York. On August 27, 1967, a small private airplane crashed into the radio tower, destroying the antenna and taking WCBS and WNBC off the air, the day before WCBS's all news format launched. https://www.fybush.com/site-030424.html Both stations were able to borrow nearby transmission facilities for about a week, until an emergency tower could be erected on High Island. The permanent replacement was built with a second (shorter) tower as an emergency backup. The taller of the towers is . The shorter tower is and was built in 2001 to replace the emergency tower erected in 1967. The proximity of these two AM radio stations has, at times, caused interference on telephones and electronic equipment on nearby City Island. High Island is only an AM radio transmission facility. It does not have any studios or tower tenants, other than the two AM radio stations. Both WCBS-AM and WFAN-AM broadcast from studios located at the Hudson Square Broadcast Center in Manhattan. The island is currently uninhabited. A full- time caretaker's residence was in use from 1961 to 2007. The island is currently maintained by the radio stations' engineers and contractors. Advances in broadcast and security technology have made remote monitoring of both the radio equipment and the physical property more feasible than in earlier years where a full-time human presence was required.

John Thomson's 1832 map also shows the upper reaches named \\"Shaws Burn\\", with the lower reaches named \\"Ardgowan or Kipp Water\\" (note the double 'p').NLS Thomson 1832 map It is not clear when the name \\"Kip Water\\" was formally adopted for the entire length of the river. =Present Course= The present source of the river is Compensation Reservoir at Cornalees Bridge from where it drops steeply down Shielhill Glen to Millhouse, where it passes under the so-called 'Roman Bridge'. At this point the river enters Dunrod Glen where it runs around three sides of Idzholm Hill, here it is joined by the Spango Burn before entering the Kip Valley. The final stretch of the river from Bankfoot Farm to the Clyde is fairly flat and has been altered over the years by the addition of several small weirs.OS 25\\" map (1913) =Past Industry= The Aislie and Thomson maps referenced above show mills, including a waulkmill, at what is now Ardgowan Policies. Little or no trace of these mills survives today. It is also likely that there was a mill further upstream at Millhouse, based on the name of the house. Three sandstone quarries were active at the top of Shielhill Glen in the late 19thC. These were served by a railway line which left the main line at Dunrod Farm. The line of the railway can still be clearly seen along most of the route.RMWeb Dunrod Quarry Branch =Present Industry= Other than the workshops at Kip Marina, there is no industry on the river at the time of writing in May 2018. =Future Industry= Plans have been approved for the construction of a distillery at Bankfoot Farm by Ardgowan Distillery.Inverclyde Council Planning Application Summary The planned distillery will take water from the river for process and cooling purposes. It will also take water from some adjacent springs.Ardgowan Distillery web site At the time of writing (May 2018) no opening date for the distillery has been confirmed.  Bridges  There are several extant bridges across the river, the highest upstream being Cornalees Bridge which crosses the waterfall as the river exits Compensation Reservoir. This is a late 20thC concrete and steel construction which carries a minor road over the river. A few hundred metres downstream is a wooden footbridge which is part of the Cornalees nature trail. There are traces of a bridge at the site of the disused sandstone quarries near the top of Shielhill Glen. Slightly downstream from this, the sandstone abutments and piers of a three span former railway bridge can be seen at Majeston Farm . This carried a short lived mineral line from Dunrod to the sandstone quarries in the late 19thC.RMWeb Dunrod Quarry Branch A wooden farm bridge also crosses the river at this point. Millhouse Road crosses the river on a stone arched bridge, from which can be seen the impressive single span of the 'Roman Bridge' in the private grounds of Millhouse. Just downstream from Millhouse is a sandstone and steel railway viaduct which carries the existing Glasgow to Wemyss Bay line. Parallel to this viaduct can be seen the piers of a second viaduct which was removed in the late 1960s. A steel and timber bridge crosses at Bankfoot Farm. The remains of a further small bridge can be seen between Bankfoot and Bridgend. At Bridgend, there are two parallel bridges, one of which is disused, having been replaced when the A78 road was realigned in the early 1970s. Between this bridge and Kip Marina there is a dilapidated farm track bridge leading from Ardgowan Policies to Swallow Brae plantation. At Kip Marina there are two more parallel bridges, one of which is now a footpath only and which served Ardgowan House. This was replaced by a new concrete bridge in 2006 when Kip Marina Village was constructed. The final bridge is the pontoon bridge within Kip Marina.

Founded in 1866, it operates as a government agency and is tasked with preserving Swedish historical items as well as making knowledge about history available to the public. The origin of the museum is the collections of art and historical objects gathered by Swedish monarchs since the 16th century. It has a number of permanent exhibitions and annually hosts special exhibitions tied to current events.  Function  The History Museum is part of a central museum agency called the Statens historiska museer (SHMM) (\\"National Historical Museums\\"). Other institutions under the aegis of this agency are the Royal Coin Cabinet, the Tumba Papermill Museum and the Swedish Archaeology Commission (Arkeologiska uppdragsverksamheten or Arkeologerna). The museum is also one of five so called ansvarsmuseum (\\"museums with responsibilities\\") in Sweden. It is tasked with coordinating activities between museums, assist other museums and develop contacts between museums and other parts of the Swedish community.  History  The foundation for what was to become the History Museum and the Nationalmuseum, was King Gustav Vasa's 16th century art collection at Gripsholm Castle. The collection grew through acquisitions, gifts and spoils of war during the time of the Swedish Empire. Some of the collections were lost during the fire in the Tre Kronor castle. During the later part of the 18th century, art and antiquities were bought by ambassadors and members of the royal family and collected at Stockholm Palace. After the death of King Gustaf III in 1792, the collections were turned over to the Swedish government. That same year the Royal Museum (Kongl. Museum) opened in the palace. It was one of the first public museums in the world. In 1846‚Äì47, the museum moved from the palace to the Ridderstolpe House at Skeppsbron where it resided until 1865 and the move to Nationalmuseum. Swedish archaeologist Stig Welinder argues that the History Museum was in fact founded with its establishment in the Ridderstolpe House in 1847. The present-day museum was founded in 1866 by Bror Emil Hildebrand, who had been director of its predecessor both at Stockholm Palace and Ridderstolpe House. The collections of the museum were exhibited on the ground floor of the recently built Nationalmuseum. The premises soon became too small for both museums. When plans for the new Nordic Museum building were made in 1876, it was suggested that the building should also include the History Museum's collections. The debate about housing for the History Museum continued for decades until Sigurd Curman became Custodian of Ancient Monuments (riksantikvarie) and head of the Swedish National Heritage Board on 3July 1923. He moved the issue forward to a more concrete and permanent solution. The main objective for a new and sufficiently large building for the museum was to bring order to the collections, commonly called \\"The Chaos\\" while the unpublished research papers were referred to as \\"the corf\\". In 1929, the Swedish government suggested that the former military barracks and stables at Storgatan in the city block known as the Krubban (\\"the crib\\"), could be allocated to the museum. An architectural competition was held in 1930, for the proposed conversion of the block into suitable accommodation for the museum. No winner was declared, instead it was elements from the runner-up suggestion, made by architects Bengt Romare and George Scherman with engineer G√∂sta Nilsson, that became the starting point for the remodeling of the area. They developed the design for the new museum in cooperation with Curman, the National Property Board and the National Heritage Board.  Architecture  The Eastern Stable In 1932, the Swedish government granted funds for construction of official buildings to create jobs during the depression. Some of these were used to build the museum in 1934‚Äì39. The plans for the museum were not finalized until 1936. = Exterior = The main building, designed by Romare and Scherman 1935‚Äì1940, reflects an ambivalence between the predominant modern style of the era and the historical context given not only by the context requirements, but also the 19th century barracks and stables south of the museum designed by Fredrik Blom and built in stages in 1805‚Äì1818, starting one year after the land had been appropriated by the government. The barracks are neoclassicist in style and the repetitive fa√ßades used to be exposed to Ladug√•rdslandsviken that was part of Stockholm's main harbor up until the 19th century, while the main building forms a compact block taking a step backwards from the street to leave space for a forecourt. The museum consists of four two- and three-story block-like buildings surrounding an inner courtyard, giving it the appearance of a fortress. The fa√ßade is austere and decorated with sculptures made by Bror Marklund (added in 1959) and reliefs by artist Robert Nilsson. In the courtyard by a pool is a sculpture called N√§cken (The Neck) by Carl Frisendahl.  The bronze doors  Sculptures and doors by Bror Marklund Most of the decorations of the museum were selected through a series of competitions. In 1938, Marklund won the competition for creating the main entrance to the museum. The doors, called The Gates of History (Historiens Portar), took him thirteen years to make. They were finished and inaugurated in 1952. The doors were financed by philanthropist Eva Bonnier's foundation. The doors are high and weighs about each. Made of bronze, they were first cast at the Herman Bergman foundry and then chased by Marklund. Through a series of ten fields, the doors depict the history of Sweden from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages. The left door represents the Pagan era with Odin as a central figure, while the right door depicts Ansgar and the Christian era. A noted deviation from the historical theme, is the depiction of a standard, 1950s pilsner bottle on the far right side of the right-hand door. A common item with the workers who cast the doors and built the museum. The bottle was chased by Marklund and it is the only part of the bronze surface that has been polished to a shine by people touching it.  Interior  Golden necklace from F√§rjestaden, one of the objects in the Gold Room The interior of the museum is spacious with room for both permanent and special exhibitions. The permanent displays are arranged in chronological order in rooms facing the inner courtyard, with the pre-Christian collections on the ground floor and the collections from around 800 onwards upstairs. The halls are constantly updated with adaption to new technology and to accommodate new exhibitions. The entrance hall was refurbished in 1994 to give a modern impression of a Medieval knight's hall. The floor was laid with stone and the exposed beams in the ceiling were made of concrete. = The Gold Room = Blasted into the bedrock beneath the central courtyard is the concrete vault known as the Gold Room, where a large number of gold and silver objects are on display. It was built in 1994 and paid for by a donation from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. Designed by architect Leif Blomberg, it resembles a mystic cult place with a representation of M√≠mir's Well in the middle of the exhibition room. The floor and pillars in the room are made of limestone and diabase, and the d√©cor is made from wrought iron. It is accessed through an underground passage from the entrance hall. The room contains about 3000 objects made from a total of gold and more than silver. It was only with the heightened security the vault provided, that most of the gold objects could be on display for the general public.  Collections  Part of the Skog tapestry When Curman originally designed how the collections were to be displayed, he borrowed ideas from contemporary exhibitions, industrial fairs and storefronts. The idea was to entice and educate visitors, something that was met with skepticism from scholars who regarded the museum mainly as a scientific institution. It is one of the largest museums in Sweden with more than 10 million artefacts, registered under around 34,000 inventory numbers, and one of the largest collections of antiquities in Europe. About 6,200 of the objects are on display. In 2011, information about 480,000 of the objects in the museum were accessible through an online database. 65,000 of these entries were illustrated with drawings or photos. The database also contained information about 55,900 places in Sweden where archaeological finds had been made and approximately 267,300 bone finds (total weight about ). The database is constantly expanded and updated. The Vikings collection comprise objects from around 800‚Äì1050, including weapons, the M√§stermyr chest, archaeological finds from the Viking Age trading centre, Birka, a UNESCO World Heritage Site on Bj√∂rk√∂, religious items from the era, foreign objects brought home from travels and raids in other parts of the world as well as thousands of finds related to the everyday life during that period. The most noted objects in the Gold Room collection are the collars dating from around 350‚Äì500, made of gold from Roman coins. The room also contains Viking silver jewelry, bejeweled reliquaries from the Middle Ages, coins, ceremonial swords and spoils of war. The large number of preserved objects made from precious metals, is due to a law that was issued in the 17th century, stating that all such finds that were 100 years or older and with no owner, were to be redeemed by the government and sent to the History museum. The law is still in effect. The museum's collection of Swedish ecclesiastical art is extensive, and its origins span from the 12th century to the post-Reformation period. It contains objects such as wooden sculptures, altarpieces and crucifixes. Among these are the Reliquary of St. Elizabeth and the Viklau Madonna, one of the most well- preserved wooden sculptures from 12th-century Europe. Textile works from the Middle Ages are kept in the Textile Chamber. The objects are mostly textiles used in churches or by priests and bishops. The oldest and most noted object is a 13th-century tapestry from Skog Church, the Skog tapestry. It was found in 1912, wrapped around a bridal crown. Another tapestry is the Gr√∂dinge tapestry.  Exhibitions  The first comprehensive exhibition in the museum opened on 17April 1943. It was called Ten thousand years in Sweden and comprised exhibitions from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages. The museum has since altered and remade the permanent exhibitions a number of times as well as hosted several new special exhibitions on an annual basis. These are often related to some topic that is currently under debate or otherwise current. Some of the special exhibitions were: *Luxury products and unique portraits, 1997, exports from the Roman Empire to Scandinavia. *Snow White and The Madness of Truth, 2004, an art installation that lead to an international controversy. *Save History!, 2009, on how global warming and pollution destroys the cultural heritage. *Boundless ‚Äì a global voyage of discovery, 2011, about how different cultures have met and influenced each other throughout history. *Three centuries of friendship between Russia and the Netherlands, 2013, with objects on loan from museums, archives and libraries in Russia and the Netherlands. *Hidden stories, 2015, an exhibition interwoven in the permanent exhibitions with notes and stories highlighting sexuality and gender identity by providing an alternate view on history. In 2010, a new permanent exhibition called Sweden's History opened. It highlights personal items connected with milestones and turning points in Swedish history during the last 1000 years. In 2011, the museum created its first turnkey exhibition We call them Vikings in cooperation with Austrian MuseumsPartner and Studio Exhibit. The two-parts exhibition showcase other aspects of Viking life than that of stereotype barbarian raiders. , it has toured a number of venues in Europe and North America.

Plot The eponymous hero undergoes a journey of self-realization. The story centers upon Wilhelm's attempt to escape what he views as the empty life of a bourgeois businessman. After a failed romance with the theater, Wilhelm commits himself to the mysterious Tower Society. =First Book= Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship depicts the eighteenth- century German reception of William Shakespeare's dramas: the protagonist is introduced to these by the character Jarno, and extensive discussion of Shakespeare's work occurs within the novel's dialogues. Wilhelm and his theater group give a production of Hamlet, in which Wilhelm plays the lead role. Shakespeare's work had begun to be translated into German in the 1740s, and had attained tremendous popularity and influence in Germany by the end of the century. Origins Goethe's work on the novel began in the 1770s. An early version of the work, unpublished during Goethe's lifetime, was discovered in the early twentieth century, and published under the title Wilhelm Meister's Theatrical Calling (Wilhelm Meisters theatralische Sendung). When the Apprenticeship was completed in the mid-1790s, it was to a great extent through the encouragement and criticism of Goethe's close friend and collaborator Friedrich Schiller that it took its final shape. Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre (\\"Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years\\"), the sequel to the Apprenticeship, was already planned in the 1790s, but did not appear in its first edition until 1821, and in its final form until 1829. Genre Further books patterned after this novel have been called Bildungsroman (\\"novels of formation\\"), despite the fact that Wilhelm's \\"Bildung\\" (\\"education\\", or \\"formation of character\\") is ironized by the narrator at many points.See According to Andrew Crumey, \\"while Wilhelm Meister‚Äôs Apprenticeship is billed as the classic coming-of-age tale, or Bildungsroman, it‚Äôs really far more than that: a story of education and disillusionment, a novel of ideas ranging across literature, philosophy and politics, a masterpiece that resists all pigeonholing.\\" Legacy The novel has had a significant impact on European literature. Romantic critic and theorist Friedrich Schlegel judged it to be of comparable importance for its age to the French Revolution and the philosophy of Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Arthur Schopenhauer cited Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship as one of the four greatest novels ever written. Schopenhauer also mentions the book in his Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit. Arguing against chasing transient pleasures, Schopenhauer says, \\"Where we were looking for pleasure, happiness and joy, we often find instruction, insight and knowledge, a lasting and real benefit in place of a fleeting one. This idea runs like a bass-note through Goethe's Wilhelm Meister; for this is an intellectual novel and is of a higher order than the rest.\\" Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship provided the text for many lieder, among others by Beethoven, for example Sehnsucht: Gedicht von Goethe viermal in Musik gesetzt von L. van Beethoven, four settings of \\"Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt\\", WoO. 134 (1808), and by Schubert, for example , Ges√§nge aus Wilhelm Meister, Op. 62 (1826).\\"Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt\\" at LiederNet Archive Schubert set several excerpts more than once: Otto Erich Deutsch, with revisions by Werner Aderhold and others.

Lineage Full dress uniform from the 13th Battalion Volunteer Militia, 1862. The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry traces its lineage to the 13th Battalion. The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry originated in Hamilton, Ontario on 11 December 1862 as the 13th Battalion Volunteer Militia (Infantry), Canada. It was redesignated as the 13th Regiment on 8 May 1900; as the 13th \\"Royal Regiment\\" on 3 January 1910; and as the Royal Hamilton Regiment on 1 May 1920. It was organised as a four battalion regiment with the 1st Battalion (perpetuating the 13th Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), CEF) on the Non Permanent Active Militia order of battle, and the 2nd Battalion (perpetuating the 86th Battalion (Machine Gun), CEF), 3rd Battalion (perpetuating the 120th Battalion (City of Hamilton) CEF), and 4th Battalion (perpetuating the 205th Battalion (Hamilton), CEF)) on the Reserve order of battle. On 15 June 1926, the 1st Battalion was redesignated the 1st Battalion (perpetuating the 4th Battalion (Central Ontario), CEF). The reserve units were disbanded on 14 December 1936. The regiment was redesignated as the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry on 15 March 1927. On 15 December 1936, it amalgamated with the headquarters and three companies of the Wentworth Regiment and was redesignated as the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment). It was redesignated as the 2nd (Reserve) Battalion, the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) on 7 November 1940 and as the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) on 31 December 1945. On 4 May 1951, the regiment mobilised two temporary Active Force companies designated \\"E\\" and \\"F\\" Company. \\"E\\" Company was reduced to nil strength upon its personnel being incorporated into the 1st Canadian Rifle Battalion(later the 1st Battalion, the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada) for service in Germany with NATO. It was disbanded on 29 July 1953. \\"F\\" Company was initially used as a reinforcement pool for \\"E\\" Company. On 15 May 1952, it was reduced to nil strength, upon its personnel being absorbed by the newly formed 2nd Canadian Rifle Battalion (later the 2nd Battalion, the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada) for service with the United Nations in Korea. The Wentworth Regiment originated in Dundas, Ontario on 23 May 1872 as the 77th \\"Wentworth\\" Battalion of Infantry. It was redesignated as the 77th Wentworth Regiment on 8 May 1900; and as the Wentworth Regiment on 1 May 1920. On 15 December 1936, it was amalgamated with the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry.

The 4th Battalion (Central Ontario), CEF was authorised on 10 August 1914 and embarked for Britain on 3 October 1914. It disembarked in France on 12 February 1915, and fought as part of the 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division¬∏ in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 30 August 1920. The 86th Battalion (Machine Gun), CEF was authorised on 22 December 1915 and embarked for Britain on 19 May 1916 where it provided reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field until 22 June 1916, when it was reorganised in Britain as the 'Canadian Machine Gun Depot, CEF'.

The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 12 July 1918. =Second World War= The regiment mobilised the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, CASF for active service on 1 September 1939. It was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, CASF on 7 November 1940. It embarked for Britain on 22 July 1940. The battalion took part in Operation Jubilee on 19 August 1942. (General Denis Whitaker, who fought as a captain with the RHLI at Dieppe, in a 1989 interview stated, ‚ÄúThe defeat cleared out all the dead weight. It was the best thing that ever happed to the regiment.‚Äù) The RHLI returned to France on 5 July 1944 as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, and continued to fight in North-West Europe until the end of the war. The overseas battalion was subsequently disbanded on 31 December 1945. =Post-war= On 4 May 1951, the regiment mobilised two temporary Active Force companies designated \\"E\\" and \\"F\\" Company for service on NATO duty in Germany and United Nations duty in Korea respectively. \\"E\\" Company was reduced to nil strength upon its personnel being incorporated into the '1st Canadian Rifle Battalion'. \\"F\\" Company was initially used as a reinforcement pool for \\"E\\" Company until 15 May 1952 when it was reduced to nil strength, upon its personnel being absorbed by the newly formed '2nd Canadian Rifle Battalion'. =War in Afghanistan= The regiment contributed an aggregate of more than 20% of its authorised strength to the various Task Forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014. History The regiment has a long history which includes perpetuating the 2nd Regiment of York Militia from the War of 1812. Its formal lineage descends from the 13th Regiment, formed 11 December 1862, on a general order issued by the Governor General. It has earned thirty-nine battle honours in the two world wars. Most recently, members from the regiment have deployed to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). They suffered their greatest single day of losses at Dieppe, France on 19 August 1942.RhLI website The anniversary of Dieppe is recognised each year by the regiment. =History 1862‚Äì1913= The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry has a rich history in Hamilton and Wentworth County. The regiment has two direct antecedents, and indirect antecedents include the 1st and 2nd Companies of Volunteer Rifles (Hamilton), formed in 1855, and the Volunteer Highland Company (No. 3 Company) formed in 1856. The RHLI's earliest direct ancestor is the 13th Battalion of Volunteer Militia established in 1862, which along with the 2nd Battalion the Queen's Own Rifles are modern Canada's oldest fighting regiments, having first seen combat in June 1866 at the Battle of Ridgeway against an invading Irish American Fenian insurgent army composed of better armed and more experienced recent civil war veterans. The regimental cap badge still bears the supposedly unlucky number from its oldest official antecedent. When the 13th Battalion first saw action at the Battle of Ridgeway it took heavy casualties and was forced to fall back along with the Queen's Own Rifles. The 13th Battalion commanding officer Lt. Colonel Alfred Booker who was in command of the brigade deployed in the battle was blamed for the disaster.Peter Vronsky, Ridgeway: The American Fenian Invasion and the 1866 Battle That Made Canada, Toronto: Penguin Books, 2011. In 1870, another contingent from the battalion served in Manitoba during the Red River Rebellion. The regiment also traces ancestry to the 77th (Wentworth) Battalion of Volunteer Militia. Founded under that name in 1872, it was renamed the 77th Wentworth Regiment in 1900. Between 1899 and 1902, during the Boer War, many members of the 13th served in South Africa as members of the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment and the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles. Not asked to mobilise for the war, the 13th Battalion remained in Canada and was redesignated 13th Regiment in 1900 and 13th Royal Regiment in 1910. =History 1914‚Äì1938= When the Great War began in 1914, Colonel Sam Hughes, Canada's Minister of Militia, scrapped the original national mobilisation plan and asked the commanding officers of Militia units for volunteers to serve with battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). Consequently, many members of the 13th Royal Regiment went overseas with the 4th Battalion, CEF, part of the famous First Contingent. Throughout the war, the unit served as a depot regiment that enrolled and trained men before despatching them to deploying CEF battalions. The CEF was not the only destination, either; the Royal Flying Corps accepted 82 men from the 13th, and 81 went to the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve. Locally raised CEF battalions that received soldiers from the 13th included the 19th Battalion, CEF (145 men), 36th Battalion, CEF (124 men), 76th Battalion, CEF (506 men), 86th (Machine Gun) Battalion, CEF (600 men), 120th (City of Hamilton) Battalion, CEF (625 men) and the 205th (Tiger) Battalion, CEF (704 men). Of these, the 120th (City of Hamilton) Battalion CEF had the closest affiliation with the 13th Royal Regiment, so on 28 May 1916, that battalion formally accepted the regiment's colours and took them overseas. The colours were laid up in Westminster Abbey until 5 March 1919, when the Dean of Westminster returned them to veterans of the 120th (City of Hamilton) Battalion, which was broken up to reinforce other CEF battalions in 1917. In the interwar period, the Canadian Militia underwent two major reorganisations (in 1920 and again in 1936) and several minor ones. The Hamilton area did not escape, and in 1920 the two most significant RHLI antecedents acquired new names: The Royal Hamilton Regiment and the Wentworth Regiment. In 1927, the former became the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, and the final reorganisation in 1936 brought all but one company of the Wentworth Regiment into the RHLI, which then received its current title: The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment). To this day, the regiment is informally known as the Rileys. =History 1939‚Äì1945= Infantry Carrier move through the Dutch village of Krabbendijke on the Beveland Causeway, 27 October 1944thumbright220px The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry SF On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, all the units of the Non-Permanent Active Militia of Canada were mobilised for overseas service. (This was not done in 1899 or 1914 because the original terms of sovereignty under the British North America Act-amended by the Statute of Westminster in 1931-did not include authority to deploy troops outside Canadian territory.) The Rileys were mobilised with the Canadian Active Service Force on 1 September 1939, reinforced from the 2nd Battalion at the regiment's home station, which began recruiting for home defence in early 1940. In November 1940, the active service battalion was redesignated the 1st Battalion, RHLI. The 1st Battalion was assigned to the 4th Infantry Brigade in the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. The battalion saw combat for the first time at Dieppe on August 19, 1942. Of the 582 soldiers who landed that morning, only 102 (18 percent) were not among the casualties: 197 killed, 174 captured and 194 wounded (including 85 also captured).RHLI website The Dieppe survivors suffered great physical trauma and psychological distress as a result of the battle and the loss of so many of their friends and comrades in a battle that lasted only about eight hours. The most highly decorated member of the battalion was the chaplain, Honorary Captain the Reverend John Foote, who remained at Dieppe with his wounded and captured comrades rather than accept evacuation to Britain. Padre Foote was nominated for the Victoria Cross while still a prisoner of war; the award was made after VE Day. The 2nd Canadian Division came under command of the newly formed II Canadian Corps in Britain, and after almost two years of training after Dieppe, returning to France after D-Day, to fight through the Battle of Normandy from early July on. During Operation Spring, the Rileys earned the distinction of being the only assault unit to hold their objective (the village of Verri√®res). During the winter of 1944-45, the Rileys fought through the Battle of the Scheldt and the Rhineland, and on V-E Day was deep into Germany. =History 1945‚Äì1999= The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry In the post-war period, the regular battalion was demobilized and the reserve battalion consequently lost its number. It looked like the RHLI would revert to the genteel neglect of the interwar period, until the Cold War interrupted. Some Rileys served in the United Nations Special Force in the Korean War and in 1955 the regiment was represented in the 27th Brigade that served on NATO duty in West Germany. At home, its armoury was renamed in honour of Padre Foote, VC. In 1978, Prince Philip was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment. The RHLI, formerly part of the Hamilton Militia District, became part of 4th Canadian Division's 31 Canadian Brigade Group in the 1990s. The town of Dieppe, France, has set aside a small park at the western end of the esplanade in which it has erected a memorial of its own. Standing in the centre of the Square du Canada (Canada Square), the Dieppe-Canada Monument is a testimony to the long and warm association between Canadians and Normans which has existed since Samuel de Champlain sailed to found New France. The names of people and events which have linked Canada and Normandy over the centuries have been recorded on the monument. Mounted on the wall behind it is a plaque that commemorates the Raid on Dieppe: :On 19 August 1942 on the beaches of Dieppe our Canadian cousins marked with their blood the road to our final liberation foretelling thus their victorious return on 1 September 1944. (translation from the French) =Recent activities= Members of the regiment have augmented Regular Force contingents on many operations including serving in the Balkans with United Nation forces (UNPROFOR) in the early 1990s and NATO from 1995-present. Over the past decades members have also served in; Cyprus, the Golan Heights, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Congo, Haiti, Sudan, Dubai, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Ukraine and Latvia. They were also on alert for the feared millennial or Y2K crisis which failed to materialise. The City of Hamilton dedicated Dieppe Memorial Park in the Hamilton Beach neighbourhood on 19 August 2003, the 61st anniversary of the Dieppe Raid. Among the 250 invited guests and 1,000 onlookers were the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario and 18 of the 24 Riley Dieppe veterans known to survive. In 2017 the RHLI received the StAR (Strengthening the Army Reserve) Mission Task of Influence Activities (IA). This is a mixture of Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) and Civil- Military Cooperation (CIMIC). Current parade strength is approximately 200-250 all ranks, making the RHLI one of the largest reserve regiments in the CAF. The RHLI currently consists of; one rifle company, \\"B\\" Company (Hamilton), an IA Company, \\"D\\" Company (Burlington) and an administration company, \\"A\\" Company, also at battalion headquarters in Hamilton. Battalion structures are maintained throughout the militia to allow for expansion in time of war. =Serving in Afghanistan= Most recently, soldiers from the RHLI have deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Canadian Forces contribution to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). This is the first time since the Second World War serving members from the regiment have taken part in combat operations. Most notably this included Operation Medusa in 2006. Members from the RHLI in Afghanistan have also served with the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) and as members of the Force Protection Unit. Battle honours The regimental colour of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) Battle honours in small capitals are for large operations and campaigns and those in lowercase are for more specific battles. Bold type indicates honours authorized to be emblazoned on the regimental colour. Royal Canadian Army Cadets The RHLI has two affiliated Royal Canadian Army Cadets corps. One corps in Hamilton (62 Canadian Cadet Corps) and one corps in Burlington (2379 Canadian Cadet Corps). Both corps have an outstanding training program as well as having had several cadets attend the Royal Military College of Canada or Civilian University - Regular Officers Training Program and join the Canadian Armed Forces. Notable soldiers *Denis Whitaker, a prewar professional football player, rose to command the 1st Battalion of the regiment in the Second World War. After the war, he rose to the rank of Brigadier and published many books on Canadian military history with his wife Shelagh. *Rev. John Wier Foote, VC, was awarded the Victoria Cross during the battle of Dieppe for rescuing fallen Allied soldiers and surrendering so as to assist the captured and injured Allied soldiers during their wait for liberation. * William Merrifield, Victoria Cross recipient * George R.

Despite not being an incorporated city, Riverside has its own zip code, 02915, and is an acceptable mailing address according to the United States Postal Service. Riverside has a population of approximately 20,000 people. Adjoining Riverside are the town of Barrington in Bristol County to the south, Narragansett Bay to the west, the rest of East Providence to the north, and the Runnins River and Seekonk, Massachusetts to the east.  History  Riverside, known as Cedar Grove until 1878, was originally a farming and fishing area. The streets south of the Maze are named for trees. Crescent Park Carousel Riverside most notably became a tourist attraction in the late 19th and early 20th century due to the presence of Crescent Park Amusement Park, known as the ‚ÄúConey Island of the East‚Äù. The 50 acre park operated from 1886 until 1979, and was famous for its Rhode Island Shore Dinners as well as the Alhambra Ballroom, where famous Big Bands played, and the bustling midway which included roller coasters, kiddie land, rides and games. Although the park in now gone, the famous 1895 Crescent Park Looff Carousel has been preserved and continues in operation every summer. The Carousel is nationally recognized as a true masterpiece of wood sculpture. Originally built as a showcase for prospective buyers, it is the largest and most elaborate of Looff's works. Two other amusement parks sprung up in the early 1900s in Riverside. Boyden Heights and Vanity Fair each had a short run before closing down due to low attendance. Many hotels, guest houses and shore dinner halls operated in Riverside in the late 19th century to accommodate the influx of summer visitors escaping the big city. Also available were several tent sites like Camp White and Camp Fuller. The Vue de l'Eau Hotel was built around 1860. The four-story Riverside Hotel boasted its own wharf and a huge ballroom overlooking the bay. After a few years, it was dismantled and shipped by barge to Nantucket. Pomham House opened in 1867 with its own wharf. The popular Silver Spring Hotel was opened two years later by developer, Hiram Maxfield. In addition to the hotel, it included a shore dinner hall and summer cottages. Girl Scout House The Lyric Theater opened on Maple Avenue around 1920 and featured silent movies until 1928 when the theater became the second in the state to have talking pictures. Later named the Gilbert Stuart, it eventually closed as a theater. The Riverside Girl Scout House on Willett Avenue, built around 1870, is the oldest school still standing in East Providence. It was known as District 6 Schoolhouse. Hockey star and NHL / U.S. Olympic hockey coach Ron Wilson lived in Riverside, at 47 Lottie Drive, from the ages of 12 until he was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs. Today, it is a close-knit and diverse community with several distinct neighborhoods.  Tourism  The historic Little Neck Cemetery contains the grave of Thomas Willett, the first mayor of New York City and Elizabeth Tilley Howland (d.1687) who was a passenger as a child on the Mayflower. The exclusive Squantum Club and clam bake building was built overlooking the bay in 1872. The all-male club still operates today. Riversidians were known for harvesting clams, quahogs and oysters from the beaches and surrounding waters. They became known as \\"Clam-diggers\\". Narragansett Terrace, in the extreme south of town, was the site of many summer cottages for wealthy residents including Governor Case. This peninsula afforded a grand view of Narragansett Bay. Bullock's Cove, nestled between the Terrace and Bay Spring, offered mooring sites for small boats. From this point one can see Barrington, Warren, Bristol, Warwick, Cranston, and Providence from the shore. In the past decade, East Providence has considered many redevelopment projects. The largest landowner in Riverside is ExxonMobil. There are also banking call centers for Bank of America and Citizens Bank. It is also home to Bradley Hospital and the Silver Spring Golf Course. East Bay Bike Path The major roads through Riverside are the Wampanoag Trail connecting East Providence to Bristol County, RI and Willett Ave, named after Captain Thomas Willett, the first English mayor of New York City (1665). Willett is buried in Riverside at the Little Neck Cemetery.

Danilo Baltasar Anderson (born 29 October 1966) was a Venezuelan environmental state prosecutor investigating more than 400 people accused of crimes during the Llaguno Overpass events and the failed 2002 coup d'√©tat attempt. Anderson, 38, was assassinated on his way home from attending postgraduate classes. In 2005 several people were convicted of masterminding the assassination, though the investigation had flaws, was marred with allegations of corruption. Background Anderson was born in Caracas and was raised in the slums. In the 1990s, he was a student agitator participating in clashes with police weekly with fellow demonstrators. He graduated in law from Central University of Venezuela in 1995, specializing later in criminology and environmental law. He worked as a lawyer for several firms, and was a general tax inspector between 1993 and 2000. He was the first official to bring a case for environmental offenses in Caracas. Anderson described himself as being a radical leftist and was a supporter of Hugo Ch√°vez. His murder shocked Venezuelan opinion across the political spectrum. Danilo Anderson was a high- profile prosecutor that participated often in political trials. Following the failure of the coup in April 2002, he prosecuted the responsibles of the Llaguno Overpass events and those who signed the Carmona Decree. Many accused Anderson of extorting money from those he threatened to prosecute in order to have their charges dropped. Leaders of the political movements opposed to President Ch√°vez had also turned to economic means to achieve their political goals following the 2002 coup attempt. For two months from early December 2002 they organized the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003, dominated by the near-closure of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA as a key oil transport route was blocked. The strike ultimately failed in its attempt to make President Ch√°vez resign, but caused acute economic problems, with GDP falling by a quarter in early 2003, and deepened the conflictive political situation and polarization resulting from the Llaguno Overpass shootout and the April coup. Following the collapse of the strike, opposition politicians focused on a recall referendum. Widespread international attention focused on the run-up to the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum in August 2004. President Ch√°vez won the vote with 59% of the total. Assassination On 18 November 2004 at about 9:45 pm, Anderson was in Urbanizaci√≥n Los Chaguaramos in Caracas, driving home in his yellow Toyota Autana from the University Institute of Forensic Science where he was taking postgraduate classes. Anderson stopped at a street and as he accelerated, a military-grade C-4 plastic explosive device placed on the frame under the driver's seat detonated from a wireless device killing Anderson instantly. The blast had such force that it broke windows in the vicinity and covered the street with glass. Witnesses say they heard two loud explosions and saw the vehicle, already in flames, roll into the front of a nearby building. Firefighters and CICPC investigators arrived at the scene shortly after the explosion. Anderson's body was charred an unrecognizable and he had to be identified by his fingerprints and dental records. Anderson's sister and girlfriend also helped identify him as the victim by recognizing personal belongings such as his Glock automatic pistol, two cell phones, his girlfriend's photo, his wallet and a chain. Within a few hours, many government officials had gathered at the scene and Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez began to mention Anderson's involvement in the investigation of those who signed the Carmona Decree. The Venezuelan government and opposition, multiple national organizations and international bodies such as the OAS and the IACHR condemned the assassination. Investigation The investigation into who masterminded Anderson's murder became one of the most controversial topics in Venezuelan politics. According to the United States Department of State, Anderson's death was \\"believed to be linked to his alleged extortion attempts, but the BRV [Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela] claims his death was part of a larger plot to destabilize the government\\". There were reports that friends of Anderson may have operated an extortion racket aimed at opposition figures being investigated by Anderson in relation to the 2002 coup and that Anderson or lawyers close to him \\"were paid large bribes in a bid to ensure the acquittal of some civilians linked to the 2002 coup\\".El Universal, 6 January 2005, PROSECUTOR ANDERSON'S FRIENDS UNDER INVESTIGATION; El Universal, 10 March 2005, Attorney General Office keeps on investigating Anderson case Other reports claimed that Anderson was a member of an extortion ring himself and the members involved feared he was investigating them. Lifelong friend of Anderson and Caracas municipal council member, Carlos Herrera, stated \\"The Danilo I first knew was a revolutionary without a cent to his name\\" and stated that a few years before his death, Anderson did not even have a vehicle. Herrera explained that the Toyota Autana that Anderson was killed in was $70,000 and that he had recently purchased two personal water craft along with multiple apartments and farms. Following the assassination, the Venezuelan government quickly blamed Venezuelan exiles in the United States for the murder. On 26 November 2004, two brothers Otoniel and Rolando Guevara were found by the National Guard wandering down a road in Valencia naked and tied after they had been seen earlier accompanied by about 10 armed individuals who had bound and gagged the brothers. Some reported that DISIP officers were the ones who had the Guevara brothers bound earlier and let them go so that they would be found and arrested legally, though the Venezuelan government denied such allegations. The two were arrested and both charged with homicide.Venezuelanalysis.com, 28 November 2004, Two More Arrests and one More Death in the Case of Venezuelan Prosecutor's Assassination The brothers stated that they were captured, drugged and then tortured before they were arrested. The same day the Guevara brothers were arrested two other suspects in the case, lawyer Antonio Lopez Castillo and, another former police agent, Juan Carlos Sanchez, were shot dead by investigating officers in separate incidents; both were said to have opened fire on the police, though relatives and lawyers stated that the two were executed by the police.BBC, 26 November 2004 Arrests over Venezuelan killing Police alleged finding a C4 explosive, a 9mm pistol, and a hand grenade were found among Sanchez‚Äôs belongings. On 4 January 2005, Interior Minister Jesse Chac√≥n stated that there was evidence of bribery and extortion linked to both Anderson and bankers that allegedly participated in the 2002 coup. A lawyer linked to Anderson, S√≥crates Tiniacos, told police in an affidavit that he assisted Anderson's girlfriend and her brother with removing about $60,000 from Anderson's apartment safe following the assassination in order to cover up suspicious money from the police. Tiniacos also explained in his sworn statement that he saw two attorneys negotiating to keep a banker and coup suspect from being arrested and saw them give Anderson a bag full of U.S. dollars in a Caracas restaurant. Tiniacos said to police, \\"Danilo got into his car with the package and left. I don't know what he did with it\\". Later that month, Attorney General Isa√≠as Rodr√≠guez stated that police involved in the investigation \\"shuffled the pieces of the puzzle\\" to protect those suspected in Anderson's death and replaced the investigative team for a second time. Rodr√≠guez called the extortion evidence \\"contradictory\\" saying \\"If we take away his medal and say Danilo was a crook, we are hurting Hugo Ch√°vez.\\" The investigation eventually widened in search of the organizers and planners of the murder. By August 2005 the Venezuelan authorities had detained Giovani Jos√© V√°squez De Armas, a self-confessed former member of the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC), the Colombian right-wing paramilitary organization. In sworn testimony given on August 29, 2005, V√°squez de Armas declared that he had participated in two meetings to plan attacks against members of the Venezuelan government.Venezuelanalysis.com, 9 November 2005, FBI and CIA identified as helping Plan Venezuelan Prosecutor's Murder He alleged that participants in the second meeting decided to target Danilo Anderson. After that second meeting V√°squez de Armas said he collected 12 kg of C4 plastic explosive in Panama and transported it to Venezuela.El Universal, 12 November 2005, Four people accused of masterminding the murder of public prosecutor Danilo Anderson On the basis of V√°squez De Armas' testimony, warrants were issued for the arrest of leading journalist Patricia Poleo, banker Nelson Mezerhane, retired general Eugenio √Å√±ez N√∫√±ez and Salvador Roman√≠, as the \\"intellectual authors\\" of the assassination. Mezzerane, √Å√±ez and Roman√≠ turned themselves in and were granted bail in December 2005.El Universal, 21 December 2005, Mezerhane, A√±ez and Roman√≠ released pending trial Poleo did not present herself to the authorities; she was interviewed on a TV show in Peru in January 2006. Human rights groups, media advocates and members of the opposition accused the Venezuelan government of turning the investigation of Anderson's murder into a political issue, using the case to harass government opponents.El Universal, 9 November 2005, ATTORNEY GENERAL ACCUSED OF USING ANDERSON'S CASE TO CHASE DISSIDENTS They stated that the accusations were an attempt to take away the freedom of the press. On 20 December 2005, Otoniel and Rolando Guevara were sentenced to 27 years and 9 months imprisonment each, while their brother Juan Bautista was sentenced to the maximum 30 years.El Universal, 21 December 2005, Perpetrators of Anderson murder convicted to up to 30 years in jail = Investigation flaws = In 2006 the credibility of the key prosecution witness V√°squez De Armas came into question after it was shown he had a criminal record for identity fraud in his native Colombia and he was not a psychiatrist as he had pledged to be.

Early life Couvoisier was born at Besan√ßon on 30 November 1775. During the revolutionary period, he left the country and served in the army of the √©migr√©s and later in that of Austria.  Career  In 1801, under the Consulate, he returned to France and established himself as an advocate at Besan√ßon, being appointed conseiller-auditeur to the court of appeal therein 1808. At the Restoration he was made advocate-general by Louis XVIII, resigned and left France during the Hundred Days, and was reappointed after the second Restoration in 1815. In 1817, after the modification of the constitution by the ordonnance of the 5 September, he was returned to the chamber of deputies, where he attached himself to the left centre and supported the moderate policy of Richelieu and Decazes. He was an eloquent speaker, and master of many subjects; and his proved royalism made it impossible for the Ultra-Royalists to discredit him, much as they resented his consistent opposition to their short-sighted violence. After the revolt at Lyon, he was nominated procureur-general of the city, and by his sense and moderation did much to restore order and confidence. He was again a member of the chamber from 1819 to 1824, and vigorously opposed the exceptional legislation which the second administration of Richelieu passed under the influence of the ultra-Royalists. In 1824, he failed to secure re-election, and occupied himself with his judicial duties until his nomination as councilor of state in 1827. On 8 August 1829, he accepted the offer of the portfolio of justice in the Polignac ministry, but resigned on 19 May 1830, when he realized that the government intended to abrogate the Charter and the inevitable revolution that would follow. During the trial of the ex-ministers, in December, he was summoned as a witness, and paid a tribute to the character of his former colleagues which, in the circumstances, argued no little courage. He refused to take office under Louis Philippe, and retired into private life, dying on 18 September 1835.

There are essentially two reasons to use program trading, either because of the desire to trade many stocks simultaneously (for example, when a mutual fund receives an influx of money it will use that money to increase its holdings in the multiple stocks which the fund is based on), or alternatively to arbitrage temporary price discrepancies between related financial instruments, such as between an index and its constituent parts. According to the New York Stock Exchange, in 2006 program trading accounts for about 30% and as high as 46.4% of the trading volume on that exchange every day. Barrons breaks down its weekly figures for program trading between index arbitrage and other types of program trading. As of July 2012, program trading made up about 25% of the volume on the NYSE; index arbitrage made up less than 1%.http://online.barrons.com/public/page/9_0210-nysepgtd.html History Several factors help to explain the explosion in program trading. Technological advances spawned the growth of electronic communication networks. These electronic exchanges, like Instinet and Archipelago Exchange, allow thousands of buy and sell orders to be matched very rapidly, without human intervention. In addition, the proliferation of hedge funds with all their sophisticated trading strategies have helped drive program-trading volume. As technology advanced and access to electronic exchanges became easier and faster, program trading developed into the much broader algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading strategies employed by the investment banks and hedge funds. Program Trading Firms Program Trading is a strategy normally used by large institutional traders. Barrons shows a detailed breakdown of the NYSE-published program trading figures each week, giving the figures for the largest program trading firms (such as investment banks). Index Arbitrage Index Arbitrage is a particular type of Program Trading which attempts to profit from price discrepancies between the basket of stocks which make up a stock index and its derivatives (such as the future based on that index). As of July 2012, it makes up less than 5% of the active Program Trading volume on the NYSE daily. =Premium Buy and Sell Execution Levels= The \\"premium\\" (PREM) or \\"spread\\" is the difference between the stock index future fair value and the actual index level. As the derivative is based on the index, the two should normally have a very close relationship. If there is a sufficiently large difference the arbitraging program will attempt to buy the relatively cheap level (whether that is the basket of stocks which make up the index or the index future) and sell the relatively expensive product, making money from the price discrepancy. The fair value calculation takes into account the time to expiration of the future contract, the dividends received from holding all the stocks, and the interest cost of buying the stocks.http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/program_trading.asp See also * Automated trading system * Algorithmic trading * High-frequency trading * Alternative trading system * Electronic trading platform * Dark pool References Category:Share trading sv:Algoritmisk handel ","title":"Program trading"},{"id":"1249559","text":"The ancient Roman roads to the north west. In blue the original trace of the via Aurelia, in red the via Cassia, in mauve the via Clodia. The Via Clodia at Saturnia near to Porta Romana Tabula Peutingeriana: Part IV. Here the branch Pisa-Luni is not yet linked The Via Clodia was an ancient high-road of Italy. Situated between the Via Cassia and the Via Aurelia, it is different from them notably in that the latter were designed primarily for military long-haul, irrespective of settlements they met, but the Via Clodia was of short-range, intended for commercial traffic with the colonies in Etruscan lands. Its origin is uncertain, but most scholars agree that it was built by the Romans on an existing Etruscan route (between Pitigliano, Sorano and Sovana) on the path of the existing Etruscan \\"Via Cava\\"). However we can speak of the Via Clodia from the end of the 3rd century BC, and that from 225 BC it was paved. The existing road was probably used as a way of penetration and conquest of Etruria by the Roman army begun in 310 BC. The road never seems to have had heavy traffic, only connecting Rome with Etruria inner north-western cities. The stretch between Bracciano and Oriolo Romano continues a straight line whose paving stones are found here and there, often uprooted. Some basalt sections appear in the territory of Tuscania, Oriolo Romano, Vejano and Blera. Its course, for the first 11 miles, was the same as that of the Via Cassia; it then diverged in a northwest direction and ran on the west side of the Lacus Sabatinus, past Forum Clodii and Blera. According to some it ended in Saturnia. At Forum Cassii it may have rejoined the Via Cassia, and it seems to have taken the same line as the latter as far as Florentia (Florence). However, beyond Florentia, between Luca (Lucca) and Luna, we find another Forum Clodii, and the Antonine itinerary gives the route from Luca to Rome as being by the Via Clodia, wrongly as regards the portion from Florentia southwards, but perhaps rightly as regards that from Luca to Florentia. Clodius Vestalis (c. 43) was perhaps responsible for the construction of the first portion and of that from Florentia to Luca (and Luna). Moreover, he also founded the two Fora Clodii. The name seems, in imperial times, to have to some extent driven out that of the Cassia, and both roads were administered, with other minor roads, by the same curator.  Via Clodia Nova  The Via Clodia Nova extension was constructed in 183 BC by the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus. It started from Lucca and climbed the valley on the right bank of the river Serchio, crossed the Garfagnana region to the Piazza al Serchio, then passed over the col of Tea (955m) and through Fosdinovo before joining the Via Cassia, Luni and the port.  Stages  According to the Tabula Peutingeriana, the stages on the Via Clodia are: *Sextum (in the current area of Rome called The Retort and where the Via Cassia separated) *Careias (in the current area of Rome called Santa Maria di Galeria) *ad Nonas (near Vigna di Valle) *Forum Clodii (near San Liberato di Bracciano) *Olera (Blera) *Tuscana (Tuscania) *Marta (on lago di Bolsena) *Maternum (Canino or Ischia di Castro) *Saturnia  Roman bridges  :For an overview of the location of Roman bridges, see List of Roman bridges.

Before German reunification, the facility served as a microwave transmission link between West Berlin and West Germany. It first used only an overhorizon directional link. For this link between 1970 and 1973 a 117.5 m high free- standing steelframe work tower was built. This tower was equipped with parabolic dishes of 18 m diameter for an overhorizon link to Gartow in Lower Saxony. From 1977 onward a 358.6 m high guyed mast for conventional directional service was built. It carries on a platform aerials for directional services toward Gartow and Clenze,Der deutsche Fernsehturm, Rudolf Pospischil, 2009, page 47 both in Lower Saxony. At a height of 300 metres, there was a room for technical equipment measuring 4 by 5 metres. This room was the highest floor of all structures in the European Union at the time of the tower's demolition. Since 2002 there have been test transmissions for DRM on the medium wave frequency 1485 kHz. Because neither of the towers was designed for use as aerial for AM transmission, a long wire aerial on a 10 m high mast was built. The radio mast was demolished on February 8, 2009 shortly after 1pm local time.

After the war he moved to Harwell and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment. He had no qualifications but became expert in the design and construction of the advanced machines and instruments used in physics research, designing the Harwell Synchrocyclotron. In 1953 he joined CERN as director of the Proton Synchrotron division. After the death of Prof. C. J.

He held this post until August 1961 when he returned to the UK as director of the Culham Fusion Laboratory, and then from 1966 to 1971 he was a member of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Returning to CERN in 1971 as Director- General of Laboratory II, he led the design of the Super Proton Synchrotron. He split the duties of CERN Director General with Willibald Jentschke and then L√©on Van Hove during the 1970s.

Measuring approximately long by wide, Hart Island is part of the Pelham Islands archipelago, to the east of City Island. The island's first public use was as a training ground for the United States Colored Troops in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a Union Civil War prison camp, a psychiatric institution, a tuberculosis sanatorium, a potter's field with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' reformatory, a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the Cold War, Nike defense missiles were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the New York City Department of Correction until 2019, when the New York City Council voted to transfer jurisdiction to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims. Access to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates from the nearby Rikers Island jail. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available. Prior to 2019, several laws to transfer jurisdiction to the Parks Department had been proposed to ease public access to Hart Island.  Etymology  There are numerous theories about the possible origins for the island's name. In one, British cartographers named it \\"Heart Island\\" in 1775 due to its organ-like shape but the 'e' was dropped shortly after. A map drawn in 1777 and subsequent maps refer to the island as \\"Hart Island\\". Other names given to the island during the late 18th century were \\"Little Minneford Island\\" and \\"Spectacle Island\\", the latter because the island's shape was thought to resemble spectacles. Another theory, based on the meaning of the English word \\"hart\\", which means \\"stag\\", is that the island was named when it was used as a game reserve. Another version holds that it was named in reference to deer that migrated from the mainland during periods when ice covered that part of Long Island Sound.  Geography  Hart Island is approximately long by wide at its widest point. It lies about off the eastern shore of City Island. The island's area is disputed; according to some sources, it is , while others state that it is . Hart Island is isolated from the rest of the city: there is no electricity and the only means of access is via ferryboat. History 1884 Nautical Chart = Early history = Before European colonization, Hart Island was occupied by the Siwanoy tribe of Native Americans, who were indigenous to the area. In 1654, English physician Thomas Pell purchased the island from the Siwanoy as part of a property. Pell died in 1669 and ownership passed to his nephew Sir John Pell, the son of British mathematician John Pell. The island remained in the Pell family until 1774, when it was sold to Oliver De Lancey. It was later sold to the Rodman, Haight, and Hunter families, in that order. According to Elliott Gorn, Hart Island had become \\"a favorite pugilistic hideaway\\" by the early 19th century. Bouts of bare-knuckle boxing held on the island could draw thousands of spectators. The first public use of Hart Island was training the 31st Infantry Regiment of the United States Colored Troops beginning in 1864. A steamboat called John Romer shuttled recruits to the island from the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan. A commander's house and a recruits' barracks were built; the barracks included a library and a concert room; it could house 2,000 to 3,000 recruits at a time, and over 50,000 men were ultimately trained there. In November 1864, construction of a prisoner-of-war camp on Hart Island with room for 5,000 prisoners started. The camp was used for four months in 1865 during the American Civil War. The island housed 3,413 captured Confederate Army soldiers. Of these, 235 died in the camp and were buried in Cypress Hills Cemetery. Following the Civil War, indigent veterans were buried on the island in soldier's plots, which were separate from the potter's field and at the same location. Some of these soldiers were moved to West Farms Soldiers Cemetery in 1916 and others were removed to Cypress Hills Cemetery in 1941. =Addition of cemetery= The first burials on Hart Island were those of 20 Union Army soldiers during the American Civil War. On May 27, 1868, New York City purchased the island from Edward Hunter, who also owned nearby Hunter Island, for $75,000. City burials started shortly afterward. In 1869, a 24-year-old woman named Louisa Van Slyke, who died in Charity Hospital, was the first person to be buried in the island's public graveyard. The cemetery then became known as \\"City Cemetery\\" and \\"Potter's Field\\". By 1880, The New York Times described the island as \\"the Green-Wood of Five Points\\", comparing an expansive cemetery in Brooklyn with a historically poor neighborhood in Manhattan. The newspaper also said of Hart Island, \\"This is where the rough pine boxes go that come from Blackwell's Island\\", in reference to the influx of corpses being transported from the hospitals on modern-day Roosevelt Island. The potter's field on Hart Island replaced two previous potter's fields on the current sites of Washington Square Park and New York Public Library Main Branch in Manhattan. The number of burials on Hart Island exceeded 500,000 by 1958. = Juxtaposition of uses = Hart Island was used as a quarantine station during the 1870 yellow fever epidemic. In that period, the island contained a women's psychiatric hospital called The Pavilion, which was built 1885, as well as a tubercularium. There was also an industrial school with 300 students on the island. After an 1892 investigation found the city's asylums were overcrowded, it was proposed to expand those on Hart Island from 1,100 to 1,500 beds. Convalescent Hospital on Hart Island, 1877 In the late 19th century, Hart Island became the location of a boys' workhouse, which was an extension of the prison and almshouse on Blackwell Island. A workhouse for men was established in 1895, and was followed by a workhouse for young boys ten years later. By the early 20th century, Hart Island housed about 2,000 delinquent boys as well as elderly male prisoners from Blackwell's penitentiary. The prison on Hart Island grew; it had its own band and a Catholic prison chapel. The cornerstone for the $60,000 chapel was laid in 1931 and it was opened the following year. In 1924, John Hunter sold his tract of land on Hart Island's west side to Solomon Riley, a millionaire real estate speculator from Barbados. Riley subsequently proposed to build an amusement park on Hart Island, which would have served the primarily black community of Harlem in Manhattan. It was referred to as the \\"Negro Coney Island\\" because at the time, African Americans were banned from the Rye Playland and Dobbs Ferry amusement parks in the New York City area. Riley had started building a dance hall, boardinghouses, and a boardwalk, and purchased sixty steamboats for the operation. The state government raised concerns about the proposed park's proximity to a jail and hospital, and the city condemned the land in 1925. Riley was later paid $144,000 for the seizure. = After World War II = The prison population of Hart Island was moved to Rikers Island during World War II, and Hart Island's former workhouse was used as a disciplinary barracks by the United States Armed Forces. Rikers Island soon became overcrowded with prisoners. The New York City Department of Correction reopened Hart Island as a prison following the war, but the facilities were considered inadequate. The New York City Board of Estimate approved the construction of a homeless shelter on the island in 1950; it was intended to serve 2,000 people. The homeless shelter operated from 1951 to 1954; it was also used to house alcoholics. Residents of nearby City Island opposed the inclusion of the homeless shelter. The New York City Welfare Department closed the homeless shelter and the Department of Correction regained control of the island. The Department of Correction opened an alcoholism treatment center on Hart Island in 1955. A courthouse, which ruled on cases involving the homeless, was opened on Hart Island. The island housed between 1,200 and 1,800 prisoners serving short sentences of between 10 days and two years. In 1956, the island was retrofitted with Nike Ajax missile silos. Battery NY-15, as the silos were known, were part of the United States Army base Fort Slocum from 1956 to 1961 and were operated by the army's 66th Antiaircraft Artillery Missile Battalion. The silos were underground and were powered by large generators. Some silos were also built on Davids' Island. The integrated fire control system that tracked the targets and directed missiles was at Fort Slocum. The last components of the missile system were closed in 1974. Construction of a new $7 million workhouse on Hart Island to replace the existing facility was announced in 1959. A baseball field was dedicated at the Hart Island prison the following year. It was named Kratter Field, after Marvin Kratter, a businessman who had donated 2,200 seats saved from the demolished Ebbets Field stadium. The seats deteriorated after being outdoors for several years, and by 2000, had been donated to various people and organizations. The island continued to be used as a prison until 1966, when the prison was closed due to changes in the penal code. After it closed, a drug rehabilitation center was proposed for Hart Island. The center became Phoenix House, which opened in 1967; it quickly grew into a settlement with 350 residents and a vegetable garden. Phoenix House hosted festivals that sometimes attracted crowds of more than 10,000 people. Phoenix House published a newsletter known as The Hart Beat and organized baseball games against other organizations such as City Island's and NBC's teams. In 1977, after regular ferry service to Hart Island ended, Phoenix House moved from the island to a building in Manhattan. Since then, proposals to re-inhabit the island have failed. In 1972, the city considered converting it into a residential resort but the plan abandoned. New York City mayor Ed Koch created a workhouse on the island for persons charged with misdemeanors in 1982 but not enough prisoners were sent there. Six years later, another proposal called for a homeless shelter and a workhouse to be built on Hart Island, but this plan was abandoned because of opposition from residents of City Island. = Abandonment of structures and use as cemetery = Map from 1966Originally, City Cemetery occupied on the northern and southern tips of Hart Island, while the center two-thirds of the island was habitable. In 1985, sixteen bodies of people who died from AIDS were buried in deep graves on a remote section of the southern tip the island because at the time it was feared that their remains may be contagious. The first pediatric AIDS victim to die in New York City is buried in the only single grave on Hart Island with a concrete marker that reads SC (special child) B1 (Baby 1) 1985. Since then, thousands of AIDS victims have been buried on Hart Island, but the precise number of AIDS victims buried on the island is unknown. From 1991 to 1993, New York artist Melinda Hunt and photographer Joel Sternfeld photographed Hart Island for their book of the same name, which was published in 1998. Hunt subsequently founded the Hart Island Project organization in 1994 to help the families and friends of those buried on Hart Island. Another media work, the 2018 documentary One Million American Dreams, documents the history of Hart Island and delves briefly into the lives of various individuals buried there. There is a section of old wooden houses and masonry institutional structures dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries that have fallen into disrepair. Military barracks from the Civil War period were used prior to the construction of workhouse and hospital facilities. In the late 2010s, the Hart Island Project and City Island Historical Society started petitioning for Hart Island to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation labeled the island a \\"site of historical significance\\" in 2016, given that Hart Island met three of the four criteria for being listed on the NRHP. The island was significantly affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and some of the shoreline was eroded, which exposed many of the skeletons buried on the island. Following this, the city announced a restoration of the shoreline. The federal government gave $13.2 million toward the shoreline project in 2015, but the work was delayed for several years. The start of restoration was initially slated for 2020, but in August 2019, the city announced that shoreline work would begin the following month. That December, control of the island passed to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.  Cemetery  Hart Island contains New York City's potter's field, or public cemetery. The potter's field is variously described as the largest tax-funded cemetery in the United States, the largest-such in the world, and one of the largest mass graves in the United States. At least 850,000 have been buried on the island, though since the 2000s, the burial rate has declined to fewer than 1,500 a year. One-third of annual burials are infants and stillborn babies, which has been reduced from a proportion of one- half since the Children's Health Insurance Program began to cover all pregnant women in New York State in 1997. According to a 2006 New York Times article, there had been 1,419 burials at the potter's field during the previous year: of these, 826 were adults, 546 were infants and stillborn babies, and 47 were dismembered body parts. = Burials = The dead are buried in trenches. Babies are placed in coffins, which are stacked in groups of 100, measuring five coffins deep and usually in twenty rows. Adults are placed in larger pine boxes placed according to size, and are stacked in sections of 150, measuring three coffins deep in two rows. There are seven sizes of coffins, which range from long. Each box is labeled with an identification number, the person's age, ethnicity, and the place where the body was found, if applicable. Inmates from the Rikers Island jail are paid $0.50 per hour to bury bodies on Hart Island. The bodies of adults are frequently disinterred when families are able to locate their relatives through DNA, photographs and fingerprints kept on file at the Office of the Medical Examiner. There were an average of 72 disinterments per year from 2007 to 2009. As a result, the adults' coffins are staggered to expedite removal. Children, mostly infants, are rarely disinterred. Regulations stipulate that the coffins generally must remain untouched for 25 years, except in cases of disinterment. Approximately half of the burials are of children under five who are identified and died in New York City's hospitals, where the mothers signed papers authorizing a \\"City Burial.\\" The mothers were generally unaware of what the phrase meant. Many other interred have families who live abroad or out of state and whose relatives search extensively; these searches are made more difficult because burial records are currently kept within the prison system. An investigation into the handling of the infant burials was opened in response to a criminal complaint made to the New York State Attorney General's Office in 2009. Burial records on microfilm at the Municipal Archives indicate that until 1913, burials of unknowns were in single plots, and identified adults and children were buried in mass graves. In 1913, the trenches became separate to facilitate the more frequent disinterment of adults. The potter's field is also used to dispose of amputated body parts, which are placed in boxes labeled \\"limbs\\". Ceremonies have not been conducted at the burial site since the 1950s. In the past, burial trenches were re-used after 25‚Äì50 years, allowing for sufficient decomposition of the remains. Since then, however, historic buildings have been demolished to make room for new burials. Because of the number of weekly interments made at the potter's field at the expense of taxpayers, these mass burials are straightforward and are conducted by Rikers Island inmates, who stack the coffins in two rows, three high and 25 across, and each plot is marked with a concrete marker. A tall, white peace monument was erected by New York City prison inmates at the top of a hill that was known as \\"Cemetery Hill\\" following World War II and was dedicated in October 1948. Disease victims' burials Hart Island has also been used for burials of disease victims during epidemics and pandemics. During the 1980s AIDS epidemic, those who had died from AIDS were the only people to be buried in separate graves. The first AIDS victims' bodies were delivered in body bags and buried by inmate workers wearing protective jumpsuits. When it was later discovered that the corpses could not spread HIV, the city started burying AIDS victims in the mass graves. In 2008, the island was selected as a site for mass burials during a particularly extreme flu pandemic, available for up to 20,000 bodies. COVID-19 burials on Hart Island During the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, Hart Island was designated as the temporary burial site for victims of COVID-19 if deaths overwhelmed the capacity of mortuaries; this option was chosen in lieu of using city parks for such a purpose. Deaths at home within the city had increased significantly, though the corpses were not tested for COVID-19. Preparations for mass graves began at the end of March 2020. Early the next month, Reuters reported that private contractors were hired to replace inmate labor for mass grave burials. Although several media sources reported that burials had begun, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio clarified that Hart Island was only being used to bury unclaimed corpses, as well as the bodies of those who chose it as a burial place. = Records = Many burial records were destroyed by arson in late July 1977. Remaining records of burials before 1977 were transferred to the Municipal Archives in Manhattan; while records after that date are still kept in handwritten ledgers, these are now transcribed into a digital database that is partially available online. A Freedom of Information Act (FOI) request for 50,000 burial records was granted to the Hart Island Project in 2008. A lawsuit, concerning \\"place of death\\" information redacted from the Hart Island burial records, was filed against New York City's government in July 2008 and was settled out of court in January 2009. = Notable people buried = Those interred on Hart Island are not necessarily homeless or indigent. Many of the dead either had families who could not afford the expenses of private funerals or were not claimed by relatives within a month of death. Notable burials include the playwright, film screenwriter, and director Leo Birinski, who died alone and in poverty, and was buried there in 1951. The American novelist Dawn Powell was buried on Hart Island in 1970, five years after her death, after her remains had been used for medical studies and the executor of her estate refused to reclaim them. Academy Award winner Bobby Driscoll, who was found dead in 1968 in an East Village tenement, was buried on Hart Island because his remains could not be identified in a timely fashion. T-Bone Slim, the labor activist, songwriter, and Wobbly, was buried on Hart Island after his body was found floating in the Hudson River. Public engagement =Hart Island Project= Founded by New York artist Melinda Hunt in 1994, the Hart Island Project is a nonprofit organization devoted to improving access to the island and its burial data. The organization helps families obtain copies of public burial records; arranges visits to grave sites; and operates a website to help people find relatives interred on the island. Historian Thomas Laqueur writes: Since 2009, the city has given burial records for the island to the Hart Island Project. In turn, the organization maintains an online database of burial records from 1980 onward. The project has led to reforms of access to Hart Island such as opening the island monthly to everyone and legislation that requires the Department of Correction to publish burial records online. The Hart Island Project has digitally mapped grave trenches using Global Positioning System (GPS) data. In 2014, an interactive map with GPS burial data and storytelling software \\"clocks of anonymity\\" was released as the \\"Traveling Cloud Museum\\", which collects publicly submitted stories of those who are listed in the burial records. Traveling Cloud Museum was updated in 2018 to include a map created with GeoTIFF images collected by a drone. The map displays nearly 69,000 intact burials and allows people who knew the deceased to add stories, photographs, epitaphs, songs and videos linked to a personal profile, as well as identify AIDS victims. In 2012, Westchester Community College hosted an art exhibition of people whose graves were located through the Hart Island Project with Hunt's help. The Hart Island Project also collaborated with British landscape architects Ann Sharrock and Ian Fisher to present a landscape strategy to the New York City Council and the Parks Department. Sharrock introduced the concept that Hart Island is a natural burial facility and outlined a growing interest in green burials in urban settings. = Legislation = On October 28, 2011, the New York City Council Committee on Fire and Criminal Justice held a hearing titled \\"Oversight: Examining the Operation of Potter's Field by the N.Y.C., Department of Correction on Hart Island\\". Legislation passed in 2013 requires the Department of Correction to make two sets of documents available on the Internet: a database of burials and a visitation policy.In April 2013, the Department of Correction published an online database of burials on the island. The database contains data about all persons buried on the island since 1977 and is composed of 66,000 entries.  Transfer to Parks Department  A bill to transfer jurisdiction to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation was introduced on April 30, 2012. The Hart Island Project testified in favor of this bill on September 27, 2012, but the bill was not passed. The bill was reintroduced in March 2014, and Bill 0134 had a public hearing on January 20, 2016. The bill ultimately failed because neither the Parks Department nor the Department of Correction supported the move. The Parks Department stated that the operation of an active cemetery was outside its purview while the Department of Correction preferred that another city agency take control of Hart Island. In 2018, City Council member Ydanis Rodr√≠guez and three colleagues re-introduced the bill a second time. In supporting the bill, Rodriguez stated that he wanted relatives of Hart Island's deceased to be able to access their loved ones' graves. The bill was passed in the New York City Council in November 2019, with most council members voting in favor of transferring jurisdiction to the Parks Department. The following month, mayor Bill de Blasio signed the legislation, as well as three other bills, including one that would allow the ferry service to be operated by the New York City Department of Transportation. Access Hart Island ferry pier The only access to Hart Island is by ferryboat. Hart Island and the pier on Fordham Street on City Island are restricted areas under the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Correction. Family members who wish to visit the island must request a visit ahead of time with the Department of Correction. The city government allows family members to visit the island and leave mementos at grave sites, and maintains an online and telephone system for family members to schedule grave site visits. Other members of the public are permitted to visit by prior appointment only. The city formerly operated a 24/7 ferry service between City and Hart Islands, which ran every forty-five minutes during the day and less frequently at night. The ferries also transported corpses. By the 1960s, two ferryboats were used for the Hart Island ferry service; the Michael Cosgrove (built 1961) and the Fordham (in service 1922‚Äì1982). The service was extremely expensive to operate; in 1967, about 1,500 people per month used the service and the city spent $300,000 per year to keep it running. By 1977, the city had discontinued frequent ferry service and provided seven trips a day. The Department of Correction offered one guided tour of the island in 2000. Following the signing of a bill in 2019, the ferry was to be operated at a higher frequency by the New York City Department of Transportation. The process of visiting the island has been improved due to efforts by the Hart Island Project and the New York Civil Liberties Union. An ecumenical group named the Interfaith Friends of Potter's Field and another organization called Picture the Homeless has also advocated for making the island more accessible. In July 2015, the Department of Correction instituted a new policy, wherein up to five family members and their guests were allowed to visit grave sites on one weekend per month. The first visit took place on July 19, 2015. Visits to individual graves, which take place twice a month, are restricted to individuals who had a close relationship with the deceased. Visits to Hart Island's gazebo, which occur once a month, are available to the general public. The ferry leaves from a restricted dock on City Island. In 2017, the city government increased the maximum number of visitors per month from 50 to 70. The Department of Correction has opposed further loosening of restrictions on accessing Hart Island; a The New York Times article quoted a Corrections official as saying: \\"As long as D.O.C. runs the facility, we are going to run it with the D.O.C. mentality\\".

The British pronunciation is either or , and the American is . Devanagari: ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á, ), sometimes spoken as namaskar and namaskaram, is a customary, non-contact form of Hindu greeting. In the contemporary era, it is found on the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and among the Indian diaspora worldwide. The gesture (but not the term namaste for it) is widely used in the parts of Southeast Asia where Indian religions are strong. It is used as a greeting.Sanskrit English Disctionary University of Koeln, GermanyConstance Jones and James D. Ryan, Encyclopedia of Hinduism, , p. 302 Namaste is usually spoken with a slight bow and hands pressed together, palms touching and fingers pointing upwards, thumbs close to the chest. This gesture is called a√±jali mudrƒÅ; the standing posture incorporating it is pranamasana..  Etymology, meaning and origins  Namaste (Namas + te) is derived from Sanskrit and is a combination of the word namas and the second person dative pronoun in its enclitic form, te.Thomas Burrow, The Sanskrit Language, pp. 263‚Äì268 The word nama·∏• takes the sandhi form namas before the sound te.Thomas Burrow, The Sanskrit Language, pp. 100‚Äì102Namah Sanskrit Dictionary The term namas is made of 2 words na meaning ‚Äúnot‚Äù and mamah meaning ‚Äúi‚Äù or mine. It is therefore ‚Äúnot I‚Äù. This implies being open to the person being greeted and sometimes when ‚Äúnamaste‚Äù is said to God it refers to bowing or adoration. The subtle difference between bowing and openness is important. When greeting a peer or a stranger, ‚Äúnot I‚Äù accords respect to the other while maintaining self respect for oneself. When addressing God, ‚Äúnot I‚Äù can be interpreted as bowing. However, it is important to understand the distinction: ‚Äúnot I‚Äù is not bowing but according respect to the person being greeted. It is found in the Vedic literature. Namas-krita and related terms appear in the Hindu scripture Rigveda such as in the Vivaha Sukta, verse 10.85.22\\"‡§â‡§¶‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§µ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•á‡§≥‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§π‡•á ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡•§ ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§´‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∏‡•É‡§ú ‡••‡•®‡•®‡••, Griffith translates it as, \\"Rise up from hence, Visvavasu, with reverence we worship thee.

Resident of Okhaldhunga District making a Namaste gesture In the contemporary era, nama·∏• means 'bow', 'obeisance', 'reverential salutation' or 'adoration'. and te means 'to you' (singular dative case of 'tvam'). Therefore, namaste literally means \\"bowing to you\\".Namaste Douglas Harper, Etymology Dictionary In Hinduism, it also has a spiritual import reflecting the belief that \\"the divine and self (atman, soul) is same in you and me\\", and connotes \\"I bow to the divine in you\\".Ying, Y. W., Coombs, M., & Lee, P. A. (1999), \\"Family intergenerational relationship of Asian American adolescents\\", Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 5(4), pp. 350‚Äì363Lawrence, J. D. (2007), \\"The Boundaries of Faith: A Journey in India\\", Homily Service, 41(2), pp. 1‚Äì3 According to sociologist Holly Oxhandler, it is a Hindu term which means \\"the sacred in me recognizes the sacred in you\\". In modern usage, though, namaste simply means \\"hello\\". A less common variant is used in the case of three or more people being addressed namely Namo va·∏• which is a combination of nama·∏• and the enclitic second person plural pronoun va·∏•. The word nama·∏• takes the sandhi form namo before the sound v. An even less common variant is used in the case of two people being addressed, namely, Namo vƒÅm, which is a combination of nama·∏• and the enclitic second person dual pronoun vƒÅm. In contemporary practice, namaste is rarely spoken, as it is extremely formal and other greetings are generally more suitable depending on context. Some people feel that Namaste has been misappropriated as a general greeting or slogan in the West, particularly in yoga-as-fitness classes. Representations Excavations for Indus Valley Civilization have revealed many male and female terracotta figures in namaste posture.Sharma & Sharma (2004), Panorama of Harappan Civilization, , Kaveri Books, p. 129\\"Origins of Hinduism\\" . Hinduism Today, Volume 7, Issue 2 (April/May/June), Chapter 1, p. 3 These archaeological findings are dated to be between 3000 BCE to 2000 BCE.Seated Male in Namaskar pose National Museum, New Delhi, India (2012)S Kalyanaraman, Indus Script Cipher: Hieroglyphs of Indian Linguistic Area, , pp. 234‚Äì236  A√±jali MudrƒÅ  Statue with hands in the most common Anjali Mudra position A Japanese statue of Bodhisattva Seishi, doing A√±jali MudrƒÅ A√±jali MudrƒÅ (), the salutation seal, is a hand gesture associated with Indian religions, practiced throughout Southeast Asia. It is used as a sign of respect and a greeting in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Indonesia, also used among East Asian Buddhists, Taoists and Shintoists and amongst yoga practitioners and adherents of similar traditions. The gesture is incorporated into many yoga asanas, and is used for worship in many Eastern religions. The modern yoga pose pra·πáƒÅmƒÅsana () consists of standing with the hands in a√±jali mudrƒÅ. =Etymology= Anjali is Sanskrit for \\"divine offering\\", \\"a gesture of reverence\\", \\"benediction\\", \\"salutation\\", and is derived from anj, meaning \\"to honour or celebrate\\". Mudra means \\"seal\\" or \\"sign\\". The meaning of the phrase is thus \\"salutation seal\\". The gesture is also known as hrdayanjali mudra meaning \\"reverence to the heart seal\\" (from hrd, meaning \\"heart\\") and atmanjali mudra meaning \\"reverence to the self seal\\" (from atman, meaning \\"self\\"). =Description= A sadhu performing Anjali Mudra at his crown chakra in front of a sculptured figure in the same posture Anjali mudra is performed by pressing the palms of the hands together. The fingers are together with fingertips pointing up. The hands are pressed together firmly and evenly. In the most common form of anjali mudra, the hands are held at the heart chakra with thumbs resting lightly against the sternum. The gesture may also be performed at the ajna or brow chakra with thumb tips resting against the \\"third eye\\" or at the crown chakra (above the head). In some yoga postures, the hands are placed in anjali mudra position to one side of the body or behind the back. Anjali mudra is normally accompanied by a slight bowing of the head. =Symbolic meaning= Anjali mudra has the same meaning as the Sanskrit greeting Namaste and can be performed while saying Namaste or Pranam, or in place of vocalizing the word. The gesture is used for both greetings and farewells, but carries a deeper significance than a simple \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\". The joining together of the palms is said to provide connection between the right and left hemispheres of the brain and represents unification. This yoking is symbolic of the practitioner's connection with the divine in all things. Hence, anjali mudra honours both the self and the other. =Physical benefits= Anjali mudra is performed as part of a physical yoga practice with an aim to achieving several benefits. It is a \\"centering pose\\" which, according to practitioners, helps to alleviate mental stress and anxiety and is therefore used to assist the practitioner in achieving focus and coming into a meditative state. The physical execution of the pose helps to promote flexibility in the hands, wrists, fingers and arms. =Use in full- body asanas= While anjali mudra may be performed by itself from any seated or standing posture, the gesture is also incorporated into physical yoga practice as part of many full-body asanas, including: * Anjaneyasana (lunge) ‚Äì with arms overhead * Hanumanasana (monkey pose) * Malasana (garland pose) * Matsyasana (fish pose) ‚Äì an advanced variant * Prasarita Padottanasana (wide- legged forward bend) ‚Äì an advanced variant with hands behind the back * Rajakapotasana (Pigeon Pose/King Pigeon Pose) ‚Äì anjali mudra in Pigeon pose * Tadasana/samasthiti (mountain pose) ‚Äì a variant of the pose used during sun salutation sequences *Utkatasana (chair pose, literally \\"fierce pose\\"), arms overhead * Urdhva Hastasana (upward salute/extended mountain pose) ‚Äì arms overhead * Virabhadrasana I (warrior I) ‚Äì arms overhead * Vrikshasana (tree pose) Use The gesture is widely used throughout the Indian subcontinent, parts of Asia and beyond where people of South and Southeast Asian origins have migrated. Namaste or namaskar is used as a respectful form of greeting, acknowledging and welcoming a relative, guest or stranger. In some contexts, Namaste is used by one person to express gratitude for assistance offered or given, and to thank the other person for his or her generous kindness.Joseph Shaules (2007), Deep Culture: The Hidden Challenges of Global Living, , pp. 68‚Äì70 Namaskar is also part of the 16 upacharas used inside temples or any place of formal Puja (worship). Namaste in the context of deity worship, scholars conclude,James Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 2, , 720 pp. has the same function as in greeting a guest or anyone else. It expresses politeness, courtesy, honor, and hospitality from one person to the other. It is used in goodbyes as well. This is sometimes expressed, in ancient Hindu scriptures such as Taittiriya Upanishad, as Atithi Devo Bhava (literally, treat the guest like a god).Kelkar (2010), , Services Marketing Quarterly, 31(4), 420‚Äì433Roberto De Nobili, Preaching Wisdom to the Wise: Three Treatises, , p. 132 Namaste is one of the six forms of pranama, and in parts of India these terms are used synonymously.R.R. Mehrotra (1995), How to be polite in Indian English, International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Volume 116, Issue 1, pp. 99‚Äì110G. Chatterjee (2003), Sacred Hindu Symbols, , pp. 47‚Äì49 Since Namaste is a non-contact form of greeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested using the gesture as an alternative to hand shaking during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic as a means to prevent the spread of the virus.

Its most dominant constructions are a 324-metre guyed radio mast and two 210 metre guyed steel tube masts. The 324-metre-high mast is a grounded construction with triangular cross section. Until the early 1990s it had a highly effective fading-reducing transmitting antenna in the form of a special cage aerial developed in Russia, known as the ARRT-antenna. It was used for the 1000 kW- medium wave transmitter operated on 783 kHz, which was the strongest transmitter of the former GDR, as transmitting antenna. Today this mast has a cage aerial for long wave. Both the 210-metre-high tube masts are isolated from the ground. One of the two tube masts can be used as a toe-fed mast antenna for long and medium wave, while the other mast can be used only as a transmitting antenna for the medium-wave band. As further antenna systems there are still three step-radiating antennas, each of which is supported by two freestanding steel framework towers and which served as transmitting antenna for a medium-wave transmitter on the frequency 1575 kHz (shut down at present) and a triangle plane aerial for medium wave. From 1967 to 1976 there was also another radio mast for long wave, the steel tube lattice mast SL3, which was used for transmitting the program of Radio Wolga. In order not to affect the radiation field of the other masts, this radio mast was placed at a distance of 2.2 kilometres from the other masts near the road from Burg to Grabow, in the neighbourhood of G√ºtter, part of Burg. It collapsed on February 18, 1976, because of a defective bolt and was not rebuilt. As a replacement, one of the two steel tube masts was converted in such a way that it could also broadcast the program of Radio Wolga (and later also of Radioropa Info) in the long-wave range. There are still some remains of the basements of the radio mast SL3 today. In the 1960s some propaganda transmitters, as German military transmitters, were operated on the site of the AM transmitter Burg.

Sometimes nicknamed \\"Raymond-la-science\\" (\\"Raymond-the-Science\\", previously the nickname of Belgian anarchist and Bonnot gang member Raymond Callemin), \\"le sorcier\\" (\\"the Wizard\\") or \\"le magicien\\" (\\"the Magician\\"), Goethals was known for his blunt way of speaking, his habit of mispronouncing players' names and his distinctive Brussels accent. A chain smoker, he was likened to TV police detective Lieutenant Columbo. He was the father of the referee Guy Goethals, who officiated at the 1996 European Championship. Playing career and early coaching career Goethals began his career as a goalkeeper in the 1930s with Daring Brussels, making his way through the youth ranks of the club before joining Racing Club Brussel in 1947. He remained at Racing Club Brussel until 1948. After a period spent playing for Renaisi√®nne, he moved into coaching with Hannutois and Waremme, and led Sint-Truiden to second place in the Belgian First Division in 1966. =Belgium national coach= Goethals took charge of the Belgian national side in 1968. Belgium would succeed in qualifying for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, although they were eliminated in the first round of the tournament. Belgium hosted the 1972 European Championship, having knocked out holders Italy in the qualifying stages, and defeated Hungary in the match for third place after losing in the semi-final to eventual tournament winners Germany. That marked Goethals' greatest success as national team coach. He also took great pride in the fact that Belgium had held the emergent Dutch national team scoreless in both their meetings in 1974 World Cup qualifying. Belgium completed their qualifying campaign without having conceded a single goal, but lost out to the Netherlands on account of their inferior goal difference. =Return to club coaching= In 1976 Goethals' tenure as coach of the national side ended, and he joined Anderlecht as coach. In his first season, Anderlecht reached the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup, where they lost to German side Hamburger SV, but won the trophy the following year with a comprehensive victory over FK Austria/WAC. After spells coaching in France at Bordeaux and in Brazil with S√£o Paulo, Goethals returned to Belgium to coach Standard Li√®ge. Standard Li√®ge were Belgian champions in 1982 and 1983, and they reached the Cup Winners' Cup Final in 1982, losing to Barcelona, who were at a considerable advantage in that the final was played at their home ground, Camp Nou. =Controversy and Goethals' return to Anderlecht= Standard Li√®ge's 1982 championship win was to become the subject of great controversy in 1984. Seemingly preoccupied with winning his first Belgian title, Goethals had suggested and initiated the bribing of the Waterschei players prior to the teams' meeting in the final match of the season, in order to secure championship honours for Standard Li√®ge and ensure that none of his players would miss their European final against Barcelona through injury. Goethals was forced to resign in the wake of the scandal, and he moved to Portugal to take charge of Vit√≥ria Guimar√£es. He then returned to Belgium to coach Racing Jet de Bruxelles before a second spell in charge of Anderlecht, where he won Belgian Cup trophy in 1989. Bordeaux again recruited Goethals, and they finished runners-up in the French championship in 1989‚Äì90 behind Marseille. Approaching 70 years of age, Goethals' greatest triumph as a coach was yet to come. =Olympique de Marseille= In 1990, Goethals was named coach of Marseille and was entrusted with the task of leading the club to European Cup success. In his first season, the club narrowly missed out on European glory, losing on penalties in the European Cup Final to Red Star Belgrade. There was recognition for Goethals' coaching abilities, as he was voted 1991 European Coach of the Year. In 1993, Marseille again reached the European Cup final, where they defeated favourites A.C. Milan with a headed goal by Basile Boli. Having achieved his primary objective at Marseille, Goethals left the club. Marseille were later stripped of their 1993 French championship when it emerged that three Valenciennes players had been offered money to underperform in a crucial match against Marseille. The club were not allowed to defend their European title as a result, and were punished with relegation to the French second division. Retirement Goethals' coaching career ended at Anderlecht in season 1995‚Äì96, but he remained in demand as a television analyst for his insights into football. He died of bowel cancer aged 83. In 2005, the year following his death, he was voted 38th in De Grootste Belg, a Flemish television programme based on the BBC's 100 Greatest Britons. The number 2 stand at F.C. Brussels' home ground, Edmond Machtens Stadium, was renamed in honour of Goethals in late 2005. He remains today as the oldest winning manager of UEFA Champions League.

Included in the merger was the legacy of the East India Marine Society, established in 1799 by a group of Salem-based captains and supercargoes. Members of the Society were required by the society's charter to collect \\"natural and artificial curiosities\\" from beyond the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn. They were also required to personally circumnavigate the globe, and share navigational discoveries with other Society members, thereby increasing their chances of returning from their voyages safely. Due to the institution's age, the items they donated to the collections are significant for their rare combination of age and provenance. The East India Marine Society built East India Marine Hall, a National Historic Landmark now embedded in the museum's facilities, in the 1820s to house its collection. This collection was acquired by the Peabody Academy of Science (later renamed the Peabody Museum of Salem) in 1867, along with the building, which continued to serve as a museum space through these mergers and acquisitions. George Peabody, benefactor =2000s‚Äì2010s= The East India Marine Hall is one of the oldest parts of the museum, built in 1825.

At this time, the museum also opened to the public the Yin Yu Tang House, an early 19th-century Chinese house from Anhui Province that had been disassembled in its original village and reconstructed in Salem. In 2011, the Peabody Essex Museum announced it had raised $550 million, with plans to raise an additional $100 million by 2016.Peabody Essex announces $650 million campaign, WickedLocal.com, November 14, 2011 The Boston Globe reported this was the largest capital campaign in the museum's history, vaulting the Peabody Essex into the top tier of major art museums.Peabody Essex vaults into top tier by raising $550 million , Boston Globe, November 6, 2011.

It allows remote access from a remote client to a computer hosting an X Window session and the x11vnc software, continuously polling the X server's frame buffer for changes. This allows the user to control their X11 desktop (KDE, GNOME, Xfce, etc.) from a remote computer either on the user's own network, or from over the Internet as if the user were sitting in front of it. x11vnc can also poll non-X11 frame buffer devices, such as webcams or TV tuner cards, iPAQ, Neuros OSD, the Linux console, and the Mac OS X graphics display. x11vnc is part of the LibVNCServer project and is free software available under the GNU General Public License. x11vnc was written by Karl Runge. x11vnc does not create an extra display (or X desktop) for remote control. Instead, it uses the existing X11 display shown on the monitor of a Unix-like computer in real time, unlike other Linux alternatives such as TightVNC Server. However, it is possible to use Xvnc or Xvfb to create a 'virtual' extra display, and have x11vnc connect to it, enabling X-11 access to headless servers.See manpages for x11vnc, Xvnc, and the Xvfb article. x11vnc has security features that allows the user to set an access password or to use Unix usernames and passwords. It also has options for connection via a secure SSL link. An SSL Java VNC viewer applet is provided that enables secure connections from a web browser. The VeNCrypt SSL/TLS VNC security type is also supported. Many of the UltraVNC extensions to VNC are supported by x11vnc, including file transfer.  Polling algorithm  x11vnc keeps a copy of the X server's frame buffer in RAM. The X11 programming interface \`XShmGetImage\` is used to retrieve the frame buffer pixel data. x11vnc compares the X server's frame buffer against its copy to see which pixel regions have changed (and hence need to be sent to the VNC viewers.) Reading pixel data from the physical frame buffer can be much slower than writing to it (because graphics devices are not optimized for reading) and so a sequential pixel by pixel check would often be too slow. To improve the situation, x11vnc reads in full rows of pixels separated by 32 pixels vertically. Once it gets to the bottom of the screen it starts again near the top with a slightly different offset. After 32 passes like this it has covered the entire screen. This method enables x11vnc to detect changes on the screen roughly 32 times more quickly than a sequential check would (unless the changes are very small, say only 1 pixel tall.) If the X11 DAMAGE extension is present, x11vnc uses it to provide hints where to focus its polling, thereby finding changes even more quickly and also lowering the system load.  Input injection  When x11vnc receives user input events (keystrokes, pointer motion, and pointer button clicks) from a VNC viewer, it must inject them synthetically into the X server. The X11 programming interfaces \`XTestFakeKeyEvent\`, \`XTestFakeMotionEvent\`, and \`XTestFakeButtonEvent\` of the XTEST extension are used to achieve this. For non-X11 managed devices (such as the Mac OS X graphics display) different programming interfaces must be used. x11vnc also provides an interface where the user can supply their own input injection program.  Interesting uses  Often special-purpose systems are built using the X Window System to manage the graphical display. x11vnc can be used to export the system's display for remote VNC access. This enables remote monitoring, control, and troubleshooting of the special-purpose system. Sometimes this saves sending a technician to a remote site or allows users to control equipment from their workstation or laptop. x11vnc is known to have been run on the following types of systems: Electron microscope, MRI and Radiology image analysis system, Power plant and Oil platform management consoles, Materials distribution control, Ship self-defense system testing, NMR systems, Silicon wafer analysis microscope, and Theater and concert lighting control. x11vnc is used to export the X11 displays in embedded systems such as Linux-based PDAs and Home theater PCs. If x11vnc cannot be run on the special-purpose system, sometimes it can be run on a nearby computer and poll the X server frame buffer over the network. This is how proprietary X terminal devices can be accessed via x11vnc.  Xvnc emulation  Although x11vnc's primary use is for X servers associated with physical graphics hardware, it can also attach to virtual X servers (whose frame buffers exist in RAM only) such as Xvfb or a Sun Ray session. x11vnc has options (\`-create\` and \`-svc\`) to start Xvfb automatically, possibly as the Unix user that logged in. The interactive response of x11vnc and Xvfb may not be as fast as Xvnc, however this mode enables features that Xvnc does not have, such as SSL encryption and Unix usernames and passwords.  Client-side caching  The RFB (VNC) protocol is odd when compared to other network graphics protocols, such as X11 and RDP, in that there is no provision for viewer-side caching of pixel data. While this makes the client easier to implement, there is a price to pay in terms of interactive response. For example, every re-exposure of a window or background region needs to have its (compressed) pixel data resent over the network. This effect is particularly noticeable for windows with complex or photo regions (such as a web browser window) that gets iconified and deiconified or re-exposed often. x11vnc has an experimental and somewhat brute-force implementation of client-side caching. It is enabled via the \`-ncache\` option. When creating the RFB frame buffer in this mode, x11vnc allocates a very large scratch region below the top portion used for the actual (on-screen) pixel data. x11vnc can then use the RFB CopyRect command to instruct the viewer to move rectangles of pixel data into and out of the scratch region. These moves are done locally on the viewer side. In this way x11vnc can manage the scratch region to store and retrieve pixel data without having to resend it over the network. x11vnc's client-side caching mode can give noticeable interactive response improvements for many activities. SSVNC 1.0.29 connected to a remote Debian 7 Linux Xsession Since it uses the existing RFB CopyRect command, the scheme will work with any (i.e. unmodified) VNC viewer. There are some disadvantages, however. The first is that it consumes a large amount of memory. For good performance a scratch region 10 to 20 times larger than the actual screen should be used. So instead using 5 MB for a 1280x1024 truecolor frame buffer, closer to 100 MB will be used (on both the VNC client and server sides.) This is not so much of an issue on modern computers, but would not be possible on a low memory device. Second, the VNC viewer may treat the scratch region in ways that confuse the user, for example displaying it to the user or automatically panning down into it if the mouse reaches the bottom of the real screen. The Unix VNC viewer in SSVNC automatically hides the scratch region. Finally, x11vnc's heuristics for caching and reusing window pixel data are not perfect and can lead to unexpected flashing of a window's contents and other undesired effects.

Brooks and illustrated by Kurt Wiese, consisting of 25 novels and one poetry collection. The books focus on the adventures of a group of animals living on a farm in rural upstate New York. Freddy is introduced as \\"the smallest and cleverest\\" of the pigs on the Bean farm. He is initially just one of the ensemble, but he becomes the central character shortly into the series. Freddy's interests drive the books as he becomes a detective, politician, newspaper editor, magician, pilot, and other vocations or avocations. A recurring villain is the slimy but dignified Simon, who leads a gang of criminal rats. Human characters include Mr. and Mrs. Bean (who own the farm), the population of local Centerboro, and human villains. Much of the humor in the books is derived from the self-referential way in which the author acknowledges the unreality of talking animals, unlike other children's works in which they are accepted as normal. As the series progresses, the Bean Farm animals attain national fame for their ability to talk and read, and the humans whom they encounter are taken aback at first (though only momentarily) to find themselves conversing with animals. The animals and humans do not age, although the stories reflect the social conditions at the time of writing; for example, the books published during World War II feature scrap drives and victory gardens. History Brooks created his animals for To and Again, published in 1927 by Alfred A. Knopf. It took some time before their personalities were fully developed, along with their ability to talk to humans when they chose, beginning with the fourth volume in 1936. In the remainder of the series, the animals of the Bean Farm lead a highly developed life, variously operating a bank, a newspaper, the First Animal Republic, and Freddy's detective business, which follows the principles of Sherlock Holmes as Freddy knows them from his reading. The books went out of print in the 1960s, despite their popularity in the 1940s and 1950s, but children's libraries continued to have them. In the past decade, they have been republished by The Overlook Press in response to plaintive requests from Freddy fans who treasure their combination of ingenious plots, well-drawn characters, literary allusions, and wholesome (but not cloying) moral lessons. The audio and film rights to the series have been sold.http://www.overlookpress.com/freddy-the-pig/freddy-the-pied-piper.html Audio versions of some books were made and, as of 2009, others are apparently in preparation. Reception of books Adam Hochschild describes the series in The New York Times Book Review as \\"the moral center of my childhood universe.\\" He also observes that sales of the books have increased since when they were first written. Roger Sale sums it up in his history of children's literature: \\"If L. Frank Baum has a successor, it is Brooks.\\"\\"Two Pigs\\", in Roger Sale, Fairy Tales and After: from Snow White to E.B. White\\", Harvard Univ. Press, 1978, p. 245. . Columnist Nicholas Kristof named them among the best children's books ever and called them \\"funny, beautifully written gems.\\"The Best Kids‚Äô Books Ever Location of books Nearly all the books focus on the Bean farm and Centerboro area, in Oneida County, upstate New York. Centerboro does not actually exist, nor do the other towns mentioned as being nearest (Aeschylus Center, Gomorrah Falls, South Pharisee, Plutarch Mills, and West Ninevah). However, other towns do exist, described as slightly farther away: Syracuse, Rome, Buffalo, and Utica, New York (mentioned, for example, in Freddy and the Baseball Team From Mars). This would put Centerboro somewhere east of Syracuse, close to where Brooks lived as a boy. However, in Freddy and Mr. Camphor, the nearby fictional lake Otesaraga is described as \\"thirty miles around, and only a mile across\\". This corresponds closely (and only) to Skaneateles Lake, some ten miles southwest of Syracuse. Regardless, the evidence supplied by Brooks points to the Bean farm being loosely within 30 miles southwest or generally east of Syracuse. Illustrations The series is illustrated by Kurt Wiese, who became an award-winning illustrator and author (although not for the Freddy series). The first book was originally illustrated by Adolfo Best Maugard but redone by Wiese when the book was re- released. After the first books, the pattern of illustration was established: a half-page black and white drawing at the beginning of each chapter, and a full page black-and-white drawing within each chapter. The covers are line drawings colored with watercolor, each emphasizing a dominant color. The endpapers are two-tone illustrations, loosely matching the cover's color theme. For example, the yellow background and blue drawing of the endpapers for Freddy Rides Again match the yellow and blue colors of the cover (Freddy, a horse, and a goat are yellow). Wiese drew more than 900 illustrations for the series. Freddy books in order of publication These are all 26 titles in the Freddy the Pig series.

It is located at the intersection of Mills County Road 433 and San Saba County Road 137, both gravel roads, near a small community called Regency. The bridge straddles the Colorado River between Mills and San Saba counties. History The main span is 343 feet long, but counting the approach spans, engineers list the bridge‚Äôs overall length at 403 feet (122.8 meters). The wooden deck of the bridge is 16 feet across. It was built in 1939, with most of the work being done by hand. An earlier bridge constructed in 1903 collapsed under the weight of a herd of cattle, and a later bridge built in 1936 washed away in a flood. The Regency Bridge was restored by James Harris in 1997, with then-Governor Bush attending the re-dedication service. This was a major event for the community of around 25 people. Local teenagers accidentally set the wood surface on fire on December 29, 2003, burning a hole in some planks and causing $20,000 in damage. The bridge was repaired and reopened to traffic in early 2005. After closing in late 2014, the bridge is once again open to traffic. As of Sept 2020 the bridge is closed to automobile traffic due to \\"recent structural damage\\", but you can still walk across it. It is expected to reopen once the damage is determined/repaired. {{cite weburl=https://www.goldthwaiteeagle.com/2020/09/22/regency-bridge-closed/ In 2005, the Regency Bridge became the last suspension bridge in Texas open to automobile traffic. Commemoration A nearby historical marker, located on the southeast side of the intersection of FM 574 and Mills County Road 433 (which is just east of the intersection of FM 45 and FM 574) reads: This area's first Colorado River bridge was at Regency, on Mills-San Saba County line. Built 1903, it served ranchers and farmers for going to market, but fell in 1924, killing a boy, a horse, and some cattle. Its successor was demolished by a 1936 flood. With 90 per cent of the work done by hand labor, the Regency Suspension Bridge was erected in 1939. It became the pride of the locality, and youths gathered there in the 1940s to picnic, dance, and sing. Bypassed by paved farm roads, it now (1976) survives as one of the last suspension bridges in Texas. In popular culture *The bridge is included in the opening credits for Texas Country Reporter. *In 2005, Alton and Sue Watson founded the There's Something In The Water Songwriter Festival featuring musicians and songwriters from Texas, Oklahoma, and other regions. The annual festival was held for 12 years on the third weekend in April at an old campground located on the Mills County side of the river. *World Without Waves was filmed in the area and featured the Regency bridge in several scenes.

The serekh was the earliest convention used to set apart the royal name in ancient Egyptian iconography, predating the later and better known cartouche by four dynasties and five to seven hundred years. Appearance A serekh was an ornamental vignette combining a view of a palace fa√ßade and a plan (top view) of the royal courtyard. The term serekh derives from the Egyptian word for \\"facade\\". Different serekhs on different types of object display countless variations of the fa√ßade decor in its complexity and detail. It seems that no strict artistic rules for the design of the serekh itself existed.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der √§gyptischen K√∂nigsnamen. M√ºnchner √Ñgyptologische Studien. Bd. 49. Philipp von Zabern, Mainz 1999, , p. 7-9.Rolf Gundlach: Horus in the Palace: The centre of State and Culture in pharaonic Egypt. In: Rolf Gundlach, John H. Taylor: Egyptian royal Residences: 4.

Routledge, London 1999, , p. 56-57, 201‚Äì202. History The serekh first appears as an ornamental miniature during the late Gerzeh culture, when it was used as a royal crest only. From the Old Kingdom period onward, the first uses of the full written word appear in old papyri. Serekhs bearing the rebus symbols n'r (catfish) and mr (chisel) inside, being the phonetic representation of king Narmer's name, circa 3100 BC.Wengrow, David, The Archaeology of Ancient Egypt Cambridge University Press, p.207 A serekh was normally used as a royal crest, accentuating and honouring the name of the pharaoh. Its use can be dated back as early as the Gerzeh culture (c. 3400 BC.). The hieroglyphs forming the king's name were placed inside a rectangular extension atop the serekh, which represented the royal courtyard. Additionally, the falcon of the god Horus, or in a few cases the Set animal, topped the serekh, showing the celestial patron of the named king. If the word \\"serekh\\" was written in full letters (as shown in the infobox above), sometimes accompanied by a miniature of the serekh, it could also be used in text. One of the most important elements of royal display and identity in ancient Egypt was the king's name, important as pharaohs were concerned that future generations remain aware of their reigns.Kathryn A. Bard, An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt (Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2008), p. 114. These were first seen from rulers as early as those of Dynasty 0 and continued to be used by kings throughout the history of ancient Egypt.Ian Shaw, The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt (New York: Oxford University Press Incorporated, 2000), p. 6. For example, a serekh of Senusret I, who was a king during the Twelfth Dynasty, has been found and is now displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The serekhs of kings from the 30th Dynasty can also be seen.Stephen Quirke, Who Were The Pharaohs?: A history of their names with a list of cartouches (London: British Museum Publications Limited, 1990), p. 29. The serekh represented the king's palace shown in a combination of plan and elevation. The rectangular enclosure represented the plan while the patterned area represented the elevation of the fa√ßade.Gay Robins, The Art of Ancient Egypt (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000), p. 33. A serekh incised or painted in ink on a vessel denoted that the contents were the produce and/or property of the royal court.Toby A.H. Wilkinson, Early Dynastic Egypt (New York: Routledge, 2000), p. 44. The serekh containing the king's name was used on a variety of objects and made a fundamental statement of royal ideology.Robins (2000), p. 36. The king's name was written in hieroglyphs and the Horus falcon, in reference to the sky god Horus, usually surmounted it. The Horus name is the first of five royal titles that were in use by the Fifth Dynasty. The second title is the (He of the) Two Ladies, representing the king as manifesting, and under the protection of, the goddesses Nekhbet of Elkab and Hierakonpolis in Upper Egypt, and Wadjet of Buto in Lower Egypt.Bard (2008), p. 123. The third title is the Horus of Gold, with the Horus falcon above the hieroglyphic sign for gold. The fourth title is often translated as ‚ÄúHe of the Sedge and Bee,‚Äù with the sedge plant symbolic of Upper Egypt and the bee symbolic of Lower Egypt. This is also known as nswt-b√¨ty, a title which expressed the many dualities over which the king exercised rule: Upper and Lower Egypt, the Black Land of cultivation and the Red Land of desert, the realms of day and night, and the natural and the supernatural.Wilkinson (2000), p. 200. The fifth title is Son of Ra. This name claims a direct solar origin for the king as child of the sun-god.Quirke (1990), p. 11. The Horus name was commonly written in the serekhs of ancient Egypt. There are a couple of cases in which the Horus name appears without serekhs, and only Peribsen and Khasekhemwy have serekhs without the Horus name. Horus Serekh of Pharaoh Djet, 1st Dynasty, with his name framed by the royal serekh and surmounted by the Horus falcon. This particular stela is from his tomb at Abydos and can now be found at The Art Archive/Mus√©e du Louvre Paris/Dagli Orti. This funerary stela is one of two that would have been placed on the east side of his Abydos tomb to mark the place where offerings were to be made. The width of the stela is approximately 65 centimeters, and its height approximately 143 centimeters. The king's name was written in hieroglyphs and the Horus falcon, in reference to the god Horus, usually surmounted it. As a result, the king's name in the serekh came to be known as his ‚ÄòHorus name.‚Äô The writing of the king's name within the serekh symbolized the king in his palace as the center of royal administration and power. The serekh as a whole was therefore a symbol of kingship. The presence of the Horus falcon showed that the living king was a manifestation of the god. Additionally, the Horus names of several First Dynasty kings expressed the aggressive authority of Horus, perhaps reflecting the coercive power of kingship at this early stage of Egyptian statehood. Examples of such names are ‚ÄòHorus the fighter‚Äô (Hor- Aha), ‚ÄòHorus the strong‚Äô (Djer), and ‚Äòarm-raising Horus‚Äô (Qa'a). All of these names reveal the warlike iconography of the earliest royal monuments from the period of state formation. They emphasize an authority based upon military strength and the power of life and death.Wilkinson (2000), p. 202. The emphasis in the Second Dynasty, however, began to change possibly due to the periods of instability that the kings faced, though the exact reason is still disputed. This led to a slight alteration in the structure of the serekh, solely during the reigns of Peribsen and Khasekhemwy. Since this alteration only occurred during these two reigns, it is seen as an exception, as the succeeding kings returned to the previous iconography. Progression The earliest serekhs were empty because the symbol alone relayed the necessary message of royal power. Over time, the king began to write an epithet within the serekh.Wilkinson (2000), p. 201. These serekhs were dominated by the symbol of Horus. During the Second Dynasty only, changes in the formulation of the Horus name to a Seth-name and then a Horus-and-Seth name were seen. These changes occurred merely during the Second Dynasty and are viewed as an exception to the typical use of the Horus name as is evidenced by the continued use of Horus in the serekhs of the Egyptian kings before and after Peribsen and Khasekhemwy. Many propositions have been made as to why this change occurred, though the exact reason is still disputed. Peribsen and Khasekhemwy For reasons which remain unclear, Seth attained particular prominence in the late Second Dynasty, temporarily replacing, then joining, Horus as the god atop the royal serekh.Wilkinson (2000), p. 295. When the name Peribsen, who was the penultimate king of the Second Dynasty, was written in a serekh, it was surmounted, not by the usual Horus falcon, but by the Seth animal, a hound or jackal-like creature with a wide, straight tail.Kathryn A. Bard, \\"The Emergence of the Egyptian State (c. 3200‚Äì2686 BC)\\", in The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, Ian Shaw (New York: Oxford University Press Incorporated, 2000), p. 86. Peribsen thus made a visual statement that he was the earthly embodiment of Seth. The importance of Seth in the reign of Peribsen was also reflected in a sealing of the king from Abydos. It referred to a god named ‚Äòthe golden one‚Äô or, perhaps more likely, ‚Äòhe of Nubt (Naqada)‚Äô, the usual epithet of Seth in historic times. It appears as though Seth was adopted by Peribsen as his personal deity. This is emphasized by the wording of the inscription: ‚ÄòHe of Nubt has handed over the Two Lands to his son, the dual king Peribsen‚Äô. One interpretation of this dramatic change in the format of the royal name is that it represented a rebellion of some kind that was quashed or reconciled by the last king of the dynasty, Khasekhemwy, whose name appeared in serekhs surmounted by both the Horus falcon and the Seth animal. Originally known as Khasekhem, which means ‚ÄòThe One who Arises in respect of the Power,‚Äô his name eventually came to be known as Khasekhemwy which means ‚ÄòThe One who Arises in respect of the Two Powers.‚Äô The ‚ÄòTwo Powers‚Äô have been interpreted by some as the Horus falcon and the Seth animal.Robins (2000), p. 37. The addition to Khasekhem's name is further evidence that he was trying to merge the ideas of both Horus and Seth. While the validity of this proposal is debatable, Khasekhemwy's epithet from seal impressions supports this notion. It is interpreted as ‚Äòthe Two Lords are at peace in him‚Äô which can be viewed as though he resolved some internal conflict, especially if ‚ÄòTwo Lords‚Äô are seen as referring to Horus and Seth and their followers respectively. Others have viewed this evidence as a way of proclaiming national renewal under Khasekhemwy as he was able to reunite Upper and Lower Egypt. This remains speculative, however, due to the lack of hard evidence to support this notion.Wilkinson (2000), p. 91. Nonetheless, it seems likely that foreign relations reached a new level under Khasekhemwy since a seal-impression of his reign showed the first occurrence of the title √¨m√¨-r3 h3st which means ‚Äòoverseer of foreign land(s).‚Äô It strongly suggests the imposition of Egyptian hegemony on foreign territory.Wilkinson (2000), p. 92. The change of the deity image on a serekh was significant because while the king's name sometimes appeared in a serekh without an image of a deity above, no deity other than Horus was so far known to occur on the serekh until the reign of Peribsen. Due to evidence that Peribsen's stelae were exposed to erasure of the Seth animals, it has been inferred that whatever reasons Peribsen had for substituting his falcon failed to win acceptance among future generations after Khasekhemwy.

Julius J. & Philip G. Epstein wrote one or more drafts together; Richard Brooks worked on later drafts. The film was adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story \\"Babylon Revisited\\". The Writers Guild of America (WGA) credit system for motion pictures and television programs covers all works under the jurisdiction of the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) and the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW). The WGA, originally the Screen Writers Guild, has since 1941 been the final arbiter of who receives credit for writing a theatrical, television or new media motion picture written under its jurisdiction. Though the system has been a standard since before the WGA's inception, it has seen criticism. A determination process for screen credits first sees the production company submit proposed credits; about a third of these are challenged and taken to arbitration. A complex arbitration process asks all writing parties involved to provide evidence and supporting statements to help determine how much of the final product was each writer's work. A variety of credit forms can be given, which can indicate technicalities like whether a writer contributed original material, the chronological order of contributions, and if people worked on a script together. Since its inception, writers must have contributed at least 33 percent of a final script to receive credit, and only a certain number of writers can receive credit. Rationale Writing credits impact the career of writers, as well as their reputation and union membership. Writers trade on the reputation of their name; John Howard Lawson, the first president of the Screen Writers Guild (SWG; now the Writers Guild of America, WGA), said that \\"a writer's name is his most cherished possession. It is his creative personality, the symbol of the whole body of his ideas and experience.\\" Not having their name on a film's credits will not only cost the writer residuals, but also hinder them from finding future work, depending on the film's success. A writer may also be given a bonus if their name is in the credits, as films often have many more contributing writers than the credits show. The credit system can affect eligibility for membership in the union, as one way in which a person becomes a member of the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) is by accruing \\"points\\" based on the individual's writing credit. Membership points are also accrued through employment by, or sale or option to, a company signatory to the Minimum Basic Agreement (MBA), a deal struck between the WGA and a collection of studios and production companies every three years, in which the companies agree to certain minimum fees, residuals, and other benefits for WGA writers they contract. It is negotiated by a committee of the WGA. Screen Writers Guild credit system The early industry had taken efforts to prevent writers from unionizing. Although the SWG was formed in 1933, it encountered resistance until May 1941, when it signed a deal with the studios that gave the Guild, among other rights, the final say on writing credits. The agreement was seen as weak, as it mostly covered the lowest paid writers, and credits were still unfairly given in the compulsory collaboration era when studios employed large numbers of independent writers on projects; at this point, the need for writers to have contributed 33 percent of the final script had been established, which left many out of credits on productions written by committee. The best paid writers, on the other hand, had always been respected and could often elect to work alone because of their status. Credits process All writers on a project have the right to know who else has written on that project. Under the MBA a production is required to tell all new writers who has preceded them; a writer may conversely ask the production for the names of those who contributed after them. Writers also bear responsibilities to make sure they are informed, and to inform other writers on the same project that they are working for it; they must also file their contract with the appropriate Guild within a week of receiving it. For television productions of a motion picture over 90 minutes, the production company must inform, in writing, all writers of the writers who follow them. The MBA stipulates also that the production company must supply all participant writers‚Äîanyone who has contributed, or been hired to contribute, written material; anyone who has been paid for their prior written material whether purchased or licensed; anyone who contributed in any of the aforementioned ways to the original script, in the case of a remake‚Äîand the Writers Guild a notice of tentative credits, and give all participant writers a copy of either the shooting script or latest revised script, promptly upon the conclusion of photography. Any participant writer, even deceased, has the right to be involved in the credit determination process (this may be through a representative, such as an agent). Up to three writers, or two teams of writers in film and three teams of writers in television, may receive credit for a production. The Writers Guild has the right to protest any company's proposed credits, regardless of whether the writers do. To determine credits, \\"it is vital that the writer keep copies of all work done\\", and submit copies to the Writers Guild promptly upon completion. Scripts as well as substantial story ideas and other literary material are counted for credit decisions. When there is more than one participant writer on a production, \\"all participants have the right to agree unanimously among themselves as to which of them shall receive writing credits on the screen and in what form\\", as long as the agreed form meets requirements. The MBA also establishes that the agreed form \\"shall not be suggested or directed by the [production] Company\\". The Writers Guild also officially presumes that any writer has access to all prior material written for the project during their employment, underscoring credits given to prior writers who have been removed from projects. Materials used for research are not credited, but source material as defined by the WGA receives credits. The appropriate credit to use for source material is anything indicative of the nature and relationship of the source material and the final script, with the WGA providing the examples \\"From a Play by, From a Novel by, Based upon a Story by, From a series of articles by, Based upon a [teleplay/Screenplay] by\\". Once a writer has received both the notice of tentative credits and the final script, they can either agree with the production's tentative credits, in which case they do nothing, they can discuss the credits with the other writers through the Writers Guild, or they can challenge the tentative credits within a certain time period. If a participant writer disagrees with the credits, but there are other participants and it is seen that an agreement may be reached between them, the Screen/Television Credits Administrator must make a best attempt to arrange discussion between all writers before arbitration is sought. Credit forms =Teams= Credits are handled differently for individual writers and for \\"teams\\". A team of writers is defined by the WGA as \\"two writers who have been assigned at about the same time to the same material and who work together for approximately the same length of time on the material\\"; the work of the two writers is considered a joint contribution, not creditable to only one of them or to one more than the other. For the purpose of credits (and to discourage later disputes), one of the writers must openly question the designation of their contributions being part of a team at the time the work is submitted to the Writers Guild if they wish to be credited in another way. A team is credited with an ampersand (&) separating their names. Team credits are more complex when one of the team has also been hired as an additional writer: both writers in the team must form an agreement to allow the additional writer to take the shared credit. Multiple writers who are not part of a team have the word \\"and\\" separating their names. =Written by= The \\"Written by\\" credit is for writers who can claim both the story and teleplay/screenplay elements, except when there is \\"source material of a story nature\\". There are some restrictions on producers and directors of a work being given writing credits, particularly that they cannot receive the story/screenplay/teleplay credit unless there are either no other writers for the story/screenplay/teleplay or the decision is taken to arbitration, and that the Writers Guild must have been notified of a writing team (intending to claim credits) that includes a producer/director and a non-producer/director at the commencement of the team's work together. In television, a written by credit is also usually given to writers on variety shows and audience participation shows. =Screenplay by= A \\"Screenplay by\\" credit may also be used, when the writers for the story and screenplay are different, or in similar circumstances to a screen story credit (either if the work is not mostly original, or in addition to the screen story credit). No more than two writers can share a screenplay credit except in cases of arbitration. From arbitration, screenplay credits can be given to either three individual writers or two teams of writers. For the purposes of arbitration, to be awarded a screenplay credit, the writer must have contributed more than 33 percent of the final screenplay. In the case of an original screenplay, Writers who did not write the original must contribute more than 50 percent to receive the credit. The WGA acknowledges the difficulty in determining such percentages. The television equivalent of the screenplay by credit is \\"Teleplay by\\", and it is used in the same way. =Story by= The MBA describes story as \\"distinct from [teleplay/screenplay] and consisting of basic narrative, idea, theme or outline indicating character development and action\\". A \\"Story by\\" credit is used when the writer was hired (as a WGA member) to write for story, when the story idea was purchased from the writer by a WGA signatory company, or when the resultant script is based on a sequel story devised by the writer under the WGA's jurisdiction. The \\"Story by\\" credit cannot be shared by more than two writers in film and three in television, and the story may have been written in different literary forms, including a film treatment. A \\"Screen Story by\\" or \\"Television Story by\\" credit is used for the screenwriter when their work is based on, but substantially different to, source material and a story as they are defined by the WGA. Screen story credit also cannot be shared by more than two writers, and is a credit that is only handled through arbitration. The writer of the source material for the screen story may receive a source material credit. =Separated rights= Television also has a \\"Created by\\" and a \\"Developed (for Television) by\\" credit under a crediting structure known as separated rights. Writers entitled to created by credits will have developed a significant part of the format, story, and teleplay, and also get sequel rights to the material. Created by credits are given on every episode, while Developed (for Television) by credits are only given on the episodes the writer has explicitly contributed material to. =Other forms= Other writing credits that may be used are \\"Narration Written by\\", \\"Based on Characters Created by\\", and \\"Adaptation by\\". A \\"Special Material by\\" credit can be given to writers on some forms of television shows, when they have contributed written material that does not qualify for other credits; there are no limits to how many people may receive this credit. Screenwriter Scott Myers, a WGA member and arbiter on \\"perhaps 10 credit arbitrations\\", has questioned why more than three writers cannot be credited, saying: =Structure and exceptions= In credits, names are usually ordered by who did the most work. If the order is disagreed upon and the arbitration finds that all writers contributed equally, the names will be ordered chronologically. A pseudonym may be used if the writer is to be paid less than (for film) or less than three times the applicable minimum in their MBA (for television), if the pseudonymous name is deemed reasonable, and if the writer requests this within five business days of the final credits being determined (for film) or within a preset time frame (for television). Before a pseudonym can be used, it must be registered with the Writers Guild. A writer may withdraw from credit \\"for personal cause\\" before the tentative notice is submitted; if the other writers do not agree, it shall be taken to arbitration. A writer cannot withdraw from credit after arbitration. Withdrawing from credit also includes losing rights to and compensation from the material; using a pseudonym does not remove these rights. Arbitration If there is no agreement on writing credits, the Writers Guild's Screen Credits Administrator (for film) or Television Credits Administrator (for television) will begin arbitration proceedings. Three members of the Writers Guild are selected as arbiters, as long as they have no interest in the decision; for film, the members must have either been a member for five years or have three screen credits, and for television, they must have been a member for at least one year and have at least three writing credits. At least two of the selected members must have been on at least two arbitration committees before and, where possible, members who are familiar with the type of writing involved will be chosen. The identity of arbiters is kept anonymous to everyone, including the other arbiters, except the Screen/Television Credits Committee. Also, before selecting the three members, the Screen/Television Arbiters List of all eligible members will be sent to all participant writers, who can preclude from selection a reasonable number of names on it; the selection will be made from the remaining names without question. A member of the Screen/Television Credits Committee will be designated to each arbitration case to advise the arbiters and help them to come to a decision. Film arbitration takes place over 21 business days, and television arbitration over eight. All participant writers and the production must also cooperate with the committees, most importantly by accurately submitting all written material (original and in triplicate) to be considered, and scrutinizing submitted material. The Writers Guild also advises all writers to submit a written statement to the arbitration committee, outlining their stance and detailing their claim to credit in line with Writers Guild policy; the statement cannot include anything irrelevant to the case, reference to compensation, letters of support from other people, or information on the development that will not help the arbiters in their purely analytical review. Participant writers have 24 hours to give their statements, their only means of providing supporting evidence to the arbiters, to the guild. Statements submitted late will be accepted as long as they come before a decision is made. The arbiters thus each receive the tentative writing credits, the writers' statements, a summary of the issues to be determined in the case, all the written material with a chronological record, a copy of the Screen/Television Credits Manual, and the request that their decision be communicated to the Screen/Television Credits Administrator first by telephone and then in writing. The writers' statements are kept private by the WGA. Additionally, the writers' identities are kept anonymous from the arbiters. In situations where there is doubt over the authenticity of the submitted written material, a hearing may be held before arbitration, where the writers each provide testimony and evidence as to the authorship, sequence, and legitimacy of the material. The Writers Guild may also request a descriptive script of a film called a \\"cutting continuity\\", or a television production called an \\"as broadcast\\" script, which the production must provide if available; particularly, a writer may ask that the Writers Guild request this if they believe the final script is not reflective of what was actually filmed. The arbiters may not come to unanimous agreement. When this happens, they teleconference with the advisor to, while remaining anonymous to each other, discuss the reasoning for their choices in an attempt to come to a decision. In the absence of a unanimous decision at this stage, a majority decision shall be accepted. The arbitration committee's decision, once written confirmation has been received by the Screen/Television Credits Administrator, is communicated to the interested parties. A participant writer may then request an appeal before an internal Policy Review Board of the Writers Guild, within 24 hours of the arbiters' decision being communicated to them. That board consists of three members of the Screen/Television Credits Committee, usually including either the Chair or Vice-Chair; none should have an interest in the decision. The Policy Review Board only serves to determine if there was any \\"serious deviation from the policy of the Guild or the procedure as set forth in [the Screen/Television Credits Manual]\\" through the process of the arbitration, and do not read any of the submitted written materials nor judge the writers' contributions. The Policy Review Board may annul an arbitration decision, but only if policy regarding decision-making has been broken; if they find this, the arbiters may be asked to reconsider, or a new arbitration committee selected. Should the screenplay be rewritten after the final credits decision has been made, arbitration may be reopened within 48 hours of the final changes. WGA members have criticized how the process handles existing material, such as a book that is adapted to film. New York Times reporter Michele Willens suggests that the first writer to work on such a project will write the most cinematic elements of the story, but other teams that subsequently work on the script may base their work on the original text, rather than the first draft. Barry Levinson, the director of Wag the Dog, and a disputant over screenwriting credit for the film (which was adapted from a novel), said: Notable conflicts Frank Pierson, former WGAW president (and former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences), said that \\"the large majority of credits are still straightforward and uncontested [but] when they go wrong, they go horribly wrong.\\" Writer-director Phil Alden Robinson has said that \\"no one can trust the writing credit. Nobody knows who really wrote the film.\\" From 1993 to 1997, there were 415 arbitrations, about a third of all films with credits submitted. When Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was adapted for the screen, Alex Cox and Tod Davies wrote the initial adaptation. When Terry Gilliam was brought in to direct it, he rewrote it with Tony Grisoni. The WGA initially denied Gilliam and Grisoni any credit even though Gilliam claimed that nothing of the original adaptation remained in the final film: \\"As a director, I was automatically deemed a 'production executive' by the Guild and, by definition, discriminated against. But for Tony to go without any credit would be really unfair.\\" After complaints, the WGA awarded Gilliam and Grisoni credit in addition to Cox and Davies, but Gilliam resigned from the union over the dispute. Gilliam said the arbitration process \\"[is] really a Star Chamber\\", claiming it took more work than the screenplay itself. Similar problems arose for the film Ronin. According to director John Frankenheimer, \\"the credits should read: Story by J. D. Zeik, screenplay by David Mamet. We didn't shoot a line of Zeik's script.\\" Instead, Mamet received credit under a pseudonym. After the controversy over credits for Wag the Dog, Mamet decided to attach his name only to movies on which he is the sole writer. A disagreement over the 2-1 arbitration decision denying George Clooney a writing credit for Leatherheads led Clooney to become a financial core member of the WGA, rather than an active one. Variety's Michael Fleming wrote that \\"Clooney took a languishing 17-year old project and got a greenlight after personally giving the script a major overhaul that transformed it into a screwball comedy\\", with Clooney asserting that he wrote almost the entire script, but only Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly, who came up with the original concept, were credited.

He was an attacking midfielder, generally regarded as having one of the hardest shots in football. From 1984 to 1985 he was club captain of Leeds and holds the record as the club's youngest ever player and record goalscorer. He has been voted as the ninth-greatest Leeds player of all time and voted into the Greatest Leeds United team of all time. After retiring as a player, Lorimer became a director on the board at Leeds, provided match commentary on BBC Radio Leeds and Yorkshire Radio, and written a regular column in the Yorkshire Evening Post. Since April 2013 he has held the position of club ambassador. Playing career =Leeds United= Manchester United scouts offered his parents ¬£5,000 for him to join the club, though he agreed to sign for Leeds United who had shown interest in him first. He made his debut for Leeds aged 15 in September 1962. After his debut, Lorimer didn't feature in the Leeds first team picture again for two years. Lorimer came to regular prominence in the 1965‚Äì66 season, making 34 League Championship appearances and scoring 19 goals, more than any other player at Leeds United managed that season. A skillful and industrious player who operated best in a drifting position either wide on the right (though not as an orthodox winger ‚Äì he was more likely to cut in and shoot than stay wide and cross) or behind two main strikers (usually Allan Clarke and Mick Jones), Lorimer was a frequent and often spectacular goalscorer, earning himself several nicknames stemming from his powerful shooting ‚Äì HotShot, Lash and Thunderboots were three of the more prevalent. He became renowned for these strikes, with his shots reaching speeds of up to 90 mph. One penalty kick was recorded at 107 mph.Amazon (2002). Peter Lorimer: Leeds United and Scotland Hero amazon.co.uk (accessed 23 September 2006). In the 1966‚Äì67 season, Lorimer made his first major headlines when a free-kick equaliser against Chelsea in an FA Cup semi-final was ruled out for a controversial decision by the referee to make him re-take the free kick as the Chelsea players hadn't retreated the necessary 10 yards. Chelsea held on to win the game. Leeds United won the League Cup and Fairs Cup in 1967‚Äì68 ‚Äì their first major trophies under Revie ‚Äì and Lorimer scored 30 goals during the season. He featured prominently as they clinched their first League championship in 1968‚Äì69 and just before the end of the decade, won his first cap for Scotland. In 1969‚Äì70, Lorimer was in the side which chased a \\"treble\\" of League championship, FA Cup and European Cup, though Leeds ended the season with nothing. Lorimer ended that season with 19 goals. Leeds United took the Fairs Cup again in 1970‚Äì71 and then finally won the FA Cup in 1971‚Äì72. Lorimer picked up winner's medals in both, scoring 29 goals in the Cup winning season, including his best seasonal League tally of 23. After being Division 1 runners-up on five occasions (1964‚Äì65, 1965‚Äì66, 1969‚Äì70, 1970‚Äì71, 1971‚Äì72), United reclaimed the title in the 1973‚Äì74 season, with Lorimer hitting 14 goals in all competitions as Leeds clinched their second First Division crown. Leeds started the 1973‚Äì74 season with a record unbeaten start of 29 League games, winning their second League title under Revie. Lorimer was rewarded with a place in Scotland's squad for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany, and he scored in the group game against Zaire. Another eventful season with Leeds United followed for Lorimer, as he continued to score goals, managing four as Leeds United progressed to their first European Cup final, including scoring a crucial away goal against Leeds' semi-final opponents Barcelona. In the final held in Paris, they played Bayern Munich and lost 2‚Äì0, with Lorimer having a goal disallowed due to a dubious offside decision given against captain Billy Bremner. That was the last major trophy for which the team built by Revie (who had left the year previously to manage England) would compete, and the ageing team began to break up. Lorimer, who also made his 21st and final Scotland appearance in 1975, was still not 30 and continued to play as an experienced head amidst a new generation of Leeds United players. Lorimer eventually left in 1979, no longer a regular player. =Later career= He played for York City and then tried his luck in the North American Soccer League (NASL). Lorimer played for two clubs: the Toronto Blizzard (1979‚Äì1980) and the Vancouver Whitecaps (1981‚Äì83). In January 1983 he signed for University College Dublin A.F.C.. Lorimer returned to Leeds United in 1983, aged 37, two seasons after Leeds had fallen into the Football League Second Division. He played under former team-mate Eddie Gray (more than a year his junior) and broke the club's goalscoring record in the process, ending up with 238 goals from 676 appearances by the time new manager Billy Bremner (another of his former teammates) \\"retired\\" him just before his 40th birthday at the end of the 1985‚Äì86 season. However, Leeds were still a Second Division team when Lorimer played his final game for them and it would be another four years before they returned to the First Division. Lorimer played on for a short time in Israel after a short spell at Whitby Town under former Leeds star David Harvey. After playing Lorimer has remained a dedicated spokesman for Leeds United since retirement ‚Äì he is always one of the first ex-players broadcasters and journalists turn to when the club is in the news. He has worked as a pundit at games for BBC Radio Leeds and as a columnist for the local paper, the Yorkshire Evening Post. He currently writes a column in the club's Match Programme and he acts as a summariser on every Leeds away match for Yorkshire Radio. His main source of income since retirement has been from running The Commercial Inn pub in the Holbeck area of the city. In 2004, with the club on its knees financially, Lorimer acted as a go-between who liaised between potential benefactors and supporters as a rescue plan for the club was launched. He is a fans' representative on the board of directors who also deals with the media on club issues. He was the only person to remain on the board after Ken Bates takeover of Leeds United in 2005 as Bates felt his role as fans' representative was important and would help with relations with the Leeds United fans. Peter Lorimer represented the city of Leeds as part of the application to be a Host City in England's bid for the 2018 World Cup. The application for Leeds to be part of the England bid was successful, but England subsequently lost the bid to host the World Cup. Lorimer has criticised former Leeds manager Simon Grayson.

An individual or organization engaging in advocacy typically seeks to protect children's rights which may be abridged or abused in a number of areas.  Rights   What child advocates do  A child advocate typically represents or gives voice to children whose concerns and interests are not being heard. Child advocacy can be done at the micro level (for one child or a few children), mezzo level (for group of children or at a community level) or macro level (for a category of children affected by a social issue).Wright, A. C., & Jaffe, K. J. (2013). Six Steps to Successful Child Advocacy: Changing the World for Children. SAGE Publications. A child advocate will try to prevent children from being harmed and may try to obtain justice for those who have already been injured in some way. A child advocate may also seek to ensure that children have access to resources or services which will benefit their lives such as education, childcare and proper parenting. Malnutrition is another form of harm-there are many children who go to bed without eating and it is looked over by child welfare or the police. Another form of child advocacy happens at the policy level and aims at changing the policies of governments or even transnational policies. These advocates do lobbying, policy research, file lawsuits and engage in other types of policy change techniques.DeVita, C.J. & Mosher-Williams, R. (Eds.) (2001). Who speaks for America‚Äôs children?. Washington, DC: The Urban Institute. Many use Internet based techniques to influence decision makers.McNutt, J.G. (2007). Adoption of New Wave Electronic Advocacy Techniques by Nonprofit Child Advocacy Organizations. Cortes, M. & Rafter, K (eds.), Nonprofits and Technology: Emerging Research for Usable Knowledge. Chicago, IL: Lyceum Books  Where child advocates can be found  Several countries have established Children's Ombudsman agencies, at national, sub-national or local levels, as independent public bodies promoting and protecting the rights of children. Other child advocates exist in school, community, and home environments, and work on an individual, group or governmental level(s) to protect and nurture children. In most circumstances, mothers, fathers, family and teachers all advocate on behalf of children, although it is well recognized that we all have the ability and responsibility to advocate on behalf of children. In Wales the Welsh Assembly Government has set up the National Advocacy Meic helpline which allows children to talk directly to advocates. These independent advocates support and represent the concerns of children. Eight Canadian provinces, including Ontario, have an official child advocate whose job it is to protect the interests and welfare of all the children in the province. Within the criminal justice system, child advocates are concerned with the developmental needs of children and young people, and can play an important role in ensuring due process rights for young people in conflict with the law. They can help provide a voice for children and young people, ensure just and humane conditions of custody, and guard the privacy rights surrounding record provisions. They can also work to ensure that the special legal protections assigned to young people are provided with dignity and fairness. = Child advocacy centers = Child advocacy centers (CAC) provide a child-friendly, safe and neutral location in which law enforcement and Child Protective Services investigators may conduct and observe forensic interviews with children who are alleged victims of crimes, and where the child and non- offending family members receive support, crisis intervention and referrals for mental health and medical treatment. The Child advocacy center model's main objective is to reduce trauma to child victims by bringing all disciplines together and sharing information more efficiently to minimize duplication. CACs coordinate multidisciplinary teams composed of law enforcement officers, child protective service personnel, prosecutors, advocates, mental health therapists and medical personnel. The multidisciplinary team meets regularly to communicate and collaborate on child maltreatment cases. Cases are reviewed beginning with the victim‚Äôs initial outcry through investigation, treatment and prosecution. Communication within the team reduces duplication and mistakes, and keeps victims from falling through the cracks. A child forensic interview is a process where a child is given the opportunity to make a statement about what happened in a private, safe, supportive environment. The child is questioned in a legally-sound, developmentally appropriate, and trauma-informed manner by a specially trained child interviewer. Members of the multidisciplinary team that have jurisdiction over the case observe the interview as it is taking place. Interviews are recorded, reducing the number of times children need to be interviewed, therefore reducing trauma to the child. Information gathered in the forensic interview is used to help make decisions about protection, prosecution and treatment. Conducting forensic interviews with child crime victims in a child advocacy center is considered best practice. History of child advocacy centers: In 1985, Congressman Robert E. \\"Bud\\" Cramer (AL), who was then a District Attorney, organized an effort to create a better system to help abused children. He was frustrated as a prosecutor, because he was having difficulty prosecuting child abuse cases and getting guilty verdicts or pleas for offenders of crimes against children. He noticed the social service and the criminal justice systems were not working together in an effective manner and this created the common problem of adding to children's emotional distress, and created a segmented, repetitious, and often frightening experience for the child victims. He pulled together law enforcement, criminal justice, child protective service, medical and mental health workers into one coordinated team that would serve child victims of crime in a respectful way. Thirty years ago, this was a revolutionary idea. Child advocacy centers in the USA are accredited by the National Children's Alliance. The Child Advocate in the USA is a national not for profit organization with connections to hundreds of other organizations and resources to address sexual abuse but also many other advocacy needs for children and families. Their goals are to serve the needs of children, families and professionals while addressing mental health, medical, educational, legal and legislative issues. Child advocacy organizations in the USA at the policy level exist at state and national levels and as transnational NGOs. The organizations that they work in vary from smaller organizations at the local level to multinational voluntary organizations concerned about international child rights.  The United Nations  On the international stage, the United Nations has long advocated on behalf of children through UNICEF, whose position on children was formulated and publicly formalized in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention sets out a summary of collective ideals and a covenant of commitments to all children on the planet.  Philosophy  One thing that all child advocates have in common is healthy respect for young children. There is also recognition that in most countries, children are not seen as having the full citizenship status which confers certain rights and responsibilities as adults.

In February 2007, American webzine Somewhere Cold voted Having No. 10 on their 2006 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame. The band toured the United States and Europe several times, including a U.K. tour with Damien Rice and a festival appearance in Spain with Morrissey. The band's music attracted modest press coverage and exposure, most notably in British magazines such as NME and Uncut and was featured on such television shows as One Tree Hill, The O.C., Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Felicity, and movies such as A Love Song for Bobby Long and Annapolis. The band disbanded at the beginning of 2012.

It emerged from the popular op√©ras comiques en vaudevilles of the Fair Theatres of St Germain and St Laurent (and to a lesser extent the Com√©die-Italienne),M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet and Richard Langham Smith. \\"Op√©ra comique\\", Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 19 November 2009 which combined existing popular tunes with spoken sections. Associated with the Paris theatre of the same name, op√©ra comique is not necessarily comical or shallow in nature; Carmen, perhaps the most famous op√©ra comique, is a tragedy. Use of the term Poster for Carmen, probably the most famous op√©ra comique The term op√©ra comique is complex in meaning and cannot simply be translated as \\"comic opera\\". The genre originated in the early 18th century with humorous and satirical plays performed at the theatres of the Paris fairs which contained songs (vaudevilles), with new words set to already existing music. The phrase op√©ra comique en vaudevilles or similar was often applied to these early-stage works. In the middle of the 18th century, composers began to write original music to replace the vaudevilles, under the influence of the lighter types of Italian opera (especially Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's La serva padrona). This form of op√©ra comique was often known as com√©die m√™l√©e d'ariettes, but the range of subject matter it covered expanded beyond the merely comic. By the 19th century, op√©ra comique often meant little more than works with spoken dialogue performed at the Op√©ra-Comique theatre, as opposed to works with recitative delivery which appeared at the Paris Op√©ra. Thus, probably the most famous of all op√©ras comiques, Georges Bizet's Carmen, is on a tragic subject. As Elizabeth Bartlet and Richard Langham Smith note in their Grove article on the subject, composers and librettists frequently rejected the use of the umbrella term op√©ra comique in favor of more precise labels. History =Beginnings= Op√©ra comique began in the early eighteenth century in the theatres of the two annual Paris fairs, the Foire Saint Germain and the Foire Saint Laurent. Here plays began to include musical numbers called vaudevilles, which were existing popular tunes refitted with new words. The plays were humorous and often contained satirical attacks on the official theatres such as the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. In 1715 the two fair theatres were brought under the aegis of an institution called the Th√©√¢tre de l'Op√©ra-Comique. In spite of fierce opposition from rival theatres the venture flourished and leading playwrights of the time, including Alain-Ren√© Lesage and Alexis Piron, contributed works in the new form.Grove =Late 18th century= The Querelle des Bouffons (1752‚Äì54), a quarrel between advocates of French and Italian music, was a major turning-point for op√©ra comique. Members of the pro-Italian faction, such as the philosopher and musician Jean-Jacques Rousseau, attacked serious French opera, represented by the trag√©dies en musique of Jean-Philippe Rameau, in favor of what they saw as the simplicity and \\"naturalness\\" of Italian comic opera (opera buffa), exemplified by Pergolesi's La serva padrona, which had recently been performed in Paris by a traveling Italian troupe. In 1752, Rousseau produced a short opera influenced by Pergolesi, Le Devin du village, in an attempt to introduce his ideas of musical simplicity and naturalness to France. Its success attracted the attention of the Foire theatres. The next year, the head of the Saint Laurent theatre, Jean Monnet, commissioned the composer Antoine Dauvergne to produce a French opera in the style of La serva padrona. The result was Les troqueurs, which Monnet passed off as the work of an Italian composer living in Vienna who was fluent in French, thus fooling the partisans of Italian music into giving it a warm welcome. Dauvergne's opera, with a simple plot, everyday characters, and Italianate melodies, had a huge influence on subsequent op√©ra comique, setting a fashion for composing new music, rather than recycling old tunes. Where it differed from later op√©ras comiques, however, was that it contained no spoken dialogue. In this, Dauvergne was following the example of Pergolesi's La serva padrona. Andr√© Gr√©try, the most famous composer of op√©ra comique before the French Revolution The short, catchy melodies which replaced the vaudevilles were known as ariettes and many op√©ras comiques in the late 18th century were styled com√©dies m√™l√©es d'ariettes. Their librettists were often playwrights, skilled at keeping up with the latest trends in the theatre. Louis Anseaume, Michel-Jean Sedaine and Charles Simon Favart were among the most famous of these dramatists. Notable composers of op√©ras comiques in the 1750s and 1760s include Egidio Duni, Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny and Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor. Duni, an Italian working at the francophile court of Parma, composed Le peintre amoureux de son mod√®le in 1757 with a libretto by Anseaume. Its success encouraged the composer to move to Paris permanently and he wrote 20 or so more works for the French stage.Holden, article on Duni, p. 294 Monsigny collaborated with Sedaine in works which mixed comedy with a serious social and political element. Le roi et le fermier (1762) contains Enlightenment themes such as the virtues of the common people and the need for liberty and equality. Their biggest success, Le d√©serteur (1769), concerns the story of a soldier who has been condemned to death for deserting the army.Holden, article on Monsigny p. 674 Philidor's most famous op√©ra comique was Tom Jones (1765), based on Henry Fielding's 1749 novel of the same name. It is notable for its realistic characters and its many ensembles.Holden, article on Philidor, pp. 775‚Äì777 The most important and popular composer of op√©ra comique in the late 18th century was Andr√© Gr√©try. Gr√©try successfully blended Italian tunefulness with a careful setting of the French language. He was a versatile composer who expanded the range of op√©ra comique to cover a wide variety of subjects from the Oriental fairy tale Z√©mire et Azor (1772) to the musical satire of Le jugement de Midas (1778) and the domestic farce of L'amant jaloux (also 1778). His most famous work was the historical \\"rescue opera\\", Richard Coeur-de-lion (1784), which achieved international popularity, reaching London in 1786 and Boston in 1797.Holden article on Gr√©try. Between 1724 and 1762 the Op√©ra-Comique theatre was located at the Foire Saint Germain. In 1762 the company was merged with the Com√©die- Italienne and moved to the H√¥tel de Bourgogne. In 1783 a new, larger home was created for it at the Th√©√¢tre Italien (later renamed the Salle Favart). =Revolution and the 19th century= Title page of the first edition of the full score of M√©d√©e by Cherubini, 1797 The French Revolution brought many changes to musical life in Paris. In 1793, the name of the Com√©die-Italienne was changed to the Op√©ra-Comique, but it no longer had a monopoly on performing operas with spoken dialogue and faced serious rivalry from the Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, which also produced works in the op√©ra comique style. Op√©ra comique generally became more dramatic and less comic and began to show the influence of musical Romanticism. The chief composers at the Op√©ra-Comique during the Revolutionary era were √âtienne M√©hul, Nicolas Dalayrac, Rodolphe Kreutzer and Henri-Montan Berton. Those at the Feydeau included Luigi Cherubini, Pierre Gaveaux, Jean-Fran√ßois Le Sueur and Fran√ßois Devienne. The works of M√©hul (for example Stratonice, 1792; Ariodant, 1799), Cherubini (Lodo√Øska, 1791; M√©d√©e, 1797; Les Deux journ√©es, 1800) and Le Sueur (La caverne, 1793) in particular show the influence of serious French opera, especially Gluck, and a willingness to take on previously taboo subjects (e.g. incest in M√©hul's M√©lidore et Phrosine, 1794; infanticide in Cherubini's famous M√©d√©e). Orchestration and harmony are more complex than in the music of the previous generation; attempts are made to reduce the amount of spoken dialogue, and unity is provided by techniques such as the \\"reminiscence motif\\" (recurring musical themes representing a character or idea). In 1801 the Op√©ra-Comique and the Feydeau merged for financial reasons. The changing political climate ‚Äì more stable under the rule of Napoleon ‚Äì was reflected in musical fashion as comedy began to creep back into op√©ra-comique. The lighter new offerings of Boieldieu (such as Le calife de Bagdad, 1800) and Isouard (Cendrillon, 1810) were a great success. Parisian audiences of the time also loved Italian opera, visiting the Th√©√¢tre Italien to see opera buffa and works in the newly fashionable bel canto style, especially those by Rossini, whose fame was sweeping across Europe. Rossini's influence began to pervade French op√©ra comique. Its presence is felt in Boieldieu's greatest success, La dame blanche (1825) as well as later works by Auber (Fra Diavolo, 1830; Le domino noir, 1837), Ferdinand H√©rold (Zampa, 1831), and Adolphe Adam (Le postillon de Lonjumeau, 1836).

Biography He was born at Radipole, near Weymouth, Dorset. He entered the Royal Navy in 1857, served in the Abyssinian campaign of 1868, and was employed for a considerable time in the suppression of the East African slave trade. The experience thus obtained led to his being selected to command an expedition sent by the Royal Geographical Society in 1873, to assist Dr Livingstone. He was also instructed to make independent explorations, guided by Livingstone's advice. Soon after the departure of the expedition from Zanzibar, Chuma and Susi were met bearing the dead body of the reverend doctor. Cameron's two European companions, Dr. William Edward Dillon, surgeon in the Royal Navy, and Lieutenant Cecil Murphy of the Royal Artillery, turned back with the task of returning Livingstone's body to the coast. Dr. Dillon died on 18 November 1873. Cameron continued his march and reached Ujiji, on Lake Tanganyika, in February 1874, where he found and sent to England Livingstone's papers. Cameron spent some time determining the true form of the south part of the lake, and solved the question of its outlet by the discovery of the Lukuga River. From Tanganyika he struck westward to Nyangwe, the Arab town on the Lualaba previously visited by Livingstone. This river Cameron rightly believed to be the main stream of the Congo, and he endeavoured to procure canoes to follow it down.Stanley, H.M., 1899, Through the Dark Continent, London: G. Newnes, Vol. One , Vol. Two In this he was unsuccessful, owing to his refusal to countenance slavery, and he therefore turned south-west. After tracing the Congo-Zambezi watershed for hundreds of miles he reached Bihe and finally arrived at the coast on 28 November 1875, being the first European to cross equatorial Africa from sea to sea. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Founder's Gold Medal in 1876. His travels, which were published in 1877 under the title Across Africa, contain valuable suggestions for the opening up of the continent, including the utilization of the great lakes as a Cape to Cairo Road connection. In recognition of his work he was promoted to the rank of Commander. Verney Lovett Cameron in 1878 The remainder of Cameron's life was chiefly devoted to projects for the commercial development of Africa, and to editing and writing. His last work was the editing of the personal adventure narrative of the Master Mariner James Choyce, who had sailed as a teenager in 1797 aboard a whaler to the Pacific Ocean. Choyce's narrative covering 26 years of seafaring life is one of the earliest works of an Englishman's experiences in South America. Cameron visited the Euphrates valley in 1878-1879 in connection with a proposed railway to the Persian Gulf, and accompanied Sir Richard Burton in his West African journey of 1882. At the Gold Coast Cameron surveyed the Tarkwa region, and he was joint author with Burton of To the Gold Coast for Gold (1883). In the 1880s he published several books for boys emulating his sister in law Mrs. Lovett Cameron who wrote romantic fiction.Mrs Lovett Cameron, OxfordIndex.oup.com, retrieved 23 February 2014 He was killed, near Leighton Buzzard, by a fall from horseback when returning from hunting in 1894. A second edition of Across Africa, with new matter and corrected maps, appeared in 1885. A summary of Cameron's great journey, from his own pen, appears in Dr Robert Brown's The Story of Africa, vol.

The Comanche were the Native American inhabitants of a large area known as Comancheria, which stretched across much of the southern Great Plains from Colorado and Kansas in the north through Oklahoma, Texas, and eastern New Mexico and into the Mexican state of Chihuahua in the south. For more than 150 years, the Comanche were the dominant native tribe in the region, known as ‚Äúthe Lords of the Southern Plains‚Äù, though they also shared parts of Comancheria with the Wichita, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache and, after 1840, the southern Cheyenne and Arapaho.Meedm D.V & Smith, J. Comanche 1800-74 Oxford (2003), Osprey, Oxford, pp 5 The value of the Comanche traditional homeland was recognized by European-American colonists seeking to settle the American frontier and quickly brought the two sides into conflict. The Comanche Wars began in 1706 with raids by Comanche warriors on the Spanish colonies of New Spain and continued until the last bands of Comanche surrendered to the United States Army in 1875, although a few Comanche continued to fight in later conflicts such as the Buffalo Hunters' War in 1876 and 1877. The Comanche were noted as fierce combatants who practiced an emphatic resistance to European- American influence and encroachment upon their lands. Comanche power peaked in the 1840s when they conducted large-scale raids hundreds of miles into Mexico proper, while also warring against the Anglo-Americans and Tejanos who had settled in independent Texas. Their power declined as epidemics of cholera and smallpox inflicted severe casualties on their population, and as continuous pressure from the expanding population of the United States forced them to cede most of their tribal lands. Influential people =Iron Jacket= Iron Jacket was a Comanche chief and medicine man. The name ‚ÄúIron Jacket‚Äù came from his tendency to wear a coat of mail into battle. Iron Jacket took part in the Antelope Hills Expedition of 1858, where he was ultimately killed at the Battle of Little Robe Creek. He was the father of Peta Nocona, who later became a chief himself. =Cynthia Ann Parker= Cynthia Ann Parker, mother of Quanah Parker, the last Comanche chief Comanche Warriors attacked the Texan Fort Parker and Kidnapped Nine year old Cynthia Ann Parker among several other children. Cynthia Ann Parker quickly assimilated to the Comanche tribe and later married the Comanche chief Peta Nocona. Cynthia Ann Parker had a son named Quanah Parker who later became a Chief himself and aided a war party in 1874. =Peta Nocona= Peta Nocona was the father of the last Comanche Chief Quanah Parker, as well as a Comanche Chief who played a crucial part in the Indian Wars. Peta Nocona led the full attack on Fort Parker where Cynthia Ann Parker was kidnapped and eventually became his wife. Peta Nocona's place and date of death is still in dispute. =Quanah Parker= Chief Quanah Parker, son of Cynthia Parker and last chief of the Comanche Quanah Parker was the last Comanche Chief and part of the Quahadi sect of the Comanche, who were highly respected by the other tribes. Quanah was never an official chief since the United States government appointed him to the position. Before he was a Comanche chief, Quanah Parker witnessed the peace negotiations of 1867 but refused to sign the accords. =Buffalo Hump= Buffalo Hump was a Comanche War Chief who led the Great Raid of 1840 after Texan officials killed Comanche delegates during the events that unfolded during the Council House Fight. =Mirabeau B. Lamar= Mirabeau Lamar was the second President of the Republic of Texas from 1838 to 1841, preceded by Sam Houston. Mirabeau Lamar had a harsher policy towards Native Americans in Texas and signed two bills which escalated tensions in the region. The first bill was signed on December 21, 1838 which formed an 840-man regiment to protect the Northern and Western Frontiers of Texas. An additional bill was passed on December 29, 1838, which added an additional 8 companies of mounted volunteers to serve 6 month deployments.Brice, Donaly E.

Santa Anna joined forces with Buffalo Hump and most likely took part in the Battle of Plum Creek and the Great Raid of 1840. Santa Anna was the first of his tribe to travel to Washington D.C. and agreed to sign a treaty in May 1846, despite the continued hostilities.

The conflict started over negotiations regarding Texan and Mexican captives that the Comanches were holding in order to gain back sections of Comancheria that Texas had claimed. The Council house fight ended with twelve of the Comanche Leaders killed inside the Council house as well as 23 others shot in San Antonio.H√§m√§l√§inen, Pekka (2008), The Comanche Empire, Yale University Press, p. 216, Online at Google Books =Battle of Plum Creek (August 1840)= The Battle of Plum Creek was a conflict in Lockhart, Texas that took place on August 12, 1840. It was an attack led by Chief Buffalo Hump who led a large force of 1,000 Comanche warriors against 200 Texas Rangers in response to the Council House Fight. The Battle Began as a raid where the Comanche party stole livestock and firearms which gradually turned into a gun fight. The results of the battle are still being debated since the Rangers reported 80 Comanches were killed but only 12 bodies were found Brice, Donaly E. The Great Comanche Raid: Boldest Indian Attack on the Texas Republic McGowan Book Co. 1987 The Comanches claimed to have killed 11 Texas Rangers. =Antelope Hills Expedition (January‚ÄìMay 1858)= The Antelope Hills Expedition was a campaign led by the federal 2nd Cavalry against the Comanche and Kiowa tribes in Comancheria. It started in January 1858 and ended in May of the same year. The cause for the expedition was due to Comanche raids into Texan territories. Peta Nocona and Iron Jacket led Comanche troops against the combined 220 forces of the 2nd cavalry, Tonkawa, Nadaco and Shawnee. Their expedition's purpose was to move the 2nd Cavalry from Oklahoma to Texas in order to better handle the raiding Comanches. For this reason the United States gained the aid of the Comanches' enemy tribes Tonkawa, Nadaco and Shawnee. The resulting battle concluded with 50 killed on the United States side and 76 killed and 16 captured on the Comanche side. The Antelope Hills Expedition further expanded into the Battle of Little Robe Creek. Battle of Little Robe Creek The Battle of Little Robe Creek (Also known as the Battle of Antelope Hills) was a battle fought between the Comanches' allies of the Kiowa and the Apache against the Texas Rangers with their allies the Tonkawa, Caddo, Anadarko, Waco, Shawnee, Delaware and Tahaucano. The Battle was the first battle in which the Texas Rangers were able to enter the Comanche land of Comancheria. The United States rallied a force of 100 Texas Rangers and 113 allies where the Comanches rallied a force between the range of 200-600.Fehrenbach, T.R. ‚ÄúComanches, The Destruction of a People In the battle there were three decisive battles between the Comanches and the Texas Rangers. The first began in the morning of May 12 Fehrenbach, T.R. ‚ÄúComanches, The Destruction of a People\\". when the Texas Rangers led by General Ford attacked a Comanche camp, the Comanches were not ready for such attack and a massacre occurred. The second battle began when the Texas Rangers attempted to do the same to the next Comanche camp only to be met by resistance from the Comanche‚Äôs who saw the approach of the Texas Rangers. The Comanches at this point were able to act in defense but there was still a significant lose of life for the Comanches. It was not until the third and final battle of Little Robe creek where the Comanche warriors were able to take an offensive stance against the Texas Rangers. However, the end result of the three battles was costly to the Comanche forces: 76 were killed and over 60 were captured by the Texas Rangers. By comparison, the Texas Rangers lost two killed and only five wounded. =Battle of Pease River (December 1860)= The Battle of Pease River took place on December 18, 1860, in Foard County, Texas. This battle has become highly debated due to unreliable sources and exaggerated facts surrounding the event, but the event started in November 1860, most likely when a band of Comanche warriors, \\"struck farms, ranches, and outlying settlements in Parker, Young, Jack, and Palo Pinto counties west of Fort Worth.\\"Carson, Paul H., Dr., and Tom Crum. \\"The \\"Battle\\" at Pease River and the Question of Reliable Sources.\\" Southwestern Historical Quarterly CXIII.1 (2009): 33-52.

The citizens responded by pursuing the Comanches to a village on the Pease River, but because there were too many Comanches, the citizens had to wait for a larger force to arrive. Three units arrived, led by Lawrence Sullivan \\"Sul\\" Ross, Captain J.J. Cureton, and First Sergeant John W. Spangler. On December 19, 1860, Sul Ross led the attack on the Comanche village and according to Ross's report, \\"killed twelve of the Comanches and captured three: a woman who turned out to be Cynthia Ann Parker, her daughter Topsannah (Prairie Flower), and a young boy whom Ross brought to Waco and named Pease Ross...The whole incident lasted twenty minutes-thirty at the most.\\"\\"From the Frontier.\\" Dallas Herald 2 Jan. 1861: =First Battle of Adobe Walls (November 1864)= The First Battle of Adobe Walls was a battle fought against the United States Army and the Comanche Allies of Kiowa, and the Plains Apaches.

Geosiris aphylla is sometimes called the \\"earth-iris.\\" It is a small myco-heterotroph lacking chlorophyll and obtaining its nutrients from fungi in the soil. The genus name is derived from the Greek words geos, meaning \\"earth\\", and iris, referring to the Iris family of plants. Its rhizomes are slender and scaly, and stems are simple or branched. The leaves are alternate, but having no use, are reduced and scale-like. The flowers are light purple. In 1939, F. P. JonkerF. P.

At the time it was conceived, the waltz was titled 'Liebesgedichte' or \\"Love Poems\\" and during its first performance, it was even announced as 'Liebesst√§ndchen' or \\"Love Serenade\\". The first performance was at the famed Vienna Volksgarten on 18 June 1852 under the composer's direction. 'Liebeslieder' stands among the master works of the Strauss Jr., who had, since 1849 an enduringly difficult time convincing the Viennese that his works deserve the attention it sought. The fierce and uncompromising Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick was even captivated by this waltz by writing in the journal \\"Wiener Zeitung\\" the following extract \\"Those bad-tempered old- fashioned people, whose narrow-mindedness goes far as to call today's dance music contemptible should be serenaded with ashaming generosity by the 'Liebeslieder' of the young Johann Strauss.\\" By essence, the waltz is a love serenade of sorts in 3/4 time. The waltz starts quietly with pizzicato on the strings section of the orchestra before a full-bodied 'forte' signals the beginning of the waltz sections. The first theme is that of a yearning feeling, before accelerating into a strong melody. The mood of the rest of the piece alternates between lushly romantic moods as well as light-heartedness, with the flute gently serenading the waltz sections 4 and 5. The piece ends dramatically, with a sense of anticipation, on a timpani drumroll and brass flourish. The waltz also features on many arrangements with a string orchestra as well as a quintet of strings. Curiously, many of these arrangements are labelled as 'Music of the Old Vienna' when played with such an arrangement, as it could be possible that Strauss' melodies in this waltz invokes the feeling of the romance of the Old Vienna.

It is said that she coined the term for the syndrome. Biography Katharina Dorothea Kuipers was born in London on November 11 1916. As a child she wanted to be a doctor, but, after winning a scholarship to the London Foot Hospital, trained to be a chiropodist. After her first husband (Wilfred Thompson) died in World War II, Dalton decided to switch careers in the medical field, and eventually obtained a medical degree at the Royal Free Hospital. Dr. Dalton became involved in the study of PMS in 1948, when, as a pregnant 32-year-old medical student, she realized her monthly migraine headaches had disappeared. Consulting with endocrinologist Dr. Raymond Greene,Raymond Greene she concluded that the headaches could be attributed to a deficiency in the hormone progesterone, which drops before menstruation but soars during pregnancy. After further clinical study, Dr. Dalton, along with Greene, published the theory in British medical journals in 1953‚Äîfirst using the term \\"premenstrual syndrome,\\" or PMS. Dr. Dalton, who treated numerous women after setting up her own practice, concluded that PMS was a cyclical hormonal illness occurring in the 14 days following ovulation, with the most severe symptoms evident during the final four days before menstruation. In direct conflict with the views of many of her male colleagues, Dr. Dalton said the symptoms were more physical than psychological and included migraine headaches, asthma, epilepsy, skin lesions, irritability, fatigue, and depression. In addition to her patients, she studied teenage schoolgirls, the mothers of abused children and women confined to prison for serious crimes, including murder. Her research showed that during times of severe PMS, students' academic performance dipped and women were more likely to abuse their children or commit crimes. From historic anecdotes, she even concluded that Queen Victoria suffered from PMS, as indicated by reports of her monthly screaming and throwing objects at her husband, Prince Albert. She is largely credited with developing the use of menstrual charts for the diagnosis of the disorder, and argued that the timing of PMS in women was associated with higher rates of suicide attempts, alcohol abuse and violent crimes. PMS, Dr. Dalton argued, was brought on primarily by deficiencies of progesterone and could be alleviated with hormone therapy. She also believed that the hormone could be used to ease postnatal depression. But today most experts disagree with those findings and instead rely on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s, and other medications for the treatment of PMS. In her later works, Dr. Dalton helped demonstrate that depression and other disorders could be aggravated by PMS, particularly around the last few days of the menstrual cycle or the first days of menstruation. Dr. Dalton eventually became the first female president of the general practice section within the British Royal Society of Medicine. Another observation made by Dr. Dalton was that some symptoms of PMS, such as hypertension, edema, and albumin in the urine, were predictors of toxemia during pregnancy. Patients were administered an initial dose of progesterone during early symptoms, and was given continuous treatment if symptoms were still present. Using progesterone in trials of intervention in maternity hospitals, the incidence rate of toxemia dropped from 9 percent to 1 percent. Dr. Dalton refused using progestins (synthetic progestogens) in treatment as she believed it was the cause of various side effects. She opted for the use of natural progesterone in treatments, which is found in sweet potatoes. In addition, Dalton only supported the use of natural progesterone as she claims that only natural progesterone fit progesterone receptors. Most of her treatments used generous doses of progesterone as she believed that there was no unsafe dose, with 400 mg via suppository being the minimum dose. Other positive effects of progesterone include increased hair growth in women and brain trauma treatment. Her books include: Once a Month: The Original Premenstrual Syndrome Handbook (1978) which became a best seller, and Depression after Childbirth: How to Recognize, Treat, and Prevent Postnatal Depression.  Personal life  After the death of her first husband, Dalton married Tom Dalton, who passed away in 1992. She had four children, Michael, Thomas, Wendy, and Maureen. Dalton also had five grandchildren, including the British MEP Daniel Dalton. On 17 September 2004, Dalton died in Britain at age 87. The cause of death was not specified by her family..

Let us show that the supertrace does not depend on a basis. Suppose e1, ..., ep are the even basis vectors and ep+1, ..., ep+q are the odd basis vectors. Then, the components of T, which are elements of A, are defined as :T(\\\\mathbf{e}_j)=\\\\mathbf{e}_i T^i_j.\\\\, The grading of Tij is the sum of the gradings of T, ei, ej mod 2. A change of basis to e1', ..., ep', e(p+1)', ..., e(p+q)' is given by the supermatrix :\\\\mathbf{e}_{i'}=\\\\mathbf{e}_i A^i_{i'} and the inverse supermatrix :\\\\mathbf{e}_i=\\\\mathbf{e}_{i'} (A^{-1})^{i'}_i,\\\\, where of course, AA‚àí1 = A‚àí1A = 1 (the identity). We can now check explicitly that the supertrace is basis independent. In the case where T is even, we have :\\\\operatorname{str}(A^{-1} T A)=(-1)^{i'} (A^{-1})^{i'}_j T^j_k A^k_{i'}=(-1)^{i'}(-1)^{(i'+j)(i'+j)}T^j_k A^k_{i'} (A^{-1})^{i'}_j=(-1)^{j} T^j_j =\\\\operatorname{str}(T).

The ordinary trace is not basis independent, so the appropriate trace to use in the Z2-graded setting is the supertrace. The supertrace satisfies the property :\\\\operatorname{str}(T_1 T_2) = (-1)^{T_1T_2} \\\\operatorname{str}(T_2 T_1) for all T1, T2 in End(V). In particular, the supertrace of a supercommutator is zero. In fact, one can define a supertrace more generally for any associative superalgebra E over a commutative superalgebra A as a linear map tr: E -> A which vanishes on supercommutators.N. Berline, E. Getzler, M. Vergne, Heat Kernels and Dirac Operators, Springer-Verlag, 1992, , p. 39. Such a supertrace is not uniquely defined; it can always at least be modified by multiplication by an element of A. Physics applications In supersymmetric quantum field theories, in which the action integral is invariant under a set of symmetry transformations (known as supersymmetry transformations) whose algebras are superalgebras, the supertrace has a variety of applications. In such a context, the supertrace of the mass matrix for the theory can be written as a sum over spins of the traces of the mass matrices for particles of different spin: :\\\\operatorname{str}[M^2]=\\\\sum_s(-1)^{2s} (2s+1)\\\\operatorname{tr}[m_s^2]. In anomaly-free theories where only renormalizable terms appear in the superpotential, the above supertrace can be shown to vanish, even when supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. The contribution to the effective potential arising at one loop (sometimes referred to as the Coleman-Weinberg potential) can also be written in terms of a supertrace. If M is the mass matrix for a given theory, the one-loop potential can be written as :V_{eff}^{1-loop}=\\\\dfrac{1}{64\\\\pi^2}\\\\operatorname{str}\\\\bigg[M^4\\\\ln\\\\Big(\\\\dfrac{M^2}{\\\\Lambda^2}\\\\Big)\\\\bigg] = \\\\dfrac{1}{64\\\\pi^2}\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\bigg[m_{B}^4\\\\ln\\\\Big(\\\\dfrac{m_{B}^2}{\\\\Lambda^2}\\\\Big)- m_{F}^4\\\\ln\\\\Big(\\\\dfrac{m_{F}^2}{\\\\Lambda^2}\\\\Big)\\\\bigg] where m_B and m_F are the respective tree-level mass matrices for the separate bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in the theory and \\\\Lambda is a cutoff scale.

As a delegate to Oklahoma's constitutional convention in 1906, he played a crucial role in drafting the Oklahoma Constitution and gaining Oklahoma's admission into the United States as the 46th state in 1907. A prominent businessman in Muskogee, he helped the city grow in importance. He represented the city as a delegate in both the Oklahoma convention and an earlier convention that was a failed attempt to create a U.S. state of Sequoyah. During Oklahoma's constitutional convention, Haskell succeeded in pushing for the inclusion of prohibition and blocking the inclusion of women's suffrage in the Oklahoma Constitution. As governor, he was responsible for moving the state capital to Oklahoma City, establishing schools and state agencies, reforming the territorial prison system, and enforcing prohibition. Lee Cruce succeeded Haskell, who died of a stroke in 1933. Early life and education Born in West Leipsic, Ohio on March 13, 1860, Charles Haskell was the son of George R. Haskell, a cooper who died when the boy was three years old. His mother, Jane H. Reeves Haskell, worked for the local Methodist church as a bell ringer and custodian to support the six children.Compton, J. J. \\"Haskell, Charles Nathaniel (1860-1933) ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture , Oklahoma Historical Society. (accessed July 17, 2013) At the age of 10, he started working as a farm boy for a farmer named Miller in Putnam County, Ohio, where he lived and worked for eight years as he grew into adulthood. Miller was a school teacher, but as the young Haskell had to work, he did not have time to attend school. Instead, Miller's wife taught him at home and Haskell earned a teaching certificate at age 17. Private career Haskell became a teacher at age 18 and taught for three years in Putnam County. On December 6, 1880, he passed the bar exam, and became a practicing attorney at age 20 despite having no academic training in the field. In his work as an attorney, Haskell became one of the most successful lawyers in Ottawa, Ohio, the county seat, as well as one of the most prominent members of the Democratic Party in northwestern Ohio. In 1888, Haskell started work as a general contractor; for the next 16 years, his business career gave him an understanding of American industrialism. During this time, he lived in New York City and in San Antonio, Texas. Marriage and family Haskell married Lucie Pomeroy, daughter of a prominent Ottawa family, on October 11, 1881. Their children were Norman, who became a Muskogee lawyer; Murray, a bank cashier; and Lucie. Mrs. Haskell died in March 1888. Haskell remarried in 1889, to Lillie Elizabeth Gallup. They had three children: Frances, Joe and Jane. Move to Muskogee Haskell moved to Muskogee, Oklahoma, where he would become a prominent resident. With the Land Run of 1889 and the passage of the Organic Act in 1890, Oklahoma Territory was gaining importance on the national scene. Haskell moved his family to Muskogee, the capital of the Creek Nation, in March 1901. When he arrived, Haskell found Muskogee a dry, sleepy village of some 4,500 people. Upon his arrival a movement of building business blocks began and he built the first five-story business block in Oklahoma Territory. Haskell organized and built most of the railroads running into Muskogee. He is said to have built and owned 14 brick buildings in the city. Through his influence, Muskogee grew to be a center of business and industry with a population of more than 20,000 inhabitants. Haskell often told others that he hoped Muskogee would become the ‚ÄúQueen City of the Southwest.‚Äù His success earned him clout in the politics of Indian Territory and the attention of the Creek Nation. During this time, the Native American nations in Indian Territory were talking of creating a state and joining the Union under the name of the State of Sequoyah. The Creeks selected Haskell as their official representative to the conventions, in the position of vice-president for the Five Civilized Tribes, held in Eufaula, Oklahoma in 1902 and Muskogee in 1905. Of the six delegates at the Muskogee convention, all were of Native American descent, save two: Haskell and William H. Murray. Even though U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt blocked the attempt to create Sequoyah, Haskell wrote a large portion of the proposed state's constitution. Though Haskell publicly worked for a separate state for Indian Territory, privately, he was thrilled to see the Sequoyah proposal defeated. Haskell believed it would force the Indian leaders to join in statehood with Oklahoma Territory. The United States Congress and President Roosevelt agreed that Oklahoma and Indian Territories could only enter the Union as one state, the State of Oklahoma. After the federal passage of the Enabling Act in 1906, Haskell was elected as a delegate by the largest margin in the new state, representing the seventy- sixth district, which included Muskogee. Traveling to Guthrie and the Oklahoma Constitutional convention on November 20, 1906, Haskell would meet William H. Murray from the Muskogee convention and Robert L. Williams. Because of their meetings at both conventions, Haskell would gain a friendship with Murray that would last until the end of his life. The delegates to the Guthrie convention included many of those who had served in the Sequoyah convention in Muskogee, and a number of the ideas proposed for the new constitution were based upon the rejected Sequoyah constitution. Haskell owned the New State Tribune, and through its editorial columns advocated for the propositions he wanted in the new constitution, most of which were incorporated into the document, in substance if not in form. While Murray served as the convention's president, delegates recognized Haskell's power in the body. A local newspaper during the time, the Guthrie Report, called Haskell ‚Äúthe power behind the throne.‚Äù Haskell had a perfect attendance and voting record during the session. He advocated for provisions that affected both territories‚Äô labor problems and avocation for representatives of organized labor. Haskell also drafted a report drawing up county boundaries, led the crusade for state prohibition, introduced Jim Crow laws and successfully kept female suffrage out of the state constitution. Gubernatorial campaign William Jennings Bryan supported Haskell in his 1907 campaign. At Tulsa on March 26, 1907, during the recess before the final adoption of the constitution by the convention, Haskell held a large Democratic Party banquet at the Brady Hotel, attended by between 500 and 600 of the leading Democrats of the new state. During this banquet, the first campaigns for governor were formally inaugurated. It was during the course of that evening that Haskell was presented by his friends with the honors of the Democratic gubernatorial candidacy. Among the other potential candidates were Thomas Doyle of Perry and Lee Cruce of Ardmore. Haskell, like other prominent Democrats at the time, had the strong support of labor and agriculture leaders.A Century to Remember , Oklahoma House of Representatives . (accessed July 17, 2013) Unfortunately for Haskell, the primaries for governor were set for June 8, and Doyle and Cruce had already been campaigning; Haskell had little time. During his campaign, Haskell made 88 speeches in 45 days, and reached nearly every county, while the lieutenants of the respective candidates were vigorously working in the school districts and securing support in every community. Haskell's hard working nature led him to win the Democratic nomination. Haskell's victory in the primaries was carried by a more than 4,000-vote majority. He immediately confronted a new opponent in the opposite party, the Republican territorial governor, Frank Frantz, who was nominated by the Republican caucus at Tulsa. Frantz, the current territorial governor, a former Rough Rider, a friend of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, and with the federal prestige and support backing him, was the strongest candidate the Republican party could have presented to face Haskell. Haskell challenged his opponent to joint public discussions throughout the state, and every problem concerned with the administration of the new state came up in debate during the campaign. During the course of the campaign, two nationally prominent figures spoke at various locations: Republican presidential nominee William Howard Taft and Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan. Unfortunately for the Republicans, Taft's disapproval of Oklahoma's proposed constitution and his advice that the people vote against it caused the voters to react in favor of the Democrats. Haskell won the gubernatorial race by more than 30,000 votes on September 17, 1907. On the same day, the voters ratified the Oklahoma Constitution. After Haskell's election and the approval of the constitution, a Republican approached the governor-elect and is reported to have said, \\"You have so written the constitution and carried on this fight in a way that the Republicans can't get anything in the state for fifty years.\\" Haskell's eyes had a twinkle in them when he replied, \\"Well, that's soon enough, isn't it?\\" Governor of Oklahoma Governor Haskell as he appeared upon entering office. On November 16, 1907, five minutes after it was known that Oklahoma had officially become a state, Guthrie Leader editor Leslie G. Niblack administered the oath of office to Haskell. The ceremony took place privately in Haskell's hotel apartments in the presence of his immediate family, Robert Latham Owen, United States Senator-elect, and Thomas Owen of Muskogee, Haskell's former political manager. Haskell's inaugural address at Guthrie, delivered on the south steps of the Carnegie Library, quickly lifted him into national prominence. Haskell's old friends William H. Murray and Robert L. Williams also came into power with the state's founding; with Murray as the state's first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives and Williams appointed, by Haskell, as the first Oklahoma Supreme Court chief justice. Haskell set the precedents for the use of executive power. During the 1st Oklahoma Legislature, Haskell delivered a message creating a commission charged with sending a message to the U.S. Congress: amending the United States Constitution to provide for the election of U.S. senators by a direct vote of the people. Although it did not occur until after he left office, his efforts, as well as the works of the Progressive-era leaders, provided for the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1912. Though Guthrie was the official capital of the state, Haskell set up his administration from Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City quickly grew in industry and prominence, with a booming population of 64,000, shadowing the smaller city of Guthrie, which was located just miles from the growing city. Haskell personally led the move to change the capital from Guthrie to Oklahoma City. First, he moved the official home of the Great Seal of Oklahoma and Oklahoma Constitution. Slowly, all government functions moved to the Oklahoma City area. Theodore Roosevelt would be one of Haskell's fiercest political opponents during his Governorship In the state legislature's first session, under Haskell's leadership, Oklahoma adopted laws regulating banking in the state, reformed the old territorial prison system, and protected the public from exploitative railroads, public utilities, trusts and monopolies. Haskell also initiated a law insuring deposits in case of a bank failure, a landmark piece of legislation in the nation. Haskell also rigidly enforced prohibition through the Alcohol Control Act. Though following progressive dogma at every turn, such as the introduction of child labor laws, factory inspection codes, safety codes for mines, health and sanitary laws, and employer's liability for workers, Haskell's legislative schedule also included Jim Crow laws for Oklahoma. Haskell's other significant contributions while governor included establishing the Oklahoma Geological Survey, the Oklahoma School for the Blind, the Oklahoma College for Women and the Oklahoma State Department of Health. In addition, he helped to create the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in 1908. Haskell selected the first judges of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.Enrolled House Concurrent Resolution No. 25 , Chronicles of Oklahoma Vol. 11, No. 3, September, 1933. (accessed July 14, 2013) Prior to statehood, Kansas officials imprisoned individuals convicted of crimes in Oklahoma Territory. Oklahoma Commissioner of Charities and Corrections Kate Barnard, Oklahoma's first female state official, visited the Kansas prisons and reported to Governor Haskell on the horrible conditions. In response, in 1908, Haskell pushed a bill through the state legislature that transferred 50 Oklahoma prisoners detained in the Kansas penitentiary at Lansing to McAlester, Oklahoma. When the Oklahoma state militia marched the prisoners down to McAlester, they found no prison. Under military supervision, the prisoners built Oklahoma State Penitentiary, the state's first correctional facility (still in use today). The militia housed the prisoners in a tent city and were authorized by Haskell to use lethal force against any prisoner that tried to escape. A grandfather clause was also enacted by the 2nd Oklahoma Legislature by the state's Democratic leaders, effectively excluding blacks from voting. Haskell would spend the remainder of his term enforcing prohibition, regulation of railroads and other trusts, and the moving of the state capital to Oklahoma City. Haskell's dream came true on June 11, 1910, when Oklahoma City became the state's official capital. Throughout his term as governor, Haskell remained free from corruption. Though he was the leader in the deliberations of the committee on county lines and county seats, when hundreds of towns had committees attending the sessions with heavy purses, he left these deliberations lean and poor, and by the time he retired from the governor's office he had become utterly impoverished. In debate he ignored the graces of oratory and instead marshaled facts, arrayed statistics and piled up figures, using his cutting wit and grim humor to carry his point. At the end of his term as governor in 1911, Haskell stepped down from the governorship, happy to see his 1907 Democratic primary challenger Lee Cruce inaugurated as the second governor of Oklahoma. In 1912, Haskell unsuccessfully challenged incumbent U.S. Senator Robert Latham Owen in a hard-fought Democratic primary for his U.S. Senate seat. National politics Not only a powerful figure in Oklahoma politics, Haskell's progressive roots and populist nature granted him national clout. In 1908, Haskell headed the Oklahoma delegation to the National Democratic Convention at Denver and for a few months was Treasurer of the Democratic Campaign Committee. He was the spokesman for William Jennings Bryan in writing the platform of the convention. In 1920, he again headed the Oklahoma delegation at the National Convention, which in that year met at San Francisco, and was committed to and faithfully labored for United States Senator Robert Latham Owen, of Oklahoma, for the United States presidential nomination. Haskell would serve in this post two more times: a third in 1928 to the National Democratic Convention at Houston, and a fourth time in 1932 to the National Democratic Convention at Chicago. At each convention and in his speeches and in articles appearing in the public press he disclosed an intimate understanding of the big money masters of America and ruthlessly exposed many of their venal practices and their corrupt usage of the public funds in their own interest to the detriment of the people. Later life, death and legacy Haskell entered the oil business after finishing his term as governor,Oklahoma Governors , Ok.gov. (accessed July 14, 2013) a profession he would stay in until the end of his life. In 1933, Haskell suffered a major stroke, from which he would never recover. Three months later Haskell would die from pneumonia. Haskell lost consciousness on July 4, and died the next day, in the Skirvin Hotel in Oklahoma City at the age of 73. He is buried in Muskogee, Oklahoma. As Oklahoma's first governor, Haskell left a legacy marked by a practical and keen legal mind. Haskell was known for finding the middle ground and usually brought the belligerent partisan forces and rival interests into friendly agreement. One of his most significant achievements as governor was moving the state capital from Guthrie to Oklahoma City. Charles Haskell Elementary in Edmond, Oklahoma, and Charles N. Haskell Middle School in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma are named in his honor. Haskell County, Oklahoma and the city of Haskell, Oklahoma were also named for him. In 2007, Oklahoma celebrated 100 years of statehood. Many descendants of Charles Nathaniel Haskell were in attendance.

Originally introduced to the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors, it was quickly adopted and carried to all Spanish-occupied lands. The horno has a beehive shape and uses wood as the heat source. The procedure still used in parts of New Mexico and Arizona is to build a fire inside the horno and, when the proper amount of time has passed, remove the embers and ashes and insert the bread to be cooked. In the case of corn, the embers are doused with water and the corn is then inserted into the horno to be \\"steam\\"-cooked.

The waltz principal melody was based on the waltz duet \\"K√∂nnt' ich mit Ihnen fliegen durchs Leben\\" or 'Could I but fly with you through life' sung in Act 2 of the operetta. The operetta itself was a success at its first performance and Strauss long adopted the practice of opera composers to draft melodies from their successful stage works to be arranged as a new piece to boost sales of sheet music, thus he composed this 'Cagliostro-Walzer'. The entire waltz consists of just 3 two-part waltz sections which is also a new Strauss development from the previous 5 two-part sections heard in his earlier works. The piece began with a loud march melody in the C major key before progressing into waltz time. The principal waltz theme in C major is also in the style of The Blue Danube, where three notes in rising melody starts off the waltz proper. Waltz 2A carries the principal key in C major as well but quickly interpolates with a more thoughtful passage in E-flat major. Waltz 3A starts off in F major in a hesitant mood, proceeding into a climax with cymbals. A brief coda enters and the entire Waltz 2B is repeated. After a short chorded passage, the swirling Waltz 1A recurs and Strauss signs off the waltz with a strong chord and long snare-drumroll.

After the surrender of Germany, the districts of Schwarzenberg, Stollberg, and Aue in the Ore Mountains were left unoccupied for unknown reasons. This led to anti-fascist groups forming local governments in those towns and villages, ending with the area's occupation by Soviet troops on June 24, 1945. There has been speculation as to why neither American nor Soviet troops immediately occupied the area. One explanation is that the Soviets and Americans agreed to halt on the banks of the Mulde river. Because there are several rivers with this name, and the Schwarzenberg area lies between them, there may have been some misunderstanding over the agreed- to boundaries. Another possible explanation is that the Allies simply overlooked the area until the lack of occupation was noticed. Government and organisation The authority of the newly generated anti-fascist councils was still subject to democratic structures, though they were never intended to build a nation-state. The councils dealt with humanitarian issues since the unoccupied county of Schwarzenberg was not supported by any military force at the time. Issues the council dealt with included the maintenance of law and order, as well as dealing with scattered German soldiers fleeing west to avoid Soviet imprisonment. After the Soviet occupation in June 1945, the councils were dismissed. However, their work was appreciated by the Soviets, and some councilmen kept their positions in similar Soviet-initiated councils for several years even after the German Democratic Republic was founded in 1949. Popular culture The name \\"Free Republic of Schwarzenberg\\" is derived from the 1984 novel Schwarzenberg by Stefan Heym. As the novel is based on actual events, the name has become a convenient descriptor, although the book is primarily a work of fiction rather than a historical record. The Haus Schwarzenberg structure in Berlin is named after the Free Republic of Schwarzenberg. The place contains street art, galleries, shops, and a center named after diarist and Holocaust victim Anne Frank.

It was developed and published by Perihelion Software. Its primary architecture is the Transputer. Helios' microkernel implements a distributed namespace and messaging protocol, through which services are accessed. A POSIX compatibility library enables the use of Unix application software, and the system provides most of the usual Unix utilities. Work on Helios began in the autumn of 1986. Its success was limited by the commercial failure of the Transputer, and efforts to move to other architectures met with limited success. Perihelion ceased trading in 1998.  Development  In the early 1980s, Tim King joined MetaComCo from the University of Bath, bringing with him some rights to an operating system called TRIPOS. MetaComCo secured a contract from Commodore to work on AmigaOS, with the AmigaDOS component being derived from TRIPOS. In 1986, King left MetaComCo to found Perihelion Software, and began development of a parallel operating system, initially targeted at the INMOS Transputer series of processors. Helios extended TRIPOS' use of a light-weight message passing architecture to networked parallel machines. Helios 1.0 was the first commercial release in the summer of 1988, followed by version 1.1 in autumn 1989, 1.1a in early 1990, 1.2 in December 1990 followed by 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 updates. Version 1.3 was a significant upgrade with numerous utility, library, server and driver improvements. The last commercial release was 1.3.1. Later Tim King and Nick Garnett gave permission to release the sources under the GNU Public License v3.  Kernel and nucleus  Helios was designed for a network of multiple nodes, connected by multiple high-bandwidth communications links. Nodes can be dedicated processing nodes, or processors with attached I/O devices. Small systems might consist of a host PC or workstation connected to a set of several processing nodes, while larger systems might have hundreds of processing nodes supported by dedicated nodes for storage, graphics, or user terminals. A Helios network requires at least one I/O Server node that is able to provide a file system server, console server and reset control for the processing nodes. At power on, the Helios nucleus is bootstrapped from the I/O server into the network. Each node is booted using a small first-stage loader that then downloads and initialises the nucleus proper. Once running, a node communicates with its neighbours, booting them in turn, if required. The Helios nucleus is composed of the kernel, libraries, loader service and the processor manager service. = Kernel = The Helios kernel is effectively a micro-kernel, providing a minimal abstraction above the hardware with most services implemented as non-privileged server processes. It provides memory allocation, process management, message passing and synchronisation primitives. = Libraries = The Helios nucleus contains three libraries: the system, server and utility libraries. The utility library provides some basic library routines for C programming that are shared by the other libraries. The system library provides the basic kernel interface, converting C function calls into messages sent to and from the kernel. It implements an abstraction that allows communication between processes regardless of their location in the network. The server library provides name space support functions for writing Helios servers, as described below. = Loader and processor manager = The remaining components of the nucleus are the loader and processor manager servers. Once the kernel is loaded, these processes are bootstrapped, and they integrate the newly running node into the Helios network.  Naming and servers  A key feature in Helios is its distributed name system. A Helios network implements a single unified name space, with a virtual root node, optional virtual network structuring nodes, nodes for each processor, and sub-processor name spaces provided by services. Names are similar to those in Unix, using a forward slash separating character and textual naming elements. The name space is managed by the network server, which is started by the I/O server once the nucleus is booted on its first attached node. The network server uses a provided network map to allocate processor names and initialise drivers for hardware devices at specific nodes in the network. The kernel includes a name resolver, and manages a local cache of routes to previously resolved names. Servers are Helios processes that implement the General Server Protocol, typically with the support of the server library. The server protocol is conceptually similar to the Unix VFS API, and more closely to Plan 9's 9P. It requires that servers represent their resources as files, with standardised open/read/write/close-style operations. Similar to facilities such as /proc in Plan 9 and other Unix-like operating systems, resources such as files, I/O devices, users, and processes are all represented as virtual files in the namespace served by their managing process. Key servers in Helios are the previously mentioned loader, processor manager and network server, together with the session manager, the window server and the file server. Others include the keyboard, mouse, RS232 and Centronics servers (built into the host I/O server), the null server (like Unix's /dev/null), and the logger server (like Unix's syslog).  Programming and utilities  From a user's perspective, Helios is quite similar to Unix. Most of the usual utility programs are provided, some with extensions to reflect the availability of multiple machines. What is not immediately apparent is that Helios extends the notion of Unix pipes into a language called Component Distribution Language (CDL). In CDL, a typical Unix shell pipeline such as \`ls  more\` is called a task force, and is transparently distributed by the Task Force Manager server across the available CPUs. CDL extends traditional Unix syntax with additional operators for bi-directional pipes, sequential and parallel process farm operators, load balancing and resource management. Helios applications can be written using C, C++, FORTRAN and Modula-2. The POSIX library assists in porting existing Unix software, and provides a familiar environment for programmers. Helios does not support programs written in the occam programming language.  Hardware  Helios was predominantly intended to be used with Transputer systems. It is compatible with products from various manufacturers including INMOS' TRAM systems, the Meiko CS, Parsytec MultiCluster and SuperCluster, and the Telmat T.Node. The Atari Transputer Workstation was perhaps the highest profile Helios hardware, at least outside academia. Helios can run on T4xx and T8xx, 32-bit Transputers (but not the T2xx 16-bit models) and includes device drivers for various SCSI, Ethernet and graphics hardware from Inmos, Transtech, and others. In its later versions, Helios was ported to the TI TMS320C40 DSP, and the ARM architecture used by the Active Book tablet device.

The conflict took place in what is now part of Pelham Bay Park (namely the Split Rock Golf Course and Pelham Bay Golf Course) in the Bronx, New York City and the towns of Pelham Manor and Pelham in Westchester County, New York. On October 12, British forces landed at Throgs Neck in order to execute a flanking maneuver that would trap Gen. George Washington, commander-in-chief of the American revolutionary forces, and the main body of the Continental Army on the island of Manhattan. The Americans thwarted the landing, and Gen. Sir William Howe, commander-in-chief of British forces in North America, looked for another location along Long Island Sound to disembark his troops. On October 18, he landed 4,000 men at Pelham, north of Throgs Neck. Inland were 750 men of a brigade under the command of the American Col. John Glover. Glover positioned his troops behind a series of stone walls and attacked the British advance units. As the British overran each position, the American troops fell back and reorganized behind the next wall. After several such attacks, the British broke off, and the Americans retreated. The battle delayed British movements long enough for Washington to move the main army to White Plains and avoid being surrounded on Manhattan. After losing to the British in a battle at White Plains, and losing Fort Washington, Washington retreated across New Jersey to Pennsylvania. Background After a victory at the Battle of Long Island in late August, the commander-in-chief of British forces in North America, Gen. Sir William Howe landed his troops at Kip's Bay, on the eastern shore of present-day Manhattan, on September 15.McCullough, p. 209 George Washington and his army retreated to Harlem Heights, a plateau situated on the north end of Manhattan Island.Ward, p. 246. Washington was in a good defensive position, with his rear guarded on two sides by rocky heights and the Hudson and Harlem Rivers, and with more rocky heights to the south between his forces and the British. The next day, the British attacked the Americans and were defeated at the Battle of Harlem Heights. There was very little action for the next month,Abbatt, p. 1 while the two forces remained in their fortified positions, each unable to decide upon their next move.Ward, p. 253. The Americans believed Howe would either attack Fort Washington or attempt to flank the Americans with a landing at some point on Long Island Sound. A council-of-war decided to guard against both possibilities; Washington kept 10,000 men to defend Harlem Heights and Fort Washington, while Maj. Gen. William Heath took 10,000 troops to defend Kingsbridge, and Maj. Gen. Nathanael Greene was given 5,000 troops to defend the other side of the Hudson River, near Fort Constitution. After 26 days of contemplation, Howe decided against a frontal attack on Harlem Heights and Fort Washington, and chose instead to attempt a flanking maneuver.Ward, p. 255. On October 12, leaving behind three brigades under the command of Lord Hugh Percy on Manhattan Island, Howe embarked his main army in 80 vessels and proceeded up the East River, through Hell Gate, and landed at Throgs Neck. Throgs Neck-- originally known as Throckmorton's, and also known as Throck's, Frog's Neck, and Frog's Point--is a narrow spit of land that sits between the East River and Long Island Sound. Conveniently for Howe, there was a road running from Throgs Neck to Kingsbridge, directly behind the American forces. Howe hoped to use this road to flank the Americans and pin them against the Hudson River. Under the cover of fog, an advance force of 4,000 men under the command of General Henry Clinton was landed on Throgs Neck. To their dismay, they found they were not on a peninsula, but on an island, separated from the mainland by a creek and a marsh. There were two ways to get to the mainland: a causeway and bridge at the lower end, and a ford at the other. The Americans were guarding both. Col. Edward Hand and a detachment of 25 men from the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment positioned themselves behind a length of cordwood along the causeway, after having removed the planks of wood from the bridge. They surprised the British troops, who fell back and made an attempt to cross at the ford, which was guarded by another detachment. The Americans guarding both positions were quickly reinforced, and the defenders soon numbered over 1,800 men. Howe decided it would be better to retreat and land somewhere else.McCullough, p. 230. He made camp on Throgs Neck and remained there for six days while supplies and reinforcements, including 7,000 Hessian soldiers under the command of Gen. Wilhelm von Knyphausen, were brought up from New York.Ward, p. 256. Just after midnight on October 18, Howe embarked his army again and decided to land at Pell's Point near the town of Pelham, a few miles to the north.Abbatt, p. 5. After hearing of the landing on Throgs Neck, Washington knew he risked entrapment on Manhattan. He made the decision to move his army to White Plains, where he believed they would be safe. By October 17, the Continental Army was on its way to White Plains,McCullough, p. 231. leaving behind 2,000 men to garrison Fort Washington. Battle Statue of Glover on Commonwealth Avenue, Boston At dawn, the British began to land on the shore, Clinton's advance guard of 4,000 British light infantry and Hessian j√§gers landing first. Inland, opposing them, was a brigade of some 750 men under the command of John Glover. Glover was atop a hill with a telescope when he noticed the British ships.Abbatt, p. 6 (hill on the west side of the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Hutchinson River on East Sanford Blvd. in Mount Vernon, NY on the opposite side of the Hutchinson River Parkway and Pelham Memorial High School) Glover sent an officer, Major William Lee, to report to Charles Lee, Washington's second in command, and ask for orders. However, Lee did not give any orders, and in the absence of orders Glover chose to attack.Abbatt, p. 11 Glover turned out his brigade, which consisted of the 14th, 13th, 3rd and the 26th Continental Regiments. Glover left the 150 men of the 14th Continentals behind in reserve.Billias, p. 116 Glover had not closed half the distance when he ran into approximately 30 skirmishers. Glover ordered a Captain and his 40-man company forward as an advance guard to hold the British in check, while Glover organized the rest of the force. Glover prepared an ambush by placing the main body in staggered positions behind the stone walls that lined either side of the laneway leading from the beachhead to the interior. Glover instructed each of the regiments to hold their position as long as they could and then to fall back to a position in the rear, while the next unit took up the fighting.Billias, p. 117 Glover then rode up to take command of the advance guard. The advance guard and the British began to engage each other, both sides taking casualties.Abbatt, p. 13 After a little while the British were reinforced, and Glover ordered a retreat, which was done without confusion. The British troops began to advance at the retreating Americans. However, the 200 troops of the 13th Continentals that Glover had stationed behind the stone wall stood up and fired at the British when there were only 30 yards away.Abbatt, p. 14 The ambush worked, and the column of British troops took heavy losses and fell back to the main body of the invading army. William Howe, leader of the British force at the Battle of Pell's Point The British waited half an hour before attacking again.Abbatt, p. 15 This time when they attacked, they attacked with all 4,000 men and seven cannon. The British bombarded the American position behind the stone wall as their infantry advanced. The cannon fire was ineffective, and when the British were 50 yards away the Americans fired a volley which stopped the British infantry. The British returned fire, and musket and rifle fire ensued for 20 minutes, the British supported by cannon, at which point the lead American regiment fell back under cover of the next reserve regiment. The 3rd Continental Regiment was stationed behind the stone wall on the opposite side of the road.Billias, p. 118 The British attacked the position of the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued.Abbatt, p. 16 Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans, and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone wall on the crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.Abbatt, p. 17Billias, p. 119 A reconnaissance party of 30 men was sent out from behind the third stone wall to see if the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British.Abbatt, p. 18 Howe camped on a hill on the opposite side of the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream. Aftermath The British movements from Pell's Point to White Plains. The next day, Glover and his force retreated to the town of Yonkers. American casualties were 8 killed and 13 wounded. British and Hessian casualties are not known.Lowell's The Hessians and the Other German Auxiliaries of Great Britain in the American Revolution lists p.209 Hessian Casualties from October 9 to October 23, 1776 as 13 killed 63 wounded 23 missing Howe's official dispatch listed British casualties as 3 killed and 20 wounded, although the report did not include Hessian casualties. As the Hessians made up the majority of the landing force, it is reasonable to expect they made up the majority of the casualties.Billias, p. 120 Over the next few days, from knowledge collected from British deserters, the Americans estimated that the British lost between 800 and 1,000 killed or wounded, likely an exaggeration.Abbatt, p. 20 Colonel Loammi Baldwin, (an officer and fruit fancier whose fame came in the Baldwin apple) who was present at the battle, estimated that the Americans had killed 200 British and Hessians, but historian David McCullough says this was \\"undoubtedly an exaggeration.\\" Historian George Athan Billias argues in support of Baldwin's estimates, due in part to the corroborating admission of another British deserter.Billias, p. 121 Regardless, the combined British and Hessian casualties were almost certainly larger than those of the Americans. With the British advance delayed, the main American army under Washington was able to safely evacuate from Harlem (on the island of Manhattan) to White Plains.McCullough, p. 233 Howe slowly moved his army through New Rochelle and Scarsdale. On October 28, he sent 13,000 men to attack the Americans, resulting in a minor victory over Washington at the Battle of White Plains. Fort Washington, the last American stronghold on Manhattan, fell on November 16.McCullough, p. 241 With these defeats, Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania, paving the way for the Battles of Trenton and Princeton.McCullough, p. 290 See also *Saint Paul's Church National Historic Site References Bibliography   External links *Historic Pelham *NPS page for Saint Paul's Church *Glover's Skirmish in Eastchester Pell's Point Category:1776 in the United States Category:Conflicts in 1776 Pell's Point Pell's Point Pell's Point Category:1776 in New York (state) Category:History of the Bronx Category:Pelham Bay Park ","title":"Battle of Pell's Point"},{"id":"1249781","text":"Steven Douglas White is an English drummer who has worked extensively with Paul Weller and The Style Council among others. Musical career White was given a small drum as a child by his uncle and upon joining his local Boys' Brigade he began to learn his craft. As with White's band mate Paul Weller, he was given full support from his parents who went out of their way to help their son develop. White spent his youth having lessons from the late George Scott of Wanstead and learning from recordings of Buddy Rich and Louis Bellson. White later took lessons with drumming teacher Bob Armstrong at Bob's Masterclass studio, then in Hornchurch, Essex. White complemented his work gigging with local bands with part-time work, spending any spare cash on updating his collection of jazz records. In 1983, White auditioned for an unnamed band which turned out to be Paul Weller's new group, The Style Council. Weller was impressed with the 17-year-old drummer's jazz background and asked White to come back the following day. White stayed with the band for some years but was never actually invited to join, even though he appeared in most of their videos and on all but a few recordings. He became the youngest drummer on stage at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in 1985. He also performed at Live 8 with The Who at Hyde Park in 2005.

He has won three Tony Awards, all in the category of Featured Actor in a Musical. He was the first to portray the Scarecrow in the stage version of The Wiz (a role assumed by Michael Jackson in the 1978 film adaptation). Early life Battle was born in Neubr√ºcke, Hoppst√§dten, West Germany, part of the Baumholder Army Military Community, and raised in Washington, D.C. and New York City. His mother was a homemaker and his father a U.S. army officer.Hinton Battle Biography (1956‚Äì) Battle's talent became apparent at the age of nine.

The waltz's title was a chronicle of events in and around Vienna as the Imperial City underwent vast development through the years.

He batted switch and threw right-handed. Wilson was a career .244 hitter with 22 home runs, with three grand slams, and 141 RBI in 555 games. Versatile around the diamond, Wilson had a rather mobile career playing (mostly as a backup) at second base, third and shortstop. Wilson was known to play hitters well and with a strong arm, had some pop in his bat, and would run occasionally, but did not to try to steal very often. In 2001, he was scheduled to be on American Airlines Flight 587 that crashed in a New York City neighborhood. However, when the Yankees lost the 2001 World Series to the Arizona Diamondbacks (and thus there was no Yankees victory parade), Wilson flew home a few days earlier and was not on the flight.Olney, Buster. \\"Epilogue: 'The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty'.\\" ESPN.

In 2003, Wilson was involved in an incident where Manny Ramirez missed a game claiming to have a sore throat, but was later found to actually have been partying in a hotel room with Wilson. At the time, Wilson played for the rival New York Yankees. During Wilson's time with the Yankees, he was often placed in the lineup over superior players when the team faced Boston Red Sox ace Pedro Mart√≠nez. This was due to his inexplicable ability to hit Martinez well over his career. In 25 at bats, Wilson had a .440 career batting average against Martinez. Wilson was signed by the Baltimore Orioles to a minor-league contract before the 2005 season. He was released in May, and subsequently signed with the Cubs. After appearing in fifteen games with the Cubs, he was released a second time. In 2006, Wilson played for the Boston Red Sox's Triple-A team, the Pawtucket Red Sox, and retired in August.

He lived around the 31st century BC and is thought to have had a long reign.  Identity  = Name= The commonly used name Hor- Aha is a rendering of the pharaoh's Horus-name, an element of the royal titulary associated with the god Horus, and is more fully given as Horus-Aha meaning Horus the Fighter. Manetho's record Aegyptiaca (translating to History of Egypt) lists his Greek name as Athothis, or \\"Athot√≠s\\". For the Early Dynastic Period, the archaeological record refers to the pharaohs by their Horus-names, while the historical record, as evidenced in the Turin and Abydos king lists, uses an alternative royal titulary, the nebty-name. The different titular elements of a pharaoh's name were often used in isolation, for brevity's sake, although the choice varied according to circumstance and period.Lloyd 1994: 7 Mainstream Egyptological consensus follows the findings of Flinders Petrie in reconciling the two records and connects Hor-Aha (archaeological) with the nebty-name Ity (historical).Edwards 1971: 13Cervell√≥-Autuori 2003: 174 Inscription bearing Hor-Aha's serekh together with a Nebty-name expressed with the game-board hieroglyph, which could be read mn. The same process has led to the identification of the historical Menes (a nebty-name) with Narmer (a Horus-name) evidenced in the archaeological record (both figures are credited with the unification of Egypt and as the first pharaoh of Dynasty I) as the predecessor of Hor-Aha (the second pharaoh). = Theories = There has been some controversy about Hor- Aha. SomeStephan Seidlmayer, The Rise of the State to the Second Dynasty, quoted in Egypt: The World of the Pharaohs, 2004 (translated from German, 2010), believe him to be the same individual as the legendary Menes and that he was the one to unify all of Egypt. Others claim he was the son of Narmer, the pharaoh who unified Egypt. Narmer and Menes may have been one pharaoh, referred to with more than one name. Regardless, considerable historical evidence from the period points to Narmer as the pharaoh who first unified Egypt (see Narmer Palette) and to Hor-Aha as his son and heir.  Reign  =Successor to Narmer= Seal impressions discovered by G√ºnter Dreyer in the Umm El Qa'ab from Den and Qa'a burials identify Hor-Aha as the second pharaoh of the first dynasty.Toby A.H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. S. 69‚Äì70 His predecessor Narmer had united Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom, Upper and Lower Egypt. Hor-Aha probably ascended the throne in the mid 31st century. =Interior policy= Hor-Aha seems to have conducted many religious activities. A visit to a shrine of the goddess Neith is recorded on several tablets from his reign.W. M. Flinders Petrie: The Royal Tombs of the Earliest Dynasties 1901, Part II, London 1901, Taf. X,2; XI,2 The sanctuary of Neith he visited was located in the north-west of the Nile Delta at Sais.Toby A.H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. S. 291 Furthermore, the first known representation of the sacred Henu-bark of the god Seker was found engraved on a year tablet dating from his reign.Toby A.H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. S. 301 Mastaba attributed to Neithhotep which is believed to have been built by Hor-Aha. Vessel inscriptions, labels and sealings from the graves of Hor- Aha and Queen Neithhotep suggest that this queen died during the reign of Aha. He arranged for her burial in a magnificent mastaba excavated by Jacques de Morgan.De Morgan Recherches sur les origines de l'Egypte II. Ethnographie pr√©historique et tombeau royal de Negadah Queen Neithhotep is plausibly Aha's motherSilke Roth: Die K√∂nigsm√ºtter des Alten √Ñgypten von der Fr√ºhzeit bis zum Ende der 12. Dynastie. Wiesbaden 2001, S. 31‚Äì35 The selection of the cemetery of Naqada as the resting place of Neithhotep is a strong indication that she came from this province. This, in turn, supports the view that Narmer married a member of the ancient royal line of Naqada to strengthen the domination of the Thinite kings over the region. However, in January 2016, a rock inscription has demonstrated that Neithhotep was actually a queen regent early during the reign of Djer, Hor-Aha's successor.Owen Jarus, Live Science, Early Egyptian Queen Revealed in 5,000-Year-Old Hieroglyphs, Therefore, the cemetery evidence above only proves that Neithhotep did live during the reign of Hor-Aha but succeeded him into Djer's reign. Most importantly, the oldest mastaba at the North Saqqara necropolis of Memphis dates to his reign. The mastaba belongs to an elite member of the administration who may have been a relative of Hor-Aha, as was customary at the time. This is a strong indication of the growing importance of Memphis during Aha's reign. =Economic development= Few artifacts remain of Hor-Aha's reign. However, the finely executed copper-axe heads, faience vessel fragments,F. Petrie Abydos, II, London: Egypt Exploration Fund. Memoir 23, A. J. Spencer Early Egypt: The rise of civilisation in the Nile Valley, London: British Museum Press 1993 ivory box and inscribed white marbles all testify to the flourishing of craftsmanship during Aha's time in power. =Activities outside Egypt= Inscription on an ivory tablet from Abydos suggests that Hor-Aha led an expedition against the Nubians. On a year tablet, a year is explicitly called 'Year of smiting of Ta-Sety' (i.e. Nubia).W. M. Flinders Petrie: The Royal Tombs of the Earliest Dynasties 1901, Part II, London 1901, Taf. XI,1 During Hor-Aha's reign, trade with the Southern Levant seems to have been on the decline. Contrary to his predecessor Narmer, Hor-Aha is not attested outside of the Nile Valley. This may point to a gradual replacement of long-distance trade between Egypt and its eastern neighbors by a more direct exploitation of the local resources by the Egyptians. Vessel fragment analysis from an Egyptian outpost at En Besor suggests that it was active during Hor-Aha's reign. Other Egyptian settlements are known to have been active at the time as well (Byblos and along the Lebanese coast). Finally, Hor-Aha's tomb yielded vessel fragments from the Southern Levant.Toby A.H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. S. 71  Family  Clay seal fragment bearing Hor-Aha's serekh together with ·∏• and t signs, perhaps meant to signify a personal name Htj Hor-Aha's chief wife was Benerib, whose name was \\"written alongside his on a number of [historical] pieces, in particular, from tomb B14 at Abydos, Egypt\\".Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004), p.46Walter Bryan Emery: √Ñgypten ‚Äì Geschichte und Kultur der Fr√ºhzeit. S. 47f.Toby A.H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. S. 70 Tomb B14 is located directly adjacent to Hor-Aha's sepulchre.Dodson & Hilton, p.46 Hor-Aha also had another wife, Khenthap,Queens of Egypt, informations based on the book The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt with whom he became father of Djer. She is mentioned as Djer's mother on the Cairo Annals Stone. Hor- Aha's mother is believed to be Neithhotep. She is also believed to be wife of the late Narmer and possibly remarries one of Hor-Aha's top three Grand Viziers by the name of Rekhit after the death of Narmer. The massive Naqada tomb Neithhotep was believed to be buried has 10 inscriptions of her in it. The same tomb also has 15 inscriptions to Rekhit. Tomb Hor-Aha's tomb comprises three chambers B10, B15 and B19, shown in inset. B14 could be the tomb of Hor-Aha's wife Benerib. The tomb of Hor-Aha is located in the necropolis of the kings of the 1st Dynasty at Abydos, known as the Umm el- Qa'ab. It comprises three large chambers (designated B10, B15, and B19), which are directly adjacent to Narmer's tomb.W. M. Flinders Petrie: The Royal Tombs of the Earliest Dynasties 1901, Part II, London 1901, S. 7‚Äì8, Taf. LIX; and more recently: Werner Kaiser: Einige Bemerkungen zur √§gyptischen Fr√ºhzeit, In: Zeitschrift f√ºr √Ñgyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde 91 (1964), 86‚Äì124, and 96‚Äì102 The chambers are rectangular, directly dug in the desert floor, their walls lined with mud bricks. The tombs of Narmer and Ka had only two adjacent chambers, while the tomb of Hor-Aha comprises three substantially larger yet separated chambers. The reason for this architecture is that it was difficult at that time to build large ceilings above the chambers, as timber for these structures often had to be imported from Palestine. A striking innovation of Hor-Aha's tomb is that members of the royal household were buried with the pharaoh, the earliest known retainer sacrifices in Egypt. It is unclear if they were killed or committed suicide. Among those buried were servants, dwarfs, women and even dogs. A total of 36 subsidiary burials were laid out in three parallel rows north-east of Hor-Aha's main chambers. As a symbol of royalty Hor-Aha was even given a group of young lions.

It is one of the two species of the genus Rupicapra, the other being the chamois, Rupicapra rupicapra. It is in the bovid subfamily Caprinae, along with sheep and goats. Up to 80 cm tall, its summer coat is a ruddy brown; in winter it is black/brown with darker patches around the eyes. Both males and females have backward-hooked horns up to 20 cm in length. They browse on grass, lichens and buds of trees. Sure- footed and agile, they are found anywhere up to 3000 m. Like other species of chamois, it was hunted almost to extinction, especially in the 1940s, for the production of chamois leather. The population has since recovered and in 2002 was estimated to be about 25,000.

Circumstances In June 1967 the Independent Television Authority (ITA) had announced changes to the structure and contracts of the ITV network in the United Kingdom, to take effect in July 1968. Several changes were announced that would have far-reaching effects for British television. The UK press decided that the most dramatic news was the loss of the Wales and West contract, held by TWW since 1958, to a consortium headed by and named after Lord Harlech. TWW fought the ITA's decision, both formally and through the press.The Daily Telegraph, \\"'Capricious injustice' to TWW\\", 21 June 1967, quoted in Death of TWW: Telegraph 21/06/67, accessed 16 March 2008 However, the ITA remained resolute that it was legally entitled to remove any contract at any time for any reason,The Daily Telegraph, \\"Hill replies to Derby on TWW\\", 20 June 1967, quoted in Death of TWW: Telegraph 20/06/67, accessed 16 March 2008 and the board of TWW eventually accepted this and announced it would carry on providing a programme service to the area until the end of the contract period. Problems with TWW Standard regulatory practice at the time stated that the new incumbent of a licence should take on all available staff of the outgoing company. However, the new licence holder, Harlech Television, intended to dismiss all the on-screen personnel of TWW, and launch with a fresh team. The board of TWW were advised not to take a stake in Harlech that was offered to them by the ITA, but this had the effect of depressing the company's share price.Wagner, R and Carrington J, The Times, \\"TWW worst hit as ¬£11.3m is wiped off television shares\\", 13 June 1967, quoted in From the City: The Times 13/06/67 Photomusications (Transdiffusion), accessed 16 March 2008 It eventually became clear to the board that to raise the maximum amount of money for shareholders, they should \\"sell\\" the last part of the broadcast contract to Harlech. The ITA accepted this and the sale went through for ¬£500,000. However, Harlech were not yet in a position to begin production and would therefore have to launch their promised new service using \\"in the can\\" TWW productions. ITA solution The ITA suggested Harlech would receive all the advertising revenue from the handover date, and pay TWW a fee to continue local production, while Harlech continued to prepare its own programmes for the original 31 July launch. The interim contract would use neither company's name, and the literal Independent Television Service for Wales and the West was chosen. This created a cordon sanitaire between the end of TWW and the start of Harlech. Nevertheless, the \\"in the can\\" TWW productions, of which there were many, still carried \\"TWW presents\\" and \\"TWW production\\" captions. The presentation retained TWW in-vision announcers, giving the impression that little had changed. A temporary ident was designed, with four white horizontal bars shooting towards the viewer, electronic music and the name revealing itself a line at a time. The former TWW clock was retained. This was referred to in the local press as \\"TWW's revenge\\" on Harlech. The situation lasted just under three months. The ITSWW service was never referred to as such on air, but it continued both of the former TWW dual services under the names 'South Wales and West' and 'Teledu Cymru' ‚Äì the latter having been the existing on-air name in that area. Both names were prefixed with the new phrase \\"Independent Television Service\\". Extensive broadsheet press advertising was taken out to explain the arrangements to those viewers deemed to be interested. Nothing was placed in the tabloids.

A Coca-Cola \\"Brain Freeze\\" Slurpee. A Slurpee machine with 2 flavor barrels in a 7-Eleven store in Taiwan. Slurpee is the 7-Eleven- exclusive brand name for a frozen carbonated drink. History Machines to make frozen beverages were invented by Omar Knedlik in the late 1950s. The idea for a slushed ice drink came when Knedlik's soda fountain broke down, forcing him to put his sodas in a freezer to stay cool, which caused them to become slushy. The result was popular with customers, which gave him the idea to make a machine to help make a \\"slushy\\" from carbonated beverages. When it became popular, Knedlik hired artist Ruth E. Taylor to create a name and logo for his invention. She created the Icee name and designed the original logo, which is used today. Early prototypes for the machine made use of an automobile air conditioning unit. After a successful trial of Icee machines in 100 stores,Liles, Allen. Oh Thank Heaven! The story of the Southland Corporation, 1977, p. 182 7-Eleven in 1965 made a licensing deal with The Icee Company to sell the product under certain conditions. Two of these were that 7-Eleven must use a different name for the product, and that the company was allowed to sell the product only in 7-Eleven locations in the US, a non- compete clause ensuring the two drinks never went head to head for distribution rights. 7-Eleven then sold the product that in 1966 became known as the \\"Slurpee\\" (for the sound made when drinking them). The term was coined by Bob Stanford, a 7-Eleven ad agency director. The Slurpee machine has a separate spout, or spigot, for each flavor at the front of a tumbler or freezer, from which spigots they dispense their own Slurpees. When Slurpees were first introduced, the dispensing machine was located behind the counter, and the clerk dispensed the product. Common flavors are frozen Cherry, Coke, and Mountain Dew, but new flavors are introduced regularly. In the Slurpee's early history, flavors rotated much more frequently than today. Slurpee flavors were given novelty names such as Pink Fink, Adults Only, Moonshine, Kissin' Cousin, Gully Washer, Sticky Icky, and Redeye. In 1990, Dallas-based Southland Corp., 7-Eleven's founder and US operator, went bankrupt, but Seven- Eleven Japan, and its parent Ito-Yokado, bought 70% of Southland in 1991 for $430 million and quickly launched renovations of the US stores. As a result, the US chains became more efficient, though 1,218 stores closed. Following the Japanese model, the new 7-Elevens set up a weekly system to monitor inventories to ensure popular items are always in stock.Schuman, Michael. \\"Sushi Slurpee.\\" Forbes 156.5 (1995): 12. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 19 Oct. 2010. Worldwide consumption Canadians purchase an average of 30 million Slurpee drinks per year. Manitoba was crowned the Slurpee Capital of the World for the twentieth year in a row in 2019. 7-Eleven stores across Winnipeg sell an average of 188,833 Slurpee drinks per month. The rest of Canada sells an average of 179,700 per month, which makes Winnipeggers the world leader of Slurpee sales. Unlike their counterparts in America, Canadian Slurpees do not contain yucca extract which gives it the airy consistency American Slurpees are known for. 6.6 million Slurpee drinks are sold in Australia each year. Dietary information The Diet Pepsi flavor uses sodium caseinate as an anti-freezing agent (sugar is a natural antifreeze in other flavors) which only gives it the status of kosher dairy. The Pi√±a Colada, Twizzler Strawberry, Tropicana Grape Wild Strawberry, and Monster Black flavors are not kosher. There is an updated list on the Chicago Rabbinical Council website. Promotions In 1965-66, Icee transitioned to Slurpee in 7-Eleven stores and sales. By the spring of 1967, Slurpee machines were in all 7-Eleven stores. In 1967, Top 40 AM radio stations were losing market share to FM stations. DJs were desperate to gain audience attention. Slurpee was a kid / teen / young adult product, the main AM radio audience. The Stanford Agency created a \\"media blitz\\" to launch Slurpee and flew agency staff to all Top 40 markets with 7-Eleven stores to introduce Slurpee and the comedy commercials with funny voices and sound effects that told stories about the Strange Things That Happened To People Who Slurp. The agency backed the Slurpee launch with a very large media budget. DJs used \\"drops\\" or snippets from the \\"crazy\\" commercials in their programs to gain audience share. The campaign became an AM radio sensation. The Stanford Agency followed the Strange Things launch with a campaign that threw away product names like lemon-lime, cola or what have you, and instead created 26-weeks of :60 second commercials about Slurpees with Funny Names like Sticky Icky, Redeye, Moon Shine, Pink Fink, Adults Only, Kissin Cousin, and Gully Washer. These commercials were even more popular. Each flavor had a pin associated with it. There were pins made for the flavors There was also a generic pin that simply stated \\"I have Slurped\\". In 1968, the Official Slurp Hat was offered. In 1970, 7-Eleven released a 45 RPM 7\\" single record entitled \\"Dance the Slurp\\" that was given away with Slurpee purchases. The dance side was written by Tom Merriman, one of the fathers of radio jungle production. The B-side was a comedy bit detailing \\"strange things\\" that happen to people who \\"slurp\\" at 7-Eleven. The record is considered highly collectible today. In 1999, \\"Dance the Slurp\\" was sampled by DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist for their Brainfreeze mix album. Slurpee became the top selling 7-Eleven product and kids / teens / young adults came in regularly for the latest \\"flavor\\" with less and less promotional expense. After Funny Names, the next innovation was Slurpee Cups. In 1972, Baseball Slurpee Cups, plastic cups with illustrations of favorite players including Johnny Bench, Pete Rose and others. In 1973, Baseball Slurpee Cups, with illustrations of current stars and early players like Honus Wagner. In 1973, the DC Comics Super Hero Cups, a 60 cup series. 1973 Endangered Species Cups ‚Äì Congress passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on December 14, 1973. This triggered 7-Eleven making an advanced of $250,000 representing 1-cent from the sale of more than 2-million Endangered Species Cups to the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) who purchased Bald Eagle habitat. The transfer of land to the U.S. Government and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service took place on December 19, 1974 and came to be known as the Carl E.

In 1994, 7-Eleven sought to remake Slurpee's \\"brain freeze\\" campaign targeted to the adolescent MTV audience. The creative directors assigned the task of creating four new commercials to the Brothers Quay, and Boston-based Olive Jar Animation. Known for their bizarre aesthetic and influence in the stop-motion animations industry, the Quays based their \\"brain freeze\\" ad on a late 19th-century photograph of a female contortionist. In the commercial, a curtain reveals the contortionist balancing on two chairs, bending over backward to sip a Slurpee.

Other \\"Slurpee-flavored\\" products have included Slurpee gum, which had a liquid candy center. In 2002, The World Wrestling Federation launched promotional cups featuring the likes of The Rock, Rob Van Dam, Lita with The Hardy Boyz, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Undertaker and Trish Stratus. The designs were on 40-ounce Slurpee cups and 34-ounce thermal mugs. In 2004, 7-Eleven created an edible Slurpee straw. In 2005, 7-Eleven promoted the film \\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\\" by making a Mountain Dew Pitch Black \\"Dark Side\\" Slurpee which came in a cup shaped like Darth Vader's helmet. In 2007, as part of the Kwik-E-Mart promotion for the feature film The Simpsons Movie, Slurpees at 7-Elevens were renamed \\"Squishees\\" (the analog in the Simpsons universe) and sold in special collector cups. Starting on November 4, 2008, 7-Eleven worked with Nexon to promote Slurpees to gamers that play on Nexon.net. The Slurpee cups had images printed on them from certain Nexon games, and a code printed on them that could be redeemed on a website for special in-game items. Also for professional wrestling WWE's Summerslam 2010 7-Eleven offered collectible Slurpee cups of Rey Mysterio, John Cena, The Undertaker, Triple H, and Kelly Kelly. They also came with collectible straws with figures of each wrestler on them. The flavor used for the promotion was Barq's Root Beer. As well as for the 2011 SummerSlam, which again featured Cena, The Miz, 2009 WWE Hall of Famer \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin, and The Rock. The flavor used for the promotion was Fanta's Berry Citrus Slam. Every year on 11 July (7/11, month/day), 7-Eleven offered a free 7.11 fluid ounce (210 ml) Slurpee in the US and Canada thru 2014. From 2015 to 2019 & come 2021, the size increased to a 12-fluid ounce (355 ml) size. 7 Rewards members are given a free medium Slurpee loaded into their app in 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing 7-11 Day's cancellation that year. In Australia, free Slurpees are given on November 7 (7/11, day/month) to coincide with 7-Eleven day. In 2010, 7-Eleven teamed up with Sony to create limited edition promotion cups for the PlayStation 3 games LittleBigPlanet 2 and Killzone 3. In 2011, a Slurpee themed t-shirt was added as DLC to LittleBigPlanet 2. Since July 7, 2011, 7-Eleven has partnered with Cinemark Theatres marking the first time Slurpees are sold outside its parent franchise. 32 theatres were chosen in Houston, Texas; Dallas, Texas; and Portland, Oregon. This marks the first reappearance of the Slurpee brand in the Houston metro area since 1990 (all 7-Elevens in the Houston area were sold to National Convenience Stores that owned Stop-n-Go - all Houston-area 7-Elevens were rebranded as Stop-n-Gos until Diamond Shamrock acquired the franchise in the late 1990s, now part of the Valero conglomerate of crude oil refineries and retail convenience stores most commonly operated under the Valero brand with generic names, though some Texas-area stores retained Corner Store branding held over from the Valero purchase of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock in 2001. 2012 has the Slurpee being sold at the Six Flags amusement parks chain in a marketing agreement to promote the product in 10 states. In Australia on 21 September 2011, customers could bring in their own cups (or container, regardless of size) and fill it full of Slurpee for only $2.60 (a portion of the price of a Super Slurpee) as long as it would fit through a cutout hole limiting the size. This did not stop people from receiving up to and above 5 liters of Slurpee for less than the price of a Super Slurpee. This event was known as Bring Your Own Cup Day. Since 11 April 2015, Bring Your Own Cup Day in U.S locations originally occurred once annually; now semi-annually since 2016. Slurpee fans could come in and enjoy any size cup, that fit through the cutout hole, for only $1.49 the first 2 years. This promotion occurred again on 19‚Äì20 August 2016 in honor of the Slurpee's 50th anniversary. It returned on 19‚Äì20 May 2017, but the price was $1.50 plus tax, and returned once more on 18‚Äì19 August. On November 7, 2015, 7-Eleven stores in the USA celebrated the giving season with Name Your Own Price Day for Small Slurpee drinks. Net proceeds from all Large Slurpee purchases were donated to Feeding America to support local food banks. Since May 2018, as a result of the 7-Eleven - Sunoco LP agreement, existing Stripes Convenience Stores (now part of the 7-Eleven business portfolio) rebranded its Slush Monkey frozen beverage to the Slurpee brand. Since the rebranding, the 40 ounce Slurpee cup usually sold at 7-Eleven locations is absent from Stripes since the cup dispensers were designed for three sizes - S, M, and L.

Lord Macaulay described Sir Ewen as the \\"Ulysses of the Highlands\\", being a man of enormous strength and size. An incident showing his strength and ferocity in single combat is used by Sir Walter Scott in Lady of the Lake (canto v.). Early years Sir Ewan Cameron of Lochiel was the eldest son of John Cameron and the grandson of Allan Cameron of Lochiel, 16th Chief (c. 1567/68 ‚Äì c. 1647; son of John Cameron and Margaret Mackintosh). His father having predeceased him in infancy, Ewen Cameron spent much of his youth under the guardianship of the 1st Marquess of Argyll at Inveraray. In 1647 he succeeded his grandfather as Chief of Cameron, being one of the most important Highland clans. The Camerons were always strong supporters of the Royal Stuarts and as The Lochiel he joined William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn in the Royalist rising of 1651 to 1654, being defeated at the Battle of Tullich in 1652. However, Sir Ewen also won several minor skirmishes; after the defeat of this attempt he served the royalist cause by harassing the Parliamentarian general and military governor of Scotland General George Monck. He then built a new base at Achnacarry Castle in 1655, to keep his men further away from the government troops. It was only upon the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658 did he submit to general Monck and was received warmly for his chivalrous conduct during the Civil War. Soon after he accompanied Monck to London where the General called a meeting of Parliament to discuss the new status quo. After lengthy discussion and debate it was decided that the King would be invited back from exile and that the Royal House of Stuart would be restored to the throne after a Republican Interregnum of 12 years. For his loyal service during the Civil War, the Lochiel was received warmly by the King and was allowed soon after to return to his estates. On 20 September 1665, Lochiel ended the 360-year feud with Clan Mackintosh after the stand-off at the Fords of Arkaig near Achnacarry.MacKenzie (1883/2008) p156 From that point, Ewen Cameron was responsible for keeping the peace between his clansmen and their former enemies. However whilst he was away in London in 1668, a feud broke out between Clan Donald and hostile elements of Clan Mackintosh, who headed the confederation of clans known as Clan Chattan. Being absent he was unable to constrain some of his clansmen and they made a small contribution to the MacDonald victory over the Mackintoshes at the Battle of Maol Ruadh (Mulroy).The Battle of Mulroy In another dispute, Lochiel was on his way to talk to the Duke of Atholl about a border between Lochaber and Perthshire when he met Gormshuil Mh√≤r na Maighe. She was married to a Cameron and was known for her supernatural powers.. At first he ignored Gormshuil but she told him to return home to get his men. He should take them with him and keep them hidden and if he needed them he was to turn his coat inside out. Lochiel took her advice and although Atholl too had men lying in wait, he was able to defeat them. This dispute between Lochiel and Atholl led to the Cameron clan's motto 'Sons of the hounds, come here and get flesh.' It's also said that this came from the tune Lochiel's piper was playing at the time, 'Thigibh an seo, chlanna nan con, is gheibh sibh feoil, (Come hither, children of the hounds, and you‚Äôll get flesh). In 1681, Sir Ewen was knighted by Charles II, whom he had fought alongside during the Civil War. After the Glorious Revolution in 1688 when the House of Stuart was replaced by a foreign dynasty, the Hanoverians, he became one of the principal commanders in the Jacobite rising of 1689 where he fought under John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, at the Battle of Killiecrankie, a victory marred by Claverhouse‚Äôs death. After this the Jacobite rebellion soon collapsed because of arguments among the remaining leaders. By this time Sir Ewen Cameron, nearly sixty years old, had started to give his son, the Master of Lochiel, greater responsibilities. The Lochiel felt he was now too old to participate directly in military action thus designated his son John Cameron to lead his clan in battle, most notably in the second Jacobite rising of 1715 at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. Marriage and children Sir Ewen married three times and had many children, of which eleven were daughters: His first wife was Mary Macdonald, daughter of Sir Donald Macdonald, 8th of Sleat.

Under this system, two completely separate water piping systems are used to deliver water to the user. This system prevents mixing of the two water supplies, which is undesirable, since reclaimed water is usually not intended for human consumption. In the United States, reclaimed water is distributed in lavender (light purple) pipes, to alert users that the pipes contain non-potable water.

The series' original pilot episode aired on September 7, 2003, without many of the current version's main characters, and it was ordered to series by Nickelodeon in early 2004. The one-hour special movie series finale aired on June 8, 2007. The show was produced by Apollo ProScreen GmbH & Co. Filmproduktion KG in association with Jack Mackie Pictures. Its main executive producer and creator is Scott Fellows, the head writer for The Fairly OddParents. Premise Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide follows the lives of Ned Bigby, Jennifer \\"Moze\\" Mosely, and Simon \\"Cookie\\" Nelson-Cook. The first season takes place during the first semester of seventh grade, the second season covers the second semester of seventh grade, and third season takes place during eighth grade. Throughout the series, Ned builds up a number of 'tips' for his \\"survival guide\\", and uses the tips to help himself and his classmates cope with the standard struggles of middle school. Each individual episode relates to a topic in the guide, such as popularity, grades, or sports, as well as developing other plots (such as Ned's love life) throughout. Episodes Cast * Devon Werkheiser as Ned Bigby * Lindsey Shaw as Jennifer \\"Moze\\" Mosely * Daniel Curtis Lee as Simon \\"Cookie\\" Nelson- Cook * Jim J. Bullock as Mr. Monroe (main role, season 1; recurring role, seasons 2‚Äì3) * Daran Norris as Gordy (recurring role, season 1; main role, seasons 2‚Äì3) Locations The show takes place at the fictional James K. Polk Middle School, named after the 11th President of the United States, James K. Polk. The exterior of the school was filmed at La Mesa Junior High in Santa Clarita, California. The school's colors are gold and green and its mascot is the Wolves, which is a common theme throughout the school's interior. During the first season, all of the show's action took place within the school or its grounds, and with the exception of one or two notable occasions, everything happened indoors. However, during season 2, the show's producers decided they wanted more exterior scenes, so more outdoor shots were used, and on certain occasions, the show took place off school property. The show's finale, for example, took place almost entirely off the school grounds. DVD releases In the USA there have been four DVD releases made for the series. * TEENick Picks, Volume 1 released on April 18, 2006 ‚Äì features \\"Guide to: Computer Labs and Backpacks\\" (Season 1, Episode 9) * Special Field Trip Edition released on August 28, 2007 ‚Äì features \\"Field Trips, Permission Slips, Signs, and Weasels\\" and \\"Guide to: Dismissal and The School Play.\\" * The Best of Season 1 and The Best of Season 2 both released on September 23, 2008 exclusive to Amazon.com.

The waltz was first performed at the regular Sunday concerts of the Strauss Orchestra conducted by Eduard Strauss on 7 November 1880 at the Musikverein in Vienna. Its themes drawn from the operetta are the act 1 \\"Tr√ºffel-Couplet\\" and the act 2 romance \\"Wo die wilde Rose erbl√ºht\\" (\\"Where the Wild Rose Blossoms\\"). The act 2 romance most certainly inspired the title of this waltz. The waltz ranks among the \\"Waltz King's\\" magnificent works and is still regularly performed today at the Vienna Philharmonic's New Year's Concert. The general mood of the piece is rather pensive but the final moments of the piece are utter joy and sparkling with Strauss happier tunes. Waltz section 1 is in F major and is graceful but pensive in mood. Waltz 2A is also in a more reflective mood but waltz 2B is more uplifting. The entire waltz 3 section is in G major while waltz section 4 is in E-flat major and has the climax with cymbals. A restless-sounding coda in E flat is soon replaced with a reprise of the waltz 3A. Waltz 1A has a brief show at the end before the waltz 4B is introduced, this time in the home key of F major. A series of descending chords marks the end of the waltz, underlined with a drum roll and final flourish. Fans of Star Trek will recognize \\"Roses from the South\\" as the waltz Trelane has Uhura play in \\"The Squire of Gothos\\". The song is also used in the Dancing with the Stars videogame for PlayStation 2, in the carnival sequence of \\"Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,\\" and finally in \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" when Sophie is asked for her hand in marriage. The waltz appears uncredited in the dance scene in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises starring Christian Bale and Michael Caine.

It has connections to CSX at Ocala, Florida, running north to Lowell, Florida, and south to Candler, Florida. It was formerly run by CSX as their Ocala Subdivision. The railroad also operates lines connecting to CSX in Newberry, Florida, running south to the Crystal River Energy Complex in Red Level, Florida, just north of Crystal River. This line was formerly CSX's West Coast Subdivision and Red Level Subdivision. Long coal trains are still pulled by CSX locomotives on this branch while local traffic still uses the Pinsly Red with Yellow locomotives. History =Lowell to Candler Line= Ocala Union Station along the Florida Northern Railroad line The main track of the line from Lowell to Candler via Ocala was originally built by the Florida Southern Railway, which was part of the Plant System of railroads. It was built from Rochelle (south of Gainesville) to Ocala in 1881. In 1883, it was extended south to Leesburg. The track connecting the Florida Northern main track with the CSX track and the industrial spur from Ocala west was originally part of the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad, which was built in 1887 and historically extended west to Dunnellon and Homosassa. The Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad also became part of the Plant System. The Plant System became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The Atlantic Coast line used this line for passenger service and in 1917, they jointly built Ocala Union Station with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad where the two railroads crossed. Ocala Union Station no longer serves passenger trains but continues to stand where the Florida Northern crosses the CSX S Line (the former Seaboard Air Line). The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line merged in 1967 with the merged company becoming the CSX Transportation in 1986. The former Atlantic Coast Line route was abandoned north of Lowell and south of Candler around 1982, creating the line that exists today.Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Jacksonville Division and Tampa Division Timetable (1977)Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Jacksonville Division and Tampa Division Timetable (1982) CSX leased the line to the Pinsly Railroad Company in 1988 who established the Florida Northern Railroad. In November 2019, Pinsly Railroad Company sold the Florida Northern, along with the Florida Central Railroad and Florida Midland Railroad, to 3i RR Holdings GP, LLC and subsidiaries (d.b.a. \\"Regional Rail, LLC\\"). =Newberry to Red Level Line= Newberry to Red Level Line as seen from the platform of the former Dunnellon station The line from Newberry to Red Level was built incrementally by Henry Plant's system of railroads. Track from High Springs to Archer was built in 1893 by the Plant System as a branch of the Live Oak, Tampa and Charlotte Harbor Railroad. At the other end, the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad (which originated in Ocala), built the track from a point historically known as Juliette (near Rainbow Springs) south to Dunnellon, Crystal River, and Homosassa in 1887 (though track to Homosassa only lasted until 1941). In 1893, track was built from Juliette (near Rainbow Springs) north to Morriston and from just south of Dunnellon south to Inverness. The split in the line to Inverness would become known as Gulf Junction. One of the early organizers of the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad was John F. Dunn, for whom Dunnellon is named for. The Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad would become part of the Plant System of railroads in 1901. The Plant System was acquired by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The Atlantic Coast Line then extended the line from Morriston north to Archer in 1913 to connect with the line from High Springs. The completion of this line created a through route from High Springs to Dunnellon, which combined with track to Inverness south created a west coast main line for the Atlantic Coast Line. In the 1960s, a spur was built to the Crystal River Energy Complex in Red Level. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad eventually evolved into CSX in 1986, with this line being known as the West Coast Subdivision. The track from Red Level Junction to Crystal River was removed by 1982 and track from Dunnellon south to Inverness and Owensboro was removed in 1987, which became the Withlacoochee State Trail. The Florida Northern took over the remaining track of the West Coast Subdivision in 1988. The spur from Newberry to High Springs was removed in 2014.

Washburn cabled Charlotte Serber at Los Alamos. As the librarian, she had access to the Technical Area, and told her husband, physicist Robert Serber, who then went to inform Oppenheimer. When he reached his office, he found that Oppenheimer already knew.Conant, 109 East Place, pp. 193‚Äì194. The security chief at Los Alamos, Captain Peer de Silva, had received the news through the wiretap and Army Intelligence, and had broken it to Oppenheimer.Monk, Inside the Centre, pp. 386‚Äì387. Tatlock had introduced Oppenheimer to the poetry of John Donne, and it is widely believed he named the first test of a nuclear weapon \\"Trinity\\" in reference to one of Donne's poems, as a tribute to her.Herken, Brotherhood of the Bomb, p. 129. In 1962, Leslie Groves wrote to Oppenheimer about the origin of the name, and elicited this reply: A formal inquest in February 1944 returned a verdict of \\"Suicide, motive unknown\\".Bird and Sherwin, American Prometheus, p. 251. In his report, the coroner found that Tatlock had eaten a full meal shortly before her death. She had taken some barbiturates, but not a fatal dose. Traces of chloral hydrate were found, a drug normally associated with a \\"Mickey Finn\\" when combined with alcohol, but there was no alcohol in her blood, despite damage to her pancreas that indicated she was a heavy drinker. As a psychiatrist working in a hospital, she had access to sedatives such as chloral hydrate.Bird and Sherwin, American Prometheus, pp. 249‚Äì253. The coroner found that she had died at around 4:30 pm on January 4. The cause of death was recorded as \\"acute edema of the lungs with pulmonary congestion\\"Streshinsky and Klaus, An Atomic Love Story, p. 192 ‚Äî drowning in the bathtub. It seems likely that she knelt over the bathtub, took chloral hydrate, and plunged her head into the water.Bird and Sherwin, American Prometheus, p. 253. There has been, at times, speculation by historians and her brother Hugh as to whether her death was truly a suicide, as there were some suspicious circumstances. The conspiracy theory that she was murdered by intelligence agents working for the Manhattan Project was bolstered by the 1975 Church Committee, which revealed details of assassinations carried out by American intelligence agencies, and was depicted in the fictional TV series Manhattan. One doctor observed that: \\"If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is the way to do it.\\" Her father had her remains cremated.

Its function is to shape bread while it is rising during baking. The most common shape of the bread pan is the loaf, or narrow rectangle, a convenient form which enables uniform slicing. The bread pan is made from a conductive material such as metal which might be treated with a non-stick coating. It can also be made of heat-resistant glass, ceramic, or a special type of paper that sticks to the dough but is easily removed, once cooked. Bread pans are found in a variety of designs and sizes providing the baker with different possibilities not only for baking bread, but also cakes and puddings. Types of bread typically baked in bread pans include sandwich breads, brioche, challah, and raisin bread. Image:Banana bread in loaf pan.jpgA loaf of banana bread sitting in a loaf pan.

He is also the author of numerous books, chiefly on defence matters, which have won several major awards. Early life Hastings' parents were Macdonald Hastings, a journalist and war correspondent and Anne Scott-James, sometime editor of Harper's Bazaar. He was educated at Charterhouse and University College, Oxford, which he left after a year.  Career  Hastings then moved to the United States, spending a year (1967‚Äì68) as a Fellow of the World Press Institute, following which he published his first book, America, 1968: The Fire This Time, an account of the US in its tumultuous election year. He became a foreign correspondent and reported from more than sixty countries and eleven wars for BBC TV's Twenty-Four Hours current affairs programme and for the Evening Standard in London. Hastings was the first journalist to enter Port Stanley during the 1982 Falklands War. After ten years as editor and then editor-in-chief of The Daily Telegraph, he returned to the Evening Standard as editor in 1996 until his retirement in 2002. Hastings was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 2002 Birthday Honours for services to journalism. He was elected a member of the political dining society known as The Other Club in 1993. He has presented historical documentaries for the BBC and is the author of many books, including Bomber Command, which earned the Somerset Maugham Award for non-fiction in 1980. Both Overlord and The Battle for the Falklands won the Yorkshire Post Book of the Year prize. He was named Journalist of the Year and Reporter of the Year at the 1982 British Press Awards, and Editor of the Year in 1988. In 2010 he received the Royal United Services Institute's Westminster Medal for his \\"lifelong contribution to military literature\\", and the same year the Edgar Wallace Award from the London Press Club. In 2012, he was awarded the US$100,000 Pritzker Military Library Literature Award, a lifetime achievement award for military writing, which includes an honorarium, citation and medallion, sponsored by the Chicago-based Tawani Foundation. Hastings is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and the Royal Historical Society. He was President of the Campaign to Protect Rural England from 2002 to 2007. In his 2007 book Nemesis: The Battle for Japan, 1944‚Äì45 (known as Retribution in the United States), the chapter on Australia's role in the last year of the Pacific War was criticised by the chief of the Returned and Services League of Australia and one of the historians at the Australian War Memorial, for allegedly exaggerating discontent in the Australian Army. Dan van der Vat in The Guardian called it \\"even-handed\\", \\"refreshing\\" and \\"sensitive\\" and praised the language used. The Spectator called it \\"brilliant\\" and praised his telling of the human side of the story. Hastings wrote a column for the Daily Mail and often contributes articles to other publications such as The Guardian, The Sunday Times and The New York Review of Books.  Personal life  Hastings lives near Hungerford, Berkshire with his second wife, Penelope (), whom he married in 1999. Hastings has a surviving son and daughter by his first wife, Patricia Edmondson, to whom he was married from 1972 until 1994. In 2000, his 27-year-old first son, Charles, took his own life at Ningbo in China. He dedicated his book Nemesis: The Battle For Japan 1944‚Äì45 which was published in 2007 to his son's memory.\\"In memory of my son CHARLES HASTINGS 1973‚Äì2000\\". Political views Hastings has supported both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. He announced his support for the Conservative Party at the 2010 general election, having previously voted for the Labour Party at the 1997 and 2001 general elections. He claimed that \\"four terms are too many for any government\\" and described Gordon Brown as \\"wholly psychologically unfit to be Prime Minister\\". In August 2014, Hastings was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. In June 2019, Hastings described the Conservative Party leadership candidate Boris Johnson as \\"unfit for national office, because it seems he cares for no interest save his own fame and gratification...[his] premiership will almost certainly reveal a contempt for rules, precedent, order and stability...If the price of Johnson proves to be Corbyn, blame will rest with the Conservative party, which is about to foist a tasteless joke upon the British people ‚Äì who will not find it funny for long.\\" I was Boris Johnson's boss: he is utterly unfit to be prime minister The Guardian.

His elder sister was Edith Sitwell and his younger brother was Sacheverell Sitwell. Like them, he devoted his life to art and literature. Early life John Singer Sargent, The Sitwell Family, 1900. From left: Edith Sitwell (1887-1964), Sir George Sitwell, Lady Ida, Sacheverell Sitwell (1897-1988), and Osbert Sitwell (1892-1969) Sitwell was born on 6 December 1892 at 3 Arlington Street, St James's, London. His parents were Sir George Reresby Sitwell, fourth baronet, genealogist and antiquarian, and Lady Ida Emily Augusta (n√©e Denison). He grew up in the family seat at Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire, and at Scarborough, and went to Ludgrove School, then Eton College from 1906 to 1909. For many years his entry in Who's Who contained the phrase \\"Educ[ated]: during the holidays from Eton.\\" In 1911 he joined the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry but, not cut out to be a cavalry officer, transferred to the Grenadier Guards at the Tower of London from where, in his off-duty time, he could frequent theatres and art galleries. =Army= Late in 1914 Sitwell's civilised life was exchanged for the trenches of France near Ypres in Belgium. It was here that he wrote his first poetry, describing it as \\"Some instinct, and a combination of feelings not hitherto experienced united to drive me to paper\\". \\"Babel\\" was published in The Times on 11 May 1916. In the same year, he began literary collaborations and anthologies with his brother and sister, the trio being usually referred to simply as the Sitwells. Political and other activity In 1918 Sitwell left the Army with the rank of Captain, and contested the 1918 general election as the Liberal Party candidate for Scarborough and Whitby, finishing second. Later he moved towards the political right, though politics were very seldom explicit in his writings. In Who's Who he ultimately declared of his political views: Advocates compulsory Freedom everywhere, the suppression of Public Opinion in the interest of Free Speech, and the rationing of brains without which innovation there can be no true democracy. Sitwell campaigned for the preservation of Georgian buildings and was responsible for saving Sutton Scarsdale Hall, now owned by English Heritage. He was an early and active member of the Georgian Group. He also had an interest in the paranormal and joined the Ghost Club, which at the time was being relaunched as a dinner society dedicated to discussing paranormal occurrences and topics. Writing career Sitwell devoted himself to poetry, art criticism and controversial journalism. Together with his brother, he sponsored a controversial exhibition of works by Matisse, Utrillo, Picasso and Modigliani. The composer William Walton also greatly benefited from his largesse (though the two men afterwards fell out) and Walton's cantata Belshazzar's Feast was written to Sitwell's libretto. He published two books of poems: Argonaut and Juggernaut (1919) and At the House of Mrs Kinfoot (1921). In the mid-1920s he met David Stuart Horner (1900-1983) who was his lover and companion for most of his life. =Works= Sitwell's first work of fiction, Triple Fugue, was published in 1924, and visits to Italy and Germany produced Discursions on Travel, Art and Life (1925). His first novel, Before the Bombardment (1926), set in an out-of- season hotel, was well reviewed ‚Äì Ralph Straus writing for Bystander magazine called it 'a nearly flawless piece of satirical writing', and Beverley Nichols praised 'the richness of its beauty and wit'.Quotes from thumbnail publicity for the Oxford University Press edition of the novel, introduced by Victoria Glendinning. His subsequent novel The Man Who Lost Himself (1929) was an altogether different affair and did not receive the same critical acclaim. However, for Osbert Sitwell it was an attempt to take further the techniques that he had experimented with in his d√©but, and he ventured to explain this in one challenging sentence in his PrefaceAuthor's Preface, 1929 ‚Äì 'The Man Who Lost Himself' (LTMI Ed., 2007) when he said: \\"Convinced that movement is not in itself enough, that no particular action or sequence of actions is in itself of sufficient concern to dare lay claim to the intelligent attention of the reader, that adventures of the mind and soul are more interesting, because more mysterious, than those of the body, and yet that, on the other hand, the essence does not reside to any much greater degree in the tangle of reason, unreason, and previous history, in which each action, event and thought is founded, but is to be discovered, rather, in that balance, so difficult to achieve, which lies between them, he has attempted to write a book which might best be described as a Novel of Reasoned Action\\". Re-edited over three quarters of a century after its initial publication, The Man Who Lost Himself has found new popularity as an idiosyncratic mystery novel. Sitwell, sure in himself of the techniques he was exercising, went on to write several further novels, including Miracle on Sinai (1934) and Those Were the Days (1937) neither of which received the same glowing reviews as his first. A collection of short stories Open the Door (1940), his fifth novel A Place of One's Own (1940), his Selected Poems (1943) and a book of essays Sing High, Sing Low (1944) were reasonably well received. His \\"The Four Continents\\" (1951) is a book of travel, reminiscence and observation. =Rat Week= Sitwell was a close friend of the Duke and Duchess of York, future King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.Sitwell, p37 In December 1936, when the abdication of King Edward VIII was announced, he wrote a poem, Rat Week, attacking principally the king and Mrs Simpson but also those friends of the king who deserted him when his alliance with Mrs Simpson became common knowledge in England.Pearson, p15 Because of its libellous content it was not published but Sitwell ensured that it was circulated privately.Pearson, p16 In February 1937, a version appeared in Cavalcade, which Sitwell described as a \\"paper, which confounded liveliness with mischief\\".Sitwell, p67 The Cavalcade version omitted the \\"offensive\\" references to Edward and Mrs Simpson. This resulted in the poem's gaining an unwarranted reputation as being sympathetic to the Windsors over the way some of their friends had treated them.Pearson, pp15-16 Cavalcade also missed out a verse in which a number of the \\"rats\\" were named explicitly, as to publish this would have been libellous.Sitwell, p 67 Sitwell sued Cavalcade for breach of copyright. He obtained an interim injunction preventing further publication in Cavalcade, which ensured further surreptitious circulation of the poem. When the full case came to court, Cavalcade tried to get Sitwell to produce the missing verse. Sitwell resisted on the grounds that he could not be forced to make a criminally libellous statement. The case ended up in the Appeal Court, where Sitwell won and obtained damages and costs.Sitwell, pp 70-73 Sitwell knew that, because of the libel issue, the poem could not be published in his lifetime; he decided that publication should wait even longer than that to avoid \\"pain to those still living\\".Sitwell, p 24 The poem was first published in 1986 by Michael Joseph in a book entitled Rat Week: An Essay on the Abdication authored posthumously by Sitwell. Sitwell, in his essay, explained the background to the poem in some detail because he recognised that the long delay in publication would result in many readers being unfamiliar with the characters.Sitwell, p60 The book also contains a foreword by John Pearson, explaining some of the background to the publication of the book.Pearson, pp 7-19 =Autobiography= In 1943 he started an autobiography that ran to four volumes: Left Hand, Right Hand (1943), The Scarlet Tree (1946), Great Morning (1948) and Laughter in the Next Room (1949). Writing in The Adelphi, George Orwell declared that, \\" although the range they cover is narrow, [they] must be among the best autobiographies of our time.'The Adelphi, July‚ÄìSeptember 1948, reprinted in Orwell:Collected Works, It Is What I Think, p.398 Sitwell's autobiography was followed by a collection of essays about various people he had known, Noble Essences: A Book of Characters (1950), and a postscript, Tales my Father Taught Me (1962). The sometimes acidic diarist James Agate commented on Sitwell after a drinking session on 3 June 1932, in Ego, volume 1, \\"There is something self-satisfied and having-to- do-with-the-Bourbons about him which is annoying, though there is also something of the crowned-head consciousness which is disarming.\\" In Who's Who, he summed up his career: ‚ÄúFor the past 30 years has conducted, in conjunction with his brother and sister, a series of skirmishes and hand-to-hand battles against the Philistine. Though outnumbered, has occasionally succeeded in denting the line, though not without damage to himself.‚Äù Baronetcy After Sitwell's father died, in 1943, Osbert succeeded to the baronetcy. Death Cimitero degli Allori, Firenze, Italy Sitwell suffered from Parkinson's disease from the 1950s; by the mid-1960s this condition had become so severe that he needed to abandon writing. He died at 7.15 p.m. on 4 May 1969 in Italy, at Montegufoni, a castle near Florence which his father had bought derelict in 1909 and restored as his personal residence. The castle was left to his nephew, Reresby; his money was left to his brother Sachie. Sitwell was cremated and his ashes buried in the Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori in Florence, together with a copy of his first novel, Before the Bombardment.Pearson, pp 503-504 Gallery of Montegufoni File:III Castello di Montegufoni, Italy (2).jpg File:III Castello di Montegufoni, Italy 2 (2).jpg File:III Castello di Montegufoni, Italy 3 (2).jpg File:III Castello di Montegufoni, Italy 6 (2).jpg File:III Castello di Montegufoni, Italy 4 (2).jpg File:III Castello di Montegufoni, Italy 5 (2).jpg Select bibliography * Triple Fugue (Stories) (1924) * Discursions on Travel, Art and Life (Essays) (1925) * Before the Bombardment (Novel) (1926) * The Man Who Lost Himself (Novel) (1929) * Collected Poems and Satires (1931) * Winters of Content, More Discursions on Travel, Art and Life (1932) * Dickens (1932) * Miracles on Sina√Ø (Novel) (1934) * Penny Foolish: A Book of Tirades and Panegyrics (1935) * Those Were the Days (Novel) (1937) * A Place of One's Own (Novel) (1940) * Selected Poems (1943) * Left Hand!

Her first novel, titled Jhansir Rani, based on a biography of the Rani of Jhansi was published in 1956. She had toured the Jhansi region to record information and folk songs from the local people for the novel. Mahasweta Devi's specialisation lay in the studies of Adivasi, Dalit and Marginalized citizens with a focus on their women. They were associated as protestor in the face of the oppressive British rule, the Mahajanas and upper class corruption and injustice. She lived in the Adivasi villages in West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh years afer years, befriending them and learning from them. She has embodied their struggles and sacrifices in her words and characters. She had claimed that her stories aren't her creation, they are the stories of the people of her country. Such an example is her work \\" Chotti Mundi Ebong Tar Tir\\" In 1964, she began teaching at Vijaygarh Jyotish Ray College (an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta system). In those days Vijaygarh Jyotish Ray College was an institution for working-class women students. During that period she also worked‚Äîas a journalist and as a creative writer. She studied the Lodhas and Shabars, the tribal communities of West Bengal, women and dalits. In her elaborate Bengali fiction, she often depicted the brutal oppression on the tribal people and untouchables by the powerful authoritarian upper-caste landlords, money-lenders, and venal government officials. She wrote of the source of her inspiration: Postcolonial scholar Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has translated Devi's short stories into English and published three books Imaginary Maps (1995, Routledge), Old Woman (1997, Seagull), The Breast Stories (1997, Seagull). = Social activity = Mahasweta Devi raised her voice several times against the discrimination suffered by tribal people in India. Devi's 1977 novel Aranyer Adhikar (Right to the Forest) was about the life of Birsa Munda. And in June 2016, consequent to Devi's activism, the Jharkhand State Government finally saw to the removal of the manacles from the figure of Munda, which had been part of the commemorative sculpture of the notable young tribal leader due to its having been based on a photograph dating from the era of British rule. Devi spearheaded the movement against the industrial policy of the earlier Communist Party of India (Marxist) government of West Bengal. Specifically, she stridently criticized confiscation from farmers of large tracts of fertile agricultural land by the government which then ceded it to industrial houses at throwaway prices. She supported the candidature of Mamata Banarjee in the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election which resulted in the end of the 34-year long rule of CPI(M). She had connected the policy to the commercialization of Santiniketan of Rabindranath Tagore, where she spent her formative years. Her lead in the Nandigram agitation resulted in a number of intellectuals, artists, writers and theatre workers joining together in protest of the controversial policy and particularly its implementation in Singur and Nandigram. She is known to have helped the noted writer Manoranjan Bypari to come into prominence as his initial writings were published in her journal and as prompted by her. At the Frankfurt Book Fair 2006, when India was the first country to be the Fair's second time guest nation, she made an impassioned inaugural speech wherein she moved the audience to tears with her lines taken from the famous film song \\"Mera Joota Hai Japani\\" by Raj Kapoor.  Personal life  On 27 February in 1947, she married renowned playwright Bijon Bhattacharya, who was one of the founding fathers of the Indian People's Theatre Association movement. In 1948, she gave birth to Nabarun Bhattacharya, who became a novelist and political critic. She worked in a post office but was fired for her communist leaning. She went on to do various jobs, such as selling soaps and writing letters in English for illiterate people. In 1962, she married author Asit Gupta after divorcing Bhattacharya. In 1976, the relationship with Gupta ended.  Death  Mahasweta Devi Memorial unveiled at Adivasi Academy of Tejgadh, Gujarat On 23 July 2016, Devi suffered a major heart attack and was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic, Kolkata. Devi died of multiple organ failure on 28 July 2016, aged 90. She had suffered from diabetes, sepsis and urinary infection. On her death, Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal tweeted \\"India has lost a great writer. Bengal has lost a glorious mother. I have lost a personal guide.

It is located in Alfalfa County in northern Oklahoma, north of Jet (pop. 230), along Great Salt Plains Lake, which is formed by a dam on the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River. The refuge was established March 26, 1930, by executive order of President Herbert Hoover, and contains of protected land as habitat to about 312 species of birds and 30 species of mammals. It was designated a national natural landmark in June 1983. A map of the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge Refuge description The Salt Plains were a favorite hunting ground for American Indians. Bison and other game came to the area to eat the salt and the heavily wooded and well- watered area along the Salt Fork River was like an oasis in the surrounding grassland of the Great Plains. Salt Plains refuge is divided into almost equal areas of nonvegetated salt flat, open water, and vegetated land. Marshes, woods, grasslands, and croplands dot the refuge. Management tools used to enhance the habitat for wildlife include farming, grazing, prescribed burns, construction of ponds, and wetland draining and flooding.Salt Plains - Brochures The refuge was created to be a resting and breeding ground for migratory waterfowl especially during fall and spring. The entire refuge is designated as critical habitat for the endangered whooping crane, which is mostly seen during fall migration.Salt Plains - Welcome In addition, the refuge is home to endangered least terns, threatened snowy plovers, threatened bald eagles, and peregrine falcons. Large populations of American white pelicans migrate through between August and September, staying on the Great Salt Plains Reservoir. Great Salt Plains is one of the most important habitats for shorebirds in the Western Hemisphere.http://www.whsrn.org/sites/list- sites, accessed Jan 3, 2011 =Ralstin Island= Ralstin Island (closed to the public) is an important rookery in the Great Salt Plains Lake.

The Eagle Roost Nature Trail is a loop also beginning near the nature center. The trail goes through wooded and open areas, beneath towering cottonwood trees, past marshes and ponds, and to a shore and waterfowl watching area on Sand Creek Bay. Selenite crystals: A designated area of the of salt flats at the refuge has gypsum concentrations high enough to grow selenite, a crystalline form of gypsum. The selenite crystals found there have an hourglass-shaped sand inclusion that is not known to occur in selenite crystals found elsewhere in the world. Digging for crystals is allowed, but only from April 1 through October 15 to protect this vital Whooping Crane habitat.

Hunting is permitted for pheasant, northern bobwhite quail, mourning dove, ducks, geese, and sandhill cranes.Hunting at Salt Plains Fishing: According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the extreme drought of 2011 and 2012 has almost ended fishing as a recreational activity at the refuge. These conditions caused very large fish kills in the reservoir and restocking has been suspended. Fishing downstream of the dam is still permitted, but is greatly affected by local precipitation and the flow of the Great Salt River.US Army Corps of Engineers:Great Salt Plains Recreation. \\"Great Salt Plains Lake.\\" Accessed April 20, 2015.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations\\".Tucker, Benjamin.

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism. [...] Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

Capitalism is generally considered by scholars to be an economic system that includes private ownership of the means of production, creation of goods or services for profit or income, the accumulation of capital, competitive markets, voluntary exchange and wage labor which has generally been opposed by anarchists historically.Heilbroner, Robert L. Capitalism. New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, Second Edition (2008).Tormey, Simon. Anticapitalism. One World Publications, 2004. p. 10. Since capitalism is variously defined by sources and there is no general consensus among scholars on the definition nor on how the term should be used as a historical category,Critical Issues in History. Lanham, Md: Rowman and Littlefield, 1999, p. 1. the designation is applied to a variety of historical cases, varying in time, geography, politics and culture. Anarcho-capitalists believe that capitalism is the absence of coercion and therefore fully compatible with the philosophy of anarchism; they claim that an effort to put a stop to what they consider voluntary hierarchy is inconsistent with the philosophical tradition of freedom present in anarchist thought.

It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition.\\"; : \\"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism). There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone. From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions‚Äîthe minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions‚Äîneglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a laissez-faire 'free' market. [...] Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory. The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all\\".See the following sources: * K, David (2005).

In Jun, Nathan J. (2017). Brill's Companion to Anarchism and Philosophy. BRILL. p. 81. . Anarchist commentators do not consider anarcho-capitalism as a legitimate form of anarchism due to perceived coercive characteristics of capitalism. In particular, they argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion in violation of anarchist principles.  Anarchist criticism of capitalism and economic issues  It has been pointed out that historically the anarcho-communist economic theories published by Peter Kropotkin and others have been ignored or intentionally sidelined by historians.Knowles, Rob (2000). \\"Political Economy From Below: Communitarian Anarchism as a Neglected Discourse in Histories of Economic Thought\\".

Anarchists such as Kropotkin object to the portrayal of economics as a value-free science, arguing in Revolutionary Pamphlets: Within the realm of anarchist labor issues is the issue of the monetary system. While all anarchists are against the current monetary system, there is disagreement as to whether or not there should be a monetary system. Alexander Berkman was an anarchist against the monetary system. In his book What Is Anarchism?, Berkman argues that in an anarchist society money would become unnecessary. Within anarchy, all occupations are viewed as equally beneficial to society. Since the concept of value is different for everyone and cannot be determined, it is argued that it should not be set and one's contribution to society through their occupation entitled them to be a part of it. Within this system, there is a free distribution of goods without the need for money. Money in its current form is a hierarchical system, the exception being when all people are paid equal salaries. The argument goes further to question the purpose of money if people are paid equally. Those who agree with this would also note that a monetary system would open a vulnerability for some to acquire more of it and create a class system. Some individualist anarchists and mutualists do not oppose the idea of money and see currency as a tangible form of workers receiving the full product of their labor. They support mutual banking (some individualists support no banking at all to keep exchange rates constant) and local currency as opposed to national currency. Others see money as simply an index for exchanging goods and that its existence would not necessarily create a class system.\\"Citizens' Money\\", an 1890 lecture on the national banking system delivered in Chicago and published in Liberty of Boston in 1888.

Some market abolitionist anarchists argue that while supporters of capitalism and the Austrian School in particular recognize equilibrium prices do not exist, they nonetheless claim that these prices can be used as a rational basis whilst this is not the case, hence markets are not efficient. Anarchists such as Rudolf Rocker argued that a state is required to maintain private property and for capitalism to function. Similarly, Albert Meltzer argued that anarcho-capitalism simply cannot be anarchism because capitalism and the state are inextricably interlinked and because capitalism exhibits domineering hierarchical structures such as that between an employer and an employee. The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within post-classical and contemporary currents.Williams, Dana M.

Anarchists are committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely \\"all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism\\". Anarchist schools of thought disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.Jun, Nathan (September 2009). \\"Anarchist Philosophy and Working Class Struggle: A Brief History and Commentary\\".

Duncan Reekie argue that because of a person's self-ownership, any freedom given up in a laissez-faire marketplace would be a voluntary contract and that there is nothing authoritarian about capitalist employer‚Äìemployee relationships in such a condition, writing: \\"There is nothing authoritarian, dictatorial or exploitative in the relationship.

This runs counter the concept of equality amongst anarchists as they argue that freedom without equality simply gives more freedom to those who are supposedly superior and that equality without freedom is a form of oppression.Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1840).

As further confirmation of equality's misunderstanding, anarcho-communist Alexander Berkman similarly argued in The ABC of Anarchism: While anarcho-capitalists such as Murray Rothbard consider themselves part of the individualist anarchist tradition, drawing upon the writings of early American individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner while rejecting their normative claims and other socialist doctrines, Tucker, Spooner and others argued that unequal wealth would not equal an unequal society. Those anarchists believed that equality of condition, equality of access to the means of production and equal opportunity would counteract any potential tyranny in a market society. In following William Godwin, anarchists insist that \\"inequality corrupts freedom. Their anarchism is directed as much against inequality as against tyranny\\". It has been argued that while anarcho- capitalists such Rothbard and David D. Friedman have been \\"sympathetic to Spooner's individualist anarchism\\", they \\"fail to notice or conveniently overlook its egalitarian implications\\".Newman, Stephen L. (1984) Liberalism at Wit's End. pp. 74‚Äì76. Tucker argued for a society with \\"the greatest amount of liberty compatible with equality of liberty\\".Tucker, Benjamin (1893). Instead of a Book. p. 131. = Private property = There is some debate about the question of private property and economic organization which is mainly caused by the meaning of private property. Social anarchists claim that the existence of private property (productive property) results in wage slavery while certain anti-capitalist individualist anarchists and mutualists argue for private property (personal property and possessions) and wages owned and controlled directly by workers themselves in the form of worker cooperatives such as labor-owned cooperative firms and associations.Martin, James J. (1953). Men Against the State. p. 223.Hymans, E. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. pp. 190‚Äì191. For the anarchist and socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, \\"strong workers' associations would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis\\".Vincent, Steven K. (1984). Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism. Oxford University Press. pp. 156, 230. One major point of contention between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism, causing the latter as not being recognized as part of anarchism, remains that of private property and its meaning. By property, or private property, ever since Proudhon's book What is Property?, published in 1840, anarchists meant possession (what other socialists, including Marxists and communists, distingue as personal property) which he considered as liberty (\\"Property is liberty\\") versus productive property (such as land and infrastructure, or what Marxists terms the means of production and the means of labor) which he considered as theft (\\"Property is theft\\"), causing him to also say \\"Property is impossible\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1840). What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government. However, some individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker started calling possession as property or private property.The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective. \\"Section G - Is individualist anarchism capitalistic?\\".

While anarcho-capitalists make no distinction between private property and personal property, this is extremely important to anarchists and other socialists because in the capitalist mode of production private and personal property are considered to be exactly equivalent. They make the following distinctions: * Personal property, or possession, includes items intended for personal use (e.g. one's toothbrush, clothes, homes, vehicles and sometimes money). It must be gained in a socially fair manner and the owner has a distributive right to exclude others. * Anarchists generally agree that private property is a social relationship between the owner and persons deprived (not a relationship between person and thing), e.g. artifacts, factories, mines, dams, infrastructure, natural vegetation, mountains, deserts and seas. In this context, private property and ownership means ownership of the means of production, not personal possessions. * To anarchists and other socialists alike, private property is capital or the means of production while personal property is consumer and non-capital goods and services. = Wage labor = Anarcho-capitalists support wage labor and do not explicitly support workplace democracy and workers' self-management as anarchists do, claiming that wage labor is always voluntary.Tormey, Simon (2004). Anti-capitalism: A Beginner's Guide. Oneworld. p. 10. . However, anarchists argue that certain capitalist transactions, including wage labor, are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion which violates both anarchist principles and anarcho-capitalism's non-aggression principle. Individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker, who identified his individualist anarchism as anarchistic socialism, are opposed to both capitalism and compulsory communism. Those anarchists support wage labor as long as the employers and employees are paid equally for equal hours worked and neither party has authority over the other.Cheyney, Ryan C. (November 1980). \\"Social Justice and the Right to the Labor Product\\". Political Theory (8: 4). p. 506. This approach was put into practice in American individualist anarchist colonies such as Utopia, organized by Josiah Warren. By following this principle, no individual profits from the labor of another. Tucker described the wages received in such an employer-employee relationship as the individual laborer's full product. He envisioned that in such a society every worker would be self-employed and own their own private means of production, free to walk away from employment contracts. Tucker called communism \\"pseudo- anarchism\\" because it opposes wages and property, fearing that collectivization would subdue individuals to group mentality and rob workers of the full product of their labor. The Preamble to the Constitution of the anarcho-syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World labor union states unequivocally: > Instead of the conservative motto, \\"A fair day's wage for a fair day's > work,\\" we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, > \\"Abolition of the wage system.\\"  Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism  = Anarcho-capitalism = Anarcho- capitalism is a political philosophy that espouses anything voluntary is moral, including a voluntary employee/employer hierarchy which anarchists reject.

Anarcho-capitalists are distinguished from minarchists, who advocate a small Jeffersonian night-watchman state limited to protecting individuals and their properties from foreign and domestic aggression; and from anarchists, who support personal property and oppose private ownership of the means of production, interest, profit, rent and wage slavery which they view as inherent to capitalism. Anarcho-capitalists hold that in the absence of statute society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through the spontaneous and organic discipline of the free market in what its proponents describe as a voluntary society.Edward Stringham. Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice. p. 51. In an anarcho- capitalist society, law enforcement, courts and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors selected by consumers rather than centrally through confiscatory taxation. Along with all other goods and services, money would be privately and competitively provided in an open market and personal and economic activities would be regulated by victim-based dispute resolution organizations under tort and contract law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under political monopolies which tend to become corrupt in proportion to their monopolization.\\"Review of Kosanke's Instead of Politics ‚Äì Don Stacy\\" (2011). Libertarian Papers. (3:) 3. Business regulations such as corporate standards, public relations, product labels, rules for consumer protection, ethics and labor relations would be regulated voluntarily via the use of competitive trade associations, professional societies and standards bodies. In theory, this would establish market-recourse for businesses' decisions and allow the market to communicate effectively with businesses by the use of consumer unions instead of centralized regulatory mandates for companies imposed by the state which anarcho-capitalists argue is inefficient due to regulatory capture.Yilmaz, Yesim (20 April 1998).

However, the first person to use the term anarcho-capitalism was Murray Rothbard, who synthesized in the mid-20th century elements from the Austrian School, classical liberalism and 19th- century American individualist anarchists Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner while rejecting their labor theory of value and the norms they derived from it.Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought (1987). p. 290. . \\"A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker\\".

It is either Communism or chaos\\". Rothbard argued that the capitalist system is not properly anarcho-capitalist because it so often colludes with the state, writing: \\"The difference between free-market capitalism and state capitalism is precisely the difference between, on the one hand, peaceful, voluntary exchange, and on the other, violent expropriation. State capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble\\".Rothbard, Murray (1973). \\"A Future of Peace and Capitalism\\". In Weaver, James H. ed. Modern Political Economy. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. pp. 419‚Äì430. According to Rothbard, \\"what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts are what I would call 'free-market capitalism' on the one hand, and 'state capitalism' on the other\\". However, despite Rothbard's claims, Marxists do make a distinction between free-market capitalism and state capitalism. The term state capitalism was first used by Marxist politician Wilhelm Liebknecht in 1896 and Friedrich Engels, who developed Marxist theory, talked about capitalism with state ownership as a different form of capitalism. Rothbard maintained that anarcho-capitalism is the only true form of anarchism‚Äîthe only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality as he argues that any other form presupposes an authoritarian enforcement of political ideology such as \\"redistribution of private property\\".Rothbard, Murray (25 February 1972). \\"Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard\\". The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal. Retrieved 20 June 2020. According to this argument, the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society such as cooperatives, non-profit organizations, businesses and so on. Moreover, anarcho-capitalists as well as classical liberal minarchists argue that the application of anarchist ideals as advocated by what they term left-wing anarchists would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it. Based on their understanding of anarchism, in order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating capital, which they believe is a goal of those anarchists, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. They conclude that this body would inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is what anarcho-capitalists see as the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which they believe would be necessary under a \\"coercively\\" egalitarian-anarchist system.Tame, Chris R. (October 1983). The Chicago School: Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties. Economic Affairs. p. 56.

That none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines\\". Furthermore, he wrote: \\"We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive.

Anarchists follow Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in opposing ownership of workplaces by capitalists and aim to replace wage labor with workers' associations. Anarchists also agree with Peter Kropotkin's comment that \\"the origin of the anarchist inception of society [lies in] the criticism [...] of the hierarchical organisations and the authoritarian conceptions of society\\" rather than in simple opposition to the state or government.Anarchism, p. 158. They argue that the wage system is hierarchical and authoritarian in nature and consequently capitalism cannot be anarchist.Morris, Brian, Anthropology and Anarchism, \\"Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed\\" (no. 45); Mckay, Iain, The legacy of Voltairine De Cleyre, Anarcho-Syndicalist Review, no. 44; Brown, L.

Many defined themselves as socialists. Those early individualist anarchists defined capitalism in various ways, but it was often discussed in terms of usury: \\"There are three forms of usury, interest on money, rent on land and houses, and profit in exchange. Whoever is in receipt of any of these is a usurer\\".Martin, James J. Men against the State. p. 208. Excluding these, they tended to support free trade, free competition and varying levels of private property such as mutualism based on occupation and use property norms.Anti- capitalist market anarchists support private possession along Warren's, Proudhon's, or similar lines. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists support private property along Lockean or similar lines. It is this distinction which has led to the rift between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism, with the latter supporting the homestead principle. As anarchists consider themselves to be socialists and opposed to capitalism, anarcho-capitalism is seen as not being a form of anarchism.As Peter Marshall notes in his history of anarchism (Demanding the Impossible), \\"few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho- capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice\\". p. 565. Anarchist organisations such as the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (Spain) and the Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland) generally take an explicitly anti-capitalist stance. When in the 20th century several economists began to formulate a form of radical American libertarianism known as anarcho-capitalism, this has met resistance from those who hold that capitalism is inherently oppressive or statist and many anarchists and scholars do not consider anarcho-capitalism to properly cohere with the spirit, principles, or history of anarchism.Peter Marshall, Demanding the Impossible; John Clark, The Anarchist Moment; Albert Meltzer, Anarchism: Arguments for and Against; Noam Chomsky, Understanding Power, David Weick, Anarchist Justice; Brian Morris, \\"Anthropology and Anarchism,\\" Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed (no. 45); Peter Sabatini, Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy; Donald Rooum, What is Anarchism?; Bob Black, Libertarian as Conservative While other anarchists and scholars regard anarchism as referring only to opposition to the non-privatisation of all aspects of the state and do consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of anarchism,1) Perlin, Terry M.

Like anarcho-capitalists, proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, but they maintain that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support anti-capitalist, anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical and pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views regarding socio-cultural issues.Gary Chartier and Charles W.

Anarcho-capitalists who argue for private property which supports absentee and landlordism ownership rather than occupation and use property norms as well as the principle of homesteading are considered right-libertarians rather than anarchists. This is due to anarchism, including the individualists, viewing any absentee ownership and ownership claims on land and natural resources as immoral and illegitimate,McElroy, Wendy (1995). \\"Intellectual Property: The Late Nineteenth Century Libertarian Debate\\".

Criticism of anarcho-capitalism  Anarchists argue that anarcho- capitalism does not in fact get rid of the state and that it simply privatises it. According to Brian Morris, anarcho-capitalists \\"simply replaced the state with private security firms, and can hardly be described as anarchists as the term is normally understood\\". According to anarchist Peter Sabatini, anarcho- capitalism \\"represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state\\", but that anarcho-capitalists' claim as anarchists is \\"quickly voided\\" because they \\"only wants an end to the public state\\" and allow \\"countless private states\\", or that it dissolves into city states as argued by Paul Birch.Birch, Paul (1998). \\"Anarcho-capitalism Dissolves Into City States\\". Libertarian Alliance. Legal Notes. (28): 1‚Äì4. . Retrieved 20 June 2020. Another criticism is that anarcho-capitalism turns justice into a commodity as private defense and court firms would favour those who pay more for their services. Anarchists such as Albert Meltzer argue that since anarcho-capitalism promotes the idea of private armies such as private defense agencies, it actually supports a \\"limited State\\". Meltzer contends that it \\"is only possible to conceive of Anarchism which is free, communistic and offering no economic necessity for repression of countering it\\". Anarcho- capitalists believe that negative rights should be recognized as legitimate, but positive rights should be rejected. Some critics reject the distinction between positive and negative rights, including Peter Marshall and Noam Chomsky. Marshall argues that the anarcho-capitalist definition of freedom is entirely negative and that it cannot guarantee the positive freedom of individual autonomy and independence.Marshall, Peter (2008). Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. London: Harper Perennial. p. 565. . \\"In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practicing voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists.\\" About anarcho-capitalism, Chomsky has written: Anarchists argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion which violates both anarchist principles and anarcho- capitalism's non-aggression principle. David Graeber noted his skepticism about anarcho-capitalism along the same lines: Anarchists view any ownership claims on land and natural resources as immoral and illegitimate. While anarchists, including individualist anarchists, market anarchists and mutualists, adamantly oppose absentee ownership, anarcho-capitalists have strong abandonment criteria in which one maintains ownership until one agrees to trade or gift it. Anarchists critics of this view tend to have comparatively weak abandonment criteria as one loses ownership when one stops personally occupying and using it. Furthermore, the idea of perpetually binding original appropriation is considered to be anathema to anarchist schools of thought as well as to any moral or economic philosophy that takes equal natural rights to land and the Earth's resources as a premise.  Definitional issues  Anarchist schools of thought encompass not only a range of individual schools, but also a considerable divergence in the use of some key terms. Some terms such as socialism have been subject to multiple definitions and ideological struggle throughout the period of the development of anarchism. Others such as capitalism are used in divergent and often contradictory ways by different schools within the tradition. In addition, the meanings of terms such as mutualism have changed over time, sometimes without spawning new schools. All of these terminological difficulties contribute to misunderstandings within and about anarchism. A central concern is whether anarchism is defined in opposition to hierarchy, authority and the state, or simply capitalism and the state. Debates over the meaning of anarchism emerge from the fact that it refers to both an abstract philosophical position and to intellectual, political and institutional traditions, all of which have been fraught with conflict. Some minimal, abstract definitions encourage the inclusion of figures, movements and philosophical positions which have historically positioned themselves outside, or even in opposition to, individuals and traditions that have identified themselves as anarchist. While anti-statism is central, there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.McLaughlin, Paul (2007). \\"Defining Anarchism\\".

Freeden, Michael; Stears, Marc (eds.). \\"Anarchism\\". The Oxford Handbook of Political Ideologies.

[...] The fact that [socialist and individualist anarchisms] share a core concept of 'anti-statism', which is often advanced as [...] a commonality between them [...], is insufficient to produce a shared identity [...] because [they interpret] the concept of state-rejection [...] differently despite the initial similarity in nomenclature\\" (pp. 386‚Äì388).Long 2013, p. 217. While it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization (including the state, capitalism, nationalism and all associated institutions) in the conduct of all human relations in favour of a society based on voluntary association, freedom and decentralisation, this definition has its own shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an a posteriori concussion). Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following: # The will for a non-coercive society. # The rejection of the state apparatus. # The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society. # A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy. Usages in political circles have varied considerably. In 1888, the individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker included the full text of a \\"Socialistic Letter\\" by Ernest Lesigne in his essay on \\"State Socialism and Anarchism\\". According to Lesigne, there are two socialisms: \\"One is dictatorial, the other libertarian\\".Tucker, Benjamin. State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree and Wherein They Differ. In 1894, Richard T. Ely noted that anarchism had \\"already acquired a variety of meanings\\". In its most general sense, these included the view that society is \\"a living, growing organism, the laws of which are something different from the laws of individual action\\".Ely, Richard Theodore (1894).

London: HarperCollins. p. 641. . \\"For a long time, libertarian was interchangeable in France with anarchist but in recent years, its meaning has become more ambivalent.\\" While both anarchists and anarcho-capitalist have used it, libertarian was synonymous with anarchism until the mid-20th century, when anarcho-capitalist theory developed.Cohn, Jesse (20 April 2009). \\"Anarchism\\".

Anarcho-capitalists are distinguished from the dominant anarchist tradition by their relation to property and capital. While both anarchism and anarcho-capitalism share general antipathy towards power by government authority, the latter exempts power wielded through free-market capitalism. Anarchists, including egoists such as Max Stirner, have supported the protection of an individual's freedom from powers of both government and private property owners. In contrast, while condemning governmental encroachment on personal liberties, anarcho-capitalists support freedoms based on private property rights. Anarcho-capitalist theorist Murray Rothbard argued that protesters should rent a street for protest from its owners. The abolition of public amenities is a common theme in some anarcho-capitalist writings. As anarcho-capitalism puts laissez-faire economics before economic equality, it is commonly viewed as incompatible with the anti-capitalist and egalitarian tradition of anarchism. Although anarcho-capitalist theory implies the abolition of the state in favour of a fully laissez-faire economy,Gay, Kathlyn; Gay, Martin (1999). Encyclopedia of Political Anarchy. ABC-CLIO. . it lies outside the tradition of anarchism.Marshall, Peter (1992). Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. London: HarperCollins. pp. 564‚Äì565. . \\"Anarcho-capitalists are against the State simply because they are capitalists first and foremost. [...] They are not concerned with the social consequences of capitalism for the weak, powerless and ignorant.

In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice. Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid.

While using the language of anarchism, anarcho- capitalism only shares anarchism's antipathy towards the state and not anarchism's antipathy towards hierarchy as theorists expect from anarcho- capitalist economic power relations.Davis, Laurence (2019). \\"Individual and Community\\".

It follows a different paradigm from anarchism and has a fundamentally different approach and goals. In spite of the anarcho- in its title, anarcho-capitalism is more closely affiliated with capitalism and right-libertarianism than with anarchism.

Since anarchism has been historically identified with the socialist and anti-capitalist movement as well as with socialist economics, the main divide within anarchism is between anti-market anarchists and pro-market anarchists.

Contra the collectivist or communist wing of social anarchism, seen as representing the more class-struggle oriented and revolutionary socialist- aligned forms of anarchism, individualist anarchism has been described as the anarchist school most influenced by and tied to liberalism (especially classical liberalism) as well as the liberal-socialist or socialist-liberal wing of anarchism and libertarian socialism.Boyd, Tony; Harrison, Kevin, eds.

Brill's Companion to Anarchism and Philosophy. BRILL. p. 81. . To differentiate it from individualist anarchism, anarchists prefer using social anarchism to characterize certain strides of anarchism from individualist anarchism. The former focuses on the social aspect and is more working class and mass organisational-oriented, supporting decentralised economic planning. The latter focuses on the individual, is more anti-organisational and supports either free-market forms of socialism or other anarchist economics. Nonetheless, anarchists do not seeing the two categories as mutually exclusive or as representing socialist and capitalist views within anarchism. This led to anarchism without adjectives.Esenwein, George Richard (1989). Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868-1898. p. 135. \\"Anarchism without adjectives referred to an unhyphenated form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as communist, collectivist, mutualist, or individualist. For others, [...] [it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools\\". Mutualism is seen as the middle or third category between social anarchism and individualist anarchism, although it is often considered part of social anarchism and sometimes part of individualist anarchism. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon spoke of social individualism and described the mutualism and the freedom it pursued as the synthesis between communism and property.Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1848). What Is Property?. While some anarcho-capitalists theorists and scholars divide anarchism into individualist anarchism and social anarchism as representing capitalist and socialist viewpoints, anarchist theorists and scholars reject this. Anarchists do not see this as a struggle between socialism and capitalism, or as social anarchism and individualist anarchism as being mutually exclusive, but rather as complementary. Their differences comes from the means to attain anarchy rather than on their ends. Against some anarcho- capitalist theorists and scholars who see individualist anarchism as pro- capitalist, anarchists reiterate that anarchism is socialist, meaning anti- statist and libertarian socialism. Anarchists such as Luigi Galleani and Errico Malatesta have seen no contradiction between individualist anarchism and social anarchism,Galleani, Luigi (1925). \\"The End of Anarchism?\\".

One first example of this is mutualism as developed by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in the 18th century, from which emerged individualist anarchism.

In Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture. Berg Publishers. p. 107. This tradition has been recently associated with contemporary scholars such as Kevin Carson, Roderick T. Long, Charles W. Johnson, Brad Spangler, Sheldon Richman, Chris Matthew Sciabarra and Gary Chartier, who are critics of laissez-faire as commonly understood and instead argue that a truly laissez-faire system would be anti-capitalist and socialist.Nick Manley, \\"Brief Introduction To Left-Wing Laissez Faire Economic Theory: Part One\\".Nick Manley, \\"Brief Introduction To Left-Wing Laissez Faire Economic Theory: Part Two\\". Murray Rothbard, who coined the term anarcho- capitalism and advocated such philosophy, argued that the robber baron period, hailed by the right and despised by the left as a heyday of laissez-faire, was not characterized by laissez-faire at all, but it was in fact a time of massive state privilege accorded to capital. The doyen of modern American market-oriented libertarianism and an Austrian School economist, Rothbard was initially an enthusiastic partisan of the Old Right, particularly because of its general opposition to war and imperialism.See Justin Raimondo, An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard (Amherst, NY: Prometheus 2001). However, Rothbard had long embraced a reading of American history that emphasized the role of elite privilege in shaping legal and political institutions‚Äîone that was naturally agreeable to many on the left‚Äîand came increasingly in the 1960s to seek alliances on the left and especially with members of the New Left in light of the Vietnam War,Cp. Raimondo 151‚Äì209. the military draft and the emergence of the Black Power movement.See Brian M. Doherty, Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement (New York: Public Affairs 2007) 338. Working with other radicals like Ronald RadoshSee Murray N. Rothbard and Ronald Radosh, eds., A New History of Leviathan: Essays on the Rise of the American Corporate State (New York: Dutton 1972). and Karl Hess,Cp. Karl Hess, Dear America (New York: Morrow 1975). Rothbard argued that the consensus view of American economic history, according to which a beneficent government has used its power to counter corporate predation, is fundamentally flawed. Rather, he argued that government intervention in the economy has largely benefited established players at the expense of marginalized groups, to the detriment of both liberty and equality.On partnerships between the state and big business and the role of big business in promoting regulation, see Gabriel Kolko, The Triumph of Conservatism: A Reinterpretation of American History, 1900‚Äì1916 (New York: Free 1977); Butler Shaffer, In Restraint of Trade: The Business Campaign against Competition, 1918‚Äì1938 (Auburn, AL: Mises 2008). In tandem with his emphasis on the intimate connection between state and corporate power, he defended the seizure of corporations dependent on state largesse by workers and others.Rothbard, Murray N. (15 June 1969). \\"Confiscation and the Homestead Principle.\\" Libertarian Forum. 1:6. pp. 3‚Äì4. Rothbard ultimately broke with the left, allying himself instead with the burgeoning paleoconservative movement.See Raimondo 277-8; Doherty 562-5. This caused a divide between left-Rothbardians and right-Rothbardians, with most right- Rothbardians identifying as anarcho-capitalists, conservatives, paleoconservatives, paleolibertarians, propertarians or right-libertarians whereas left-Rothbardians and some thinkers associated with market-oriented libertarianism, drawing on the work of Rothbard during his alliance with the left and on the thought of Karl Hess, came increasingly to identify with the left on a range of issues, including opposition to war, corporate oligopolies and state-corporate partnerships as well as an affinity for cultural liberalism against Rothbard's later cultural conservatism and right-wing populism. One variety of this kind of libertarianism has been a resurgent mutualism, incorporating modern economic ideas such as marginal utility theory into mutualist theory. Carson's Studies in Mutualist Political EconomyCarson, Kevin. \\"Studies in Mutualist Political Economy\\". Chs. 1‚Äì3. helped to stimulate the growth of new-style mutualism, articulating a version of the labor theory of value incorporating ideas drawn from Austrian economics.See Kevin A. Carson, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy (Charleston, SC: BookSurge 2007). This book was the focus of a symposium in the Journal of Libertarian Studies. Some left-Rothbardians are mutualists whereas other left-Rothbardians and market-oriented left-libertarians have declined to embrace mutualist views of real property while sharing the mutualist opposition to corporate hierarchies and wealth concentration.Roderick T. Long, \\"Land Locked: A Critique of Carson on Property Rights,\\" Journal of Libertarian Studies 20.1 (Winter 2006): 87‚Äì95. Those left-libertarians have placed particular emphasis on the articulation and defense of a libertarian theory of class and class conflict, although considerable work in this area has been performed by libertarians of other persuasions.Sheldon Richman, \\"Class Struggle Rightly Conceived,\\" The Goal Is Freedom (Foundation for Economic Education, July 13, 2007); Nock, Our Enemy, the State; Franz Oppenheimer, The State (San Francisco: Fox 1997); Tom G.

Those left-Rothbardians and libertarians maintain that because of its heritage and its emancipatory goals and potential radical market anarchism should be seen by its proponents and by others as part of the socialist tradition and that market anarchists like anarcho-capitalists can and should call themselves socialists, echoing the language of libertarian socialists like American individualist anarchists Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner and British Thomas Hodgskin. Some of those left-Rothbardians have used Rothbardian arguments such as the homestead principle and a labor theory of property to support anarchist concepts such as workers' self-management.Long, Roderick T.

This would mean transforming government utilities, schools and other services into consumer cooperatives and placing them under the direct control of their present clientele. It would mean handing over state industry to workers' syndicates and transforming it into worker-owned cooperatives\\". Retrieved 10 January 2020. In response to claims from anarcho-capitalists that he uses the term capitalism incorrectly, Kevin Carson says he is deliberately choosing to resurrect what he claims to be an old definition of the term in order to \\"make a point\\". He claims that \\"the term 'capitalism,' as it was originally used, did not refer to a free market, but to a type of statist class system in which capitalists controlled the state and the state intervened in the market on their behalf\\".Carson, Kevin A. Carson's Rejoinders. Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 20, No. 1 (Winter 2006): 97‚Äì136, pp. 116, 117. Carson holds that \\"capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the Middle Ages, was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier feudal conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable\\".Richman, Sheldon (March 2011). \\"Libertarian Left\\". The American Conservative. Retrieved 14 August 2011 In addition to individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker's big four monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents), Carson argues that the state has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies, arguing that in a truly laissez- faire system the ability to extract a profit from labor and capital would be negligible. In response to criticism from anarcho-capitalists who reject the labor theory of value in favor of the subjective theory of value and support marginalism, the theoretical sections of Carson's Studies in Mutualist Political Economy are presented as an attempt to integrate marginalist critiques into the labor theory of value. Gary Chartier offers an understanding of property rights as contingent yet tightly constrained social strategies, reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate ownership and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust yet non-absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by David Hume.Gary Chartier, Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society (New York: Cambridge UP 2013) pp. 44‚Äì156. This account is distinguished from anarcho-capitalists who are propertarian and hold Lockean and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from consequentialist accounts that might license widespread ad hoc interference with the possessions of groups and individuals.Justice, pp. 32‚Äì46.Gary Chartier, \\"Natural Law and Non- Aggression,\\" Acta Juridica Hungarica 51.2 (June 2010): pp. 79‚Äì96. Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the view that solidaristic wealth redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern.Justice, pp. 47‚Äì68. Chartier advances detailed arguments for workplace democracy rooted in such natural law principles as subsidiarity which anarcho-capitalists reject,Justice 89‚Äì120. defending it instead as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state.Gary Chartier, \\"Pirate Constitutions and Workplace Democracy,\\" Jahrbuch f√ºr Recht und Ethik 18 (2010): pp. 449‚Äì467. He also discusses natural law approaches to land reform and to the occupation of factories by workers which anarcho-capitalists may see as infranging on property owners' rights.Justice, pp. 123‚Äì154. Against anarcho-capitalists who support intellectual property, Chartier objects on natural law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory of property rights more generallyGary Chartier,' \\"Intellectual Property and Natural Law,\\" Australian Journal of Legal Philosophy 36 (2011): pp. 58‚Äì88. and developing a general natural law account of boycotts.Justice, pp. 176‚Äì182.  Left-wing market anarchism  Left-wing market anarchism is a form of individualist anarchism, libertarian socialism and free-market anarchism as distinct from anarcho-capitalism, whose genealogy overlaps to a significant degree with that of Steiner‚ÄìVallentyne left-libertarianism as the roots of that tradition are sketched in the book The Origins of Left- Libertarianism.Steiner, Hillel Vallentyne, Peter (2000). The Origins of Left Libertarianism. Palgrave. Carson‚ÄìLong-style left-libertarianism is rooted in 19th-century mutualism and in the work of figures such as American individualist anarchists Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner and Thomas Hodgskin, a British critic of capitalism and defender of free trade and early trade unions. Relationships between such market anarchists and the New Left thrived in the 1960s, laying the groundwork for modern left-wing market anarchism.Long, Roderick T. (2006). \\"Rothbard's 'Left and Right': Forty Years Later.\\" Rothbard Memorial Lecture, Austrian Scholars Conference. Left-wing market anarchism identifies with left-libertarianism whereas anarcho- capitalism is considered a form of right-libertarianism. Unlike anarcho- capitalists, they believe that neither claiming nor mixing one's labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights and those who support private property do so under occupation and use property norms as in mutualism or under the condition that recompense is offered to the local or even global community as advocated by geoists and geolibertarians. Arguing that vast disparities in wealth and social influence result from the use of force and especially state power to steal and engross land and acquire and maintain special privileges, members of this thought typically urge the abolition of the state. They judge that in a stateless society, the kinds of privileges secured by the state will be absent and injustices perpetrated or tolerated by the state can be rectified. According to libertarian scholar Sheldon Richman: Unlike anarcho-captalists, left-wing market anarchism explicity supports the labor movement and their struggles. Left-wing market anarchist Kevin Carson has praised individualist anarchist Dyer Lum's fusion of individualist economics with radical labor activism as \\"creative\\" and described him as \\"more significant than any in the Boston group\\".Carson, Kevin. \\"May Day Thoughts: Individualist Anarchism and the Labor Movement\\". Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti-Capitalism. Left-libertarian philosopher Roderick T. Long is an advocate of \\"build[ing] worker solidarity. On the one hand, this means formal organisation, including unionization ‚Äì but I'm not talking about the prevailing model of \\"business unions,\\" [...] but real unions, the old-fashioned kind, committed to the working class and not just union members, and interested in worker autonomy, not government patronage\\". In particular, Long has described the situation as follows: Contemporary left- wing market anarchists show markedly more sympathy than anarcho-capitalists towards various cultural movements which challenge non-governmental relations of power. Left-wing market anarchists such as Roderick T. Long and Charles W. Johnson have called for a recovery of the 19th-century alliance with radical liberalism and feminism.Long, Roderick T.; Johnson, Charles W. (1 May 2005). \\"Libertarian Feminism: Can this Marriage Be Saved?\\" Molinari Society. While adopting similar views, including opposition to drug prohibition, gun control, civil liberties violations and war, left-wing market anarchists are more likely than most self-identified anarcho-capitalists to take more distinctively leftist stances on issues as diverse as feminism, gender and sexuality, class, immigration and environmentalism. Especially influential regarding these topics have been scholars including Long, Johnson, Chris Matthew Sciabarra and Arthur Silber. Unlike anarcho-capitalism, left-wing market anarchism also does not have any strict agreement what constitutes legitimate property titles.

Market anarchists recognize that anarchism has been historically identified with the socialist and anti-capitalist movement, arguing that anarcho-capitalists should explicitly reject capitalism and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement since by capitalism they mean the free market rather than actually existing capitalism,Makdisi, Saree; Casarino, Cesare; Karl, Rebecca E. (1996). Marxism Beyond Marxism. Routledge. p. 198.Sayers, Sean (1998). Marxism and Human Nature.

The latter is used by anarchists to criticize state socialism as nothing more than state capitalism.Bottomore, Thomas B. (1964). Elites and Society p. 54.Gouldner, A. W.

Much like socialism has been conflated with state socialism in the 20th century due to Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states, capitalism has been similarly conflated with the free market when capitalism was coined in the 18th century to mean a construed political system built on privileges for the owners of capital.\\"L'Angleterre a-t-elle l'heureux privil√®ge de n'avoir ni Agioteurs, ni Banquiers, ni Faiseurs de services, ni Capitalistes ?\\".

University of Chicago Press. p. 252. Left-wing market anarchists argue that capitalism necessarily rest on the state to survive and that it was always seen as what would be later termed state capitalism. Those anarchists make the point that free market for classical economists such as Adam Smith did not mean a market free from government or social interference as it is now commonly assumed or as anarcho-capitalists argue, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities, implying that economic rents, i.e. profits generated from a lack of perfect competition, must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition. Those anarchists argue that a true free-market or laissez-faire system would be better served under socialism rather than capitalism. Anarcho- socialism or socialist anarchism are rejected by anarchists since they consider themselves socialists of the libertarian tradition and are used by anarcho-capitalist theorists and scholars who recognize anarcho-capitalism to differentiate between the two. = Globalization = Anarchists are actively involved in the anti-globalization movement, seeing corporate globalization as a neocolonialist attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the Group of Eight, the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and the World Trade Organization. Globalization is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Many anarchists use the term to mean cultural imperialism and neocolonialism which they see as related. Anarcho-capitalists use globalization to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene. Anarcho-capitalists see the worldwide expansion of the division of labor through trade as a boon, but they oppose the regulation and cartelization imposed by global institutions and managed-trade agreements such as the Central America Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Anarcho-capitalists also object to fiat money issued by central banks and resulting debasement of money and confiscation of wealth.

Lucassen started his career in 1980 as the guitarist and backing vocalist of Dutch band Bodine as Iron Anthony, before joining Vengeance in 1984. After eight years he left the band, wanting to go into a more progressive direction, and released two years later an unsuccessful solo album entitled Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy under the nickname Anthony. In 1995, Lucassen released an album uncredited to any artist called Ayreon: The Final Experiment, in which he sang, wrote every song and played most of the instruments. The album conducted to the creation of Ayreon; despite being relatively unknown at first, the project gained notable attention and praise with the release of its third album Into the Electric Castle, establishing Lucassen as a notable composer of rock operas. Following Ayreon's success, Lucassen has been involved in many other projects: he is the creator, composer and current guitarist/keyboardist of Star One, Guilt Machine, and The Gentle Storm, and the creator and former guitarist of Ambeon and Stream of Passion. He composes and writes most of his songs, but leaves the lyrics to his musical partners in some of his projects. Lucassen plays a wide variety of instruments: his main instruments are guitar and keyboards, however he also plays bass, banjo and many others. Overall, in his career and including all his bands and projects (as principal instrumentalist/creative force or as a member), Lucassen has released twenty-six studio albums, four live albums, two EPs and seventeen singles. He has also made many minor participations alongside various artists including Shadow Gallery, After Forever, Within Temptation and Avantasia, and appears in over 50 albums. Since the creation of Ayreon, Lucassen progressively made a name for himself under rock and metal reviewers, with many critics calling him a \\"genius\\", and praising his composition abilities and originality. In his review of 01011001, AllMusic reviewer Cosmo Lee stated \\"Music this over the top almost defies criticism. Reviewing it is like reviewing the world's tallest building. It doesn't care; it just goes on and on.\\"  Career  Lucassen's love of music was sparked in the 60s, when he became a big fan of The Beatles. He decided to learn guitar when he heard Ritchie Blackmore playing in Made in Japan. One of his first bands was called Mover, which he joined around the age of 18. = Bodine (1980‚Äì1984) = In 1980, Lucassen joined Bodine via their drummer Gerrard Haitsma, who was also the drum teacher of Mover's drummer. Under the nickname Iron Anthony, he was featured on their second album, Bold as Brass (1982), and their third and final album, Three Times Running (1983). Lucassen later recalled about his years with Bodine: \\"on one side they were good musicians, extremely good musicians, the best drummer in Holland (Gerard Haitsma), an incredible guitar player and a very steddy [sic] bass player (Armand van der Hoff). And I actually learned how to play there, how to play very tight, how to play in tune, you know, to play solo not just fast but to play one note and do it good. But on the other hand, they were kind of boring guys, they were all 10 years older than me, they didn't like partying and stuff. And in those days I was young, I was 20, after the girls and after the party, you know. So it was a bit boring. And another problem in that band was that they didn't like melody, they were in love with AC/DC and stuff like that. And I always liked melodic music, already in those days I was into prog music. So I didn't like to be there, I wrote songs but they were just a little part of me.\\" In 1984, Lucassen left Bodine to join Vengeance; they disbanded shortly after. = Vengeance (1984‚Äì1992) = In 1984, the newly created band Vengeance played as supporting act for Bodine. When Lucassen, who had been impressed by their performance, was later contacted by the band to ask if he knew any potential replacement for their guitarist who had just left, he proposed himself and joined the band, leaving Bodine. Regarding their original self-titled album released in 1984, Lucassen stated in a 2002 interview that the album was \\"horrible\\", adding \\"The songs were mostly finished when I joined the band. I think I wrote just two songs for that album and it was recorded very cheap, the sound is bad and the songs are not that good. So it's not a very strong album although you can already hear the potential\\". The band later established themselves as one of the most successful bands of the Netherlands at the time. He also recalled a concert in Germany cancelled at the last moment because \\"after the first night Vengeance wrecked the hotel, it was like $10,000 damage. We were not allowed to leave Germany, they took our equipment... so that was really sex, drugs and rock'n'roll!\\" In 1989, the band was forced to fire their lead vocalist Leon Goewie, who was, according to Lucassen, \\"really crazy on stage. The only problem was that he was also crazy offstage. But he also liked to have a stiff drink now and then, if you know what I mean\\". Vengeance found little success with their new vocalist Ian Parry, and disbanded in 1992 after a surprisingly successful farewell tour. While Lucassen pursued his solo career, Vengeance's label released The Last of the Fallen Heroes, promoted as a new studio album but actually a compilation of unfinished demos, in 1994. Goewie, who was heavily struggling as a musician after being fired from the band, later contacted Lucassen, asking him to write him songs. Lucassen wrote two songs, which were later featured on a new Vengeance album, Back from Flight 19, in 1997; despite participating to this new album, Lucassen did not re-join Vengeance. He later stated about Back from Flight 19 \\"I'm not so proud of that album. There's a couple of good songs but it's definitely not Vengeance.\\" = Solo debuts (1992‚Äì1995) = After his departure, Lucassen first tried to create a new band, Planet Nine. However, according to his words in The Final Experiment book, \\"nobody even wanted to touch it\\". He released his first solo album, Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy, under the name \\"Anthony\\" in 1994. It was a commercial flop; according to Lucassen, \\"people didn't understand it. It wasn't hard rock, it wasn't prog or something. People thought, 'What's that he is doing now? He must be crazy!'\\" Remembering this period, Lucassen stated \\"it was the period in my life when my girlfriend broke up with me, Vengeance broke up and I had no more record deal. So it was a horrible time\\". = Ayreon's debut and fame (1995‚Äì2000) = After his first unsuccessful solo album, Lucassen began recording The Final Experiment, which was released in 1995 as Ayreon: The Final Experiment on a small Dutch label, Transmission Records, with no artist noted. The album featured a wide array of musical styles, ranging from folk to progressive metal. It was soon followed by Ayreon's first single, \\"Sail Away to Avalon\\". One year later, Lucassen decided to continue the project started with The Final Experiment, using Ayreon as the project's official name, and released a second album titled Actual Fantasy. The album later became the exception in Ayreon's discography, as the only Ayreon release that does not feature a single overarching story concept. The single \\"The Stranger from Within\\" from this album was also released. It was a relative commercial failure. Lucassen decided to make one more album, and to stop Ayreon if this one did not become a commercial success. The same year, Lucassen, tired after the complexity of Ayreon, decided to do \\"something really simple, like punky or heavy versions of 1960s songs\\" and released Strange Hobby, a cover album without artist name or any personnel credited at the idea of the record company to make people curious about the record. According to Lucassen, \\"it didn't work because people knew how it was and they weren't so interested, so it was another flop. But I think it's good. Maybe the songs are too much alike, too short and after 10 songs you think, 'Oh, that's it?!' But I do like that album and I'm not ashamed that I did it.'\\" In 1998 the commercially successful and critically acclaimed Ayreon album Into the Electric Castle was released. It is still currently considered one of the best albums in Lucassen's career. The good reception to the album made Lucassen decide to continue the project Ayreon. The next two Ayreon albums, Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer and Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator, considered as two parts of the same story, were released simultaneously on June 20, 2000. The two sold well and were received positively, despite Part 1 being considered superior to Part 2 by most critics. \\"Temple of the Cat\\" from Part 1 was released as a single the same-year, and again the following year in an acoustic version. = First side projects; Ambeon and Star One (2000‚Äì2003) = In 2000 Lucassen created Ambeon, his first side-project since the creation of Ayreon, to explore a softer style of his music. The band consisted of him as composer and principal instrumentalist and then 14-year-old Astrid van der Veen as singer and lyricist. They released their only album Fate of a Dreamer in 2001, along with the single \\"Cold Metal\\". The album had a limited success. Ambeon's atmospheric sound draws from a wide variety of influences, including celtic, gothic, progressive music, and dark ambient. The songs on Fate of a Dreamer were mostly composed of different remixed pieces of songs from Ayreon albums. The name of the band was a play on the words ambient and Ayreon. The album went out of print shortly after its release and was considered rare, until Lucassen re-released it in December 2011, with the addition of a bonus CD containing previously unreleased tracks. Lucassen was not satisfied with the final result, stating \\"it's a bit cold for me. It's too electronic, a bit too much computers... And I didn't know how well Astrid could sing for I didn't know her and she didn't know me\\". Van der Veen retired from music after the release of Fate of a Dreamer, leading to Lucassen stating that there'd most likely be no future Ambeon albums, despite the fact he would have liked it. Van der Veen eventually released a new record for herself in 2012 after a long battle with depression and addiction, but does not seem to intend on performing actively anymore. In 2002, Lucassen created another side-project, entitled Star One; the only side-project to date he made more than one studio album with. Star One focused on four singers: Dan Swan√∂, Russell Allen, Floor Jansen and Damian Wilson; Lucassen played guitar, keyboards and hammond organ. Their first album Space Metal was released in 2002. The album also had limited success, although it was more successful than Ambeon. Live on Earth, the first live album in Lucassen's career which also included Ayreon songs, was released one year later. = The Human Equation and 01011001, Stream of Passion (2003‚Äì2008) = Lucassen with Stream of Passion at a concert in Amstelveen in 2007 Four years after Universal Migrator, Lucassen released Ayreon's sixth album, The Human Equation. It was a commercial success, going No. 7 in the Dutch album charts, and some critics considered the album as Lucassen's best since Into the Electric Castle.) Special editions of all Ayreon albums were released in 2004 when Lucassen switched label from Transmission to InsideOut Records; The new edition of The Final Experiment featured a bonus disc of newly recorded, semi-acoustic versions of songs from the album, while Actual Fantasy was entirely remixed and partially re-recorded, with the new version being titled Actual Fantasy: Revisited. In 2005, Lucassen created Stream of Passion in 2005 to make a more conventional progressive metal band with symphonic and gothic inspirations. He also wanted to showcase the talents of his friend and Mexican female vocalist Marcela Bovio, who also sang on The Human Equation and who had won a contest on Lucassen's website. He recruited second guitarist Lori Linstruth (his future girlfriend), keyboardist Alejandro Mill√°n (Bovio's then-boyfriend), bassist Johan van Stratum (Bovio's future husband), and drummer Davy Mickers, and started the band. As with Astrid van der Veen for Ambeon, Lucassen was in charge of composing the music, while letting Bovio write the lyrics. They released the album Embrace the Storm in 2005. Like Lucassen had done with Star One, Stream of Passion toured and released a live album, Live in the Real World, in 2006. Also like Star One, the tour featured many Ayreon songs, as well as songs from the album. He finally left the band in 2007, as he had planned beforehand. The band continued successfully without him: They subsequently released three studio albums, The Flame Within, Darker Days and A War of Our Own, before amicably disbanding in 2016. In 2008, Lucassen released a new Ayreon album, 01011001, which achieved commercial success, reaching No. 2 in the Dutch album chart. The album was meant to be the conclusion of the Ayreon storyline, and after its release Lucassen decided to temporarily stop Ayreon, because he was not inspired to continue and also because many critics (despite the album being well reviewed) noted that there was nothing new being offered on 01011001; he believed that he might make more Ayreon albums in the future, but that they would not follow the same storyline. = Ayreon hiatus, focus on other projects (2008‚Äì2012) = In February 2009 Lucassen announced on his website his new side-project: Guilt Machine. The project features a very limited line- up compared to other Lucassen side projects: himself on many instruments and backing vocals, Jasper Steverlinck (Arid) on lead vocals, Chris Maitland (ex- Porcupine Tree) on drums and Lori Linstruth (ex-Stream of Passion) on lead guitar. Their first album On This Perfect Day, released the same year, received a very good critical reception but was Lucassen's least commercially successful album in many years. In 2010, Lucassen reunited the six other members of Star One, inactive since 2003, and released the band's second studio album Victims of the Modern Age. The album received critical acclaim and was a big commercial success. In December 2011 the Ambeon album Fate of a Dreamer, like the older Ayreon albums, was re-released with bonus tracks. At the same time as that the Ambeon album was re-released, Lucassen was already busy composing and recording his next project. On 23 April 2012, Lucassen released Lost in the New Real, his first solo album since Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy 18 years before. On this album Lucassen sang all leading vocals, wrote all lyrics and played almost all instruments. Also, he asked the Dutch actor Rutger Hauer to provide narration between the tracks, similar to as he had done on Into The Electric Castle. Artwork for this album was done by Claudio Bergamin. = Ayreon revival and The Gentle Storm (2012‚Äì2017) = On 23 August 2012, Lucassen published on his YouTube channel that he started composing \\"a new project\\". On 9 October 2012, he revealed it via YouTube again to be a new Ayreon album, planned for 2013. Responding to fan comments on his website, Lucassen stated on 12 October that it would probably take a year before the album was completed. He also stated that the album would be the start of a new story apart from the previous Ayreon albums, and confirmed the presence of Ed Warby as usual. On late 2012, Tobias Sammet announced that Arjen would make some guest lead guitar works in his new Avantasia album, The Mystery of Time. This marked the second time both musicians have worked together, the first having been the Ayreon EP Elected, on the title-song, in which Tobias sang guest vocals. On 26 March 2013, Lucassen revealed the name of the next Ayreon's album, The Theory of Everything. This album was released on 25 October and received positive reviews. On 22 April 2014, Lucassen revealed that his new project would be a collaboration with Dutch singer Anneke van Giersbergen, who previously collaborated with him in Ayreon albums Into the Electric Castle and 01011001. He described it as \\"an epic double concept album, a combination of ‚Äòclassical meets metal‚Äô and ‚Äòacoustic folk‚Äô.\\" Lucassen's most recurrent collaborator Ed Warby was featured once again on drums, and it was his very first album featuring double bass among the instruments. He confirmed that Johan van Stratum from his former band Stream of Passion would play bass on the album. Also, due to \\"unforeseen problems\\", Warby had to re-record all his drums part in one day only. On 2 September 2014, Lucassen revealed that his collaboration with van Giersbergen was actually a new band, called The Gentle Storm. A cover EP entitled The Gentle Storm Exclusive Tour CD, and their first album, The Diary, were both released in 2015, with van Giersbergen writing all the lyrics and him composing the music. The band toured in 2015, without him; however he was featured on a few acoustic shows by the band in the Netherlands. Between September 18 and 20, 2015, a live version of The Human Equation, directed by Lucassen's former manager Yvette Boertje and featuring most of the original album's singers and musicians, took place for four shows. Although he was not involved in the creative process, Lucassen appeared at the end of each show, and acted as producer and mixer for the DVD/live album, entitled The Theater Equation and released on June 17, 2016. On October 6, 2016, Lucassen's next project was announced to be a new Ayreon studio album. After revealing the cast one by one during the following months, he revealed its cover art and title, The Source, on January 19, 2017. The album was released on April 28, 2017 and was a commercial success, topping the albums charts in the Netherlands at its release. = Focus on Ayreon live performances (2017-present) = In November 2016, Lucassen announced the first ever official Ayreon concerts for September 2017, entitled Ayreon Universe. The show featured 16 singers and 11 instrumentalists, all of which had previously worked together with Lucassen on his studio albums. Unlike The Theater Equation, it consisted of unrelated songs from Ayreon performed after each other as in a traditional concert, with a few songs from Star One featured as well. One of the performances was released as a live album/DVD on March 30, 2018, titled Ayreon Universe ‚Äì The Best of Ayreon Live. On December 7, 2017, Lucassen stated that a new Ayreon concert would take place on June 22, 2018 at Graspop Metal Meeting, where they would headline the Marquee stage. It featured the same instrumentalists as the Ayreon Universe shows and most of its vocalists, along with Simone Simons and Tom S. Englund, who had never performed live with Ayreon before, and Mark Jansen and Barry Hay, who had never collaborated with Lucassen before; Lucassen himself also performed a few songs. Between September 13 and 15 of 2019, the album Into the Electric Castle was performed in Tilburg in its entirety similarly to The Theater Equation in 2015, this time as official Ayreon performances. Fish, Anneke van Giersbergen, Damian Wilson, Edward Reekers, Edwin Balogh, and George Oosthoek returned from the original cast, alongside Ed Warby and flutist Thijs van Leer, who also performed on the original album. Simone Simons and Mark Jansen of Epica, Praying Mantis singer John Jaycee Cuijpers, Marcela Bovio, Bovio's husband and VUUR bassist Johan van Stratum, and Ex Libris members Dianne van Giersbergen and Bob Wijtsma were also featured, with actor John de Lancie acting as narrator. It was released as the live album Electric Castle Live and Other Tales on March 27, 2020. Ayreon was supposed to headline the Night of the Prog Festival in Germany on July 18, 2020 to perform Into the Electric Castle once again, however the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 8, 2020, Lucassen revealed on his YouTube channel that his next album would be an Ayreon album, titled Transitus and to be released the same year; the album will be released alongside a tie-in comic book.  Personal life  Lucassen stated that to him, \\"Music is everything. Both listening and creating. Even if I wouldn‚Äôt be successful I would be creating music. Music chose me, I didn‚Äôt choose music. I have no choice in the matter whatsoever!\\" According to Lucassen, his self-made motto is \\"the meaning of life is to give life meaning\\", a sentence which he included in the Ayreon song \\"The Sixth Extinction\\" from 01011001, and considers himself \\"a very rational man. I believe in science\\". = Family and relationships = Lucassen has an older brother, Gjalt, who speaks through a megaphone on the song \\"I'm The Slime\\" from his solo album Lost in the New Real. Every Lucassen album contains a \\"Gjalt joke\\" in its booklet, in which he refers to his brother. This is, at times, done in both a joking and/or mocking fashion, as for years he and Gjalt have had a rocky relationship and haven't always gotten along. He was married to Jolanda Verduijn, who appeared as bassist on The Final Experiment, until they divorced in 2006/2007. Lucassen is currently in a relationship with American guitarist and lyricist Lori Linstruth, who left Sweden to move in with him. She is his former bandmate from both Stream of Passion and Guilt Machine, and was featured in several Ayreon albums. Despite retiring as an active performer in 2010, she still acts as his manager, a role she has held since 2007, and is responsible for various other tasks on his albums; she notably co-wrote the story and lyrics of the Ayreon album The Theory of Everything. According to Lucassen, Linstruth supervises the making of all his works, notably his lyrics as English is her native language, and she is also an English teacher. = Health issues = During the recordings of The Human Equation from 2003 to 2004, Lucassen suffered from \\"increasing lower back problems\\". The Doctors gave him an MRI examination revealing he was suffering from a hernia; he had his examination filmed in order to use it for a video shoot, \\"as the 'Me' character [from The Human Equation] would also have needed a scan after his car accident\\". Lucassen has suffered from permanent anosmia since 2007. The same year, he sank into a depression which required medical help, due to the disease, his constant work over the last years, and his recent divorce with Verduijn resulting in him living on his own. On 3 September 2012, he revealed on his Facebook page that he has been suffering from an incurable tinnitus for the past two months.

Early life Born in Weston, Ontario, he was the son of pickle manufacturer Elwy Honderich Yost and Annie Josephine McMurran. In his youth, the senior Yost would give his son a dime a week to go see a movie on condition that he'd then recount the plot. Yost graduated from the Weston Collegiate and Vocational School in 1943. He began studies at the University of Toronto in 1943, and studied engineering but left in 1944, after failing his exams, and joined the Canadian Infantry in 1944. He was honorably discharged in September 1945. After graduating from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology in 1948, he worked variously in construction, at the Canadian National Exhibition, made an independent film with a classmate and acted in summerstock theatre.\\"Former Saturday Night at the Movies host Elwy Yost dies\\", Globe and Mail, July 22, 2011 In 1951, he was working in the circulation department of the Toronto Star where he met his future wife, Lila Melby. He also worked in the Avro Canada personnel department from 1953 until 1959 when he and most of the staff were laid off due to the cancellation of the Avro Arrow project. He then worked as an English and History teacher at Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute in Etobicoke, Ontario.\\"Elwy Yost, longtime TV host, dies at 86\\", CBC News, July 22, 2011 Career in television Through his acting connections, Yost learned that CBC was looking for quiz show panelists. Yost auditioned and, through the 1960s, appeared intermittently on the CBC as a panelist on shows such as Live a Borrowed Life, The Superior Sex and Flashback. In the late 1960s, he created and hosted CBC's Passport to Adventure, featuring classic movie serials, and also assisted in the founding of the Metropolitan Educational Television Authority (META). In the late 1960s, he hosted CBC Radio show It's Debatable.http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/its-debatable-students-and-drugs He joined the Ontario Educational Communications Authority (later TVOntario) in the early 1970s as a manager and, in 1974, was assisting with the establishment of its regional councils, when he was told OECA had acquired the broadcast rights to three Ingmar Bergman films and was asked if he had any ideas on how the station could air them in an educational context. Yost packaged the shows as Three Films in Search of God adding educational content in the form of interviews, introductions, and discussions, thus creating the model for what became Saturday Night at the Movies, which became the channel's longest-running, and one of its most popular, shows.\\"Elwy Yost, host of Saturday Night at the Movies, dies at 85\\", Toronto Star, July 22, 2011 Yost also developed Magic Shadows, which showed classic serials in half-hour early evening installments with introductions providing background and interesting details by Yost; the movie review show Rough Cuts; Talking Film and The Moviemakers. In 1979 he appeared in Ida Makes a Movie, the first of four television shorts that spawned The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1982. The format of Saturday Night at the Movies was that of two movies, separated by in-depth interviews conducted by Yost. In the early years the interviews were with local film experts, but the show's producers took the opportunity to interview visiting actors when they had engagements in Toronto. As the show grew in popularity, funds were found to send Yost and a crew to Hollywood to arrange interviews with film personalities. The library includes interviews with the stars of classic films, character actors, directors, screenwriters, composers, film-editors, special-effects people, and sometimes even their children. Some regular viewers started to plan their Saturday nights so that they could catch just the interview section if they had already seen that night's films. When Yost retired from TVOntario in 1999, a copy of the library of interviews was donated to the Motion Picture Academy. His son, Graham Yost, is a screenwriter whose most famous credit was the hit 1994 film Speed. Speed was the final movie Yost hosted before retiring from Saturday Night at the Movies in 1999. Yost wrote four books: Magic Moments from the Movies, Secret of the Lost Empire, Billy and the Bubbleship (also known as Mad Queen of Mordra) and White Shadows. Later life Elwy Yost wrote a mystery novel, White Shadows, which was published in 2003. Death Yost recovered from \\"a serious operation\\" he had in 2005, according to his wife, Lila. He died in West Vancouver, British Columbia on July 21, 2011, aged 86. Honours In 1999, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

The geostationary orbit is subject to orbit perturbations caused by anomalies in the gravitational field of the Earth, by the gravitational effects of Sun and Moon, and by solar radiation pressure. A precessional motion of the orbit plane is caused by the oblatedness of the Earth (J_2), and the gravitational effects of Sun and Moon. This motion has a period of about 53 years. The two parameters describing the direction of the orbit plane in space, the right ascension of the ascending node, and the inclination are affected by this precession. The maximum inclination reached during the 53-year cycle is about 15 degrees. Therefore, the definition of the geostationary ring foresees a declination range from -15 degrees to +15 degrees. On the other hand, solar radiation pressure induces an eccentricity that leads to a variation of the orbit radius by ¬± 75 kilometers in some cases. This leads to the definition of the geostationary ring as being a segment of space around the geostationary orbit that ranges from 75 km below GEO to 75 km above GEO and from -15 degrees to 15 degrees declination.

They were depicted as a shadowy Faustian organisation who acted as the main villains in a range of initially successful but short-lived comics launched in the US by Marvel UK in the 1990s. Some of these stories also were published in anthology form in the UK in the Marvel UK comic Overkill. They first appeared in Warheads #1 (June 1992) and were created by John Freeman, Nick Vince, Gary Erskine, and John Beeston. Fictional origins The board of Mys-Tech, a multinational corporation, were originally seven mages who in 987 sold their souls to the demon Mephisto in exchange for immortality. The Mys-Tech board members must provide a steady stream of souls to the demon otherwise they will breach their contract and their own souls will be forfeit. Over the years the board accumulated power and wealth and in the modern age this power and wealth became a business empire. Board members The seven mages who became the board of Mys-Tech were: *Algernon Crowe *Bronwen Gryffn *Ranulph Haldane *Eadmund Porlock *Brendan Rathcoole *Gudrun Tyburn *Ormond Wychwood Headquarters Mys-Tech operated as a respectable business but hidden beneath one of their front organisations, The Museum of Pagan Antiquities at Canary Wharf in London they had constructed a fantastic underground headquarters. These headquarters were used to house the arcane magical technologies the board used to increase their power and keep the supply of souls flowing to Mephisto. Chief amongst these was the Un-Earth, a macabre microcosm of the planet used in a similar fashion to a voodoo doll. The headquarters also housed extensive biotech labs. It was in one of these labs that the genetically engineered assassin named Julius Mullarkey, also known as Killpower, was created by Mys-Tech scientist Dr. Oonagh Mullarkey.\\"Motormouth\\" #1 (June 1992) The headquarters were also the base for the Warheads, Mys-Tech's mercenaries who travel through wormholes collecting sophisticated technology for their masters. Enemies Mys-Tech featured as villains in many of the titles launched by Marvel UK in their 1990s US expansion. The characters featured in these titles included Dark Angel (previously known as Hell's Angel), Death's Head, the partners Motormouth and Killpower, and the Knights of Pendragon. The Warheads Kether Troop also later went on to rebel against their masters. The scarred cyborg Badhand has confronted Mys-Tech forces multiple times. Notably, he has spied on the Warheads, allied himself with Nick Fury and assisted Cable with a theft from Mys-Tech's vaults. Mys-Tech also came up against other Marvel Universe characters such as the X-Men, although they never appeared outside of the Marvel UK imprint. Mys-Tech War and More In the mini-series Mys-Tech Wars (1993), by Dan Abnett and Bryan Hitch, their forces fought most of the Marvel Universe's assembled heroes. In the resulting demonic invasion, many of Earth's heroes (including a majority of the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and X-Men, Spider-Man, Ghost Rider, and Nick Fury) were slaughtered. However, due to the surviving heroes' efforts, the entire event was erased from history. As such, only a few, such as Doctor Strange, Professor X and Motormouth, actually remember what had happened.\\"Myst-Tech Wars\\" #1-4 (1993) In a latter attempt to destroy all super-heroes, the board transform themselves into younger versions.

Born in 1913 at Got Regea in Siaya, Nyanza Province, the late Benaiah Appolo Ohanga was the son of the late Ongewe Okelo and Alicia Obura. Education After passing his Common Entrance Examination in 1927 he joined Maseno School in 1928. At Maseno, the late Carey Francis recognized his unique ability and within two years, Mr Ohanga had taken his final exams for Secondary and teacher training education. He then proceeded to Alliance High School in 1931 for Senior Secondary education and qualified for entrance to University in 1933. However, he was prevailed upon by Carey Francis to join him in training teachers at Maseno Central School. He, therefore, returned to Maseno as a tutor and consequently taught some of his classmates. He was a keen musician and an accomplished organist. In 1943, he was elevated to the same rank as graduate teachers in recognition of his outstanding ability. Whilst at Maseno, he got married in 1943 to Truphosa Margaret Okinyo, a school teacher, and they had ten children, Veronica, Victor, Jerusha, Hudson, Mildred, Catherine, Patricia, Christopher, David and Eric. Political life From 1946 to 1947, he was Secretary to the Language Committee of all Nilotic languages. In 1947 he was nominated to the Kenya Legislative Council. He became the first African in Kenya to hold a Cabinet post when he rose to the position of Minister for Community Development and Rehabilitation in 1954, a post he held until 1957. He then joined the Civil Service as an Education Officer in the Ministry of Education, and later moved to the Ministry of Home Affairs where he was in charge of approved schools. During his tenure in the Civil Service, he was very active in the Trade Union Movement and served as President of the Civil Servants Union and first President of Central Organization of Trade Unions(COTU). Upon his retirement from the Civil Service in 1972, he became the Chief Executive of the Kenya Senior Civil Servants Association. In the course of his career he visited many foreign countries including India, Germany, United States of America and, severally, Great Britain. In his various capacities he traveled extensively all over Kenya and East Africa, and, until his death, he could still recall vividly by name the various personalities he met in those areas. He retired from the Senior Civil Servants Association in 1975 and dedicated his time to his family, farming, church and community matters. In 1986, he was awarded the Order of the Grand Warrior of Kenya by President Daniel Arap Moi. Ohanga died on January 23, 1992, at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi.

It was originally published in the July 1936 issue of Esquire Magazine. The poem was republished in the 1937 issue of Kansas Magazine and was revised and included in a small collection of Langston Hughes poems entitled A New Song, published by the International Workers Order in 1938.The Collected Works of Langston Hughes: Gospel plays, operas, and later, p. xv.Wagner, Jean, Black Poets of the United States: From Pauline Laurence Dunbar to Langston Hughes, p. 451. The poem speaks of the American dream that never existed for the lower-class American and the freedom and equality that every immigrant hoped for but never received. In his poem, Hughes represents not only African Americans, but other economically disadvantaged and minority groups as well. Besides criticizing the unfair life in America, the poem conveys a sense of hope that the American Dream is soon to come. Hughes wrote the poem while riding a train from New York to his mother's home in Ohio. He was in despair over recent reviews of his first Broadway play and his mother's diagnosis of breast cancer. Despite being a pillar of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, he was still struggling for acceptance as a poet, battling persistent racism, and just eking out a living. Selling a poem or a story every few months, he called himself a \\"literary sharecropper.\\" Fate, he said, \\"never intended for me to have a full pocket of anything but manuscripts.\\" Hughes finished the poem in a night but did not regard it as one of his best. It did not appear in his early anthologies and was only revived in the 1990s, first in a public reading by Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, later as a title for museum shows. The title of this poem was used by Democratic United States senator John Kerry as a campaign slogan in his 2004 presidential campaign.

Geography Release of floodwater in 2015 The lake covers 12,900 acres (52 km¬≤) and has a shoreline of over in the Cookson Hills of the Ozark Mountains of Cherokee and Sequoyah counties, about northeast of the town of Gore and from the intersection of I-40 and the Muskogee Turnpike. The distance from major cities include: northeast of Oklahoma City, west of Fort Smith, Arkansas, southeast of Tulsa and from Muskogee. One of the townships bordering this lake is Paradise Hill, at the far southwestern edge of the lake. It is known for its violent drop- offs, some going from a grown man's waist level to over his head. This is the cause of many deaths in the lake. =Electric power generation= The hydroelectric power station is remotely controlled from the control center at Fort Gibson Lake. Two generators, each rated for 17 megawatts, provide a total capacity of 34 megawatts (MWe). The facility can handle 40 MWe for a short period of time. However, the amount of power that can actually be generated depends heavily on the lake elevation at any given time. =Water supply= Originally, the amount of water delivered by the project was considered incidental, although the quality of water was much higher than that of the Arkansas River (the closest alternative source). Much of this water was expected to be used by the Kerr-McGee Nuclear Fuel Plant. That plant closed years ago. The cities of Muskogee and Sallisaw are now major consumers. Recreation Attractions near the lake include scuba diving, camping, hiking, fishing, golfing, water sports, scenic nature, fishing, and hunting. In addition there are of trout fishing along the Illinois River. There are also ten marinas, fourteen parks, 24 boat launching ramps, five floating restaurants, and many islands including Goat Island which is famous for the goats that inhabit it.Lake Tenkiller area visitors guide.

Early life Born in Bloomington, Indiana, Darnielle grew up in San Luis Obispo and then Claremont, California with an abusive stepfather (as referenced frequently in The Sunset Tree). Darnielle often attended professional wrestling matches with his stepfather at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. There, he developed a passion for the sport and local wrestlers like Chavo Guerrero Sr.. His childhood love of wrestling would go on to inspire the Mountain Goats' album Beat the Champ. Darnielle attended Claremont High School, located in the Pomona Valley region of Southern California. For a short time after high school, he lived in Portland, Oregon, where he developed an addiction to intravenous methamphetamine and other hard drugs (as referenced in We Shall All Be Healed).

Throughout his college education, he continued to record music. In 1992, Dennis Callaci, a friend of Darnielle's and owner of Shrimper Records, released a tape of Darnielle's songs called Taboo VI: The Homecoming. Around that time, the Mountain Goats were born and began touring with just Darnielle on guitar and a bassist, first Rachel Ware and then Peter Hughes. Musical career Darnielle is best known for his role in the band the Mountain Goats. Since starting the band in 1991, he has gained a cult following. Despite being dubbed a low fidelity artist, Darnielle has always dubbed his work \\"bi-fi\\", pointing out that recordings such as his couldn't be made without modern technology. He is known for his prolific output and literary lyrics. Sasha Frere-Jones, writing in The New Yorker, referred to him as \\"America‚Äôs best non-hip-hop lyricist\\".

He was one of the original members of the Homebrew Computer Club and the designer of the Osborne 1, the first mass-produced portable computer. Before the Osborne, Felsenstein designed the Intel 8080 based \\"SOL\\" computer from Processor Technology, the PennyWhistle modem, and other early \\"S-100 bus\\" era designs. His shared-memory alphanumeric video display design, the Processor Technology VDM-1 video display module board, was widely copied and became the basis for the standard display architecture of personal computers. Many of his designs were leaders in reducing costs of computer technologies for the purpose of making them available to large markets. His work featured a concern for the social impact of technology and was influenced by the philosophy of Ivan Illich. Felsenstein was the engineer for the Community Memory project, one of the earliest attempts to place networked computer terminals in public places to facilitate social interactions among individuals, in the era before the commercial Internet. In 2016, Lee was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum.http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/current/ Life Processor Technology SOL-20 Computer designed by Lee Felsenstein Felsenstein graduated from Central High School in Philadelphia as a member of class 219. https://centralhighalumni.com/2018/06/2018-hall-of-fame-finale-promises-to-be- grand/ As a young man, Felsenstein was a New Left radical. From October through December 1964, he was a participant in the Free Speech Movement and was one of 768 arrested in the climactic \\"Sproul Hall Sit-In\\" of December 2‚Äì3, 1964. He also wrote for the Berkeley Barb, one of the leading underground newspapers. He had entered University of California, Berkeley first in 1963, joined the Co-operative Work-Study Program in Engineering in 1964 and dropped out at the end of 1967, working as a Junior Engineer at the Ampex Corporation from 1968 through 1971, when he re-enrolled at Berkeley. He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1972. From 1981‚Äì1983, Felsenstein was employed at the Osborne Computer Corporation. At Osborne, he was the designer of the Osborne 1, the first mass-produced portable computer. He then returned to freelance consulting. In 1992, he joined Interval Research Corporation, where he worked until 2000 before joining Pemstar Pacific Consultants, where he worked until 2005. Throughout, he acted as an occasional free-lance consulting designer or worked at his own design firm. Many of his designs were leaders in reducing the costs of computer technologies for the purpose of making them available to large markets. His work featured a concern for the social impact of technology. The Community Memory project, begun as a project of Resource One, Inc. in 1972 and later incorporated in 1977 by Felsenstein with Efrem Lipkin, Ken Colstad, Jude Milhon, and Mark Szpakowski, was one of the earliest attempts to place networked computer terminals in such places as Berkeley supermarkets to attract casual use by persons from all walks of life passing through and facilitate social interactions among non-technical individuals, in the era before the Internet. Felsenstein was influenced in his philosophy by the works of Ivan Illich, particularly Tools for Conviviality (Harper and Row, 1973). This book advocated a \\"convivial\\" approach to design which allowed users of technologies to learn about the technology by encouraging exploration, tinkering, and modification. Felsenstein had learned about electronics in much the same fashion, and summarized his conclusions in several aphorisms, to wit ‚Äì \\"In order to survive in a public-access environment, a computer must grow a computer club around itself.\\" Others were ‚Äì \\"To change the rules, change the tools,\\" and \\"If work is to become play, then tools must become toys.\\" Felsenstein at the Vintage Computer Festival Felsenstein was one of the original members of the Homebrew Computer Club, which formed in 1975 in response to the appearance of the Altair 8800 computer kit. With a handy yardstick, Felsenstein \\"moderated\\" meetings at the SLAC Auditorium. He was less a chair than a keeper of chaos. In this heyday of the development of the first personal computers, Felsenstein designed the Intel 8080 based \\"SOL\\" computer from Processor Technology, the Pennywhistle modem, and other early \\"S-100 bus\\" era designs. These existed in a market space with early generation hobbyist microcomputers from Altair, IMSAI, Morrow Designs, Cromemco, and other vendors. Felsenstein's shared-memory alphanumeric video display design, the Processor Technology VDM-1 video display module board, was widely copied and became the basis for the standard display architecture of personal computers. Felsenstein was named a \\"Pioneer of the Electronic Frontier\\" in 1994 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and in 2007, he was given the Editor's Choice Award for Creative Excellence by EE Times magazine. In 1998, Felsenstein founded the Free Speech Movement Archives as an online repository of historical information relating to that event, its antecedents and successors. In 2003, while working with the Jhai Foundation of San Francisco, he designed an open-source telecommunications and computer system for installation in remote villages in the developing world. This system was dubbed \\"the Pedal-Powered Internet\\" by The New York Times Magazine due to its reliance on pedal power generation. Installation of the first system in Laos was unsuccessful, but the design has been tested on an Indian reservation in the US and continues in development in India. In 2003, Felsenstein was named a Laureate of The Tech Museum of Innovation (San Jose, California) for this work. Felsenstein is the Founding Sensei of the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, California, and was featured on a Fox News segment in late 2009 covering the non-profit facility..

The designation of X-16 was a cover to try to hide the true nature of the aircraft mission from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.Jenkins et al. 2003, p. 23. Development During the second half of 1953, Fairchild, Bell, and Martin Aircraft conducted high altitude reconnaissance aircraft design studies for the United States Air Force under project MX-2147.Polmar 2001, p. 26. All three designs used Pratt & Whitney J57-19 turbojets. The Bell and Martin (B-57D) designs were chosen for further development. The Bell Model 67 design was designated the X-16. A full- scale mock-up was completed and one aircraft was partially completed. It was designed as a high altitude long-range reconnaissance aircraft.Miller, Jay (2001). The X-Planes: X-1 to X-45 (third ed.). Motorbooks International. . The X-16 design was breaking new ground with its design. Its wing was long with a high (11.9) aspect ratio. The structure was significantly lighter and more flexible than usual for jet aircraft wings. The entire aircraft was made as light as possible to achieve its intended 3,000-mile unrefueled range at . A total of 28 aircraft were ordered, but none were completed. The first X-16 was about 80 percent complete when the program was cancelled by the Air Force in favor of the Martin RB-57 in 1956. Although no X-16 was ever completed, it made contributions to aircraft design with its lightweight design.

It typically occurs to signal attention for non-recoverable hardware errors. (Some NMIs may be masked, but only by using proprietary methods specific to the particular NMI.) An NMI is often used when response time is critical or when an interrupt should never be disabled during normal system operation. Such uses include reporting non-recoverable hardware errors, system debugging and profiling, and handling of special cases like system resets. Modern computer architectures typically use NMIs to handle non-recoverable errors which need immediate attention. Therefore, such interrupts should not be masked in the normal operation of the system. These errors include non- recoverable internal system chipset errors, corruption in system memory such as parity and ECC errors, and data corruption detected on system and peripheral buses. On some systems, a computer user can trigger an NMI through hardware and software debugging interfaces and system reset buttons. Programmers typically use debugging NMIs to diagnose and fix faulty code. In such cases an NMI can execute an interrupt handler that transfers control to a special monitor program. From this program a developer can inspect the machine's memory and examine the internal state of the program at the instant of its interruption. This also allows the debugging or diagnosing of computers which appear hung.  History  In older architectures, NMIs were used for interrupts which were typically never disabled because of the required response time. They were hidden signals. Examples include the floppy disk controller on the Amstrad PCW, the 8087 coprocessor on the x86 when used in the IBM PC or its compatibles (even though Intel recommended connecting it to a normal interrupt), and the Low Battery signal on the HP 95LX. In the original IBM PC, an NMI was triggered if a parity error was detected in system memory, or reported by an external device. In either case, the PC would display an error message and halt. Some later PC clones used an NMI to conceal the hardware differences from that of a standard PC. On such computers, an NMI would be generated when a program attempted to access incompatible hardware. A BIOS interrupt handler would then translate the program's request to match the hardware that was actually present. The SMM in the 386SL is a better way to do this. Some 8-bit home computers used the NMI line to permit a \\"warm start\\" if the system had locked up. Typically, this would restore the control registers to known good values stored in ROM, without destroying whatever data that the user might currently have loaded. On the Commodore 8-bit machines, the key was hooked up directly or indirectly to the NMI line on the 6502-series CPU, but the reset would take place only if the NMI handler routine in ROM detected that was also being held down when was struck (this combination being the Commodore version of a three finger salute). Commodore also connected the MOS Technology 6526 CIA #2 in the C64 and C128 to the processor's NMI line, which was part of the means by which software emulation of the 6551 ACIA was accomplished. Atari's 8-bit line used a button for this same purpose. Debugging NMIs have appeared in a number of forms, including the Apple Macintosh's \\"programmers' button\\", and certain key combinations on Sun workstations. With the introduction of Windows 2000, Microsoft allowed the use of an NMI to cause a system to either break into a debugger, or dump the contents of memory to disk and reboot. Debugging NMIs have also been used by devices that allow leisure users and gamers to manipulate running programs. Devices which added a button to generate an NMI, such as Romantic Robot's Multiface, were a popular accessory for 1980s 8-bit and 16-bit home computers. These peripherals had a small amount of ROM and an NMI button. Pressing the button transferred control to the software in the peripheral's ROM, allowing the suspended program to be saved to disk (very useful for tape-based games with no disk support, but also for saving games in progress), screenshots to be saved or printed, or values in memory to be manipulated‚Äîa cheating technique to acquire extra lives, for example. Not all computers provide a mechanism for triggering NMIs; however, many machines (typically rackmount servers) provide a physical button specifically for this purpose. Other machines may expose this functionality via an expansion card. Miles Gordon Technology's DISCiPLE and +D products for the ZX Spectrum featured an NMI- producing \\"magic button\\". On the Nintendo Entertainment System, an NMI is generated during each vertical blanking interval. Because these NMIs (often referred to as \\"vblank interrupts\\") occur at frequent, regular intervals, code that manipulates game graphics and audio is often executed inside of the NMI handler routine. Clearing the 7th bit of the PPU's register disables vblank interrupts, and setting it enables them.

As an employee at Epstein's company NEMS, Taylor accompanied him when he first saw the Beatles perform, at the Cavern Club in Liverpool on 9 November 1961. Taylor subsequently worked as the group's so-called \\"Mr. Fixit\\", devising escape routes from crazed fans and assisting the band members in purchasing property. He later became general manager of Apple Corps but was fired soon after Allen Klein arrived to address the company's financial problems. Taylor published various memoirs of his years in the Beatles' employ, including Yesterday: The Beatles Remembered and With the Beatles. Biography =Early life= Born on Curzon Street, Runcorn, Cheshire, Taylor served his time in the Royal Air Force before working in a series of jobs as a mover, timber importer, and docker in the Liverpool Docks. He was then successfully interviewed by Brian Epstein for a job as a salesman at North End Music Stores (NEMS) in 1960. Epstein liked Taylor so much that he decided to offer him a job as his personal assistant in the shop. =Alleged role in Epstein's discovery of the Beatles= Epstein stated in his 1964 autobiography, A Cellarful of Noise, that he first heard about the Beatles through a customer named Raymond Jones enquiring about \\"My Bonnie\\", a single by Tony Sheridan with backing by the group. Taylor later claimed to have invented the name of Raymond Jones and placed an order for \\"My Bonnie\\" at the main NEMS shop. As he wrote in The Beatles Book (1997), Taylor thought NEMS was losing sales by not stocking the disc: > The truth is that we were being asked for My Bonnie but no one actually > ordered it. Brian would order any record once we had a firm order for it. I > thought that we were losing sales and I wrote an order in the book under the > name Raymond Jones and, from that moment the legend grew. Taylor's claim that Jones was his pseudonym has since been undermined by author Spencer Leigh, who located an actual person named Raymond Jones when writing an article for Mojo magazine.Paul Trynka (ed.), The Beatles: Ten Years That Shook the World (Mojo Magazine Collection), Dorling Kindersley, London, 2006; . In his book The Best of Fellas, Leigh expanded on the story, writing that NEMS and Epstein had communicated with Jones to acknowledge their debt once the Beatles became famous.Spencer Leigh, The Best of Fellas: The Story of Bob Wooler, Liverpool‚Äôs First DJ, Drivegreen Publications, 2002. . Beatles biographer Mark Lewisohn has since offered his opinion that the information given by Jones to Leigh is \\"verifiably accurate\\". =The Cavern= Taylor accompanied Epstein to the Cavern Club when the latter first saw the Beatles play, at a lunchtime performance on 9 November 1961.. Recalling the moment in a later interview, Taylor described them as \\"these four horrible young men on stage, dressed in black leather trousers, black jackets, smoking, drinking and making noise ‚Ä¶\\"; he also found them \\"charismatic and exciting\\" and \\"sensational\\".Interview by Juan Ag√ºeras, in The Beatles Garden, fanzine of the Spanish Sergeant Beatles Fan Club, no. 18, 1997. As Epstein's personal assistant, Taylor witnessed crucial moments in the Beatles' career and was present at the signing of the first contract with Epstein (which Taylor signed as \\"In the presence of:\\"). In 1962, Taylor worked for Pye Records for 15 months, and moved to London (before the Beatles) due to his wife's asthma. =\\"Mr. Fixit\\"= In 1963 Taylor returned to NEMS to work as general manager, receiving a salary of ¬£1,550 per annum. He later said that as the Beatles began to achieve widespread popularity that year, the consensus among the group and their management was: \\"If we can last three years, it would be marvellous.\\". The Beatles named him \\"Mr. Fixit\\" for his ability to find solutions to their needs. His duties varied from simple tasks ‚Äì such as buying the band members their cigarettes and hiring limousines ‚Äì to devising their methods of escape from fans after live performances and organising their holiday trips. He was responsible for resolving the copyright issues surrounding the group's use of celebrity photographs on Peter Blake's cover for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Taylor also assisted the Beatles with property matters. He acted as consultant to John Lennon on the purchase of Dorinish Island (Ireland) for ¬£1,550, and served as the middle-man when Paul McCartney bought High Park, his Scottish farm, in 1966. In July the following year, Taylor arranged the money exchange for the band's attempted purchase of the Greek island of Leslo,. where, despite Greece's recent military coup, they planned to live communally with their families, close friends and assistants. In author Peter Doggett's description: \\"Alistair Taylor was sent to the Mediterranean like a colonial governor seeking a winter retreat for a monarch.\\". When George Harrison and Pattie Boyd were house- hunting in 1969, the couple sought anonymity by having Taylor act as Boyd's respectable husband while Harrison adopted the role of chauffeur. On one inspection, author Alan Clayson writes, their unconvincing role play led to the owner \\"turn[ing] to Pattie to ask whether Mr Harrison wanted to see the house as well\\".. =Inside Apple= Taylor in the \\"one-man band\\" advertisement According to Taylor, following Epstein's death from a drug overdose in August 1967, NEMS was plagued by \\"dreadful in-fighting\\", as \\"everybody ‚Äì Vic Lewis, Robert Stigwood ‚Äì struggled to take control of The Beatles\\". In December 1967, Taylor and his fellow NEMS employees Peter Brown and Terry Doran left the company to work directly for the Beatles.. At Lennon's invitation, he became general manager of the band's business empire, Apple Corps. In April 1968, Taylor appeared in a print advertisement to promote Apple and attract new artists to its nascent record label and publishing company. Designed by McCartney, the picture showed Taylor disguised as a one-man band.. The heading read, \\"This man has talent ‚Ä¶\\";O'Dell, Chris; with Ketcham, Katherine (2009), Miss O'Dell: My Hard Days and Long Nights with The Beatles, The Stones, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and the Women They Loved, New York, NY: Touchstone, p. 22, . text below it claimed: \\"This man now owns a Bentley!\\" The disguise was rented in Soho, and Taylor was singing \\"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling\\" when the shot was taken. The ad resulted in an avalanche of tapes and other submissions after its publication in the New Musical Express and Rolling Stone. In her 2009 autobiography, Apple employee Chris O'Dell writes of Taylor's role in the company: \\"Alistair was here, there and everywhere at Apple, arranging this and that and always involved, it seemed, in fixing one problem or another.\\"O'Dell, Chris; with Ketcham, Katherine (2009), Miss O'Dell: My Hard Days and Long Nights with The Beatles, The Stones, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and the Women They Loved, New York, NY: Touchstone, p. 54, . Taylor later said of the excesses that brought about Apple's immediate financial difficulties: \\"[The Beatles] were handing money out to people like it was going out of fashion. People were being given cars and houses ‚Ä¶ it just got out of control.\\". An early success for Apple Records was the Welsh folk singer Mary Hopkin, whom Taylor tracked down (at McCartney's suggestion) after she had appeared on the amateur talent show Opportunity Knocks.. In Taylor's later recollection, he called the four Beatles together in August 1968 and \\"told them to bring in a really good businessman\\" to address Apple's problems. That November, with the release of the band's double album The Beatles, his spoken voice appeared on Lennon's experimental track \\"Revolution 9\\". In what author Ian MacDonald describes as \\"a whimsical control-room exchange\\",. Taylor can be heard apologising to George Martin, the Beatles' producer, asking forgiveness for not bringing him a bottle of claret.Mark Lewisohn, The Complete Beatles Chronicle, Chancellor Press, 1992, . The previous year, Taylor and McCartney's random experimentation with musical notes and word association had led to McCartney writing the song \\"Hello, Goodbye\\".. According to Taylor, however, his friendship with McCartney suffered when the latter began a relationship with Linda Eastman. Taylor considered Eastman a \\"hard-faced star-chaser from the United States\\", eager to separate McCartney from any friends who had been close to his former fianc√©e, Jane Asher.. The businessman hired to resolve the issues at Apple was New York accountant Allen Klein. Soon after Klein officially became manager of Apple Corps, in May 1969, Taylor was sacked from the company. O'Dell writes that although the \\"warning signs\\" were there, suggesting an unwelcome change at Apple, she was \\"shocked\\" at Klein's firing of Taylor, the Beatles' \\"beloved employee and friend\\".O'Dell, Chris; with Ketcham, Katherine (2009), Miss O'Dell: My Hard Days and Long Nights with The Beatles, The Stones, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and the Women They Loved, New York, NY: Touchstone, p. 91, . In his memoir With the Beatles, Taylor says of Klein: \\"He had all the charm of a broken lavatory seat.\\". More troubling to Taylor than his dismissal, the Beatles refused to accept his phone calls.. Taylor said: \\"The next time I spoke to Paul was 20 years later.\\". =After the Beatles= Taylor was recruited by Dick James after leaving Apple to work with Elton John, then an emerging artist. Taylor promoted the singer's first two albums. He moved into record producing for a short time but, along with his wife, Lesley, whom he had married in 1959, he felt it was time for a change. In 1973 the couple moved to Darley Dale in Derbyshire and bought a 200-year- old cottage. It was their home for the next 30-plus years. The couple ran a tea-room in nearby Lea, and Taylor later worked in a factory and in a hotel before his retirement. He enjoyed participating in Beatles fan conventions around the world and he regularly appeared on radio both in the UK and the US. In the mid-1990s, Taylor created Mellor Beach Leisure Ltd. Taylor served as the \\"business development director\\", promoting a new musical act called Smoke. The company folded after the band broke up. In 1998, he appeared in a documentary that was part of the British TV series Arena, in the episode \\"The Brian Epstein Story: The Sun Will Shine Tomorrow: Part 1\\". Also appeared in the 2003 documentary Inside John Lennon. Tapes from a 1996 interview were used in a BBC documentary I Was There When the Beatles Played the Cavern in 2011. Taylor died in his sleep on 9 June 2004 in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, after a short bronchial illness. His wife, Lesley, died of cancer in October 2004.

A second series was aired between November and December 2005 and a three-part Christmas special, The Worst Christmas of My Life was shown during December 2006. It was written by Mark Bussell and Justin Sbresni. Plotline =Series one= Essentially a comedy of errors, The Worst Week of My Life follows the premise \\"Anything that can go wrong, does\\". The story covers the week preceding the marriage of publishing executive Howard Steel and his fianc√©e Mel, the daughter of a high-court judge, Dick Cook. Humiliating situations ensue: Cassie, a colleague with whom Howard had a drunken one-night stand two years earlier, sets out to snare him and becomes obsessive; Howard accidentally kills his in-laws' dog, puts Mel's granny in hospital and loses the wedding ring (a family heirloom). At the end of the first series, Howard and Mel were wed, despite the many mishaps that had befallen the well-meaning but accident-prone groom. =Series two= The second series takes place in the week leading up to the birth of Howard and Mel's first baby, and Howard has not yet shaken off the fate inexorably attached to him. With his father blowing up granny's cottage, into which the married couple was preparing to move, they are forced to stay with his wife's parents once again. During the course of the week he is accused of sexual harassment at work, and mistakenly arrested for 'dogging'. He also manages to toast his father-in-law's CBE on a barbecue. Despite Howard knocking out the midwife, the series ends with the birth of a baby girl, Emily. =The Worst Christmas of My Life= A three-part Christmas special entitled The Worst Christmas of My Life was shown on BBC One in December 2006. Episode One : Set: 23 December: (aired 19 December 2006) After his office Christmas party, Howard takes his intoxicated boss Nicola in a cab to her home, after realising she's not fit to drive. During the cab ride, she vomits on him and, after taking a shower at her place, he is forced outside naked by Nicola, after she mistakes his nakedness for preparation to rape her. Howard turns up naked on his in-laws' doorstep, and proceeds to urinate on the Christmas goose after the power goes out, leading to a series of events which culminate in his falsely claiming to his wife and mother-in-law that his father-in-law is dead. Later, he crashes into his father-in-law, drags his unconscious body inside, causes his mother-in-law to faint, makes his wife suspicious about his naked escapade the previous night when Nicola apologises and returns his clothes, and finally destroys his wife's childhood dollhouse, which was to be a gift to their newborn daughter, while attempting to fix the damaged fuse that led to him urinating on the goose initially. Episode Two : Set: 24 December: (aired 21 December 2006) With Dick continuing to receive wreaths and read obituaries following his \\"death\\", his contempt for Howard deepens further when he discovers Howard bought a new car with the money he was expecting to receive from the will. A freak accident involving a strimmer leads to family friend Felicity's pedigree dog, who is regularly put out to stud, losing a testicle, with Howard once more taking the blame. He then takes baby Emily Christmas shopping in the local shopping centre, where he gets in a fight with a drunken Father Christmas and accidentally ends up pushing around the wrong pushchair. He eventually manages to swap the prams back and return the baby to its black parents and reclaim Emily, but Howard's despair isn't over yet as he spills mulled wine over the local Vicar when he visits the house. Howard's visit to church on Christmas Eve sees him get in argument with Fraser over his refusal to publish his memoirs and another fight - this time with Eve's new love, Mitch, who Howard saw kissing another woman at the office Christmas party. Episode Three : Set: 25 December: (aired 22 December 2006) Howard receives a visit from police on Christmas morning following his fight with Mitch, while Eve is attempting suicide in the house and Fraser is accusing him of stealing his bagpipes. Meanwhile, Howard offers to help Dick repair the dollhouse but quickly the pair are glued together as their visitors, the Bledlow family (including Mel's ex-boyfriend, Ed), call in for Christmas lunch. With Howard fretting about a missing condom of his that the family dog took from his room earlier, he spots it and leaves the meal to try and reclaim it. But he ends up setting fire to the front room, damaging the presents that were to be opened after lunch. Main characters Geoffrey Whitehead as Dick Cook on the receiving end of one of Howard's many mishaps. *Ben Miller as Howard Steel, the hapless male lead. A book publisher by trade, Howard continually puts himself in dreadful situations and makes things worse by trying to either put things right or explain what had happened. *Sarah Alexander as Mel Cook, Howard's fianc√©e and then wife, who remains in love with him despite his mishaps. However, Mel (who works as a vet) gradually loses patience with him as the story arc in each series progresses. *Alison Steadman as Angela Cook, Mel's mother. Her main role in life appears to be to entertain guests at her country home, regularly worrying about the impression that will be set following Howard-led problems. Regardless of Howards's faults, Angela often tries to see the good in him and is friendlier to Howard than Dick. Whereas Dick doesn't understand why Mel loves Howard, Angela can see that the pair love each other and in the series one finale, Angela defends Howard after Dick refuses to give him the car keys to rescue Mel. *Geoffrey Whitehead as Dick Cook, a High Court judge and Mel's father. He has little time for Howard and struggles to understand why Mel wanted to marry him. *Janine Duvitski as Eve, Howard's assistant. She devotes much of her life to her work and has little social life outside helping Howard. *Ronald Pickup as Fraser Cook, Dick's brother. Obsessed by his days in the army, Fraser will regularly offer rather pointless advice about life. He is initially a closet homosexual but finally comes out in Series 2 while in a relationship with his \\"travelling companion\\" Gerard (Terrence Hardiman). =Minor characters= *Raquel Cassidy as Cassie Turner, Howard's stalking co- worker who he had a one-night stand with (series 1). She is unable to accept he wants to marry Mel and goes to any length possible to try and marry him instead. *Emma Pierson as Sophie Cook, Mel's troublesome younger sister (series 1). She asks Howard for relationship advice and then strongly criticises him when things do not work out. She is not in series 2 with no explanation as to her absence, however in The Worst Christmas Of My Life (third series) it is revealed that she has moved to New Zealand when Howard talks to her over the phone. *Dean Lennox Kelly as Dom, Howard and Eve's misogynistic co-worker and Howard's eventual best man. He develops a relationship with Mel's younger sister, Sophie in series one. At the end of series one Sophie announces to her parents that she and Dom are going to marry, to her parents' dismay. He does not appear in series two and similarly to Sophie, there is no explanation to his absence, but he is mentioned when Eve gives Howard his office desk items that he left. *John Benfield as Ron Steel, Howard's laddish father. He has a lap dancer girlfriend, Trish, played by Lizzie Roper (series 1). *Kim Wall as Mitch, Eve's new boyfriend (series 3). Eve quickly announces her plans to marry him but Howard feels compelled to tell her he saw him kissing another woman at the office Christmas party. Howard and Mitch end up fighting with nativity figures at Midnight Mass. *Paul Brooke as the Vicar, who finds Howard hard work when preparing to carry out his wedding (series 1). After Emily is born, Angela and Dick are keen for her christening to be held at Winchester Cathedral and believe setting a good impression to the Vicar (a personal friend to the Bishop) when he calls on Christmas Eve (series 3) will seal their wishes. But Howard spills mulled wine over the Vicar, who has to be undressed to receive treatment. *Terrence Hardiman as Gerard, Fraser's lover (series 2). Howard first meets him in the bath with Fraser. He leaves mid-way through the week in an effort to make Frazer tell the family about his homosexuality. He later returns for the last episode. *Lizzie Roper as Trish, Ron Steel's lap dancer girlfriend (series 1). In series 2 it is revealed that she left Ron for his carpet fitter.

It is located in Langenberg, Velbert, Germany and has had a very turbulent history since its inauguration. The transmitter first went into service in 1927 with 60 kilowatts (kW) of power and a T-aerial hanging on two 100-metre freestanding steel-frame towers insulated against ground. Attempted manipulation In the early 1930s, communist underground groups tried to manipulate the line from the studio to the transmitter in order to broadcast their own propaganda. Their attempts failed, but they did manage to attach a red star to the top of one of the towers, which was removed on the same day. Modifications =Pre-1945= In 1934 the T-aerial was replaced by an aerial hanging from a 160-metre wood framework tower and the transmission power was increased to 100 kW. However, this tower was destroyed on October 10, 1935 by a tornado. After this a triangular aerial hung on three 45-metre freestanding towers was built; this went into service in December 1935. In 1940/41 a second aerial was installed on a 240-metre insulated guyed steel tube mast. The entire aerial system was destroyed by SS-Postschutz troops on April 12, 1945. =Post-1945= After World War II, British forces built two triangular aerials mounted on 6 masts, each 50 metres high. One of these aerials was removed in 1948 and a insulated radio mast built on its site. The other aerial was destroyed in a storm in 1949 which broke two of the three masts. The third mast was transformed into an AM transmitter and was in service until 1957. In 1949 a second radio mast with a height of 120 metres was built, and in 1952 a third guyed mast followed with a height of 210 metres for FM and TV. The 120-metre mast was used as an AM transmitter and was insulated against ground, while the 210-metre mast, used eventually for TV and FM broadcasts, was grounded. =The 1960s= In the middle of the 1960s the transmission power of the AM transmitter was enormously increased and its frequency was changed to the almost clear frequency of 1586 kHz which allowed night-time reception, even in the USA. This 120-metre radio mast was reduced to 95 metres and it was equipped with two separation insulators. =The 1970s= In course of the workout of the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975, the facility lost the exclusive frequency of 1586 kHz and the transmitter was retuned to 1593 kHz. Because this frequency is used by other broadcasters, interference problems occurred at night-time in spite of the 800 kW transmitting power. As compensation, station owner WDR was allotted a second medium wave frequency of 720 kHz for daytime transmission only. =The 1980s= Between 1988 and 1990, the 95-metre mediumwave mast and the 210-metre TV- and FM-mast were replaced by a guyed steel-framework grounded radio mast with a cage aerial for mediumwave in its lower sections. =The 1990s= In 1993, the 1593 kHz mediumwave transmitter was shut down because some components had been manufactured with PCBs. 720 kHz remained in service, but it was not allowed to use this frequency for night transmission until new regulations were enacted in 1995. At these point there were two radio masts in Langenberg: the 160-metre radio mast for medium wave and the 301-metre radio mast for MW, FM and TV. The shorter mast had to be renovated in 1996; unfortunately, one auxiliary rope tore during this work and the mast collapsed on September 2, 1996. In 1995 the transmission power had to be reduced for ecological reasons. Until the early 1990s the whole radiated power in the AM range was 1000 kW (800 kW on 1593 kHz and 200 kW on 720 kHz), but after 1995 the transmitter was restricted to 85 kW. After the collapse of the 160 metre mast, radiation power of the AM transmitter was reduced to 20 kW. Soon after the collapse of the 160 metre mast, WDR planned a new mast in the form of a guyed grounded steel framework with a height of 170 metres and a cage aerial. The medium wave frequency of 1593 kHz was given to Radio Free Europe. The 720 kHz transmitter was fitted with a directional antenna that minimized propagation of signals westward. Construction of the new mast started in the middle of 1999, but problems delayed its inauguration until July 2000. After the inauguration of the new 170-metre radio mast, transmitter power on medium wave could be once again increased to 85 kW.

The bloodstream normally does not contain microbes, and is thus considered sterile. The presence of microbes in the blood can indicate a bloodstream infection, such as bacteremia or fungemia, which in severe cases may result in sepsis. By culturing the blood, microbes can be identified and tested for resistance to antimicrobial drugs, which allows clinicians to provide an effective treatment. Obtaining blood for culture involves drawing the blood into bottles that contain a liquid formula that enhances microbial growth. Usually, two containers are collected during one blood draw, one of which is designed to grow organisms that require oxygen, and one of which is for organisms that do not. The containers are then placed in an incubator for several days to allow the organisms to multiply. If microbial growth is detected, a Gram stain is conducted from the culture bottle to confirm that organisms are present and provide preliminary information about their identity. A Gram stain in which organisms are observed is considered a critical result and must immediately be reported to the clinician. The blood is then subcultured, meaning it is inoculated onto an agar plate to isolate microorganisms for full identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Because it is essential that bloodstream infections are diagnosed and treated quickly, rapid identification and susceptibility testing methods have been developed which bypass the subculturing step. To ensure that results are accurate, blood to be used for culture must be obtained using sterile technique. If the sample is contaminated with skin flora, the person will falsely appear to have those organisms in their blood. To reduce the chance of a false positive, two sets of blood culture bottles are usually drawn from two different blood draw sites. If an organism only appears in one of the two draws, it is more likely to represent contamination than an actual bloodstream infection. False negatives can occur if the sample is collected after the person has received antimicrobial drugs or if the bottles are not filled with the recommended amount of blood. Medical uses Blood is normally considered to be sterile.Carroll, KC et al. (2015). p. 755. The presence of bacteria in the blood is termed bacteremia, and the presence of fungi is called fungemia.Turgeon, ML (2016). p. 510. Minor damage to the skin or mucous membranes, which can occur in situations like toothbrushing, defecation, injections or venipuncture,Procop, GW & Koneman, EW (2017). p. 188.Pitt, SJ (2018). p. 26. can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, but this bacteremia is normally transient and is rarely detected in cultures because the immune system and reticuloendothelial system quickly sequester and destroy the organisms.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 866.Carroll, KC et al. (2015) pp. 755‚Äì6. Bacteria can also enter the blood from infections in other sites, such as cellulitis, urinary tract infections and pneumonia;Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 867. and infections within the vascular system, such as bacterial endocarditis or infections associated with intravenous lines, may result in a constant bacteremia. Fungemia occurs most commonly in people who are immunosuppressed. If bacteria or fungi are not cleared from the bloodstream, they can spread from the blood to other organs and tissues, or evoke an immune response that leads to a systemic inflammatory condition called sepsis, which can be life-threatening.Bennett, JE et al. (2019). p. 990. When sepsis is suspected, it is necessary to draw blood cultures to identify the causative agent and provide targeted antibiotic therapy. People who are hospitalized and have a fever, a low body temperature, a high white blood cell count or a low count of granulocytes (a category of white blood cells) commonly have cultures drawn to detect a possible bloodstream infection. Blood cultures are particularly critical in febrile neutropenia, a common complication of chemotherapy in which fever occurs alongside a severely low count of neutrophils (white blood cells that defend against bacterial and fungal pathogens); infections can quickly prove fatal in this setting.Walls, R et al. (2017). p. 1497. Bacteremia is common in some types of infections, such as meningitis, septic arthritis and epidural abscesses, so blood cultures are frequently drawn in people with these conditions. In infections less strongly associated with bacteremia, blood culture may still be indicated if the individual is at high risk of acquiring an intravascular infection or if cultures cannot be promptly obtained from the main site of infection (for example, a urine culture in pyelonephritis or a sputum culture in severe community-acquired pneumonia). Blood culture can identify an underlying microbial cause in cases of endocarditis and fever of unknown origin. Procedure Aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric blood culture bottles =Collection= Blood cultures are typically drawn through venipuncture. Collecting the sample from an intravenous line is generally not recommended, as it is associated with higher contamination rates, although cultures may be collected from both venipuncture and an intravenous line to diagnose catheter- associated infections. Prior to the blood draw, the top of each collection bottle is disinfected using an alcohol swab to prevent contamination. The skin around the puncture site is then cleaned and left to dry; some protocols recommend disinfection with an alcohol-based antiseptic followed by either chlorhexidine or an iodine-based preparation, while others consider using only an alcohol-containing antiseptic to be sufficient. If blood must be drawn for other tests at the same time as a blood culture, the blood culture bottles are drawn first to minimize the risk of contamination.Pagana, KD et al. (2014). p. xiii. Because antimicrobial therapy can hamper the detection of microbes, it is recommended that blood cultures are drawn before antimicrobial drugs are given, although this may be impractical in people who are critically ill. A typical blood culture collection involves drawing blood into two bottles, which together form one \\"culture\\" or \\"set\\". One bottle is designed to enhance the growth of aerobic organisms, and the other is designed to grow anaerobic organisms. In children, infection with anaerobic bacteria is uncommon, so a single aerobic bottle may be collected to minimize the amount of blood required.Pitt, SJ (2018) p. 34. It is recommended that at least two sets are collected from two separate venipuncture locations. This helps to distinguish infection from contamination, as contaminants are less likely to appear in more than one set than true pathogens. Additionally, the collection of larger volumes of blood increases the likelihood that pathogens will be detected if present.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 870. It is important that the bottles are neither underfilled nor overfilled: underfilling can lead to false negative results as fewer organisms are present in the sample, while overfilling can inhibit microbial growth because there is a comparatively lower ratio of growth medium to blood. A 1:10 to 1:5 ratio of blood to culture medium is suggested to optimize microbial growth.Tibbetts, RJ & Robinson-Dunn, B. Chapter 10 in Dunne, WM & Burnham, CAD eds. (2018). sec. \\"Introduction\\". For routine blood cultures in adults, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommends the collection of two sets of bottles from two different blood draws, with 20‚Äì30 mL of blood drawn in each set, half of which is distributed to each bottle. In children, the amount of blood to be drawn is often based on the child's age or weight.Revell, P & Doern, C. Chapter 8 in Dunne, WM & Burnham, CAD eds. (2018). sec. \\"Specimen Collection\\". If endocarditis is suspected, a total of six bottles may be collected.Bennett, JE et al. (2019). p. 202. Blood culture bottles contain a growth medium, which encourages microorganisms to multiply, and an anticoagulant that prevents blood from clotting. Sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS) is the most commonly used anticoagulantAtkinson-Dunn, R. & Dunne, WM. Chapter 2 in Dunne, WM & Burnham, CAD eds. (2018). sec. \\"Introduction\\". because it does not interfere with the growth of most organisms. The exact composition of the growth medium varies, but aerobic bottles use a broth that is enriched with nutrients, such as brain-heart infusion or trypticase soy broth,Procop, GW et al. (2017). p. 194. and anaerobic bottles typically contain a reducing agent such as thioglycollate. The empty space in an anaerobic bottle is filled with a gas mixture that does not contain oxygen.Ford, M (2019). p. 85. Many commercially manufactured bottles contain a resin that absorbs antibiotics to reduce their action on the microorganisms in the sample. Bottles intended for pediatric use are designed to accommodate lower blood volumes and have additives that enhance the growth of pathogens more commonly found in children. Other specialized bottles may be used to detect fungi and mycobacteria. In low and middle income countries, pre-formulated culture bottles can be prohibitively expensive, and it may be necessary to prepare the bottles manually. This requires access to proper facilities and reagents, which in many areas is limited; in some regions, it may not be possible to perform blood cultures at all.Dondorp, AM et al. (2019). pp. 172‚Äì3. =Culturing= pellicle) on the surface; b) bubbles from gas production; c) turbidity from microbial growth (in right bottle); d) visible microbial colonies After the blood is collected, the bottles are incubated at body temperature to encourage the growth of microorganisms. Bottles are usually incubated for five days in automated systems, but the incubation time may be longer if manual blood culture methods are used or if slower-growing organisms, such as certain bacteria that cause endocarditis, are suspected.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 871.Procop, GW & Koneman, EW (2017). p. 199. In manual systems, the bottles are visually examined for indicators of microbial growth, which might include cloudiness, the production of gas, the presence of visible microbial colonies, or a change in colour from the digestion of blood, which is called hemolysis. Some manual blood culture systems indicate growth using a compartment that fills with fluid when gases are produced, or a miniature agar plate which is periodically inoculated by tipping the bottle.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). pp. 871‚Äì2. To ensure that positive blood cultures are not missed, a sample from the bottle is often inoculated onto an agar plate (subcultured) at the end of the incubation period regardless of whether or not indicators of growth are observed. In developed countries, manual culture methods have largely been replaced by automated systems that provide continuous computerized monitoring of the culture bottles.Carroll, KC et al. (2015). p. 756. These systems, such as the BACTEC, BacT/ALERT and VersaTrek, consist of an incubator in which the culture bottles are continuously mixed. Growth is detected by sensors that measure the production or consumption of certain gases inside the bottle‚Äîmost commonly production of carbon dioxide‚Äîwhich serves as an indicator of microbial metabolism.Mahon, CR et al.

If the bottle remains negative at the end of the incubation period, it is generally discarded without being subcultured.Ford, M (2019). p. 87. A technique called the lysis-centrifugation method can be used for improved isolation of slow- growing or fastidious organisms, such as fungi, mycobacteria, and Legionella.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 872.Procop, GW & Koneman, EW (2017). p. 196. Rather than incubating the blood in a bottle filled with growth medium,Truant, AL (2016). p. 12. this method involves collecting blood into a tube containing an agent that destroys (lyses) red and white blood cells, then spinning the sample in a centrifuge. This process concentrates the solid contents of the sample, including microorganisms if present, into a pellet, which is used to inoculate the subculture media. While lysis-centrifugation offers greater sensitivity than conventional blood culture methods, it is prone to contamination because it requires extensive manipulation of the sample.McPherson, RA & Pincus, MR (2017). p. 1207. =Identification= If growth is detected, a microbiologist will perform a Gram stain on a sample of blood from the bottle for a rapid preliminary identification of the organism.Ford, M (2019). p. 89. The Gram stain classifies bacteria as Gram- positive or Gram-negative and provides information about their shape‚Äîwhether they are rod-shaped (referred to as bacilli), spherical (referred to as cocci), or spiral-shaped (spirochetes)‚Äîas well as their arrangement.Turgeon, ML (2016). pp. 492‚Äì3. Gram-positive cocci in clusters, for example, are typical of Staphylococcus species.Carroll, KC et al. (2016). p. 203. Yeast and other fungi may also be identified from the Gram stain.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 874.Procop, GW & Koneman, EW (2017). p. 81. A Gram stain identifying microbial growth from a blood culture is considered a critical result and must immediately be reported to the clinician.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). pp. 868‚Äì71. The Gram stain provides information about the possible identity of the organism, which assists the clinician in the selection of a more appropriate antibiotic treatment before the full culture and sensitivity results are complete. In traditional methods, the blood is then subcultured onto agar plates to isolate the organism for further testing. The Gram stain results inform microbiologists about what types of agar plates should be used and what tests might be appropriate to identify the organism.Ford, M (2019). pp. 91‚Äì2. It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for sufficient growth to occur on the subculture plates for definitive identification to be possible. At this point, the microbiologist will assess the appearance of the bacterial or fungal coloniesProcop, GW & Coneman, EW (2017). p. 94. and carry out tests that provide information about the metabolic and biochemical features of the organism, which permit identification to the genus or species level. For example, the catalase test can distinguish streptococci and staphylococci (two genuses of Gram-positive cocci) from each other,Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 126. and the coagulase test can differentiate Staphylococcus aureus, a common culprit of bloodstream infections, from the less pathogenic coagulase-negative staphylococci.Procop, GW & Coneman, EW (2017). p. 104. Loading a target plate containing microbial samples into a Bruker Biotyper, an instrument used for MALDI-TOF analysis in microbiology Microorganisms may also be identified using automated systems, such as instruments that perform panels of biochemical tests, or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), in which microbial proteins are ionized and characterized on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratios; each microbial species exhibits a characteristic pattern of proteins when analyzed through mass spectrometry.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 244. As of 2011, the pathogens most commonly isolated from blood cultures were coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, and Candida albicans.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 866. Because bloodstream infections can be life-threatening, timely diagnosis and treatment is critical,Carroll, KC et al. (2016). p. 756. and to this end a number of rapid identification methods have been developed.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 874. MALDI-TOF can be used to identify organisms directly from blood culture bottles after separation and concentration procedures, or from preliminary growth on the agar plate within a few hours of subculturing.Pitt, SJ (2018) p. 35. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can identify microorganisms by detection of DNA sequences specific to certain species in samples from positive blood cultures; several PCR systems designed for the identification of common blood culture pathogens are commercially available.Gonzalez, MD & Jerris, RC. Chapter 7 in Dunne, WM & Burnham, CAD eds. (2018). sec. \\"Introduction\\"; \\"Summary\\". Some biochemical and immunologic tests can be performed directly on positive blood cultures, such as the tube coagulase test for identification of S. aureusMahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 874. or latex agglutination tests for S. pneumoniae,Ford, M (2019). p. 93. and unlike PCR and MALDI-TOF, these methods may be practical for laboratories in low and middle income countries. It is also possible to directly inoculate microbial identification panels with blood from a positive culture bottle, although this is not as reliable as testing subcultured bacteria because additives from the growth media can interfere with the results.Ford, M (2019). pp. 93‚Äì4. =Antibiotic susceptibility testing= In traditional antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) methods, such as the disk diffusion test, pure colonies of the organism are selected from the subculture plate and used to inoculate a secondary medium. These methods require overnight incubation before results can be obtained.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). pp. 273‚Äì7. There are automated systems which use pre-formulated antibiotic panels, measure microbial growth automatically, and determine the sensitivity results using algorithms; some of these can provide results in as little as five hours, but others require overnight incubation as well.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). pp. 287‚àí8. Rapid administration of effective antimicrobial drugs is crucial in the treatment of sepsis, so several methods have been developed to provide faster antibiotic sensitivity results. Conventional AST methods can be carried out on purified pellets of microorganisms obtained from concentration and purification of the positive blood culture, or even directly from the culture bottle, skipping the initial subculturing step. PCR and MALDI-TOF can also be used for direct AST of selected organisms and antibiotics.Farron, ML & Ledeboer, NA. Chapter 11 in Dunne, WM & Burnham, CAD eds. (2018). sec. \\"Rapid Diagnostics\\". Limitations Blood cultures are subject to both false positive and false negative errors. In automated culture systems, identification of positive bottles is based on the detection of gases produced by cellular metabolism, so samples with high numbers of white blood cells may flag as positive when no bacteria are present. Inspection of the growth curve produced by the instrument can help to distinguish between true and false positive cultures, but Gram staining and subculture are still necessary for any sample that is flagged as positive.Ford, M (2019). p. 90. Blood cultures can become contaminated with microorganisms from the skin or the environment, which multiply inside the culture bottle, giving the false impression that those organisms are present in the blood. Contamination of blood cultures can lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment and longer hospital stays. The frequency of contamination can be reduced by following established protocols for blood culture collection, but it cannot be eliminated completely; for instance, bacteria can survive in deeper layers of the skin even after meticulous disinfection of the blood draw site. The CLSI defines an acceptable contamination rate as no greater than 3% of all blood cultures. The frequency of contamination varies widely between institutions and even between different departments in the same hospital; studies have found rates ranging from 0.8 to 12.5 percent. When faced with a positive blood culture result, clinicians must decide whether the finding represents contamination or genuine infection. Some organisms, such as S. aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, are usually considered to be pathogenic when detected in a blood culture, while others are more likely to represent contamination with skin flora; but even common skin organisms such as coagulase-negative staphylococci can cause bloodstream infections under certain conditions. When such organisms are present, interpretation of the culture result involves taking into account the person's clinical condition and whether or not multiple cultures are positive for the same organism. False negatives may be caused by collecting an insufficient amount of blood or drawing blood cultures after the person has received antibiotics. Additionally, certain organisms are difficult to culture and may not be detected by conventional methods. The volume of blood drawn is considered the most important variable in ensuring that pathogens are detected: the more blood that is collected, the more pathogens are recovered. However, if the amount of blood collected far exceeds the recommended volume, bacterial growth may be inhibited by natural inhibitors present in the blood and an inadequate amount of growth medium in the bottle. Over-filling of blood culture bottles may also contribute to iatrogenic anemia. History An early vacuum tube system for blood culture collection, described by C.E. Simon & C.C.W. Judd in 1915 Early blood culture methods were labour-intensive. One of the first known protocols, published in 1869, recommended that leeches be used to collect blood from the patient. Decontamination of the draw site and equipment could take over an hour, and owing to a lack of effective methods for preserving blood, the cultures would sometimes have to be prepared at the patient's bedside. In addition to subculturing the broth, some protocols specified that the blood be mixed with melted agar and the mixture poured into a petri dish. In 1915, a blood culture collection system consisting of glass vacuum tubes containing glucose broth and an anticoagulant was described. Robert James Valentine Pulvertaft published a seminal work on blood cultures in 1930, specifying‚Äîamong other insights‚Äîan optimal blood-to-broth ratio of 1:5, which is still accepted today. The use of SPS as an anticoagulant and preservative was introduced in the 1930s and 40s and resolved some of the logistical issues with earlier methods.Dunne, WM. Chapter 1 in Dunne, WM & Burnham, CAD eds. (2018). From the 1940s through the 1980s, a great deal of research was carried out on broth formulations and additives, with the goal of creating a growth medium that could accommodate all common bloodstream pathogens. In 1947, M.R. Casta√±eda invented a \\"biphasic\\" culture bottle for the identification of Brucella species, which contained both broth and an agar slant, allowing the agar to be easily subcultured from the broth; this was a precursor of contemporary commercial systems for manual blood cultures.Mahon, CR et al (2018). p. 871. E.G. Scott in 1951 published a protocol described as \\"the advent of the modern blood culture set\\". Scott's method involved inoculating blood into two rubber-sealed glass bottles, one for aerobes and one for anaerobes. The aerobic bottle contained trypticase soy broth and an agar slant, and the anaerobic bottle contained thioglycollate broth. The lysis-centrifugation method was introduced in 1917 by Mildred Clough, but it was rarely used in clinical practice until commercial systems were developed in the mid-1970s.TeKippe, EM & Pence, MA. Chapter 3 in Dunne, WM & Burnham, CAD eds. (2018). sec. \\"History of Lysis-Centrifugation Blood Culture Methods\\". Automated blood culture systems first became available in the 1970s. The earliest of these‚Äîthe BACTEC systems, produced by Johnston Laboratories (now Becton Dickinson)‚Äîused culture broths containing radiolabelled nutrient substrates. Microbes that fed on these substrates would produce radioactive carbon dioxide, the concentration of which was monitored to detect growth.Mahon, CR et al. (2018). p. 872. Before this technique was applied to blood cultures, it had been proposed by NASA as a method for detecting life on Mars. Throughout the 1970s and 80s several manufacturers attempted to detect microbial growth by measuring changes in the electrical conductivity of the culture medium, but none of these methods were commercially successful. A major issue with the early BACTEC systems was that they produced radioactive waste, which required special disposal procedures, so in 1984 a new generation of BACTEC instruments was released that used spectrophotometry to detect CO2. The BacT/ALERT system, which indirectly detects production of CO2 by measuring the decrease in the medium's pH, was approved for use in the US in 1991. Unlike the BACTEC systems available at the time, the BacT/ALERT did not require a needle to be introduced into the bottle for sampling; this reduced the frequency of contamination and made it the first system to provide truly continuous monitoring of blood cultures.Truant, AL (2016). p. 13. This non- invasive measurement method was adopted in 1992 by the BACTEC 9000 series, which use fluorescent indicators to detect pH changes.Chamberland, RR. Chapter 4 in Dunne, WM & Burnham, CAD eds. (2018). sec. \\"History\\"; \\"Bactec 9000 Series Studies\\". The Difco ESP, a direct predecessor of the current VersaTREK system which detects gas production by measuring pressure changes, was also first approved in 1992.

The population in 2011 was 23,376,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 222.12 km¬≤. The city proper had a population of 10,520 in 2001.UMA POPULA√á√ÉO QUE SE URBANIZA, Uma avalia√ß√£o recente - Cidades, 2004 Nuno Pires Soares, Instituto Geogr√°fico Portugu√™s (Geographic Institute of Portugal) History There are vestiges of mid-Paleolithic to Mesolithic period along the territory, including traces from Neolithic, Calcolithic and Bronze Age remnants. The Iron Age also marked this region, with archaeological excavations unearthing settlements and artefacts. Roman legions of D√©cimo Junius Brutus occupied the territory, following the Tagus upstream and disembarking in Santar√©m, where they left their marks. These, along with other groups, occupied arable lands, beginning in the first century A.D. This included the development of agriculture (particularly wheat and olive orchards) and raising of cattle, supporting the establishment of Almeirim along the margins of the Tagus. References to this municipality, began appearing in the 14th century. With rich lands, the territory supported hunting, extending to Santar√©m, and proximities of the Tagus and Lisbon. This easy access, made Almeirim a preferred place for the Kings of the second Dynasty, and a winter place frequented by members of Corte, becoming known as the Sintra of Winter. Almeirim, therefore, became an ideal place for relaxation, palace intrigue and romantic encounters in the royal gardens, mixed with resolutions of important negotiations. King John I, between 1411 and 1423, ordered the construction of castle and first residences that contributed to the establishment of the town, with the work to the Al-meirim, that included landscaping, drainage and earthen-works. In 1483, Almeirim was elevated to the status of municipality, wherein he bestowed a concession on its residents. As a consequence, in 1490, its first almoxarife (sheriff) √Ålvaro Pires Borges was assigned by King D. John II from the royal guard. In 1500, the Church of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista was constructed. The palace was expanded and improved by Manuel I of Portugal who was in Almeirim several times: in 1510, part of 1513, Christmas of 1514 and all the period between October 1515 and May 1516. John III of Portugal followed his example, and spent similar time in Almeirim. He ordered the construction of a royal palace near the Ribeira de Muge (Muja or Mugem), that became known as Pa√ßo da Ribeira de Muge and later, the Pa√ßo dos Negros', then later the Convent of Nossa Senhora da Serra. King Sebastian, who frequently visited Almeirim, created a dynastic succession crisis with his disappearance at the Battle of Alc√°cer-Quibir. Without a successor, the Cortes of Almeirim was opened by Cardinal Henry on 11 January 1580, to decide on the problem of succession. During the Cortes, Febo Moniz, as magistrate of Lisbon, directed his response to the Cardinal, stating \\"Give this your Highness to a Portuguese prince and all will kiss his hand\\". But, little was resolved, and the Kingdom eventually began to be governed by Phillip II of Spain, beginning the reign of Phillipian Dynastic Union, until 1 December 1640. At the time Almeirim was visited as a winter resort, where many passed through the roads of the burgh and stayed at the Royal Palace. Gil Vicente, the father of Portuguese theatre, presented many of his farses, comedies and plays, for example \\"Auto da F√©\\" in 1510; \\"Barca da Gl√≥ria\\" in 1519; tragic-comedy \\"Dom Dardos\\" at the marriage of Infanta D. Isabel with Charles V, in 1525; and in 1526 he presented the farse \\"O Juiz da Beira\\", the tragic-comedy \\"Templo de Apolo\\", \\"Breve Sum√°rio da Hist√≥ria de Deus\\" and \\"Di√°logo sobre a Ressurrei√ß√£o\\". It was also in the palace the Garcia de Resende began printing his Cancioneiro Geral. In the Mem√≥rias Paroquiais (1758) the resident population was just over 302 neighbours. With the inauguration of the D. Lu√≠s bridge in 1881, the connection between Almeirim and Santar√©m, allowed a significant change in the economy. In 1935, the Casa do Povo, health centre and dispensary were inaugurated. By the middle of the century (1953), the bullring, a social centre of annual activities was also open to the public. On 20 June 1991, the settlement was elevated to the status of city. The municipal assembly approved ARU02, designating the √Årea de Reabilita√ß√£o Urbana (Urban Rehabilitation Area) for Almeirim (8902/2014, Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, 147, S√©rie 1) in order to modernize and recuperate many of the historic buildings in the town. Geography The administrative division of civil parishes within the municipality of Almeirim Almeirim is situated from Lisbon, and in Santar√©m; its neighbours include Alpiar√ßa (to the north), Chamusca (in the east and northeast), Salvaterra da Magos, Coruche (both in the south), Santar√©m (in the northwest) and Cartaxo (in the south). The municipality is situated on a plain along the Tagus Valley and Lez√≠ria, approximately along the left bank of the Tagus River. The morphology of the terrain is marked by a planar relief with little forests, with cultivation interspersed between pastures and vineyards. The municipality of Almeirim is subdivided into the following 4 parishes: * Almeirim * Benfica do Ribatejo * Fazendas de Almeirim * Raposa Two main roadways support the population of Almeirim: the EN114 and EN118, in addition to the inter-community IC10. The construction of the Salgueiro Maia bridge and A13 bridge serves and reinforces the privileged location of Almeirim, in addition to constant traffic from Santar√©m and the rest of the country. Economy The mainstay of the economy is agriculture, including wine making and modern industry of alimentary products such as fruit juices, processed tomato and canned vegetables (Compal).

According to the people of Almeirim, a poor friar who was on a pilgrimage stopped in the village of Almeirim and knocked on the door of a house. He was too proud to beg for a bite to eat, so instead, he requested a large pot in which he could make ‚Äúa delicious and filling‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.stone soup‚Äù. With arched eyebrows and curious glances, the family invited him into their home and set up a large pot over flickering flames and filled with water. Slowly walking up to the iron clad cauldron, the friar reached into his deep pocket to produce a smooth and well- cleaned stone that he promptly dropped into the boiling water. A little while later he tasted the soup and said that it needed a touch of seasoning. So the wife brought him some salt to add, to which he suggested that maybe a little bit of chouri√ßo (sausage), or pork belly, would be better. Graciously, she obliged and dropped several thick slices into the pot. Then, the friar asked if she might not have a little something to enrich the soup, such as potatoes or beans from a previous meal. With a broad smile, she agreed, and added a healthy portion into the bubbling water. This banter continued back and forth between the family and the friar before he finally announced that he had indeed made a very delicious and filling soup. When the soup was done, the friar fished the stone out of the pot, washed and dried it off, and plopped it back in his pocket for the next time. Nowadays Almeirim is a gastronomical destiny for Portuguese people, as well as for foreign people, willing to taste this soup. Restaurants like \\"O Pinheiro\\", \\"o Toucinho\\" and \\"O Minhoto\\" are restaurants that serve this dish. Notable citizens * Cristina Branco (born 28 December 1972), is a musician and fadista.

Hefner, who served as mayor of Oklahoma City from April 11, 1939 to April 8, 1947. It also serves as a major recreational destination, as it is surrounded by of bicycle trails. Description The capacity of the lake is 75,000 acre-feet. Lake Hefner covers 2,500 acres (10 km¬≤) and averages 29 feet (9 m) deep. The lake is situated within the Oklahoma City urban area and is subsequently closely bordered by residential areas to the north, west, and east. The Lake Hefner Dam is located along the entire northern side of the lake. Lake Hefner Parkway borders the east side of the lake. The south side is the least developed, retaining the original forest along much of the shore. Lake Hefner Golf Course is located on the southwest corner of the lake. Immediately south of this are the Oklahoma City docks, commonly known as the city-side docks, the largest marina on the lake. The other marina on Lake Hefner is the Oklahoma City Boat Club (OCBC), a private organization that holds weekly sailboat races during the summer and is located on the east side. Just north of the OCBC is the East Wharf area, which contains several fairly upscale restaurants. On the south side of the lake is the Hobie Point, a YMCA sailing school, and Stars and Stripes Park. The Oklahoma Radio Kontrol Society (TORKS) has maintained a Radio Control air field since the early 1970s. Recreation Hefner is also a popular recreational fishing spot for Oklahoma City residents, and is populated with a variety of gamefish species including largemouth & smallmouth bass, channel catfish, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, as well as white bass and hybrid striped bass. Additionally, Hefner is a popular site for recreational boating, both with sailboats and motorized pleasure craft. Kiteboarding is also very popular on Hefner due to the excellent wind they receive all summer.

It is notable for the variety of birds that are attracted to Ralstin Island (not open to the public) and also for the selenite crystals that can be collected along the shoreline. Recent droughts, most notably that of 2011, have had an adverse effect on the future of the lake. Physical description A study made in 1931 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed building a flood control dam in the Great Salt Plains area. Congress authorized its construction in 1936. Design studies began in 1937 and the Corps broke ground for construction in September 1938. The dam was completed in July 1941, with a water capacity of . The lake covers and has of shoreline.

Selenite crystals Selenite crystals dug up from the lake bed. On the west edge of the lake, visitors can dig for selenite crystals. These crystals feature an hourglass inclusion which is unique to the Great Salt Plains.Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceDeHaan, Vici, \\"Great Salt Plains State Park\\", State parks of the South: America's historic paradise, pg 256 Scientists believe that salt was deposited during repeated water-level rises of a shallow sea millions of years ago. The supply of salt is kept intact by saline groundwater that flows just a few feet below the surface. When the water evaporates, a layer of salt remains on the surface. This process also plays a role in the formation of selenite crystals that visitors covet. Future of the lake The lake is subject to periodic mass fish kills, most recently in 2011. During the extreme drought of that year, the average depth decreased to . According to John Stahl, northwest fisheries supervisor for the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, the lake has grown more shallow since its creation because of silting and agricultural runoff. That and extremely hot dry summers cause the brine to become more concentrated. Oxygen in the water is mostly consumed by bacteria that break down organic matter in the water, leaving insufficient oxygen to support the fish.Shelton, Ryan. NewsOK. \\"Can the Great Salt Plains Lake be saved?\\" July 21, 2012. Retrieved April 20, 2013. According to officials of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the future of the lake appears grim if no remedial action is taken. Proposed solutions are: * Open the dam and allow the lake to flow into the river. * Dig the silt out of the reservoir, which could cost $5 - 10 million. * Plug the dam to raise the water level. There is a law requiring that a non federal partner help pay for restoration. The Corps regards this as an unlikely event. If no action is taken, the Corps has said that the seafood source will be depleted and the birds will abandon the lake.

Former State Park Lodges Oklahoma created two state parks, Arrowhead and Fountainhead, to provide recreational activities and camping facilities at the lake. The tag line in their early advertising was, \\"Follow the fun to Eufaula.\\" The state borrowed $8 million from the Federal government to build a lodge at each park. However, the lodges did not provide enough money to repay the loan, so ownership reverted to the Federal government. In 1986, the U.S. Economic Administration sold Arrowhead Lodge to the Choctaw Nation and Fountainhead Lodge to a group of private investors. Arrowhead switched hands again in 2000, when a non-profit group with ties to the Church of Scientology bought the lodge and converted it into a drug and alcohol treatment facility, now called Narconon Arrowhead. Fountainhead was sold out of a sheriff‚Äôs sale to The Muscogee (Creek) Nation in 2005, amid plans to reopen it as a gaming facility. Those plans never materialized, and the lodge was torn down. However, a 48-acre tract of the land was placed into federal trust status in 2018, opening the way for development of the property as a tourist destination with gaming, restaurants and entertainment. =Marinas = List of Marinas on Lake Eufaula. * Area 51 Marina http://www.lakeeufaula.org/area-51-marina/ LakeEufaula.org website accessed 1-31-2020 * Belle Starr Marina http://www.lakeeufaula.org/belle-starr-marina/ LakeEufaula.org website accessed 1-31-2020 * Duchess Creek Marina http://www.lakeeufaula.org/duchess- creek-marina/ LakeEufaula.org website accessed 1-31-2020 * Eufaula Cove Marina http://www.eufaulacovemarinallc.com/ Eufaula Cove website accessed 1-31-2020 * Evergreen Marina http://www.evergreenmarina.com/ Evergreen Marina website accessed 1-31-2020 * Lake Eufaula Marina http://www.lakeeufaula.org/lake- eufaula-marina/ LakeEufaula.org website accessed 1-31-2020 * No. 9 Marina http://www.lakeeufaula.org/no-9-marina/ LakeEufaula.org website accessed 1-31-2020 Popular culture The 2011 Jason Boland & the Stragglers song 'Farmer's Luck', written by Greg Jacobs, tells the story of how eminent domain laws were used to force farmers to sell their land to make way for the artificial lake.

At flood stage its pool elevation is above sea level and its storage capacity rises to .\\"McGee Creek\\", Oklahoma Water Atlas, Oklahoma Water Resources Board, available via http://www.owrb.ok.gov/news/publications/wa/lakes/McGeeCreek.php. The reservoir has a maximum depth of at the dam when the water is at conservation pool level. =Dam and river outlet= The dam is an earth-filled structure that is long and high across McGee Creek. An earthen dike long and high, blocks several saddles on the west side of the reservoir rim. A riprap blanket prevents erosion of the upstream sides of both the dam and the dike. The river outlet works located on the east side of the dam release water to McGee Creek under extreme conditions. The works include an intake structure, three conduits (each about in diameter), a stilling basin, associated gates and controls. The discharge channel to McGee Creek can pass flows ranging from to per second. =Municipal water outlet= Water from the lake is routinely pumped to municipal consumers via pipeline. The municipal outlet works has a bypass that diverts directly downstream to McGee Creek. This provides a constant stream of water that is beneficial to marine life. The river outlet works, located on the east side of the dam, handle this function. A separate intake leads to three conduits (each diameter), which terminate in a stilling basin, that has a single pipe leading to the three variable-capacity centrifugal discharge pumps. The pumps discharge into a surge tank at the Atoka Lake, away, via a concrete pipe that is diameter. Other pumps then transfer the water to Oklahoma City. History The McGee Creek Project and McGee Creek Authority were established in 1978 to develop and maintain the McGee Creek Reservoir to provide a municipal and industrial water supply for areas in central and southern Oklahoma, including Oklahoma City and Atoka County. Under the direct supervision of superintendent Glen Russell, the authority has operated and maintained the reservoir and associated facilities, including an attached water pipeline, a surge tank, a regulating tank, a maintenance complex, and land easements surrounding these facilities. The U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation owns the reservoir, but has granted McGee Creek Authority ownership title to the project office, aqueduct and appurtenances, and other operation and maintenance related facilities.

To achieve this unpredictability, some randomization is typically employed. Modern cryptographic protocols often require frequent generation of random quantities. Cryptographic attacks that subvert or exploit weaknesses in this process are known as random number generator attacks. A high quality random number generation (RNG) process is almost always required for security, and lack of quality generally provides attack vulnerabilities and so leads to lack of security, even to complete compromise, in cryptographic systems. The RNG process is particularly attractive to attackers because it is typically a single isolated hardware or software component easy to locate. If the attacker can substitute pseudo-random bits generated in a way they can predict, security is totally compromised, yet generally undetectable by any upstream test of the bits. Furthermore, such attacks require only a single access to the system that is being compromised. No data need be sent back in contrast to, say, a computer virus that steals keys and then e-mails them to some drop point. Human generation of random quantities Humans generally do poorly at generating random quantities. Magicians, professional gamblers and con artists depend on the predictability of human behavior. In World War II German code clerks were instructed to select three letters at random to be the initial rotor setting for each Enigma machine message. Instead some chose predictable values like their own or a girlfriend's initials, greatly aiding Allied breaking of these encryption systems. Another example is the often predictable ways computer users choose passwords (see password cracking). Nevertheless, in the specific case of playing mixed strategy games, use of human gameplay entropy for randomness generation was studied by Ran Halprin and Moni Naor. Attacks =Software RNGs= Just as with other components of a cryptosystem, a software random number generator should be designed to resist certain attacks. Some attacks possible on a RNG include (from ): ; Direct cryptanalytic attack: when an attacker obtained part of the stream of random bits and can use this to distinguish the RNG output from a truly random stream. ; Input-based attacks: modify the input to the RNG to attack it, for example by \\"flushing\\" existing entropy out of the system and put it into a known state. ; State compromise extension attacks: when the internal secret state of the RNG is known at some time, use this to predict future output or to recover previous outputs. This can happen when a generator starts up and has little or no entropy (especially if the computer has just been booted and followed a very standard sequence of operations), so an attacker may be able to obtain an initial guess at the state. =Hardware RNGs= A number of attacks on hardware random number generators are possible, including trying to capture radio-frequency emissions from the computer (obtaining hard drive interrupt times from motor noise, for example), or trying to feed controlled signals into a supposedly random source (such as turning off the lights in a lava lamp or feeding a strong, known signal into a sound card). =RNG subversion= Subverted random numbers can be created using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator with a seed value known to the attacker but concealed in the software. A relatively short, say 24 to 40 bit, portion of the seed can be truly random to prevent tell-tale repetitions, but not long enough to prevent the attacker from recovering, say, a \\"randomly\\" produced key. Random numbers typically go through several layers of hardware and software before they are used. Bits may be generated in a peripheral device, sent over a serial cable, collected in an operating system utility and retrieved by a system call. The subverted bits can be substituted at any point in this process with little likelihood of detection. A hardware circuit to produce subverted bits can be built on an integrated circuit a few millimeters square. The most sophisticated hardware random number generator can be subverted by placing such a chip anywhere upstream of where the source of randomness is digitized, say in an output driver chip or even in the cable connecting the RNG to the computer. The subversion chip can include a clock to limit the start of operation to some time after the unit is first turned on and run through acceptance tests, or it can contain a radio receiver for on/off control. It could be installed by the manufacturer at the behest of their national signals intelligence service, or added later by anyone with physical access. CPU chips with built-in hardware random number generators can be replaced by compatible chips with a subverted RNG in the chips' firmware. Defenses * Mix (with, for example, xor) hardware generated random numbers with the output of a good quality stream cipher, as close to the point of use as possible. The stream cipher key or seed should be changeable in a way that can be audited and derived from a trustworthy source, e.g. dice throws. The Fortuna random number generator is an example of an algorithm which uses this mechanism. * Generate passwords and passphrases using a true random source. Some systems select random passwords for the user rather than let users propose their own. * Use encryption systems that document how they generate random numbers and provide a method to audit the generation process. * Build security systems with off the shelf hardware, preferably purchased in ways that do not reveal its intended use, e.g. off the floor at a large retail establishment. From this perspective, sound cards and webcams may be a better source of randomness than hardware made for that purpose. * Maintain complete physical control over the hardware after it has been purchased. Designing a secure random number generator requires at least as high a level of care as designing other elements of a cryptographic system. Prominent examples =Predictable Netscape seed= Early versions of Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption protocol used pseudo-random quantities derived from a PRNG seeded with three variable values: the time of day, the process ID, and the parent process ID. These quantities are often relatively predictable, and so have little entropy and are less than random, and so that version of SSL was found to be insecure as a result. The problem was reported to Netscape in 1994 by Phillip Hallam-Baker, then a researcher in the CERN Web team, but was not fixed prior to release. The problem in the running code was discovered in 1995 by Ian Goldberg and David Wagner, who had to reverse engineer the object code because Netscape refused to reveal the details of its random number generation (security through obscurity). That RNG was fixed in later releases (version 2 and higher) by more robust (i.e., more random and so higher entropy from an attacker's perspective) seeding. =Microsoft Windows 2000/XP random number generator= Microsoft uses an unpublished algorithm to generate random values for its Windows operating system. These random quantities are made available to users via the CryptGenRandom utility. In November 2007, Leo Dorrendorf et al. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and University of Haifa published a paper titled Cryptanalysis of the Random Number Generator of the Windows Operating System. The paper presented serious weaknesses in Microsoft's approach at the time. The paper's conclusions were based on disassembly of the code in Windows 2000, but according to Microsoft applied to Windows XP as well. Microsoft has stated that the problems described in the paper have been addressed in subsequent releases of Windows, which use a different RNG implementation. =Possible backdoor in Elliptical Curve DRBG= The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology has published a collection of \\"deterministic random bit generators\\" it recommends as NIST Special Publication 800-90. One of the generators, Dual_EC_DRBG, was favored by the National Security Agency. Alt URL Dual_EC_DRBG uses elliptic curve technology and includes a set of recommended constants. In August 2007, Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson of Microsoft showed that the constants could be constructed in such a way as to create a kleptographic backdoor in the algorithm. In September 2013 The New York Times wrote that \\"the N.S.A. had inserted a back door into a 2006 standard adopted by N.I.S.T... called the Dual EC DRBG standard\\", thereby revealing that the NSA carried out a malware attack against the American people. In December 2013, Reuters reported that documents released by Edward Snowden indicated that the NSA had paid RSA Security $10 million to make Dual_EC_DRBG the default in their encryption software, and raised further concerns that the algorithm might contain a backdoor for the NSA. Due to these concerns, in 2014, NIST withdrew Dual EC DRBG from its draft guidance on random number generators, recommending \\"current users of Dual_EC_DRBG transition to one of the three remaining approved algorithms as quickly as possible.\\" =MIFARE Crypto-1= Crypto-1 is a cryptosystem developed by NXP for use on MIFARE chips. The system is proprietary and originally the algorithm has not been published. Upon reverse engineering of the chip, researchers from the University of Virginia and the Chaos Computer Club found an attack on Crypto-1 exploiting a poorly initialized random number generator. =Debian OpenSSL= In May 2008, security researcher Luciano Bello revealed his discovery that changes made in 2006 to the random number generator in the version of the OpenSSL package distributed with Debian GNU/Linux and other Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, dramatically reduced the entropy of generated values and made a variety of security keys vulnerable to attack. The security weakness was caused by changes made to the openssl code by a Debian developer in response to compiler warnings of apparently redundant code. This caused a massive worldwide regeneration of keys, and despite all attention the issue got, it could be assumed many of these old keys are still in use. Key types affected include SSH keys, OpenVPN keys, DNSSEC keys, key material for use in X.509 certificates and session keys used in SSL/TLS connections. Keys generated with GnuPG or GNUTLS are not affected as these programs used different methods to generate random numbers. Keys generated by non-Debian-based Linux distributions are also unaffected. The weak-key-generation vulnerability was promptly patched after it was reported, but any services still using keys that were generated by the old code remain vulnerable. A number of software packages now contain checks against a weak key blacklist to attempt to prevent use of any of these remaining weak keys, but researchers continue to find weak key implementations. =PlayStation 3= In December 2010, a group calling itself fail0verflow announced recovery of the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) private key used by Sony to sign software for the PlayStation 3 game console. The attack was made possible because Sony failed to generate a new random nonce for each signature. =RSA public key factoring= An analysis comparing millions of RSA public keys gathered from the Internet was announced in 2012 by Lenstra, Hughes, Augier, Bos, Kleinjung, and Wachter. They were able to factor 0.2% of the keys using only Euclid's algorithm. They exploited a weakness unique to cryptosystems based on integer factorization. If is one public key and is another, then if by chance , then a simple computation of factors both n and n‚Ä≤, totally compromising both keys. Nadia Heninger, part of a group that did a similar experiment, said that the bad keys occurred almost entirely in embedded applications, and explains that the one-shared-prime problem uncovered by the two groups results from situations where the pseudorandom number generator is poorly seeded initially and then reseeded between the generation of the first and second primes. =Java nonce collision= In August 2013, it was revealed that bugs in the Java class SecureRandom could generate collisions in the k nonce values used for ECDSA in implementations of Bitcoin on Android. When this occurred the private key could be recovered, in turn allowing stealing Bitcoins from the containing wallet.

Pictures. It marks the first appearance of Beaky Buzzard in a Warner Bros. short. The title is a Brooklyn-accented way of saying \\"gets the bird\\", which can refer to an obscene gesture, or as simply the \\"Bronx cheer\\"; in this case, it is also used metaphorically, as Bugs \\"gets\\" the bird (a buzzard) by playing a trick. Plot The cartoon begins with a mother buzzard instructing her children to go out and catch something for dinner. Three take off like jets from an aircraft carrier. One stays behind, his back turned. This is Beaky Buzzard (Killer) who is shy, easily embarrassed, and a little on the slow side. Against his will, his mother kicks him out of the nest with instructions to at least catch a rabbit. Beaky spots Bugs Bunny and, after sneaking around some clouds 'stalking' his prey, soars down to catch him. Bugs makes like an air-traffic controller and \\"guides\\" Beaky down, purposely causing him to crash. Beaky then lands on the ground unable to move or speak. Bugs rises out of his hole and says his usual line, \\"What's up, doc?\\" Bugs asks Beaky what he is having, then Beaky grabs Bugs' shoulders and says, \\"I am going to eat Wabbits.\\" Bugs agrees to come along as soon as he ‚Äútidies up‚Äù and heads back into his rabbit hole to have a shower. Beaky stares at the Fourth wall when he says the line, \\"I think he's-a-tricking me.\\" Then Beaky pulls Bugs out of his rabbit hole. Bugs, (disguised as a girl) then pops out of his rabbit hole and says, \\"You naughty naughty boy.\\" in a feminine voice. As a result, Beaky goes all gibberish and embarrassed with a red face going, \\"Oh no no, oh no.\\" Bugs Then proceeds to whack Beaky's bottom with his towel, then as soon as Beaky reaches the ground, Bugs hides behind the rocks. Beaky comes looking for Bugs when he suddenly jumps out from behind the rocks and plays with his throat. After some heckling and trickery from Bugs, a chase ensues. Beaky manages to grab Bugs in his talons and swoops away. Bugs tickles the buzzard with one of his own tail feathers, resulting in Bugs being released and falling. There is the skeleton of a dead animal resting on the ground and, as Bugs' bottom half is actually driven into the earth, he disturbs the bones and the wildflowers around them. They all come to land around his top half, making it appear that the remains are his. Thinking he is dead, Bugs begins to sob (\\"Gruesome, isn't it?\\", he briefly confides to the audience in a Jerry Colonna-like aside). As he cries, his feet pop out of the ground; when Bugs sees them, then feels them, he laughs with relief and then suggests he knew all along that he was fine. As Bugs wanders along enjoying a carrot, Beaky leaps out and grabs him. After a struggle, the two start jitterbugging together. Bugs says, \\"Why don't we do this more often,\\" to which Beaky replies, \\"Ya mean just what we're doing tonight?\\" This is a quote of the first line of the song \\"Why Don't We Do This More Often?\\" After a 'dip', Bugs releases Beaky into a spin; the buzzard twirls like a top over to the skeleton, spins into the earth and himself ends up in the same position Bugs was earlier. He screams \\"Oh, MA!\\" and his mother shows up. At first the mother buzzard thinks Bugs did something to Beaky. Bugs assures her 'the kid' is okay, and pulls Beaky out of the ground. Seeing that Beaky is unharmed, the mother abandons her desire to eat Bugs and declares him her hero and kisses him. A blushing Bugs copies Beaky's shyness and embarrassment.

The promotion was operated by McManus' International Touring Company. WWA was one of several promotions to come into existence shortly after the closings of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The company was in existence from October 2001 to May 2003. It was considered a successor to WCW and ECW due to using most of their former talent and a predecessor to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). History WWA recruited former WCW ring announcer Jeremy Borash as booker and head of talent for its shows. He also acted as ring announcer and commentator for their shows. Borash was recommended to the WWA by Vince Russo, who was not able to work with the company as originally planned. WWA focused on signing the wrestlers that did not get signed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after the WWF-WCW merger. They aimed to fill the gap left by the demise of WCW and ECW and provide an alternative to WWF. Many popular former WWF and WCW wrestlers wrestled for the company during its nearly two-year existence. These included Jeff Jarrett, Road Dogg, Scott Steiner, Sting, Psicosis, Devon Storm, Juventud Guerrera, Rick Steiner, Jerry Lynn, Shane Douglas, Buff Bagwell, Lex Luger, Stevie Ray, Sabu and Disco Inferno. They also brought in relatively unknown wrestlers, many of whom went on to make names for themselves for other promotions like TNA. These included Low Ki, A.J. Styles, Christopher Daniels, Frankie Kazarian, Shark Boy, and Nathan Jones. Further big names like Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Randy Savage were scheduled to appear for WWA at some point but their appearances did not happen. The promotion had three in ring commissioners during its time, namely Bret Hart, Sid Vicious and Mike Sanders. =First Tour and the Inception PPV= The WWA held its first tour in October 2001, covering dates across Australia. During this time the Road Dogg defeated Jeff Jarrett to become the first WWA World Champion. However, the title was then vacated to allow for it to be competed for during a title tournament at their first PPV, the Inception. This tournament involved 4 quarterfinals matches (one of which was a battle royal), 2 semi-finals and a final held inside a steel cage. This debut PPV was held inside a full-sized arena in Sydney and production values were of a decent standard. However, the event was universally panned by the critics for being short at 2 hours overall and various matches being too short to be able to run to their full potential. The use of WCW style comic story lines also did little to endear themselves to the viewing public as a serious alternative to the WWF. Some such comic storylines involved Australian kids TV performers, The Fruits in suits (who were a parody of The Bananas in Pyjamas), interfering in matches and former WCW joke team Lenny Lane and Lodi being allowed to compete in the semi-final after an injury forced Juventud Guerrera to withdraw. The final of the title tournament saw the Road Dogg face Jeff Jarrett. Commissioner Bret Hart was at ringside for the match and interfered on a number of occasions to prevent anyone winning the match using his sharpshooter move. In the end Jarrett won the match with his trademark guitar shot and became the champion. =UK Tour= Next the WWA toured the UK in December 2001. This tour largely included the same line up as the Inception PPV tour. Additions to the card were former WCW World Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner and former WWF tag team competitor Brian Christopher. Although the events drew several thousand fans at times the WWA failed to consistently draw large crowds. The main event on this tour was usually Jeff Jarrett versus Road Dogg versus Scott Steiner for the title in a three-way dance. Jarrett successfully defended his title each time. =Revolution PPV= On February 24, 2002, the WWA held its second PPV, The Revolution. It was the promotion's first and only event to take place in the USA. This event took place in the Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas, NV. This was a smaller venue, which reflected upon the look and style of the show. Months before the event, initial advertisements plugged the reunion of Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. However, this did not happen due to both men signing contracts to return to the WWF. Then Randy Savage was advertised to be appearing in the main event against Jeff Jarrett for the WWA Heavyweight Championship. Savage backed out of the event during the weekend and this wasn't announced until the pre-show where a big red \\"X\\" and the text \\"NOT APPEARING\\" was overlaid on all images of Savage. Road Dogg, also heavily advertised for this show, did not appear either. Andrew McManus opened the show with a prepared statement in his office, confirming that Savage would not be appearing, leading to some fans feeling cheated. Bret Hart appeared after the opening match as the WWA Commissioner. He announced to the live crowd that Randy Savage was not at the show and was being replaced in the main event by Brian Christopher. An amount of significant talent was arguably underutilized on the show. Former WCW World Tag Team Champions KroniK wrestled an unknown Native-American gimmick tag team called Native Blood and defeated them in less than five minutes. Former WCW World Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner showed up, only to cut a quick promo and beat Disco Inferno in a two-minute match. Former ECW World Heavyweight Champion Jerry Lynn also made an appearance in a promo. This was a genuine surprise, as few knew he had been released from his WWF contract before his appearance on this show. Rick Steiner and Ernest Miller defeated Lenny and Lodi in a match that only lasted 58 seconds. Larry Zbyszko showed up to cut a promo on Vince McMahon challenging him to a fight and talking about Chris Jericho, who was WWF Champion at the time, saying that he stole Zbyszko's \\"Living Legend\\" moniker. He mocked Jericho by accusing him of \\"being too short to be a world champion\\", despite Zbyszko actually being shorter in height than Jericho himself. Jarrett defeated Christopher in the main event to retain the title. Eddie Guerrero became the WWA International Cruiserweight Champion by defeating Juventud Guerrera and Psicosis. =Eruption PPV and Australian Tour= In April the WWA returned to Australia for a tour and to film its third PPV, The Eruption. During this tour Nathan Jones won the WWA title after winning a 4 corners match against Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner and Brian Christopher. The Eruption PPV was held at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia. The show started with Jeff Jarrett being escorted away from the building proclaiming he would be back (Jarrett never appeared after this). It presumed this was prerecorded earlier in the week. A new Cruiserweight Champion was crowned at the show after Eddie Guerrero had returned to the WWF. A.J. Styles defeated Jerry Lynn in the tournament final to win the title. Another match of note was a cage match between Sabu and Devon Storm. Sabu won the match after leaping from the top of the cage onto Devon Storm, who was laid on top of a double deck of tables. In the main event Scott Steiner defeated Nathan Jones to win the title. He would later give up the title to sign with the WWF. A further UK and European tour was planned for after this event. The WWA postponed the tour from May 2002 to November 2002, citing injuries to its major stars as the reason. However, it is believed that poor ticket sales may be the true reason. =Retribution PPV and European Tour= The WWA toured the UK in December 2002, filming The Retribution PPV in Glasgow Scotland. The WWA title remained vacant for the first half of the tour, with it being held up to be decided at the PPV. Mike Sanders took over as commissioner for this tour and fought Joe E. Legend each night. Memorable matches on this tour included a three-way hardcore match including Sabu, Perry Saturn and Simon Diamond. Retribution was broadcast in February 2003. The card included nine matches and two title matches (WWA and TNA), but only ran for 1 hour 45 minutes. This was fifteen minutes shorter than the house show in Newcastle the night before, which only included six matches and no title matches. This tour included an infamous dispute with a seemingly badly out of shape Lex Luger. He reportedly missed shows due to illness and refused to wrestle for more than five minutes in matches, despite being in the main events. He faced Sting for the vacant WWA title at the PPV. This match was poorly received and only lasted about 7 minutes, which largely involved Luger pacing around and avoiding wrestling. Luger won this match and became WWA Champion after an interference from Jeff Jarrett with his guitar. He lost this title to Sting a few days later at a house show in Zurich, Switzerland. =Final Tour and The Reckoning PPV= In May 2003, the WWA embarked on its final tour. This visited Australia and New Zealand. The Reckoning PPV was held in Auckland in front of a vocal crowd. It was the first to include replays and split screen shots. Before the PPV the decision had been made to fold the WWA, hence the titles were to be unified with the NWA and TNA titles. Chris Sabin won a four corners cruiserweight match to unify the TNA X Division and WWA Cruiserweight titles. In the main event, Sting was defeated by NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett to unify the NWA and WWA World titles.

Maitreya-nƒÅtha (ca. 270-350 CE) is a name whose use was pioneered by Buddhist scholars Erich Frauwallner, Giuseppe Tucci, and Hakuju Ui to distinguish one of the three founders of the Yogacara school of Buddhist philosophy, along with Asanga and Vasubandhu.Being as Consciousness: YogƒÅcƒÅra Philosophy of Buddhism. Tola, Fernando and Carmen Dragonetti. Motilal Banarsidass: 2004 pg xv Some scholars believe this Maitreya to be a historical person in India. The traditions themselves have held that it is referring to Maitreya, the future buddha. Academic views Scholars are divided in opinion whether the name refers to a historical human teacher of Asa·πÖga or to the bodhisattva Maitreya.La Vall√©e Poussin, Louis de, Abhidharmakosabhasyam, Vol.1, p.15, English translation by Leo M. Pruden, Asian Humanities Press, Berkeley, California: 1991 Frauwallner, Tucci and Ui proposed this as a possibility, while Eric Obermiller and Fyodor Shcherbatskoy doubted the historicity of this figure.Ashok Kumar Chatterjee; The YogƒÅcƒÅra Idealism, page 33. Traditional view The Buddhist traditions themselves have always held that Asa·πÖga received the texts in question from Maitreya directly in the Tu·π£ita heaven. Asa·πÖga is said to have spent many years in intense meditation, during which time tradition says that he often visited Tu·π£ita to receive teachings from the Maitreya. Heavens such as Tu·π£ita are said to be accessible through meditation. Xuanzang tells the account of these events:Rongxi, Li. The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions., Numata Center, Berkeley, 1996, p. 153. Confusion over the idea of \\"supernaturally\\" visiting heavens may be due to the unfamiliarity of scholars with the Indian concept of heavens as being accessible through samƒÅdhi. Other advanced meditators recorded similar experiences of visiting Tu·π£ita Heaven at night.Sangharakshita. The Eternal Legacy: An Introduction to the Canonical Literature of Buddhism, Windhorse Publications, Birmingham, 2006, p. 248 One such example of this is Hanshan Deqing during the Ming dynasty. In his autobiography, Hanshan describes the palace of Maitreya in Tu·π£ita, and hearing a lecture given by Bodhisattva Maitreya to a large group of his disciples. Hanshan Deqing recalls the teaching given as the following: Attributed works The number of works attributed to him vary in the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism, but variously include: * the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi ≈õƒÅstra, the encyclopaedic and definitive text of the Yogacara school * the MahƒÅyƒÅnas≈´trƒÅlamkƒÅrakƒÅrikƒÅ, which presents the MahƒÅyƒÅna path from the YogƒÅcƒÅra perspective * the DharmadharmatƒÅvibhƒÅga, a short YogƒÅcƒÅra work discussing the distinction and correlation (vibhƒÅga) between phenomena (dharma) and reality (dharmatƒÅ) * the MadhyƒÅntavibhƒÅgakƒÅrikƒÅ, 112 verses that are a key work in YogƒÅcƒÅra philosophy * the Abhisamayalankara, which summarizes the Prajnaparamita s≈´tras, which the MƒÅdhyamaka school regards as presenting the ultimate truth * the RatnagotravibhƒÅga, also known as the UttƒÅratantra ≈õƒÅstra, a compendium of the Buddha-nature literature The last five works are often referred to collectively as the Five Dharmas of Maitreya, and their authorship is given variously to MaitreyanƒÅtha, Asa·πÖga or a combination thereof.

He was president of the Edmonton Art Gallery, and a noted political activist who wrote several books critical of the Canadian government and its various policies. Early life and education Hurtig was born in Edmonton, Alberta, on 24 June 1932. His parents were Jewish; his father was from Romania, and his mother from Russia. He grew up in Edmonton, was an alumnus of the Edmonton Talmud Torah,Rebeca Kuropatka, \\"Talmud Torah in Edmonton celebrating 100th anniversary,\\" The Jewish Tribune (Canada), May 10, 2012, p. 2. and graduated from high school there.\\"Canadian nationalist Mel Hurtig dies at age 84\\". Toronto Star, August 4, 2016, page A4. Businessman, publisher and author In 1956 at the age of 24 he opened a book store, Hurtig Books, on Jasper Avenue and 103rd street which later grew into a large retail book operation with three locations. His stores featured staging of plays, readings of poetry; encouraged social interaction; and unusually, permitted drinking coffee. After selling his stores in 1972, he established Hurtig Publishers Ltd., with $30,000 in borrowed money. It became \\"one of the liveliest book publishing companies in Canada.\\"\\"Mel Hurtig,\\" in Grant H. Kennedy and James B. Stanton (eds.), The Albertans (Edmonton: Lone Pine Publishing Ltd., 1981), p. 151. In 1980, he started work on The Canadian Encyclopedia, spending $12 million on a comprehensive three-volume national encyclopedia first published in 1985.\\"How Canada got an encyclopedia to call its own\\" Jane Taber, The Globe and Mail, October 7, 2010 A second edition, which took four years to complete and cost $8.5 million to produce, appeared in four volumes in 1988.Mel Hurtig, \\"Foreword to the Second Edition,\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig Publishers, 1988), vol.

C9. In September 1990, Hurtig published the five-volume Junior Encyclopedia of Canada, the first encyclopedia for young Canadians. He sold the company to McClelland & Stewart in May 1991.\\"Mel Hurtig\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia Hurtig was an Officer of the Order of Canada, was granted honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from six Canadian universities, and was the recipient of the Lester B. Pearson Man of the Year Peace Award. Politics In 1967 Hurtig became interested in politics when the Liberal Party was looking for a new leader and ended up supporting Pierre Trudeau's bid for Liberal leadership. In 1972 he ran as a Liberal in the federal riding of Edmonton West and finished second to longtime incumbent Marcel Lambert. In 1973, he left the Library party and joined with other nationalists including Walter Gordon, Jack McClelland, and Claude Ryan to establish the Committee for an Independent Canada (CIC) which lobbied against foreign ownership and cultural imperialism. He served as Chair for the first year. In 1985, Hurtig established the Council of Canadians, another nationalist organization, five years after the demise of the CIC. The primary purpose of this organization was to lobby against a perceived rising tide of support for free trade. He considered his establishment of the Council as the act he was \\"most proud of.\\"\\"Hurtig, Mel,\\" in Edmond Y. Lipsitz (ed.), Canadian Jewry Today: Who‚Äôs Who in Canadian Jewry (Downsivew, Ontario: J.E.S.L. Educational Products, 1989), p. 150. He would leave in 1992 but the council survives to this day, albeit with a mission of social, environmental, and economic justice rather than nationalism.Council of Canadians website In 1992, Hurtig was elected leader of the National Party of Canada and led it in the 1993 federal election. He ran in the riding of Edmonton Northwest, but with 4507 votes and 12.8 per cent of the popular vote, finished a distant third to Anne McLellan. It was nonetheless the best showing of the National Party candidates in that election. =Electoral record= Death In 2005, Hurtig moved from Edmonton to Vancouver, British Columbia, in order to be closer to his four daughters. On 3 August 2016 he died there at a hospital, from complications from pneumonia. On the day of his death, one daughter, Leslie Hurtig, read him \\"newspaper headlines about the launch of the inquiry into murdered and missing women\\"; he responded, \\"Bravo\\", and died that afternoon, surrounded by family. In addition to his daughters, Hurtig was survived by four grandsons.

It is part of the outer west suburbs of Durban. History Hillcrest was formerly a sleepy village, governed by its own Town Board on the outskirts of Durban that has now become a booming suburb incorporated into the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality. Hill Crest (as the town's name was variously spelt until 1969) was founded on a rise in the main road from Durban to Pietermaritzburg in 1895 as a farming or \\"weekend\\" village, then a good distance from what was the emerging port of Port Natal. The village was laid out as leasehold sites on a portion of the farm Albinia owned by William Gillitt, one of the main pioneer families of the area and after which the nearby suburb of Gillitts is named. One of the other early families to set up in the area was the Acutts who had already established the well known in Durban estate agents firm of that name. In 1903 the first school in the village was established in a wood and iron cottage in Hospital Road leased to a Mrs McMillian, the principal of the first Highbury School, by Horace Acutt. When the first Hillcrest Health Committee was established in 1943, the total all-race population was 1135 persons and only the Main Road was hardened. Nkutu Road was hardened with klinker in 1947 and this was followed in 1951 with the hardening of the first portion of Inanda Road. In 1962 blacktopping of selected roads in the central area began, followed by further roads in 1965. By 1971, when Town Board status was obtained, the total population had grown to 2799 persons. The Hillcrest Waste Water Treatment Plant was finally established in the 1990s, then serving only the central commercial area of the village with phased extensions planned in time, with other areas continuing on septic tanks. The town celebrated its centenary in 1995 and has since then seen an incredible increase in inhabitants migrating from more central areas in Durban Hillcrest Today Hillcrest formerly known as crestESKE lost its independent Town Board status in 1996 and was made subject to administration by the Outer West Local Council - a substructure council of the then Durban Unicity. In 2000, the Outer West Local Council, along with other local councils, was disestablished and were replaced by the single eThekwini Municipality encompassing the entire Durban metropolitan area. The suburb of Hillcrest experienced a building boom in the late 1990s and 2000s with the construction of many gated communities and shopping centres.

The text was originally composed in Sanskrit, likely between the middle of the third century and no later than 433 CE.Takasaki (1966), Authorship is uncertain, the Tibetan tradition states it was taught by the Bodhisattva Maitreya and transmitted via Asanga, while the Chinese tradition states it was written by a certain SƒÅramati. Modern scholarship favors SƒÅramati. The text and its commentary are also preserved in Tibetan and Chinese translations. The RatnagotravibhƒÅga describes the gotra or \\"lineage\\" of the buddhas, which is the buddha-nature present in all beings. It is a Yogacara text particularly popular in East Asian Yogacara. History =Authorship= The text is attributed to a certain SƒÅramati (Â®ëÂõâÊú´Â∫ï) in the earlier Chinese tradition, while the Tibetan tradition considers the verse portion to have been composed by Maitreya-nƒÅtha and the prose commentary by Asanga. Ruegg suggests that the Chinese and Tibetan traditions may be reconciled by understanding the name given in Chinese sources as an epithet for Maitreya. The case for the involvement of Maitreya-nƒÅtha is also strengthened by the discovery of a Sanskrit fragment of the RatnagotravibhƒÅga in Saka script which mentions Maitreya-nƒÅtha as the author of the 'root' (m≈´la) verses.V.H. Bailey & E.H. Johnston, \\"A Fragment of the Uttratantra in Sanskrit\\", BSOS 8 (1935-37) p77-89 The question of authorship may possibly be resolved by an analysis of the structure of this multi-layered text. Takasaki Takasaki 1966: p. 62 is certain that the author of the embedded commentary is SƒÅramati through his comparison of the RGV with the DharmadhƒÅtvavi≈õe·π£a≈õƒÅstra.Takasaki, Jikido (1966).

It later came to have the meaning of \\"destiny\\", particularly in Yogacara literature. \\"Another division of lineage is into prak·πõtisthagotra (naturally present) and samudƒÅnƒ´tagotra (developed). According to the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi≈õƒÅstra, the former refers to one's innate potential for spiritual achievement; the latter refers to the specific individual habits one can develop that will help speed the mastery of that potential.\\" The RatnagotravibhƒÅga describes the gotra of the buddhas, which is the buddha-nature present in all beings. Nugteren contextualizes the Buddhist 'inheritance' of the term gotra from the wider tradition, where Sanskrit gotra literally means \\"cowshed\\". Gotra evolved in Buddhism to first different spiritual lineages one of which (rather controversially within the broader tradition) according to their spiritual predisposition and constitution were doomed to cycle endlessly in the wheel of sa·πÉsƒÅra without the intervention of a bodhisattva, that is they would never attain bodhi of their own volition, that doctrine in turn eventually evolved into the doctrine of Jina.Ruegg, D.

According to Hookam, there is no evidence that the work was associated with Maitreya before the time of Maitripa and modern scholarship favors the view of the Chinese tradition which states that the work was composed by a certain Saramati (3rd-4th century CE).Hookham, S.

Interpretation =Doctrinal significance= Final teaching The secondary title for this work, Uttaratantra≈õƒÅstra, highlights the text's claim that the tathƒÅgatagarbha or buddha-nature teachings represent the final, definitive teachings of the Buddha, in contrast to the earlier teachings on emphasizing intrinsic emptiness, such as contained in the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ sutras and other Mahayana sutras. In addition to the group of scriptures known as the Tathagatagarbha sutras, this work is the cornerstone of the tathƒÅgatagarbha trend of thought in Mahayana Buddhism. Buddha-nature The Ratnagotravibhaga is notable for its exploration of the doctrine of the buddha nature, the view that all sentient beings are already buddhas or have the propensity to attain buddhahood.Mathes, Klaus-Dieter (2008). A Direct Path to the Buddha Within: G√∂ LotsƒÅwa's MahƒÅmudra Interpretation of the RatnagotravibhƒÅga. Somerville, MA, USA: Wisdom Publications, Inc. (pbk.:alk.paper): p.1 The Uttaratantra takes as its key topic the idea of the dhƒÅtus of the Buddha present in all beings: Completion of sunyata Within tathagatagarbha literature a completion of sunyata (emptiness) theory and an emphasising of metaphysics and mysticism can be found: The Uttaratantra constitutes a higher Buddhist doctrine than that of sunyata as found in the prajnaparamita sutras: Positive understanding of sunyata Both the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ Si·πÉhanƒÅda S≈´tra and the RatnagotravibhƒÅga enunciate the idea that the buddha-nature is possessed of four transcendental qualities: # Permanence # Bliss # Self # Purity The buddha-nature is ultimately identifiable as the dharmakƒÅya. These elevated qualities make of the Buddha one to whom devotion and adoration could be given: \\"Here there is an elevation and adoration of Buddha and his attributes, which could be a significant basis for Mahayana devotionalism.\\"C.D. Sebastian, Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism, 2005, p. 21 =Exegetical tradition= Notable exegetes of the RatnagotravibhƒÅga have been Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, G√∂ Lotsawa Zh√∂nnu-pel, Gyaltsab Je, and Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso, amongst others.

Dzogchen view =Seven Diamond Points= The Three Jewels contains a synthesis of sugatagarbha literature into five chapters that distill seven 'diamond points' (vajrapada): # 'Buddha' (Sanskrit: ; Wylie: sangs-rgyas; Chinese:) # 'Dharma' (Sanskrit: Wylie: chos; Chinese:) # 'Sa·πÉgha' (Sanskrit: ga·πáa;For a related amplification of the term 'gana' as \\"community\\" within the tradition refer: ganacakra. Wylie: dge-'dun; Chinese:) # 'Essence' (Sanskrit: dhƒÅtu; Wylie: khams; Chinese:) # 'Awakened' (Sanskrit: bodhi; Wylie: bya√±-chub; Chinese:) # 'Qualities' (Sanskrit: guna; Wylie: yon-tan; Chinese:) # 'Activities' (Sanskrit: karman; Wylie: phyin-las' Chinese:) In the tantric twilight language of correspondence the Three Jewels of Sangha, Dharma and Buddha are identified as the Three Vajras (and qualities and activities).Bucknell, Roderick & Stuart-Fox, Martin (1986). The Twilight Language: Explorations in Buddhist Meditation and Symbolism. Curzon Press: London. According to Namkhai Norbu,Namkhai Norbuet. al. 1991, 2001: p. 176 all five of these, body (sku), voice (gsung), mind (thugs), qualities (yon tan), activities (phrin las), constitute a mindstream or 'continuum of being' of either a sentient being (with adventitious obscurations) or a buddha (without adventitious obscurations).Norbu, Namkhai (1991, 2001). The Precious Vase: Instructions on the Base of Santi Maha Sangha. Shang Shung Edizioni. Second revised edition, p.176. (Translated from the Tibetan, edited and annotated by Adriano Clemente with the help of the author. Translated from Italian into English by Andy Lukianowicz.) =Everlasting element= The \\"ratnagotra\\" (lineal jewel, gem lineage) is a synonym for the buddha nature, the 'element' which is \\"as it is\\", the 'everlasting' aspect of the continuum of being, the aspect that is constant and 'unsullied'. In Dzogchen technical language, 'primordial purity' (Wylie: ka dag), which is none other than the 'one taste' (ro gcig) of the 'gnosis of commonality/egality' . This is metaphorically 'twilighted' in the RGV as dhruva \\"pole star\\". From the vantage of the Northern Hemisphere of Earth, the pole star is apt because day or night it is always in the sky, hence constant, immutable and fixed, but not necessarily visible. The pole star appears not to move but the heavenly bodies revolve around it as though it is a fixed 'point' (Sanskrit: bindu). Just as the pole star is not truly fixed in the sky, the 'everlasting' aspect is not eternal, and should be understood as subject to the Catu·π£ko·π≠i which is employed in the RGV. The 'essence', the 'element', the 'ratnagotra' must not be essentialized. Rather than the term 'eternal' or 'everlasting' which smacks of 'eternalism' (Pali: sassatavada) anathemic to Buddhadharma, a continuum spontaneously 'self-emergent' (rang shar) is sound . =Essence, nature and power= An important Dzogchen doctrinal view on the Sugatagarbha qua 'Base' (gzhi) Duckworth, 2008 that foregrounds this is 'essence' (ngo bo), 'nature' (rang bzhin) and 'power' (thugs rje): * Essence is openness or emptiness (ngo bo pa), * Nature is luminosity, lucidity or clarity , * Power is universal compassionate energy (thugs rje kun khyab), unobstructed (ma 'gags pa).Petit, John Whitney (1999).

Merrie Melodies theatrical animated short. The short was released on August 21, 1948, and features Bugs Bunny. The title is a play on the nursery rhyme Hot Cross Buns as well as a punny allusion to the basic plot premise.  Summary  Bugs is \\"Experimental Rabbit #46\\" in the Eureka Hospital Experimental Laboratory, Paul Revere Foundation (which sports the slogan 'Hardly a man is now alive' in punning allusion to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\"). Bugs lives a pampered life, oblivious to the fact that a scientist plans on switching his brain (or at least his personality, since no surgery is involved) with that of a chicken. After giving Bugs an examination (including a joke when Bugs reads the microscopic \\"Allied Trades Council\\" union disclaimer on an eye chart when told to read the bottom line), the scientist brings him out to the operating theater, in front of an audience of fellow doctors. Bugs thinks he's been brought out to perform. He pulls out all the stops, singing, dancing, scatting (a la Danny Kaye), comedy routines (including his impression of Lionel Barrymore), and magic acts. Upon finishing each act, he looks around to see the unimpressed, stern-faced doctors in exactly the same frame position each time (\\"What a tough audience! It ain't like St. Joe!\\"). The scientist attempts to retrieve Bugs, but is pushed away. He strikes Bugs with a hammer while the rabbit is in the middle of a scat routine, but Bugs quickly revives and, having failed as the entertainment, becomes a vendor instead, selling hot dogs to the scientists, only to be hammered again. Learning the scientist's intentions, Bugs runs and a chase ensues. Bugs hides in a closet, not noticing a skeleton in there, and comes out scared when he does see it. Then, when chased into the laboratory, he makes an ostensibly explosive cocktail and threatens the scientist with it, saying: \\"One more step and I'll blow ya up! This contains manganese, phosphorus, nitrate, lactic acid, and dextrose!\\" The scientist laughingly dismisses the threat, telling Bugs the aforementioned ingredients are the formula for a chocolate malt. Then he hides near an oxygen tent disguised as a Boy Scout, leading the scientist in the wrong direction. Finally, Bugs is rendered helpless with laughing gas and placed on the table, with metallic mind-switching caps placed on him and the rather uninterested- looking chicken. At the last minute, he switches the electrodes (though it is revealed at the end that Bugs cut the wire connecting to his electrode instead) and the scientist ends up clucking like a chicken, while the chicken (with the scientist's mind) states in plain English he hopes that the experiment can be reversed. Bugs tells the audience: \\"Looks like Doc is a victim of fowl play!\\" and laughs.

In 1957, she won the Nationaal Songfestival for the second time in a row, and represented the Netherlands again in the Eurovision Song Contest 1957. Her entry \\"Net als toen\\", written by Willy van Hemert and composed by Guus Jansen, received most points from the international juries and gave the Netherlands its first win in the competition. In 1958, Brokken won the Nationaal Songfestival once again, this time with the song \\"Heel de wereld\\". In the international final, held in Hilversum, Netherlands, her entry finished in last place with only one point.

He later married one of the daughters of the Earl of Rutland; he had one son, also named Sackville, born around 1636 and who died in 1706. Early in 1617 he secured a reversionary lease of the former Perrot lordship of Laugharne from Charles, Prince of Wales which grant fell in on the death of the countess of Northumberland in April 1619 and he took up residence there. He was a Member of Parliament for Hastings in the 1625 Parliament (the \\"Useless Parliament\\") and for Bramber in the 1628-9 Parliament. He was Treasurer of the Navy from 5 April 1627 to 21 January 1630; on 8 July 1627 he was created a baronet. The King nominated Sir Sackville to be ambassador at Constantinople on 19 November 1633 during the personal rule. Royal instructions were delivered on 14 July 1638. In 1636 he obtained a share of a lease on the Crown's ironworks in the Forest of Dean for twenty-one years, which he later tried to sell; this caused some great legal trouble, and had to be brought before Parliament. Nonetheless it did not prevent Sir Sackville sailing for Constantinople in October 1638. He later served as the Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire; it is not recorded when he was sent to Constantinople, but in April 1642 the records of the House of Commons already mention objections being made to his \\"meddling\\" by the Levant Company. By 1646 they had progressed to formally requesting a letter of withdrawal be sent, citing his \\"seizing the Estates, and imprisoning the Factors and Servants, of the said Company, at Constantinople and Smyrna\\". Crowe was recalled after nearly a decade by Parliament in January 1647. Perhaps the ambassador had not received news of Royalist defeat because he did not finally depart until 23 November. He was brought back in April 1648, as a prisoner in the ship Margaret and consigned to the Tower of London to await trial. In March 1652 he was bailed on a ¬£2000 bond; by September 1658 the Levant Company had dropped all charges and he petitioned the Lords to annul his restraints.

The hospital is part of the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, which also runs services at Barnet Hospital, Chase Farm Hospital and a number of other sites. The trust is a founder member of the UCLPartners academic health science centre. History =Early history= Former site on Gray's Inn Road, subsequently the Eastman Dental Hospital The Royal Free Hospital was founded in 1828 by the surgeon William Marsden to provide, as its name indicates, free care to those of little means. It is said that one evening, Marsden found a young girl lying on the steps of St. Andrew Church, Holborn, dying from disease and hunger and sought help for her from one of the nearby hospitals. However, none would take the girl in and she died two days later. After this experience Marsden set up a small dispensary at 16 Greville Street, Holborn, called the London General Institution for the Gratuitous Care of Malignant Diseases. A royal charter was granted by Queen Victoria in 1837 after a cholera epidemic in which the hospital had extended care to many victims, following which it became the Royal Free Hospital. As demand for in- patient facilities increased, it was constituted as the Royal Free Hospital, and moved to the former barracks of the Light Horse Volunteers in Gray's Inn Road in August 1842.Lynne A. Amidon, Illustrated History of the Royal Free Hospital (London: Special Trustees of the Royal Free Hospital, 1996) The north wing of the former barracks, which was rebuilt and renamed the Sussex Wing after Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, a benefactor of the hospital, re-opened in 1856 and the south wing, which was rebuilt and renamed the Victoria Wing after Queen Victoria, re-opened in 1879. Meanwhile the western elevation on Gray‚Äôs Inn Road, which was rebuilt and renamed the Alexandra Building after the Princess of Wales, was re-opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales in July 1895. Some additional land was purchased and used to develop the Helena Building, named after Princess Helena: the building was completed in 1915 and served as the Royal Free Military Hospital for officers during the latter stages of the First World War before become the maternity wing after the war. The Eastman Dental Clinic opened in a building adjacent to the main hospital in 1929. The Victoria Wing was badly damaged by a V-1 flying bomb in July 1944 during the Second World War. =Royal Free disease= In 1955 an apparent outbreak of an infectious illness, involving fever and subsequent persisting fatigue along with other symptoms, affected 292 members of staff and forced the hospital's closure between 25 July and 5 October. There was subsequently some debate as to whether the episode was of an infectious cause, or just an example of mass hysteria. The outbreak turned out to be a notable case in the UK of myalgic encephalomyelitis and resulted in the coining of that disease name. =Move to Hampstead= The Royal Free viewed from Parliament Hill, London. By the late 1960s the site on Gray‚Äôs Inn Road had become too cramped, and a modern 12-storey cruciform tower block was built on the site of the former Hampstead Fever Hospital in Pond Street in Hampstead in 1974; it was opened by the Queen in 1978. Meanwhile the Eastman Dental Hospital took over the whole of the Gray‚Äôs Inn Road site. The Royal Free was the first hospital in the UK to appoint a consultant in HIV medicine, in 1989. Professor Margaret Johnson, a specialist in thoracic medicine, built the Royal Free Centre for HIV Medicine, which is at the forefront of treatment of HIV- AIDS. The out-patients' centre was opened in 1992 by the actor Sir Ian McKellen and is named after the actor Ian Charleson. =MMR vaccine controversy= In February 1998, the Royal Free held a press conference to coincide with the publication in The Lancet of a paper by Andrew Wakefield who claimed to have found a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This started a controversy which led to a crisis in public confidence over MMR and a fall in uptake of the vaccine. Wakefield left the medical school in October 2001 and was later struck off the UK medical register by the General Medical Council following an investigation by The Sunday Times newspaper into the MMR issue. = Education = For a long time, the Royal Free was the only London hospital allowing women to study medicine, forming an association with the London School of Medicine for Women, under which women from the school completed their clinical studies at the hospital, from 1877. Under the Deanship of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, one of the school's founders, it became part of the University of London and in 1896 became known as the London Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine for Women. In 1998 it merged with the University College Hospital's medical school to form the Royal Free and University College Medical School, renamed the UCL Medical School in 2008.  Facilities  The Royal Free Hospital has a high-level isolation unit equipped to treat highly infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease. In 2014, the British nurse William Pooley was successfully treated for Ebola virus disease at the unit. In December 2014, Pauline Cafferkey, a British health worker diagnosed with Ebola in Glasgow was transferred to the unit for treatment. The unit has also previously been used to treat a patient with Crimean‚ÄìCongo hemorrhagic fever. Significant advances in the fields of liver medicine (hepatology) and transplantation; renal disease and dialysis; haematology and haemophilia have been made at the Royal Free, and the trust now treats all patients needing dialysis in north and central London. The department of liver medicine is recognised as one of the leading research units of its type in the world: it was founded by Professor Dame Sheila Sherlock. Performance The hospital was rated 'good' by the Care Quality Commission in September 2017. In a report of the Care Quality Commission completed in May 2019, Royal Free Hospital's overall surgical safety rating was downgraded from ‚Äúgood‚Äù to ‚Äúrequires improvement‚Äù, due to a ‚Äúlarge number‚Äù of ‚Äúnever events‚Äù ‚Äî incidents so serious they should never have happened ‚Äî which were partially related to ‚Äúpoor behaviours‚Äù by a few consultants at the Royal Free London NHS Trust and failures of the Trust's management.

The company is best known for producing a wide range of hardware and peripherals for home computers in the 1980s, for example replacement keyboards for the ZX Spectrum, the PlusD disk interface (originally designed and sold by Miles Gordon Technology) and the Action Replay series of video game cheating devices. Datel was founded by Mike Connors, who still runs the company and has been mentioned in The Sunday Times as one of the UK's top thousand richest people.  History  =1980s= Datel started off selling AM CB radio transceivers in the UK. These AM-band radios were made illegal in the UK and even the importing of them was deemed illegal. Datel then started to import the CB radios in component form and build them up. The company started to manufacture products related to home computers that were popular in the 1980s such as the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Such devices included light pens and memory expansion. One of their first commercial successes was joystick interfaces for the ZX Spectrum. The greatest commercial success of Datel was the Action Replay, first for the Commodore 64 and then the Commodore Amiga. The Commodore 64 version was designed by Richard Bond, with six versions ultimately developed in all. The Commodore Amiga version was authored by two German students, Olaf Boehm and Joerg Zanger, who had been inspired by the earlier Commodore 64 version. The Commodore 64 and Amiga Action Replays included the ability to save the entire contents of a home computer's memory to floppy disk or compact audio cassette, and then to reload very quickly. This proved extremely popular with people, especially when the Commodore 64 could take 20 minutes to load a game from notoriously unreliable tape. It also did not escape people's attention that could use Action Replays to copy games. The name Action Replay referred to the fact that could instantly restart a game from the position that had saved it. Another feature the Amiga and Commodore 64 versions had in common was the ability to add POKEs, or cheats. They also had a system for finding pokes called a Pokefinder, or trainer. =1990s= During the 1990s, many companies that had been successful in the 1980s started to struggle. Miles Gordon technology sold their PlusD drive to Datel to assist their ailing SAM Coup√© project. The OCP Art Studio painting software was also successful, in part due to the bundled mouse, which was a novelty on 8-bit systems. During the mid-'90s, home computers, which were almost exclusively used for games, started to be replaced by video game consoles. Datel took the Pokes and Pokefinder features of the earlier Action Replays and created Action Replay for the Sega Mega Drive. This was followed shortly after by the Action Replay Pro, which used a superior system sometimes referred to as RAM stuffing. This, combined with a built-in Trainer, allowed users to easily find their own codes. The Action Replay was in competition for some time with Codemasters' Game Genie, which was distributed by Galoob. At first, Codemasters tried to protect the Game Genie as they had filed a patent on cartridge cheat devices, Datel defended this by saying that they had been cheating at games since long before the Game Genie existed. Action Replay improved on the Game Genie's functionality by adding an enable/disable switch. The cheat codes, at the time, were published in a more logical hexadecimal format compared with Codemasters' obfuscated system. This meant that users, along with the trainer, could make their own cheat codes. Ultimately Codemasters and Galoob dropped the Game Genie entirely leaving Datel as the only cheat device manufacturer in the world. Datel initially struggled to maintain a presence in the North American market, but in late 1995 they signed a deal with InterAct Accessories. InterAct took over the production and distribution of Datel's new cheat devices for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in North America, allowing Datel's products to reach the major retail chains for the first time. =2000s= After numerous unsuccessful attempts at breaking into the huge USA market, Datel finally started dealing with Interact Accessories with a new name, the GameShark. The GameShark was hugely successful. By now Datel had produced dozens of cheat devices for numerous systems. The most successful being the ones for the Game Boy, and the PlayStations 1 and 2. Interact, the distributors for GameShark, went out of business in 2005 and their parent company sold the GameShark brand name to Mad Catz for US$5 million. Currently Datel are selling that product under their Action Replay brand. Datel, creators of the Max Media Dock line, also makes hard drive add-ons and wireless adapters for PSP, Nintendo DS and Wii. There is an active homebrew community surrounding the Max Media Dock for Nintendo DS. In 2008, the company released the Wii Freeloader, which allows users to circumvent regional lockout on the Wii video game console. In 2009 the TurboFire was released for the PS3. It has a modified design and offers turbo functions for the buttons. Unlike most aftermarket controllers the TurboFire uses Bluetooth and connects wirelessly to the PS3 without the need for an adapter. Datel operates the TV station Max TV, on Sky Digital, Channel 675. =Legal= In the 1990s, Sony filed a lawsuit in California court against Datel Electronics and Interact Accessories. Datel had allegedly logged on using Interact Accessories' Sony developer user name and password and accessed official developer software from an IP that resolved to datel.co.uk. The case was settled out of court. In early 2009, Sony filed a suit against Datel for its Lite Blue Tool. The product was a sequel to the Datel Tool battery, which acted like a Pandora battery which caused a Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP) to enter into Jigkick or Factory programming mode, allowing the execution of the boot code from a removable storage. The Lite Blue tool compensated for the fact that the new factory mode was encrypted. Datel withdrew this product shortly after action was announced. On 20 November 2009, Datel filed a legal complaint against Microsoft in the Northern District of California for violations of ¬ß¬ß1‚Äì2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and ¬ß3 of the Clayton Antitrust Act; for unfair competition; and for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. In response Microsoft has filed patent infringement suits over the styling of their wildfire controllers.

He was an influential scholar on the subjects of terrorism and political violence. Biography Walter Laqueur was born in Breslau, Lower Silesia, Germany (today Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), into a Jewish family. In 1938, he left Germany, immigrating to the British Mandate of Palestine. His parents, who were unable to leave, were murdered in the Holocaust. After a year of study at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Laqueur joined a kibbutz and worked as an agricultural laborer from 1939 to 1944.Biography Between 1939 and 1944, he lived at Kibbutz Sha'ar HaGolan, Kibbutz Ein Shemer, and, as a member, Kibbutz HaZore'a. In 1955, Laqueur moved to London. Laqueur died at his home in Washington, D.C., on 30 September 2018. Journalism and academic career From 1944, when he moved to Jerusalem, until his departure in 1955 he worked as a journalist for the Hashomer Hatzair newspaper, Mishmar (later, Al HaMishmar),Walter Laqueur, obituary and for The Palestine Post (later, The Jerusalem Post). In addition, he was the Middle East correspondent for journals in the United States and a commentator on world politics for Israel radio. After moving to London, Laqueur founded and edited Soviet Survey, a journal focusing on Soviet and East European culture. Survey was one of the numerous publications of the CIA-funded Congress for Cultural Freedom. He was Director of the Institute of Contemporary History and the Wiener Library in London from 1965 to 1994. He was founder and editor, with George Mosse, of the Journal of Contemporary History. From 1969 he was a member, and later Chairman (until 2000), of the International Research Council of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington. He was also founding editor of The Washington Papers. He was Professor of the History of Ideas at Brandeis University from 1968 to 1972, and University Professor at Georgetown University from 1976 to 1988. He was also a visiting professor of history and government at Harvard, the University of Chicago, Tel Aviv University and Johns Hopkins University. Laqueur wrote extensively about the middle east, the German Youth Movement, Zionism, the cultural history of the Weimar Republic, Communism and the Soviet Union, the Holocaust, the Cold War, fascism, post-WW2 Europe and the decline of Europe. He pioneered the study of guerrilla warfare and terrorism. After the fall of the Soviet Union, he accurately predicted that Russia would not become a democracy but an authoritarian system based on nationalist populism. His books have been translated into many languages. His articles on international affairs appeared in many American and European newspapers and periodicals.

Laqueur"},{"id":"1250193","text":"Charles Cunningham Boycott (12 March 1832 ‚Äì 19 June 1897) was an English land agent whose ostracism by his local community in Ireland gave the English language the verb \\"to boycott\\". He had served in the British Army 39th Foot, which brought him to Ireland. After retiring from the army, Boycott worked as a land agent for Lord Erne, a landowner in the Lough Mask area of County Mayo. In 1880, as part of its campaign for the Three Fs (fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale) and specifically in resistance to proposed evictions on the estate, local activists of the Irish National Land League encouraged Boycott's employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest the crops on Lord Erne's estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some were threatened with violence to ensure compliance. The campaign against Boycott became a in the British press after he wrote a letter to The Times. Newspapers sent correspondents to the West of Ireland to highlight what they viewed as the victimisation of a servant of a peer of the realm by Irish nationalists. Fifty Orangemen from County Cavan and County Monaghan travelled to Lord Erne's estate to harvest the crops, while a regiment of the 19th Royal Hussars and more than 1,000 men of the Royal Irish Constabulary were deployed to protect the harvesters. The episode was estimated to have cost the British government and others at least ¬£10,000 to harvest about ¬£500 worth of crops. Boycott left Ireland on 1 December 1880, and in 1886, became land agent for Hugh Adair's Flixton estate in Suffolk. He died at the age of 65 on 19 June 1897 in his home in Flixton, after an illness earlier that year. Early life and family St Mary's church at Burgh St Peter in Norfolk, where Boycott's father William Boycott was vicar, and where Charles Boycott is buried Charles Cunningham Boycott was born in 1832 to Reverend William Boycatt and his wife Georgiana.Boycott, (1997) p. 4 He grew up in the village of Burgh St Peter in Norfolk, England; the Boycatt family had lived in Norfolk for almost 150 years. They were of Huguenot origin, and had fled from France in 1685 when Louis XIV revoked civil and religious liberties to French Protestants. Charles Boycott was named Boycatt in his baptismal records. The family changed the spelling of its name from Boycatt to Boycott in 1841.Marlow, (1973) pp. 13‚Äì14 Boycott was educated at a boarding school in Blackheath, London.Boycott, (1997) pp. 84‚Äì85 He was interested in the military‚Äîand in 1848, entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in hopes of serving in the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners. He was discharged from the academy in 1849 after failing a periodic exam, and the following year his family bought him a commission in the 39th Foot regiment for ¬£450.Marlow, (1973) p. 18 Boycott's regiment transferred to Belfast shortly after his arrival.Boycott, (1997) pp. 89‚Äì95 Six months later, it was sent to Newry before marching to Dublin, where it remained for a year. In 1852, Boycott married Anne Dunne in St Paul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin. He was ill between August 1851 and February 1852 and sold his commission the following year, but decided to remain in Ireland. He leased a farm in County Tipperary, where he acted as a landlord on a small scale.Marlow, (1973) pp. 19‚Äì27 Life on Achill Island The former house of Charles Boycott on Achill Island. The house has been modernised and renovated since Boycott's time. After receiving an inheritance, Boycott was persuaded by his friend, Murray McGregor Blacker, a local magistrate, to move to Achill Island, a large island off the coast of County Mayo.Marlow, (1973) pp. 29‚Äì43 McGregor Blacker agreed to sublet of land belonging to the Irish Church Mission Society on Achill to Boycott, who moved there in 1854. According to Joyce Marlow in the book, Captain Boycott and the Irish, Boycott's life on the island was difficult initially, and in Boycott's own words it was only after \\"a long struggle against adverse circumstances\\" that he became prosperous. With money from another inheritance and profits from farming, he built a large house near Dooagh.Boycott, (1997) p. 95 Boycott was involved in a number of disputes while on Achill. Two years after his arrival, he was unsuccessfully sued for assault by Thomas Clarke, a local man. Clarke said that he had gone to Boycott's house because Boycott owed him money. He said that he had asked for repayment of the debt, and that Boycott had refused to pay him and told him to go away, which Clarke refused to do. Clarke alleged that Boycott approached him and said: \\"If you do not be off, I will make you.\\" Clarke later withdrew his allegations, and said that Boycott did not actually owe him any money. Both Boycott and McGregor Blacker were involved in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr, the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate, from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands, and Mr O'Donnell, Carr's bailiff. The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott's candidates won. Carr was also the local receiver of wrecks, which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver had a right to a percentage of the sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr wrote a letter to the Official Receiver of Wrecks stating that Boycott and his men had illegally broken up a wreck and moved the salvage to Boycott's property. In response to this accusation, Boycott sued Carr for libel and claimed ¬£500 in damages. Life in Lough Mask before controversy A map of the area around Lough Mask In 1873, Boycott moved to Lough Mask House, owned by Lord Erne, four miles (6 km) from Ballinrobe in County Mayo.Marlow, (1973) pp. 59‚Äì70 Lord Erne, the third Earl Erne, was a wealthy landowner who lived in Crom Castle in County Fermanagh.Boycott, (1997) p. 212 He owned of land in Ireland, of which 31,389 were in County Fermanagh, 4,826 in County Donegal, 1,996 in County Sligo, and 2,184 in County Mayo. Lord Erne also owned properties in Dublin. Boycott agreed to be Lord Erne's agent for he owned in County Mayo. One of Boycott's responsibilities was to collect rents from tenant farmers on the land, for which he earned of the total rent due to Lord Erne, which was ¬£500 each year. In his roles as farmer and agent, Boycott employed numerous local people as labourers, grooms, coachmen, and house- servants. Joyce Marlow wrote that Boycott had become set in his mode of thought, and that his twenty years on Achill had \\"...strengthened his innate belief in the divine right of the masters, and the tendency to behave as he saw fit, without regard to other people's point of view or feelings.\\" During his time in Lough Mask before the controversy began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which may have contributed to his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.Marlow, (1973) pp. 133‚Äì142 Lough Mask affair =Historical background= Michael Davitt by Napoleon Sarony 1882Charles Stewart ParnellIn the nineteenth century, agriculture was the biggest industry in Ireland.Collins, (1993) pp. 19‚Äì35 In 1876, the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the land in Ireland. The survey found that almost all land was the property of just 10,000 people, or 0.2% of the population. The majority were small landlords, but the 750 richest landlords owned half of the country between them. Many of the richest were absentee landlords who lived in Britain or elsewhere in Ireland, and paid agents like Charles Boycott to manage their estates. Landlords generally divided their estates into smaller farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, and could be evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller‚Äîon average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06‚Äì0.20 km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, who worked on the land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society. In the 1850s, some tenant farmers formed associations to demand the three Fs: fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale.Collins, (1993) pp. 72‚Äì79 In the 1870s, the Fenians tried to organise the tenant farmers in County Mayo to resist eviction. They mounted a demonstration against a local landlord in Irishtown and succeeded in getting him to lower his rents. Michael Davitt was the son of a small tenant farmer in County Mayo who became a journalist and joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He was arrested and given a 15-year sentence for gun-running. Charles Stewart Parnell, then Member of Parliament for Meath and member of the Home Rule League, arranged to have Davitt released on probation. When Davitt returned to County Mayo, he was impressed by the Fenians' attempts to organise farmers. He thought that the \\"land question\\" was the best way to get the support of the farmers for Irish independence. In October 1879, after forming the Land League of Mayo, Davitt formed the Irish National Land League. The Land League's aims were to reduce rents and to stop evictions, and in the long term, to make tenant farmers owners of the land they farmed. Davitt asked Parnell to become the leader of the league. In 1880, Parnell was also elected leader of the Home Rule Party. =Parnell's speech in Ennis= On 19 September 1880, Parnell gave a speech in Ennis, County Clare to a crowd of Land League members.Collins, (1993) p. 81 He asked the crowd, \\"What do you do with a tenant who bids for a farm from which his neighbour has been evicted?\\" The crowd responded, \\"kill him\\", \\"shoot him\\". Parnell replied:Hachey et al, (1996) pp. 119 This speech set out the Land League's powerful weapon of social ostracism, which was first used against Charles Boycott. =Community action= The Land League was very active in the Lough Mask area, and one of the local leaders, Father John O'Malley, had been involved in the labourer's strike in August 1880. The following month Lord Erne's tenants were due to pay their rents. He had agreed to a 10 per cent reduction owing to a poor harvest, but all except two of his tenants demanded a 25 per cent reduction. Boycott said that he had written to Lord Erne, and that Erne had refused to accede to the tenants' demands. He then issued demands for the outstanding rents, and obtained eviction notices against eleven tenants. Three days after Parnell's speech in Ennis, a process server and seventeen members of the Royal Irish Constabulary began the attempt to serve Boycott's eviction notices. Legally, they had to be delivered to the head of the household or his spouse within a certain time period. The process server successfully delivered notices to three of the tenants, but a fourth, Mrs Fitzmorris, refused to accept the notice and began waving a red flag to alert other tenants that the notices were being served. The women of the area descended on the process server and the constabulary, and began throwing stones, mud, and manure at them, succeeding in driving them away to seek refuge in Lough Mask House. The process server tried unsuccessfully to serve the notices the following day. News soon spread to the nearby Ballinrobe, from where many people descended on Lough Mask House, where, according to journalist James Redpath, they advised Boycott's servants and labourers to leave his employment immediately. Boycott said that many of his servants were forced to leave \\"under threat of ulterior consequences\\". Martin Branigan, a labourer who subsequently sued Boycott for non-payment of wages, claimed he left because he was afraid of the people who came into the field where he was working. Eventually, all Boycott's employees left, forcing him to run the estate without help. Within days, the blacksmith, postman, and laundress were persuaded or volunteered to stop serving Boycott. Boycott's young nephew volunteered to act as postman, but he was intercepted en route between Ballinrobe and Lough Mask, and told that he would be in danger if he continued. Soon, shopkeepers in Ballinrobe stopped serving Boycott, and he had to bring food and other provisions by boat from Cong. =Newspaper coverage= Before October 1880, Boycott's situation was little known outside County Mayo.Boycott, (1997) p. 232 On 14 October of that year, Boycott wrote a letter to The Times about his situation: After the publication of this letter, Bernard Becker, special correspondent of the Daily News, travelled to Ireland to cover Boycott's situation. On 24 October, he wrote a dispatch from Westport that contained an interview with Boycott. He reported that Boycott had ¬£500 worth of crops that would rot if help could not be found to harvest them.Becker (1881) p. 1‚Äì17 According to Becker, \\"Personally he is protected, but no woman in Ballinrobe would dream of washing him a cravat or making him a loaf. All the people have to say is that they are sorry, but that they 'dare not. Boycott had been advised to leave, but he told Becker that \\"I can hardly desert Lord Erne, and, moreover, my own property is sunk in this place.\\" Becker's report was reprinted in the Belfast News-Letter and the Dublin Daily Express. On 29 October, the Dublin Daily Express published a letter proposing a fund to finance a party of men to go to County Mayo to save Boycott's crops. Between them, the Daily Express, Daily Telegraph, Daily News, and News Letter raised ¬£2,000 to fund the relief expedition.Hickey; Doherty, (2003) p. 40 =Saving the crops= In Belfast in early November 1880, The Boycott Relief Fund was established to arrange an armed expedition to Lough Mask. Plans soon gained momentum, and within days, the fund had received many subscriptions. The committee had arranged with the Midland Great Western Railway for special trains to transport the expedition from Ulster to County Mayo. Many nationalists viewed the expedition as an invasion. The Freeman's Journal denounced the organisers of the expedition, and asked, \\"How is it that this Government do not consider it necessary to prosecute the promoters of these warlike expeditions?\\" William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland made it clear in a communication with the proprietor of the Dublin Daily Express that he would not allow an armed expedition of hundreds of men, as the committee was planning, and that 50 unarmed men would be sufficient to harvest the crops.Marlow, (1973) pp. 157‚Äì173 He said that the government would consider it their duty to protect this group. On 10 November 1880, the relief expedition consisting of one contingent from County Cavan and one from County Monaghan left for County Mayo. Additional troops had already arrived in County Mayo to protect the expedition. Boycott himself said that he did not want such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme sections of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops. The expedition experienced hostile protests on their route through County Mayo, but there was no violence, and they harvested the crops without incident. Rumours spread amongst the Ulstermen that an attack was being planned on the farm, but none materialised. =Aftermath= On 27 November 1880, Boycott, his family and a local magistrate were escorted from Lough Mask House by members of the 19th Hussars.Marlow, (1973) pp. 215‚Äì219 A carriage had been hired for the family, but no driver could be found for it, and an army ambulance and driver had to be used. The ambulance was escorted to Claremorris railway station, where Boycott and his family boarded a train to Dublin, where Boycott was received with some hostility. The hotel he stayed in received letters saying that it would be boycotted if Boycott remained. He had intended to stay in Dublin for a week, but Boycott was advised to cut his stay short. He left Dublin for England on the Holyhead mail boat on 1 December. The cost to the government of harvesting Boycott's crops was estimated at ¬£10,000:Marlow, (1973) p 224 in Parnell's words, \\"one shilling for every turnip dug from Boycott's land\\". In a letter requesting compensation to William Ewart Gladstone, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boycott said that he had lost ¬£6,000 of his investment in the estate.Marlow, (1973) p. 234 Boycotting had strengthened the power of the peasants,Marlow, (1973) pp. 228 and by the end of 1880 there were reports of boycotting from all over Ireland.Marlow, (1973) pp. 221‚Äì231 The events at Lough Mask had also increased the power of the Land League, and the popularity of Parnell as a leader. On 28 December 1880, Parnell and other Land League leaders were put on trial on charges of conspiracy to prevent the payment of rent. The trial attracted thousands of people onto the streets outside the court. A Daily Express reporter wrote that the court reminded him \\"more of the stalls of the theatre on opera night\\". On 24 January 1881, the judge dismissed the jury, it having been hung ten to two in favour of acquittal. Parnell and Davitt received this news as a victory. After the boycotting, Gladstone discussed the issue of land reform, writing in an 1880 letter, \\"The subject of the land weighs greatly on my mind and I am working on it to the best of my ability.\\"Marlow, (1973) p. 225 In December 1880, the Bessborough Commission, headed by Frederick Ponsonby, 6th Earl of Bessborough, recommended major land reforms, including the three Fs.Marlow, (1973) pp. 233‚Äì243 William Edward Forster argued that a Coercion Act‚Äîwhich would punish those participated in events like those at Lough Mask, and would include the suspension of habeas corpus‚Äîshould be introduced before any Land Act. Gladstone eventually accepted this argument. When Forster attempted to introduce the Protection of Person and Property Act 1881, Parnell and other Land League MPs attempted to obstruct its passage with tactics such as filibustering. One such filibuster lasted for 41 hours. Eventually, the Speaker of the house intervened, and a measure was introduced whereby the Speaker could control the house if there was a three to one majority in favour of the business being urgent. This was the first time that a check was placed on a debate in a British parliament. The act was passed on 28 February 1881. There was a negative reaction to the passing of the act in both England and Ireland. In England, the Anti-Coercion Association was established, which was a precursor to the Labour Party. In April 1881, Gladstone introduced the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881, in which the principle of the dual ownership of the land between landlords and tenants was established, and the three Fs introduced.Marlow, (1973) p. 249 The act set up the Irish Land Commission, a judicial body that would fix rents for a period of 15 years and guarantee fixity of tenure. According to The Annual Register, the act was \\"probably the most important measure introduced into the House of Commons since the passing of the Reform Bill\\". =The word \\"boycott\\"= According to James Redpath, the verb \\"to boycott\\" was coined by Father O'Malley in a discussion between them on 23 September 1880.Marlow, (1973) pp. 143‚Äì155 The following is Redpath's account: According to Joyce Marlow, the word was first used in print by Redpath in the Inter-Ocean on 12 October 1880. The coining of the word, and its first use in print, came before Boycott and his situation was widely known outside County Mayo. In November 1880, an article in the Birmingham Daily Post referred to the word as a local term in connection to the boycotting of a Ballinrobe merchant. Still in 1880, The Illustrated London News described how \\"To 'Boycott' has already become a verb active, signifying to 'ratten', to intimidate, to 'send to Coventry', and to 'taboo.Murray, (1888) p. 1040 In 1888, the word was included in the first volume of A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (later known as the Oxford English Dictionary). According to Gary Minda in his book, Boycott in America: how imagination and ideology shape the legal mind, \\"Apparently there was no other word in the English language to describe this dispute.\\"Minda, (1999) pp. 27‚Äì28 The word also entered the lexicon of languages other than English, such as Dutch, French, German, Polish and Russian. Later life After leaving Ireland, Boycott and his family visited the United States.Marlow, (1973) pp. 245‚Äì249 His arrival in New York generated a great deal of media interest; the New York Tribune said that, \\"The arrival of Captain Boycott, who has involuntarily added a new word to the language, is an event of something like international interest.\\" The New York Times said, \\"For private reasons the visitor made the voyage incognito, being registered simply as 'Charles Cunningham. The purpose of the visit was to see friends in Virginia, including Murray McGregor Blacker, a friend from his time on Achill Island who had settled in the United States. Boycott returned to England after some months. In 1886, Boycott became a land agent for Hugh Adair's Flixton estate in Suffolk, England.Marlow, (1973) pp. 264‚Äì276 He had a passion for horses and racing, and became secretary of the Bungay race committee. Boycott continued to spend holidays in Ireland, and according to Joyce Marlow, he left Ireland without bitterness. In early 1897, Boycott's health became very poor. In an attempt to improve his health, he and his wife went on a cruise to Malta. In Brindisi, he became seriously ill, and had to return to England. His health continued to deteriorate, and on 19 June 1897 he died at his home in Flixton, aged 65. His funeral and burial took place at the church at Burgh St Peter, conducted by his nephew Arthur St John Boycott, who was at Lough Mask during the first boycott. Charles Boycott's widow, Annie, was subsequently sued over the funeral expenses and other debts, and had to sell some assets. A number of London newspapers, including The Times, published obituaries. In popular culture Charles Boycott and the events that led to his name entering the English language have been the subject of several works of fiction. The first was Captain Boycott, a 1946 romantic novel by Phillip Rooney. This was the basis for the 1947 film Captain Boycott‚Äîdirected by Frank Lauder and starred Stewart Granger, Kathleen Ryan, Alastair Sim, and Cecil Parker as Charles Boycott. More recently the story was the subject of the 2012 novel Boycott, by Colin C. Murphy.

Robert Donat makes a cameo appearance as the Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell. The film explains how the word boycott appeared in the English language. Ironically, the title character plays a secondary role in the film, as an anti-hero, and the hero of the film is Hugh Davin. Plot In 1880 in County Mayo, during the period of Irish history known as the Land War, Irish tenant farmers agitated for reinstatement of their former lower rents and increased tenants' rights, especially from absentee English landlords. They particularly resented evictions. Some resorted to the gun to achieve justice, but others, inspired by the Irish statesman Charles Stewart Parnell (played in a brief cameo role by Robert Donat), shunned violence and adopted a form of passive resistance. Parnell advocates the theory that potential new tenants should never bid for farms from which the old or current tenant has been evicted: this is the core of the \\"boycott\\" concept. The crowd, containing Davin and his friends, who had thought that Parnell was going to speak in favour of eviction, put their rotten eggs away and are instead impressed. The farmers are led by Hugh Davin (Stewart Granger) who, with the moral support of the local priest, Father McKeogh (Alastair Sim), encourages his fellow tenants to ostracize their land agent, the bombastic Captain Boycott (Cecil Parker). There is a love interest in the form of Ann Killain (Kathleen Ryan), whose father is also shunned for taking up a farm from which another farmer had been evicted. The resultant stand-off attracts international news coverage and will ultimately introduce a new word ‚Äì to boycott ‚Äì to the English language.IMDb reviews ‚Äì Captain Boycott (1947)New York Times Movie Review by Bosley Crowther, 6 December 1947 Actions begin with Boycott's servants abandoning his house. One final servant, Bridget, is caught as last to leave. She tells him Davin asked them to leave. Everyone refuses to gather Boycott's crops. The situation persists and Boycott asks for the support of the British parliament. The story reaches every newspaper and becomes the subject of music hall jokes. The British press go to the Boycott estate, followed by a squad of troopers to support him. Things start to get out of hand when the authorities, at the word of Boycott, demolish Divan's farm. Captain Boycott risks his survival, having lost all other income, on his horse racing at the Curragh. The Captain acts as his own jockey on a horse bought from Divan. However, the crowd will not tolerate it, and despite the number of mounted troopers they block the Captain on his horse as he approaches the finishing line and mob him. Michael Fagan steals Divan's revolver and tries to kill Killain, who has been signing the eviction notices. A fight ensues and Fagan falls in a river. It is reported that he has been murdered. Divan tries to stop the mob from lynching Killain because he loves his daughter. Divan rushes to the Killain cottage and finds the priest giving Killain the last rites having been shot by Fagan. When the mob arrive they are pointed to Boycott and the troops leaving: their cause lost. The priest says if anything like this happens again they will be able to \\"boycott\\" him.

In 1988, he was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of killing two members of his burglary gang and two other associates. In 2003, he received an additional 30-year sentence after confessing to the murder of a mob-connected police officer. He was given the nickname The Iceman by authorities after they discovered that he had frozen the body of one of his victims in an attempt to disguise the time of death. Among his associates, Kuklinski was known as \\"the one-man army\\" or \\"the Devil himself\\". Kuklinski was engaged in criminal activities for most of his adult life. He bought and sold stolen goods, ran a burglary and car theft ring, and was also linked to narcotics dealing, pornography, arms dealing and money laundering. Prosecutors described him as someone who killed for profit. Eventually, he came to the attention of law enforcement when an investigation into his burglary gang linked him to several murders. An eighteen-month long undercover operation led to his arrest in December 1986. Kuklinski lived with his wife and children in the New Jersey suburb of Dumont. They knew him as a loving father and husband who provided for his family, but one who also had a violent temper and was physically abusive to his wife. His family stated that they were unaware of his crimes. After his murder convictions, Kuklinski gave interviews to writers, prosecutors, criminologists and psychiatrists. He claimed to have murdered anywhere from 100 to 250 men, often in gruesome fashion.Zugibe, Dr. Frederick T. Zugibe; Costello, James T. (November 1993). \\"The Iceman Murder - One of a Series of Contract Murders\\".Journal of Forensic Sciences, Vol. 38, No. 6. pp. 1404‚Äì1408. PDF file: 333.6 KB; retrieved June 3, 2012. Most of these additional murders have not been corroborated. He also alleged that he worked as a hitman for the Mafia, and that he was a participant in several famous Mafia killings, including the murders of mob bosses Paul Castellano and Carmine Galante, and Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa; these claims are considered dubious by law enforcement and mob experts. He was the subject of three HBO documentaries aired in 1992, 2001 and 2003; two biographies, a 2012 feature film starring Michael Shannon and Winona Ryder, and a play. Personal life =Early life= Richard Kuklinski was born in his family's apartment on 4th Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, to Stanis≈Çaw \\"Stanley\\" Kukli≈Ñski (1906‚Äì1977), a Polish immigrant from Karwacz, Masovian Voivodeship\\"Richard Kuklinski ‚Äì zabijanie mia≈Ç we krwi?\\". More Maiorum 1/2016, pp. 28-37 (Polish only); retrieved 21 February 2016. who worked as a brakeman on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, and Anna McNally (1911‚Äì1972) from Harsimus, a daughter of Catholic Irish immigrants from Dublin, who worked in a meat-packing plant during Richard's childhood. He was the second of four children. Stanley Kuklinski was a violent alcoholic who beat his children regularly and sometimes beat his wife. Stanley abandoned the family while Richard was still a child, but returned periodically, usually drunk, and his returns were often followed by more beatings for Richard. Anna was also often abusive. She would beat Richard with broom handles (sometimes breaking the handle on his body during the assaults) and other household objects. He recalled an incident during his pre-teen years when his mother attempted to kill Stanley with a kitchen knife. Anna was a zealous Christian and believed that stern discipline should be accompanied by a strict religious upbringing, the same way she was raised. She raised her son in the Roman Catholic Church, where he became an altar boy. Kuklinski later rejected Catholicism. Kuklinski regarded his mother as a \\"cancer\\" who destroyed everything she touched. He said he regretted not killing his father. He also exhibited cruelty to animals as a young boy, killing neighborhood cats by tying their tails together with rope and throwing them over clothing lines to watch them tear each other apart. Other times he would throw living cats into basement incinerators, watching through the thick glass oven doors as the terrified feline ran around until consumed by the fire. Kuklinski would sometimes fantasize about murdering his father when he was torturing stray dogs he captured around his hometown neighborhood. Kuklinski had three siblings. His older brother Florian (1933‚Äì1941) died at the age of seven from injuries inflicted by his father during a violent beating. The family lied to the police, saying that Florian had accidentally fallen down a flight of steps. Stanley abandoned the family shortly after he murdered his first son. Kuklinski, who was the second son, had a younger sister, Roberta (1942‚Äì2010), and a younger brother, Joseph (1944‚Äì2003), who in 1970 was convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl and murdering her by throwing her off the top of a five- story building (along with her pet dog). When asked about his brother's crimes, Kuklinski replied: \\"We come from the same father.\\" =Marriage and children= Kuklinski's first marriage was to a woman nine years his senior named Linda, with whom he had two sons (Richard Jr. and David). While Richard was working for a trucking company he met Barbara Pedrici, who was a secretary at the same firm. Kuklinski and Barbara married in 1961 and had two daughters, Merrick and Christin, and a son, Dwayne. Barbara described his behavior as alternating between \\"good Richie\\" and \\"bad Richie.\\" \\"Good Richie\\" was a hard- working provider and an affectionate father and loving husband, who enjoyed time with his family. Barbara remembered that when Merrick became seriously ill soon after she was born, Richard stayed up night after night to care for her. Richard lavished his family with gifts; he bought Christian Dior clothes for Barbara and diamonds and jewelry for his daughters. He took the family out to expensive restaurants and regular vacations, including trips to Disney World. The Kuklinskis bought a new car every six months. In contrast, \\"Bad Richie\\" ‚Äì who would appear at irregular intervals: sometimes one day after another, other times not appearing for months ‚Äì was prone to unpredictable fits of rage, smashing furniture and domestic violence. During these periods, he was physically abusive to his wife (one time breaking her nose and giving her a black eye) and emotionally abusive towards his children. Merrick later recalled that he once killed her dog right in front of her to punish her for coming home late. Barbara claimed in an interview that once, during an argument in a car, she told Richard she wanted to see other people. He responded by silently jabbing her from behind with a hunting knife so sharp she didn't even feel the blade go in. He told her that she belonged to him, and that if she tried to leave he would kill her entire family; when Barbara began screaming at him in anger, he throttled her into unconsciousness. Merrick also remembered a number of road rage incidents involving her father. Kuklinski's family and Dumont, New Jersey neighbors were never aware of his activities, and instead believed he was a successful businessman. Barbara suspected that at least some of his income was from illegal activities, due to their lifestyle and the large amounts of cash he often possessed, but she never expressed these worries to him. She had a \\"don't ask questions\\" philosophy when it came to his business life; she didn't ask about his business partners or how he made his money. If he suddenly got up and left the house in the middle of the night, she never asked where he was going. The Kuklinskis divorced in 1993, when Richard was in prison. Barbara said the divorce was for \\"money reasons\\". She continued to visit him in prison, but only about once a year. Authorities described Kuklinski as unusual amongst both mobsters and killers. Apart from his violent temper, he had few of the vices common among criminals. He was not an abuser of alcohol or other drugs. He was not a womanizer. He did have a serious weakness for high-stakes gambling and lost a great deal of money this way. His motives for murder were also unusual, not fitting neatly into standard serial killer categories of lust murder, revenge murder, or \\"angels of mercy\\", for example. Criminal life =Early crimes= Kuklinski claimed that he committed his first murder in 1949 at the age of 13 or 14, using a closet clothes-hanging rod to bludgeon a neighborhood boy who had bullied and teased him. He said he immediately ran back to his apartment and though the boy's body was discovered soon afterwards, the police never connected the murder to him. Kuklinski later told a more dramatic version of the story, in which after killing the boy, he stole a car, drove the body to the New Jersey Pine Barrens, removed the teeth and fingertips to make identification more difficult, and then dumped the body in a frozen pond. Elsewhere, Kuklinski stated that his first murder victim was a man he had argued with in a bar, whom he beat to death with a pool cue. In the mid-1960s, Kuklinski began working at a Manhattan film lab. Through the lab he had access to master copies of popular films, and he began making bootleg copies of Disney cartoons which he could then sell on. Kuklinski discovered there was a lucrative market for tapes of pornographic movies too; copying and distributing pornography became a regular source of income for him. Several of his known murder victims were men he had met through trafficking pornography and drugs. He also headed a gang which specialised in stealing brand new Corvettes, and carrying out burglaries. He was once arrested for passing a bad check, the only crime he was charged with prior to his arrest for murder. He was photographed and fingerprinted, but the charges were dropped when he agreed to pay back the money owed. Kuklinski said he supplemented his income by working as a freelance contract killer. =Roy DeMeo= Kuklinski encountered Roy DeMeo, an aspiring associate (and later soldier) of the Gambino family when he borrowed money from a loanshark with mob connections. When Kuklinski missed a payment, he was visited by DeMeo and two other men, who beat and pistol whipped him. The beating left Kuklinski with a prominent scar on his forehead. According to Kuklinski, thereafter DeMeo regularly employed him as a debt collector, enforcer and hit man. Kuklinski's claim to have been a close associate of DeMeo is disputed by Jerry Capeci, who stated that Kuklinski was only seen entering DeMeo's Gemini Lounge headquarters once, to buy a handgun. Kuklinski is not mentioned in Capeci and Gene Mustain's book about the DeMeo crew, Murder Machine or Albert DeMeo's account of his father's life in the mob, For the Sins of My Father. Kuklinski would later claim that he killed DeMeo, who was found dead in the trunk of his car in January 1983. However, most sources indicate that DeMeo was killed by members of his own crew, with no suggestion that Kuklinski was involved. In the postscript to a later edition of The Ice Man, Philip Carlo acknowledged that Kuklinski probably didn't kill DeMeo. =Robert Pronge= In the early 1980s Kuklinski became acquainted with another killer, named Robert Pronge (sometimes spelled Prongay). Pronge was referred to by Kuklinski as \\"Mister Softee\\", as he used to drive a Mister Softee ice cream truck to appear inconspicuous while surveilling potential victims. Pronge claimed to be a Special Forces veteran and an explosives expert. He knew much about poisons and taught Kuklinski how to use cyanide as a murder weapon; one of his favored methods was to put the cyanide into a nasal spray bottle and squirt an unsuspecting target. Kuklinski said they carried out a number of murders together and that it was Pronge's suggestion to freeze the body of Louis Masgay, to see if the time of death could be disguised. The two men fell out when Pronge allegedly asked Kuklinski to murder his ex-wife and son; Kuklinski refused. Kuklinski also took exception when he learned of Pronge's plans to poison an entire reservoir with ricin just to kill one family. During an argument that followed, Pronge told Kuklinski that he knew where he lived and threatened his family. On August 10, 1984, Pronge was found dead in his Mister Softee truck with two bullet wounds in his chest. At the time of his death, Pronge was due to appear in court on aggravated assault charges against his ex-wife and son. Investigators later stated that they regarded Kuklinski as the \\"prime suspect\\" for Pronge's murder, but decided not to file charges as by then he had already been convicted of other murders. =Murder of George Malliband= On February 1, 1980, Kuklinski and a business associate named George Malliband were driving to New Jersey. After an argument, during which Malliband threatened Kuklinski's family, Kuklinski suddenly brought the van to a stop. Without warning, he pulled a .38 revolver from his pocket and shot Malliband in the chest five times, killing him. Kuklinski later said that killing Malliband was \\"due to business\\". Malliband was reportedly carrying $27,000 at the time. Malliband's body was found a few days later near the Chemitex chemical plant in Jersey City. It had been stuffed into a 55-gallon drum and rolled to the bottom of a palisade. Kuklinski had cut the tendons of Malliband's leg in order to force it into the barrel. This was the first murder to be directly linked to Kuklinski, as Malliband's brother told police that he had been on his way to meet Kuklinski the day he disappeared. =Murder of Paul Hoffman= In 1982, Kuklinski met Paul Hoffman, a 51-year-old pharmacist who occasionally frequented \\"the store\\" in Paterson, New Jersey, a storefront with a large backroom where a wide variety of stolen items could be bought and sold. Hoffman hoped to make a big profit by purchasing, at a low cost, large quantities of stolen Tagamet, a popular drug used to treat peptic ulcers, which he could then resell through his pharmacy. He believed that Kuklinski could supply the drug and badgered him to make a deal. On the afternoon of April 29, 1982, Hoffman and Kuklinski met at a warehouse leased by Kuklinski. Hoffman brought $25,000 in cash with him to purchase the Tagamet. After Hoffman gave him the money, Kuklinski told him that the deal was a ruse. Kuklinski placed the barrel of his pistol under Hoffman's chin and pulled the trigger. The shot only wounded Hoffman, so Kuklinski tried to shoot him again, only for the gun to jam. Kuklinski then resorted to killing Hoffman by beating him to death with a tire iron. Kuklinski placed Hoffman's corpse inside a fifty-gallon drum, filled the drum with instant cement, and brazenly left it on the sidewalk outside a motel behind a luncheonette called Harry's Corner in South Hackensack, New Jersey. Kuklinski monitored the drum for some time, sitting in Harry's Corner every day to listen for talk amongst the patrons that would indicate the body's discovery. After what Kuklinski related as a long time, he noticed one day that the drum was no longer there, but could not discern any details about its fate from listening to the patrons. Hoffman's body was never recovered. =Murder of Gary Smith= By the early 1980s, Kuklinski's burglary gang was coming under more scrutiny from law enforcement. In December 1982, Percy House, a member of the gang, was arrested. House would later agree to testify against Kuklinski and was placed in protective custody. Warrants were also issued for the arrest of two more gang members, Gary Smith and Daniel Deppner. Kuklinski urged them to lie low and rented them a room at the York Motel in North Bergen, New Jersey. Kuklinski was angered when he learned that Smith had left the motel to visit his daughter and also feared that Smith, who had recently spoken of giving up crime and going straight, might become an informant against him. Kuklinski, Deppner and House (who was still in jail at the time) decided that Smith had to be killed. Kuklinski and Deppner therefore fed Smith a hamburger laced with cyanide. When Smith took longer to die from the cyanide than Kuklinski expected, he grew impatient and ordered Deppner to strangle Smith with a lamp cord. According to forensic pathologist Michael Baden, Smith's death would probably have been attributed to something non-homicidal in nature (like drug overdose for instance) had Kuklinski relied solely on the cyanide; however, the ligature mark around Smith's neck (and, presumably, the fact that the body had been deliberately hidden) proved to investigators that he was murdered. When Deppner's ex-wife, Barbara, failed to return with a car to remove the body, they placed it in between the mattress and box spring. Over the next four days, a number of patrons rented the room, and although they thought the smell in the room was odd, most of them did not think to look under the bed.Mikkelson, David (June 13, 1999). \\"The Body Under the Bed\\". Snopes. Finally, on December 27, 1982, after more complaints from guests about the smell, the motel manager investigated and found Smith's decomposing body. =Daniel Deppner's murder= After Smith's murder, Kuklinski moved Deppner to an apartment in Bergenfield, New Jersey, belonging to Rich Patterson, then-fianc√© of Kuklinski's daughter Merrick. Patterson was away at the time, but Kuklinski had access to the apartment. At some point between February and May 1983, Deppner was killed by Kuklinski. Investigators later deduced that he was murdered in Patterson's apartment after finding a bloodstain on the carpet. Kuklinski enlisted Patterson's help to dispose of Deppner's body, telling Patterson that the victim was a friend who had been in trouble with the law, and that someone must have broken in and killed him over the weekend. He added that it was best to dump the body to avoid trouble with the police. Afterwards Kuklinski urged Patterson to just forget about the incident. Kuklinski made another mistake when he told an associate that he had killed Deppner. Deppner's body was found on May 14, 1983, when a cyclist riding down Clinton Road in a wooded area of West Milford, New Jersey, spotted the corpse being preyed on by a turkey vulture. Kuklinski had wrapped the body inside green garbage bags before dumping it. Medical examiners listed Deppner's cause of death as \\"undetermined\\", although they noted pinkish spots on his skin, a possible sign of cyanide poisoning. Deppner had also been strangled. Law enforcement theorized that Deppner must have already been incapacitated, such as by poison, as he had no defensive wounds and healthy adult men are rarely killed by strangulation. The medical examiner found that Deppner's stomach was full of undigested food, meaning he had died shortly after (or during) a meal. The beans that Deppner had eaten were burned, so they reasoned that it must have been a home-cooked meal, as a restaurant would probably not get away with serving burned food to a customer. Investigators noted that the body had been discovered just from a ranch where Kuklinski's family often went horseback riding. Deppner was the third associate of Kuklinski's to have been found dead. =Louis Masgay discovered= On September 25, 1983, the body of Louis Masgay was found near a town park off Clausland Mountain Road in Orangetown, New York, with a bullet hole in the back of his head. Masgay had disappeared over two years earlier, on July 1, 1981, the day he was due to meet Kuklinski to purchase a large quantity of blank VCR tapes for $100,000. Kuklinski attempted to disguise Masgay's time of death by storing his corpse in an industrial freezer for the next two years. He later said this was on the advice of Robert Pronge. Pronge may also have supplied the freezer Kuklinski used to store Masgay's body. However, Kuklinski did not allow the body to thaw completely before he dumped it and he also wrapped it in plastic garbage bags, which kept it insulated and partially frozen. The Rockland County medical examiner found ice crystals inside the body on a warm September day. Had the body thawed completely before discovery, the medical examiner stated that he probably would have never noticed Kuklinski's trickery. Detectives also realised that Masgay was wearing the same clothes his wife and son had said he was wearing the day he disappeared. The discovery that Kuklinski had frozen Masgay's body is what led authorities to nickname him \\"The Iceman\\". State and federal manhunt Kuklinski first came to the attention of Pat Kane, a detective in the New Jersey State Police when, with help from an informant, Kane connected him to a gang who were carrying out burglaries in northern New Jersey and began building a file on him. Eventually, five unsolved homicides, namely the deaths of Hoffman, Smith, Deppner, Masgay and Malliband, were linked to Kuklinski because he had been the last known person to see each of them alive. In 1985, a division of the New Jersey Criminal Justice Department created a task force composed of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, including the New Jersey Attorney General's office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, dedicated to arresting and convicting Richard Kuklinski. The task force, nicknamed \\"Operation Iceman\\", based its case almost entirely on the testimony of undercover agent ATF Special Agent Dominick Polifrone and the evidence built by Kane. Starting in 1985, Kane and Polifrone worked with Phil Solimene, a close long-time friend of Kuklinski, to get Polifrone close to Kuklinski. Posing as a Mafia-connected criminal named Dominic Provenzano, Polifrone initially purchased a silenced handgun from Kuklinski. He asked Polifrone if he could supply him with pure cyanide. Polifrone told Kuklinski he wanted to hire him to carry out a hit against a wealthy Jewish associate in a cocaine deal robbery, and recorded Kuklinski speaking in detail about how he would do it. Kuklinski was also recorded boasting that he had once killed a man by putting cyanide on his hamburger, and of his plans to kill \\"a couple of rats\\" [Barbara Deppner and Percy House]. Kuklinski claimed in the HBO interview that Solimene was the only friend he did not kill. Arrest, charges and trial On December 17, 1986, it was arranged for Kuklinski to meet Polifrone to get cyanide for a planned murder, which was to be an attempt on a police detective working undercover. After being recorded by Polifrone, Kuklinski went for a walk by himself. He tested Polifrone's (purported) cyanide on a stray dog, using a hamburger as bait, and saw it was not poison. Suspicious, Kuklinski decided not to go through with the planned murder and went home instead. He was arrested at a roadblock two hours later. A gun was found in the car, and his wife was charged with trying to prevent his arrest. She was also charged with possession of an illegal firearm, as she had been in the car where it was found. Prosecutors charged Kuklinski with five murder counts and six weapons violations, as well as attempted murder, robbery, and attempted robbery. Officials said Kuklinski had large sums of money in Swiss bank accounts and a reservation on a flight to that country. Kuklinski was held on a $2 million bail bond and made to surrender his passport. At his trial, a number of Kuklinski's former associates gave evidence against him, as did Rich Patterson and Polifrone. The recorded conversations with Polifrone were the most damaging evidence. Kuklinski's defense argued that his admissions on the tapes were merely him \\"blowing smoke\\" in an attempt to impress someone he believed to be a major criminal. In March 1988, a jury found Kuklinski guilty of murdering Smith and Deppner, but found that the deaths were not proven to be by Kuklinski's own conduct, meaning he would not face the death penalty. To avoid a second trial for the murders of Malliband and Masgay, Kuklinski agreed to plead guilty to both. The state deemed there to be insufficient evidence to convict Kuklinski for Hoffman's murder, as his body had not been recovered. In return for a confession and Kuklinski's assistance in recovering Hoffman's remains, the charges for that murder were dropped. As part of the deal, the gun charge against his wife and an unrelated marijuana possession charge against his son were also dropped. Kuklinski received two sixty-year sentences, one for killing Smith and Deppner, the other for Malliband and Masgay, which would run concurrently. He was to be ineligible for parole until he was 111 years old (the year 2046). He was incarcerated at Trenton State Prison. Statements made during interviews During his incarceration, Kuklinski granted interviews to prosecutors, psychiatrists, criminologists, and writers. Several television producers also spoke to Kuklinski about his criminal career, upbringing, and personal life. These talks culminated in three televised documentaries known as The Iceman Tapes, which were aired on HBO in 1992, 2001, and 2003. According to Merrick Kuklinski, it was her mother who convinced Richard to do the interviews and she was paid \\"handsomely\\" for them. In the last installment, The Iceman and the Psychiatrist, Kuklinski was interviewed by renowned forensic psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz. Writers Anthony Bruno and Philip Carlo wrote biographies of Kuklinski. He turned down interviews by Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo Rivera. =Interview with Dr Park Dietz= Kuklinski was interviewed by renowned forensic psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz in 2002 at Trenton State Prison. The two spoke at length, in a videotaped interview, about Kuklinski's upbringing, family life, crimes, and other events in his past. In one of the video taped segments, where Dietz questioned whether a prior incident of murder over a trivial slight was justified, Kuklinski experienced a flushed moment of subdued homicidal rage. He told the doctor that he wanted to know what events or mental irregularities made him able to perform the acts of which he was accused. After a lengthy discussion, Dietz cited nature vs. nurture, stating that his professional opinion was that both played a part in Kuklinski's development into a hitman who could be functional in other aspects of life. Dietz elaborated that Kuklinski likely inherited antisocial personality disorder from his parents and that the abuse he claims to have suffered from his father reinforced violence, activities requiring a lack of conscience, and a lack of love. Dietz also stated that Kuklinski suffered from paranoid personality disorder, which caused him to kill people for minor slights or criticisms, often long after they occurred. =Murder of a police officer= In his 2001 HBO interview, Kuklinski confessed to killing Peter Calabro, an NYPD detective who had been ambushed and shot dead by an unknown gunman on 14 March 1980. Calabro was rumored to have mob connections and had been investigated for selling confidential information to the Gambino family. His wife Carmella had drowned in mysterious circumstances three years earlier and members of her family believed that Calabro himself was responsible for her death. At the time, his murder was thought by law enforcement to have been a revenge killing either carried out or arranged by his deceased wife's relatives. Her brothers were regarded as \\"key suspects\\" but the crime remained unsolved. The Bergen County prosecutor believed Kuklinski's confession to be a fabrication, but his successor decided to proceed with the case. In February 2003 Kuklinski was formally charged with Calabro's murder and received another sentence of 30 years. This was considered moot, as he was already serving multiple life sentences and ineligible for parole until he was over the age of 100. Describing the murder, Kuklinski said that he parked his van on the side of a narrow road, forcing other drivers to slow down to pass. He lay in a snowbank behind his van until Calabro came by at 2 a.m., then stepped out and shot him in the head with a sawed-off shotgun, decapitating Calabro. He stated that he was unaware that Calabro was a police officer at the time, but said he probably would have murdered him anyway had he known. Kuklinski claimed he had been paid to kill Calabro by Gambino crime family soldier (later underboss) Sammy \\"The Bull\\" Gravano and that Gravano had provided him with the murder weapon. Gravano, who was then serving a 20-year sentence in Arizona for drug trafficking, was also indicted for the murder and Kuklinski was set to testify against him. Gravano denied any involvement in Calabro's death and rejected a plea deal, under which he would have received no additional jail time if he confessed to the crime and implicated all his accomplices. Gravano reportedly told detectives that if he had wanted to kill Calabro, he would have \\"whacked him myself\\". Gravano's lawyer claimed that Kuklinski had tried to use the allegation to extort $200,000 from Gravano, which was later confirmed by the FBI. The charges against Gravano were dropped after Kuklinski's death in 2006. =Other murders= The exact number of people killed by Kuklinski is not known. When questioned, he alluded to other murders he had committed, but rarely gave specific details like the victim's full name, the location or the date. In his 1992 HBO interview, Conversations with a Killer, Kuklinski said he had murdered more than 100 people. In his 2003 interview with Dr Park Dietz, he claimed the number was well over 200. He said he used a variety of methods, so as not to establish a modus operandi that would enable law enforcement to connect all these murders to one person: he used guns, knives, explosives, tire irons, fire, poison, asphyxiation, feeding people to cave rats, and even bare-handed beatings \\"just for the exercise\\". He favored the use of cyanide, since it killed quickly, wasn't messy and was hard to detect in a toxicology test. He would variously administer it by injection, by putting it on a person's food, by aerosol spray, or by simply spilling it on the victim's skin. He said one of his favorite methods of disposing of a body was to place it in a 55-gallon drum. His other disposal methods included dismemberment, burial, or placing the body in the trunk of a car and having it crushed in a junkyard. Kuklinski said he killed numerous random motorists whose behavior had annoyed him. He also claimed to have shot a hitchhiker who had given him the finger, taken revenge on a Jersey City policeman who crossed him by burning him to death in his car, beaten a man to death with a pool cue after a bar argument, shot a bouncer in a club, thrown a man off a Honolulu hotel balcony, poisoned a stranger at a disco by spilling a cocktail laced with cyanide over him, shot a passer-by in the head with a crossbow to test out the effectiveness of the weapon, blown up a man who owed him money with a hand grenade, killed two drug dealers in Rio de Janeiro, poisoned an Arab blackmailer in Zurich, bludgeoned to death a pushy homosexual man who propositioned him, and castrated and tortured a rapist in Miami before throwing him into the sea to be eaten by sharks. He also said he killed several people by feeding them alive to cave rats in Pennsylvania and recorded footage of it. In a 1991 interview, Kuklinski recalled one of the few murders he later regretted committing: Kuklinski also alleged that he was a Mafia contract killer who worked for all of the Five Families of New York City, as well as the DeCavalcante family of New Jersey. He claimed to have carried out dozens of murders on behalf of Gambino soldier Roy DeMeo. He said that he was one of the hitmen who assassinated Bonanno family boss Carmine Galante in July 1979 and Gambino family boss Paul Castellano in December 1985. For the latter hit, Kuklinski said he was personally recruited by John Gotti ally Sammy Gravano, who instructed him to kill Castellano's driver and bodyguard, Thomas Bilotti. He told Philip Carlo he was hired by John Gotti to kidnap, torture and murder John Favara, the man who accidentally killed Gotti's 12-year-old son Frank after hitting him with his car. In his 2001 HBO interview, Secrets of a Mafia Hitman, Kuklinski said he knew who killed former Teamsters union president Jimmy Hoffa. He didn't name the culprit, but said it wasn't him. However, he later claimed that he actually killed Hoffa. In his account, Kuklinski was part of a four-man hit team who picked up Hoffa in Detroit. While they were in the car, Kuklinski killed Hoffa by stabbing him with a large hunting knife. He said he then drove Hoffa's body from Detroit to a New Jersey junkyard, where it was placed in a drum and set on fire, then buried in the junkyard. Later, fearing an accomplice might become an informant, the drum was dug up, placed in the trunk of a car, and compacted to a 4x2-foot cube. It was sold, along with hundreds of other compacted cars, as scrap metal. It was shipped off to Japan to be used in making new cars. =Reliability of Kuklinski's claims= Many of Kuklinski's admissions about his criminal life have not been corroborated and have long been met with scepticism. His claim to have committed hundreds of murders has been described as \\"many times more than could ever be substantiated\\". Paul Smith, a member of the task force which arrested Kuklinski and later a supervisor of the organized crime division of the New Jersey Attorney General's office, said \\"I checked every one of the murders that Kuklinski said he committed, and not one was true.\\" Dominic Polifrone said \\"I don‚Äôt believe he killed 200 people. I don‚Äôt believe he killed 100 people. I‚Äôll go as high as 15, maybe.\\" Kuklinski biographer Anthony Bruno described him as a \\"part-time liar\\" and acknowledged that ‚Äúmany of his stories didn't pass the smell test‚Äù.The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-blooded Killer By Anthony Bruno, pg xvii During one of their conversations, Bruno joked: \\"Richard, I have a feeling if I listen to you long enough, you'll tell me you shot President Lincoln.\\" Kuklinski laughed and said \\"Yeah. You're probably right.\\" Mafia writer and journalist Jerry Capeci dismissed Kuklinski's claims that he killed Jimmy Hoffa, Carmine Galante and Paul Castellano as \\"mostly demented ramblings\\". Capeci commented on the improbability of a \\"heretofore unknown mob assassin\\" who \\"has never been linked to any of the slayings or any of the many well-known suspects\\" being present at three of the most famous Mafia killings of the past few decades. When he became a Government witness in 1990, Sammy Gravano admitted to planning the murder of Castellano and Bilotti, but said the shooters were all members of John Gotti's crew and were chosen by Gotti; he did not mention Kuklinski. Anthony Bruno felt that Kuklinski's participation in the killing of Castellano was ‚Äúhighly unlikely‚Äù. Bruno noted that in 1986 Anthony Indelicato was convicted of Galante's murder and Kuklinski was not mentioned during the trial. Philip Carlo later wrote that Kuklinski's claim to have participated in Galante's murder was untrue. Regarding Kuklinski's claim to have kidnapped and murdered Hoffa, Deputy Chief Bob Buccino, who worked on the Kuklinski case, said \\"They took a body from Detroit, where they have one of the biggest lakes in the world, and drove it all the way back to New Jersey? Come on.\\" Buccino added: \\"We didn't believe a lot of things he said.\\" Former FBI agent Robert Garrity called Kuklinski's admission to killing Hoffa ‚Äúa hoax‚Äù and said Kuklinski was never a suspect in Hoffa's disappearance, adding \\"I've never heard of him.\\" Bruno said he investigated Kuklinski's alleged involvement in Hoffa's disappearance, but concluded that ‚Äú[his] story didn't check out‚Äù. He opined that Kuklinski made the confession in order to ‚Äúadd extra value to his brand‚Äù and so omitted the story from his biography of Kuklinski. Numerous other accounts of Hoffa's disappearance do not mention Kuklinski as a possible accomplice. Kuklinski's claims that he dumped bodies in caves in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and fed a victim to flesh-eating rats in the caves have also been questioned. In 2013 the Philadelphia Inquirer noted that the caves have had a lot of visitors since Kuklinski's time, and no human remains have been found. Local cave enthusiast Richard Kranzel also queried the idea of flesh-eating rats, saying \\"The only rats I have encountered in caves are 'cave rats,' and they are reclusive and shy creatures, and definitely not fierce as Kuklinski claims.\\" The videos Kuklinski said he made of victims being eaten alive by cave rats have never been discovered. Death In October 2005, after nearly 18 years in prison, Kuklinski was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease (an inflammation of the blood vessels). He was transferred to a secure wing at St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton, New Jersey. Although he had asked doctors to make sure they revived him if he developed cardiopulmonary arrest (or risk of heart attack), his then-former wife Barbara had signed a \\"do not resuscitate\\" order. A week before his death, the hospital called Barbara to ask if she wished to rescind the instruction, but she declined. Kuklinski died at age 70 on March 5, 2006. At the request of Kuklinski's family, noted forensic pathologist Michael Baden reviewed his autopsy report. Baden confirmed that Kuklinski died of cardiac arrest and had been suffering with heart disease and phlebitis. In media =Film= Michael Shannon plays Kuklinski in the 2012 film The Iceman loosely based on Anthony Bruno's book The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer. The film also stars Winona Ryder as Kuklinski's wife (renamed Deborah), Ray Liotta as Roy DeMeo, Stephen Dorff as Richard's younger brother Joey, and Chris Evans as Robert \\"Mr. Softee\\" (renamed \\"Mr. Freezy\\"). Another film which would have starred Mickey Rourke as Kuklinski was reportedly in production around the same time but was never made. =Music= * The song \\"Iceman\\" from the 2003 album Murder Metal by American extreme metal band Macabre is about Kuklinski. * The song \\"Lyrical Hitman\\" by Royce da 5'9\\" featuring Marv Won was inspired by Kuklinski. The song is about the rappers murdering their opponents, similar to how ‚ÄúThe Iceman‚Äù murdered his victims.

It is an American remake of the 1994 French film Un indien dans la ville (also known as Little Indian, Big City). Jungle 2 Jungles plot follows that of the original film fairly closely, with the biggest difference being the change in location from Paris to New York.  Plot  Michael Cromwell (Tim Allen) is a self-absorbed commodities broker living in New York City. Wanting to marry his new fianc√©e Charlotte (Lolita Davidovich), he needs to obtain a divorce from his first wife Patricia (JoBeth Williams) who left him some years earlier. Patricia now lives with a semi-Westernised tribe in Canaima National Park, Venezuela. Michael travels there to get her signature on divorce papers, but upon arriving, Patricia reveals that they had a son together, who is now 13-years- old and is named Mimi-Siku (Sam Huntington). Michael attempts to bond with Mimi-Siku in his brief stay with the tribe and promises to take him to New York \\"when he is a man.\\" Michael is also given a new name, Baboon, as is a custom in the tribe. That night, Mimi-Siku undergoes the traditional rite of passage of his tribe, who then considers him to be a man. The tribal elder gives Mimi a special task: to become a tribal leader one day, Mimi must bring fire from the Statue of Liberty. A reluctant Michael, realizing his promise would have to be honored sooner than he realized, brings Mimi-Siku to New York with him. Charlotte is less than pleased about Mimi-Siku and his primitive ways. As Michael attempts to adapt Mimi-Siku to city life, cross-cultural misunderstandings occur when Mimi-Siku reverts to customs considered acceptable by his tribe. On climbing the Statue of Liberty to reach the flame, Mimi-Siku is disappointed when he sees that the fire is not real. While staying at the home of Michael's business partner Richard Kempster (Martin Short), Mimi-Siku falls in love with Richard's daughter Karen (Leelee Sobieski). He paints her face and gives her a new name, Ukume, as is the custom in his tribe. Richard resents Mimi's presence in his home due to his influence over Karen and because he cooked and ate his valuable, prize-winning Poecilia latipinna fish. Richard freaks out when he sees his daughter and Mimi together in a hammock and threatens to send her to an all-girls summer camp. The Kempsters and Michael are targeted by Alexei Jovanovic (David Ogden Stiers), a Russian mobster and caviar dealer, who believes that they have cheated him in a business deal. Jovanovic arrives at the Kempsters' and tortures Richard for info, and is prepared to cut off his fingers. By fighting together and utilizing Mimi-Siku's hunting skills (and his pet tarantula Maitika), the two families fight off Jovanovic's group. Mimi-Siku returns to the Amazon jungle, but before he leaves, his father gives him a satellite phone so they can stay in touch. Michael also presents Mimi with a Statue of Liberty cigarette lighter, which produces fire from the torch and will fulfill Mimi's quest. In return, Mimi gives his father a blowpipe and poisoned darts, telling Michael to practice and come to see him when he can hit flies. Shortly afterwards, Michael finds himself disheartened by the rat-race and realizes that his relationship with Charlotte is not working for him anymore. He attempts to kill a fly with his blowpipe on the trading floor of the New York Board of Trade. He hits the fly, but also Langston (Bob Dishy), his hot- tempered boss, who collapses asleep on the trading floor. Michael returns to Lipo-Lipo to see his son and ex-wife, bringing the Kempster family with him for a vacation. Karen and Mimi are reunited, and it is suggested that Michael and Patricia also resume their relationship. As the credits start rolling, Michael undergoes the rite of passage as Mimi did earlier.

The site's consensus states: \\"Tim Allen spends Jungle 2 Jungle annoyed and put upon, mirroring audiences' reaction as they struggle through this witless family comedy.\\" Roger Ebert, who deplored the original French version, Little Indian, Big City, confessed that he was hoping the Americanized remake would be better than the original version, due to it starring Tim Allen and Martin Short, whom he had admired as comic actors. Ebert was sorely disappointed by the film, giving it one star out of four, a small step from his original zero star rating for Little Indian, Big City.Jungle 2 Jungle review from RogerEbert.com On his television program Siskel and Ebert, Ebert said Jungle 2 Jungle was not as bad as Little Indian, Big City because it was \\"far too mediocre to be terrible.\\" He also described it as \\"lamebrained, boring, predictable, long, and slow\\", and added that while the French version was memorably bad, Jungle 2 Jungle was \\"just forgettable\\". Ebert's colleague Gene Siskel mildly disagreed, specifying that he felt Jungle 2 Jungle was just as bad as Little Indian, Big City. He also said he felt embarrassed for Allen and Short, as he felt they were used far better in other television programs and films. Siskel later went on to declare Jungle 2 Jungle the worst film of 1997. Retrieved April 5, 2013 At the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was listed as one of 30 dishonorable mentions for Worst Picture and was noted under the Founders Award, which lamented the year's biggest studio disgraces. Referencing Siskel's pick for worst film of the year (they called it \\"a horrendous embarrassment for Disney\\"), the Stinkers stated that it had \\"just as many laughs as Little Indian, Big City (zero) and we're being generous\\" and added that Disney needed to stop remaking so many films.

After fleeing his country during the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War, he became leader of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), a rebel group active in the West Nile region of Uganda during the 1990s.  Biography  Juma Abdalla Oris was born in northern Uganda, and was an ethnic Nubian. He was a Muslim.https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1977-80v17p2/d143 He received only minimal education, and eventually joined the Uganda Army, becoming a high-ranking colonel by the early 1970s. Following the 1971 Ugandan coup d'√©tat, he rose to one of the leading figures in Idi Amin's government. He first became acting foreign minister, and was appointed full foreign minister on 25 May 1975. He stayed in this position until 1978, while also serving as Minister of Information and Broadcasting. Following his takeover of the Information Ministry, a series of new directives and restrictions were handed down to the news industry. All newspapers had to print Amin's statements in full, and Radio Uganda and Uganda Television had to transmit them in full. In addition to this, the latter two had to open and close every broadcast with a daily national prayer. Oris also sharply criticised Uganda's two private newspapers, Munno and Taifa, for supposedly conveying false information about Amin because they were not printing the same stories as the government daily, the Voice of Uganda. He was regarded as follower of Vice President Mustafa Adrisi. Oris was fired from his ministerial portfolios by Amin in 1978, probably as part of a political purge following Adrisi's removal from power. In late 1978, Ugandan troops invaded neighboring Tanzania under unclear circumstances, causing the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War. Tanzania responded with a counter-invasion, and Amin's government began to collapse. Oris was one of the few Ugandan officers who remained loyal throughout most of the conflict. By 1979, he had been appointed Minister for Animal Resources and Minister of Lands. On 4 April 1979, Amin organized a four‚Äêmember war planning committee which consisted of his most trusted followers, including Oris. By this point, the Uganda Army had mostly disintegrated. After the Fall of Kampala, Oris fled with 3,000 cattle into exile to Sudan. He went on to join the Sudanese Armed Forces as a mercenary, and also became a member of the Former Uganda National Army, a pro-Amin rebel group that fought in the Ugandan Bush War. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Joseph Kony, the leader of the rebel group known as the Lord's Resistance Army claimed to be possessed by the spirit of Juma Oris. It appears he was unaware that Oris was at the time still alive‚Äîsomething which he discovered when the two men eventually met in person. Oris founded his own rebel army, called the \\"West Nile Bank Front\\" (WNBF), in 1994. Though founded in Zaire with the blessing of Mobutu Sese Seko, the group was mostly supported by the government of Sudan, as Mobutu's regime was already in terminal decline by this point. The WNBF fought for the seccession of the West Nile sub-region or the restoration of Idi Amin as President of Uganda. Oris managed to gain support in northern Uganda by exploiting ethnic tensions and the lack of development opportunities in the area, offering potential recruits money in exchange for joining the WNBF. While waging an insurgency against the Ugandan government, Oris allegedly to committed human rights violations by planting landmines in ambush attempts.SUDAN He also fought with his followers in the Second Sudanese Civil War on the side of the Sudanese government. In March 1997, the WNBF and its allies suffered a heavy defeat when South Sudanese rebels of the SPLA overran their bases in Zaire and Sudan, and then ambushed their retreating forces near Yei during Operation Thunderbolt. Oris was badly wounded during this battle, and the WNBF almost completely destroyed. Most WNBF fighters, including deputy commander Abdulatif Tiyua, were killed or captured. Oris and the remnants of his militia subsequently fled to Juba. From then on, the WNBF was \\"essentially spent\\" as fighting force. Having suffered a stroke in late 1999, Oris was bedridden from then on. His condition worsened in early 2001, and he died in Juba or Khartoum in March 2001. This disproved earlier reports according to which he had been killed in battle with the Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces. Oris was buried in Sudan.

Sokolsky was born in Saint-Petersburg, Russia, but for most of his life lived in Riga, Latvia (his father came from Ludzas County, which is where the family moved to after the revolutionary turmoil of 1917 began in Saint-Petersburg). There he worked as a woodcutter and loader, until in 1928 at Riga's 'Mars' cinema he first appeared on stage as a singer. Initially, he tried to imitate Alexander Vertinsky (for example, he too sang in a Pierrot costume), but later found his own style. He got acquainted with popular composer Oscar Strok, author of tango music, and became the first to sing all his new songs. In the same time, he himself wrote lyrics and music for several songs.

Early life Born in Hattem, Netherlands, on 21 October 1762, Daendels was the son of Burchard Johan Daendels, the mayoral secretary, and Josina Christina Tulleken. He studied law at the University of Harderwijk, acquiring his doctorate on 10 April 1783. Political activity In 1785, he sided with the Patriots, who had seized power in several Dutch cities. In 1786 he defended the city of Hattem against stadholderian troops. In 1787, he defended Amsterdam against the Prussian army that invaded the Netherlands to restore William V of Orange. After William V was in power again, he fled to France because of a death sentence. Daendels was a close witness to the French revolution. General Daendels Taking Leave of Lieutenant-Colonel Krayenhoff (1795) He returned to the Netherlands in 1794, as a general in the French revolutionary army of general Charles Pichegru and commander of the Batavian Legion. Daendels helped unitarian politician Pieter Vreede to power in a coup d'√©tat on 25 January 1798. The group behind Vreede was dissatisfied with the conservative-moderate majority in parliament, which tried to prevent the formulation of a more democratic, centralistic constitution. The reign of Vreede did not bring the expected results, however, and Daendels supported another coup d'√©tat against Vreede on 14 June 1798. In the Batavian Republic Daendels occupied several political offices, but he had to step down when he failed to prevent the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799, and he became a farmer in Heerde, Gelderland. Military and colonial career =Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies= Java Great Post Road, commissioned by Daendels. Louis Bonaparte made Daendels colonel-general in 1806 and Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies in 1807. After a long voyage, he arrived in the city of Batavia (now Jakarta) on 5 January 1808 and relieved the former Governor General, Albertus Henricus Wiese. His primary task was to rid the island of Java of the British Army. He built new hospitals and military barracks, a new arms factories in Surabaya and Semarang, and a new military college in Batavia. He demolished the Castle in Batavia and replaced it with a new fort at Meester Cornelis (Jatinegara), and built Fort Lodewijk (Fort Ludwig) in Surabaya. He also moved the central government from Old Batavia to Weltevreden, with a palace built in Paradeplaats. However, his best-known achievement was the construction of the Great Post Road () across northern Java from Anyer to Panarukan. The road now serves as the main road in the island of Java, called Jalur Pantura. The thousand-kilometre road was completed in only one year, during which thousands of Javanese forced labourers died.Pramoedya sheds light on dark side of Daendels' highway. The Jakarta Post 8 January 2006. He displayed a firm attitude towards the Javanese rulers, with the result that the rulers were willing to work with the British against the Dutch. He also subjected the population of Java to forced labour (Rodi). There were some rebellious actions against this, such as those in Cadas Pangeran, West Java. There is considerable debate as to whether he increased the efficiency of the local bureaucracy and reduced corruption, although he certainly enriched himself during this period. Daendels failed to stop the British Invasion of the Spice Islands in 1810 despite improving the defences. =General in Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e= When the Kingdom of Holland was incorporated into France in 1810, Daendels returned to Holland. He was appointed a Divisional General (Major General) and commanded the 26th Division of the Grande Arm√©e in Napoleon's invasion of Russia. =Governor-General of the Dutch Gold Coast= After the fall of Napoleon, king Willem I and the new Dutch government feared that Daendels could become an influential and powerful opposition leader and effectively banned him from the Netherlands by appointing him Governor-General of the Dutch Gold Coast (now part of Ghana). In the aftermath of the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, Daendels tried to redevelop the rather dilapidated Dutch possessions as an African plantation colony driven by legitimate trade. Drawing on his experience from the East Indies, he came up with some very ambitious infrastructural projects, including a comprehensive road system, with a main road connecting Elmina and Kumasi in Ashanti. The Dutch government gave him a free hand and a substantial budget to implement his plans. At the same time, however, Daendels regarded his governorship as an opportunity to establish a private business monopoly in the Dutch Gold Coast. In 1817, the British accused Daendels of aiding and abetting the slave trade ‚Äì which had by then been prohibited by both the British and the Dutch nations ‚Äì from his position at the Elmina fort which was then under Dutch control. \\"We deem it our duty to inform you of the conduct of General Daendels who is acting independent of his Government\\", the British Governor of Cape Coast, John Smith, wrote to the African Committee in Parliament in London on 5 March 1817. \\"Portuguese vessels are furnished with canoes, and Spaniards supplied with water. The beginning of last month a large Spanish ship was four days at anchor in Elmina roads, receiving water and bartering dollars for such goods as were suited for the purchase of slaves.\\"Metcalfe, The Last Years of the Company of Merchants, 1807‚Äì1821, p. 38 Eventually none of the plans came to fruition, as Daendels died of malaria in the castle of St. George d'Elmina, the Dutch seat of government, on 2 May 1818. His body was interred in the central tomb at the Dutch cemetery in Elmina. He had been in the country less than two years.

It is known by the common names ribwort plantain, narrowleaf plantain, English plantain, ribleaf, lamb's tongue, and buckhorn. It is a common weed on cultivated or disturbed land. Description The plant is a rosette-forming perennial herb, with leafless, silky, hairy flower stems (). The basal leaves are lanceolate spreading or erect, scarcely toothed with 3-5 strong parallel veins narrowed to a short petiole. The flower stalk is deeply furrowed, ending in an ovoid inflorescence of many small flowers each with a pointed bract. Each flower can produce up to two hundred seeds. Flowers are (calyx green, corolla brownish), 4 bent back lobes with brown midribs and long white stamens. It is native to temperate Eurasia, widespread throughout the British Isles, but scarce on the most acidic soils (pH < 4.5). It is present and widespread in the Americas and Australia as an introduced species. Distribution Plantago lanceolata is native to Eurasia, but has been introduced to North America and many other parts of the world with suitable habitats. History Plantago lanceolata (Japan) An inflorescence that has set seeds. Considered to be an indicator of agriculture in pollen diagrams, P. lanceolata has been found in western Norway from the Early Neolithic onwards, which is considered an indicator of grazing in that area at the time. This would make sense, as P. lanceolata thrives in open fields where livestock are frequently disturbing the ground. Uses Plantago lanceolata is used frequently in herbal teas and other herbal remedies.Val plantes herbal ice tea A tea from the leaves is used as a cough medicine. In the traditional Austrian medicine Plantago lanceolata leaves have been used internally (as syrup or tea) or externally (fresh leaves) for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, skin, insect bites, and infections. Songbirds eat the seeds, and the leaves are eaten by rabbits. Chemistry Plantago lanceolata contains phenylethanoids such as acteoside (verbascoside), cistanoside F, lavandulifolioside, plantamajoside and isoacteoside.Phenylethanoids in the Herb of Plantago lanceolata and Inhibitory Effect on Arachidonic Acid-Induced Mouse Ear Edema. Michiko Murai (nee Sasahara), Yasuhiko Tamayama and Sansei Nishibe, Planta Med., 1995;, volume 61, issue 5, pages 479-480, It also contains the iridoid glycosides aucubin and catalpol.Genetic variation in defensive chemistry in Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae) and its effect on the specialist herbivore Junonia coenia (Nymphalidae). Lynn S. Adler, Johanna Schmitt and M. Deane Bowers, Oecologia, January 1995, Volume 101, Issue 1, pages 75-85, These iridoid glycosides make the plant inedible to some herbivores, but others are unperturbed by them--for example, the buckeye butterfly Junonia coenia, whose larvae eat the leaves of P. lanceolata and ingest the iridoid glycosides to make themselves unpalatable to predators. Habitat Plantago lanceolata can live anywhere from very dry meadows to places similar to a rain forest, but it does best in open, disturbed areas. It is therefore common near roadsides where other plants cannot flourish; it grows tall if it can do so, but in frequently-mowed areas it adopts a flat growth habit instead. Historically, the plant has thrived in areas where ungulates graze and turn up the earth with their hooves. Reproduction The mode of reproduction can vary among populations of P. lanceolata.Jousimo, Jussi. 2014. Ecological and evolutionary effects of fragmentation on infectious disease dynamics. Science AAAS Journal. Science 344, 1289-1293. Reproduction occurs sexually, with the pollen being wind dispersed for the most part, though the plant is occasionally pollinated by bees. P. lanceolata cannot self (reproduce asexually) in the way that many other species of Plantago can; instead, it is an obligate outcrosser.  Enemies  = Insect predation = Plantago lanceolata is host to many different species of the order Lepidoptera. Species such as Junonia coenia, Spilosoma congrua, and Melitaea cinxia lay their eggs on P. lanceolata plants so they can serve as a food source for the larvae when they hatch. The iridoid glycosides in the plant leaves accumulate in the caterpillars and make them unpalatable to predators. =Infection by powdery mildew= Podosphaera plantaginis is a powdery mildew fungus that infects P. lanceolata. All of the P. lanceolata populations are infected by several strains of this powdery mildew fungus.Laiine, Anna Lisa. 2004. Resistance variation within and among host populations in a plant- pathogen metapopulation: implications for regional pathogen dynamics. Journal of Ecology 92, 990-1000. Once the populations are infected, the symptoms are minimal at first. Then, after a few weeks or months lesions start to appear covering the entire surface of the leaves and the stem, making it very noticeable. Another species that infects P. lanceolata is Golovinomyces sordidus. Both of these mildews are obligate biotrophs, meaning that they can only infect living tissue. They cover the surface of the leaves and extend hyphae into the cell matrix in order to extract nutrients. Resistance to powdery mildew After the populations are infected, they react in different ways. Some populations of P. lanceolata are more susceptible to different strains of powdery mildew. Also, some populations have multiple resistance phenotypes where on the other hand, others may only have one resistance phenotype.Laiine, Anna Lisa. 2005. Journal of Evolutionary Biology. Journal of Evolutionary Biology. 18, 930-938. Overall, the populations that have the highest variety of resistance phenotypes will have the highest survival rates particularly when rates of infection are high. In popular culture In the UK and Ireland the plant is used by children to play various simple games. In Edinburgh, Scotland this game is called ‚ÄòThe 1 o‚Äôclock gun‚Äô after the gun that fires everyday from Edinburgh Castle. Writer Sean Michael Wilson notes that: \\"When I was a kid in Edinburgh we used it for a cute wee game called ‚ÄòThe 1 o‚Äôclock gun‚Äô - we twisted the stalk around into a kind of noose, quickly pulled it (with the left hand pulling back sharply and the right hand moving forward) and then the head of the stalk would go shooting off. Piitttt!! We used to see how far we could get it to go - great fun.\\" In the West Country of England the same game is called 'cannonballs'. Another game played with the plant in Scotland and Ireland and possibly also in England is called 'Bishops'. This game is a bit like conkers; a child tries to knock off the head of their friend's stalk using their own stalk, via a fast downward thrust.

Philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle also act as doxographers, as their comments on the ideas of their predecessors indirectly tell us what their predecessors' beliefs were. Plato's Defense of Socrates, for example, tells us much of what we know about the natural philosophy of Anaxagoras.

The palace has of floor space and contains 3,418 rooms. It is the largest functioning royal palace and the largest by floor area in Europe. King Felipe VI and the royal family do not reside in the palace, choosing instead the significantly more modest Palace of Zarzuela on the outskirts of Madrid. The palace is now open to the public, except during state functions, although it is so large that only a selection of the best rooms are on the visitor route at any one time, the route being changed every few months. An admission fee of ‚Ç¨13 is charged; however, at some times it is free. The palace is owned by the Spanish state and administered by the Patrimonio Nacional, a public agency of the Ministry of the Presidency. The palace is on Calle de Bail√©n (\\"Bail√©n Street\\") in the western part of downtown Madrid, east of the Manzanares River, and is accessible from the √ìpera metro station. The palace is on the site of a 9th-century Moorish Alc√°zar, near the town of Magerit, constructed as an outpost by Muhammad I of C√≥rdoba and inherited after 1036 by the independent Moorish Taifa of Toledo. After Madrid fell to King Alfonso VI of Castile in 1083, the edifice was only rarely used by the kings of Castile. In 1329, King Alfonso XI of Castile convened the Cortes of Madrid for the first time. King Felipe II moved his court to Madrid in 1561. The Castilian Alc√°zar was on the site, mostly built in the 16th century. After it burned down on 24 December 1734, King Felipe V ordered a new palace built on the same site. Construction spanned the years 1738 to 1755 and followed a Berniniesque design by Filippo Juvarra and Giovanni Battista Sacchetti in cooperation with Ventura Rodr√≠guez, Francesco Sabatini, and Mart√≠n Sarmiento. King Carlos III first occupied the new palace in 1764. The last monarch who lived continuously in the palace was King Alfonso XIII, although Manuel Aza√±a, president of the Second Republic, also inhabited it, making him the last head of state to do so. During that period the palace was known as \\"Palacio Nacional\\". There is still a room next to the Real Capilla, which is known by the name \\"Office of Aza√±a\\". The interior of the palace is notable for its wealth of art and the use of many types of fine materials in the construction and the decoration of its rooms. It includes paintings by artists such as Caravaggio, Juan de Flandes, Francisco de Goya, and Vel√°zquez, and frescoes by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Corrado Giaquinto, and Anton Raphael Mengs. Other collections of great historical and artistic importance preserved in the building include the Royal Armoury of Madrid, porcelain, watches, furniture, silverware, and the world's only complete Stradivarius string quintet.  History of the building  Historical evolution of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid. The palace was initially built by Muhammad I, Umayyad Emir of Cordoba, between 860 and 880. After the Moors were driven out of Toledo in the 11th century, the castle retained its defensive function. Henry III of Castile added several towers. His son John II used it as a royal residence. During the War of the Castilian Succession (1476) the troops of Joanna la Beltraneja were besieged in the Alc√°zar, during which the building suffered severe damage. The only drawing of the castle from the Middle Ages is one from 1534 by Cornelius Vermeyen. Emperor Charles V, with the architects Alonso de Covarrubias and Luis de Vega, extended and renovated the castle in 1537. Philip II made Madrid his capital in 1561 and continued the renovations, with new additions. Philip III added a long southern facade between 1610 and 1636. Philip V of Bourbon renovated the royal apartments in 1700. The Alc√°zar of the Habsburgs was austere in comparison to the Palace of Versailles where the new king had spent his childhood; and he began a series of redesigns mainly planned by Teodoro Ardemans and Ren√© Carlier, with the main rooms being redecorated by Queen Maria Luisa of Savoy and the Princess of Ursins in the style of French palaces. = The baroque palace = View of part of the Royal Palace from Cuesta de la Vega, by Fernando Brambila (c. 1790-1832). Preserved in the collection of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. On Christmas Eve 1734, the Alc√°zar was destroyed by a fire that originated in the rooms of the French painter Jean Ranc. Response to the fire was delayed due to the warning bells being confused with the call to mass. For fear of looting, the doors of the building remained closed, hampering rescue efforts. Many works of art were lost, such as the Expulsion of the Moors, by Diego Vel√°zquez. Others, such as Las Meninas, were rescued by tossing them out the windows. Fortunately, many pieces were saved because shortly before the blaze the king ordered that much of his collection be moved to the Buen Retiro Palace. This fire lasted four days and completely destroyed the old Alc√°zar, whose remaining walls were finally demolished in 1738. Italian architect Filippo Juvarra oversaw work on the new palace and devised a lavish project of enormous proportions inspired by Bernini's plans for Versailles. This plan was not realized, due to Juvarra's untimely death in March 1736. His disciple Giambattista Sacchetti, also known as Juan Bautista Sacchetti or Giovanni Battista Sacchetti, was chosen to continue the work of his mentor. Sacchetti designed the structure to encompass a large square courtyard and resolved sightline problems by creating projecting wings. In 1760, Charles III called upon Sicilian Francesco Sabatini, a Neoclassical architect, to enlarge the building. Sabatini's original idea was to frame the Plaza de la Armer√≠a with a series of galleries and arcades, to accommodate various dependencies, by constructing two wings along the square. Only the extension of the southeast tower known as la de San Gil was completed. Sabatini also planned to extend the north side with a large wing that echoed the style of the main building and included three square courtyards that would be smaller than the large central courtyard. Work on this expansion started quickly but was soon interrupted, leaving the foundations buried under a platform on which the royal stables were later built. The stables were demolished in the 20th century and replaced by the Sabatini Gardens. Charles III first occupied the palace in 1764. In the 19th century, Ferdinand VII, who spent many years imprisoned in the Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay, began the most thorough renovation of the palace. The aim of this redesign was to turn the old-fashioned Italian-style building into a modern French-style palace. However, his grandson Alfonso XII proposed to turn the palace into a Victorian-style residence. Alfonso's plans were designed by the architect Jos√© Segundo de Lema and consisted of remodeling several rooms, replacing marble floors with parquet, and adding period furniture. In the twentieth century, restoration work was needed to repair damage suffered during the Spanish Civil War, by repairing or reinstalling decoration and decorative trim and replacing damaged walls with faithful reproductions of the originals.  Exterior One of the entrances to the Palace. Detail of the facade over the Prince's Gate. Reccared II and Liuva II, Visigoth kings, flanking the arms of Spain. The statues do not match the names on the bases. The main facade of the Palace, the one facing the Plaza de la Armeria, consists of a two-story rusticated stone base, from which rise Ionic columns on Tuscan pilasters framing the windows of the three main floors. The upper story is hidden behind a cornice which encircles the building and is capped with a large balustrade. This was adorned with a series of statues of saints and kings, but these were relocated elsewhere under the reign of Charles III to give the building a more classical appearance. The restoration of the facade in 1973, which includes Sabitini's balcony of four Doric columns, returned some of Sachetti's sculptures. These include statues of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II and the Inca emperor Atahualpa, works by Juan Pascual de Mena and Domingo Mart√≠nez, respectively. Representations of the Roman emperors Honorius, Theodosius I, and Arcadius by G.D. Olivieri, and Trajan by Felipe de Castro were placed in the Prince's courtyard. Flanking Sabatini's clock the Statues of Philip V, Ferdinand VI, Barbara of Braganza and Maria Luisa of Savoy interspersed with The Rising Sun Following the Zodiac. Above the clock is the royal coat of arms flanked by angels, and, above that, bells that date from 1637 and 1761. = Plaza de la Armer√≠a = View from the Plaza de la Armeria The square as it exists now was laid-out in 1892, according to a plan by the architect Enrique Mar√≠a Repull√©s. However, the history of this square dates back to 1553, the year in which Philip II ordered a building to house the royal stables. The Almudena Cathedral faces the palace across the plaza. Its exterior is neo-classical to match its surroundings while its interior is neo-gothic. Construction was funded by King Alfonso XII to house the remains of his wife Mercedes of Orl√©ans. Construction of the church began in 1878 and concluded in 1992. Narciso Pascual Colomer, the same architect who crafted the Plaza de Oriente, designed the layout of the plaza in 1879, but failed to materialize. The site now occupied by the Plaza de la Armer√≠a was used for many decades as anteplaza de armas. Sachetti tried to build a cathedral to finish the cornice of the Manzanares, and Sabatini proposed to unite this building with the royal palace, to form a single block. Both projects were ignored by Charles III. √Ångel Fern√°ndez de los R√≠os in 1868 proposed the creation of a large wooded area that would travel all around the Plaza de Oriente, in order to give a better view of the Royal Palace. A decade later Segundo de Lema added a staircase to the original design of Fern√°ndez, which led to the idea of Francisco de Cubas to give more importance to the emerging church of Almudena. = Plaza de Oriente = The Plaza de Oriente is a rectangular park that connects the east facade of Palacio Real to the Teatro Real. The eastern side of plaza is curved and bordered by several cafes in the adjoining buildings. Although the plaza was part of Sacchetti's plan for the palace, construction did not begin until 1808 when King Joseph Bonaparte, who ordered the demolition of approximately 60 medieval structures, that included a church, monastery and royal library, located on the site. Joseph was deposed before construction was completed, it was finished by Queen Isabella II who tasked architect Narciso Pascual Colomer with creating the final design in 1844. Statues of the Gothic kings in the Plaza de Oriente. Pathways divide the Plaza into three main plots: the Central Gardens, the Cabo Noval Gardens and the Lepanto Gardens. The Central Gardens are arranged in a grid around the central monument to Philip IV, following the Baroque model garden. They consist of seven flowerbeds, each bordered with box hedges and holding small cypress, yew and magnolias and annual flowers. The north and south boundaries of the Central Gardens are marked by a row of statues, popularly known as the Gothic kings‚Äî sculptures representing five Visigoth rulers and fifteen rulers of the early Christian kingdoms in the Reconquista. They are carved from limestone, and are part of a series dedicated to all monarchs of Spain. These were ordered for the decoration of the Palacio Real and were executed between 1750 and 1753. Engineers felt the statues were too heavy for the palace balustrade, so they were left on ground level where their lack of fine detail is readily apparent. The remainder of the statues are in the Sabatini Gardens. Isabel II laid out the grounds so that Pietro Tacca's equestrian statue of Philip IV was placed in the center, opposite the Prince's Gate. = Campo del Moro Gardens = View of Paseo Principal, part of Campo del Moro Gardens. These gardens are so named because the Muslim leader Ali ben Yusuf allegedly camped here with his troops in 1109 during an attempted reconquest of Madrid. The first improvements to the area occurred under King Philip IV, who built fountains and planted various types of vegetation, but its overall look remained largely neglected. During the construction of the palace various landscaping projects were put forth based on the gardens of the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, but lack of funds hampered further improvement until the reign of Isabel II who began work in earnest. Following the taste of the times, the park was designed in the Romanticist style. The Triton fountain from the Islet Garden of Aranjuez and the Fountain of the Shells from the Palace of the Infante Luis at Boadilla del Monte were aligned in the center of the right angled pathways by Isabel II, according to plans by Narciso Pascual Colomer. Under the regency of Maria Christina of Austria, the park was reformed according to Ramon Oliva's romanticism plans. Between the Fountain of Tritons and the palace is The Large Cavern or Grotto (Camellia House), built by Juan de Villanueva during the reign of Joseph Bonaparte. Sacchetti's 1757-1758 Little Cavern or Grotto (Potato Room) is in front of the Parade Ground. = Sabatini Gardens = View from the Sabatini Gardens. The Sabatini Gardens adjoin the north side of the Palacio real and extend to the calle de Bail√©n and the cuesta de San Vicente. The garden follows the symmetrical French design and work began in 1933, under the Republican government. Although they were designed by Zaragozan architect Fernando Garc√≠a Mercadal, they were named for Francesco Sabatini who designed the royal stables that previously occupied this site. These gardens feature a large rectangular pond which is surrounded by four fountains and statues of Spanish kings which were originally intended to crown the Royal Palace. Geometrically sited between its rides, there are several fountains. The Republican government constructed the gardens to return the area from control of the royal family to the people, the public was not allowed in the gardens until 1978 when they were opened by King Juan Carlos I.  Interior of the palace  = Ground Floor =  Grand Staircase  Giaquinto's fresco above the staircase Built by Sabatini in 1789 when Charles IV wanted it moved to the opposite side of where Sabatini placed it in 1760, it is composed of a single piece of San Agustin marble. Two lions grace the landing, one by Felipe de Castro and another by Robert Michel. The frescoes on the ceiling is by Corrado Giaquinto and depicts Religion Protected by Spain. On the ground floor is a statue of Charles III in Roman toga, with a similar statue on the first floor depicting Charles IV. The four cartouches at the corners depict the elements of water, earth, air and fire.  Royal Library  The Royal Library was moved to the lower floor during the regency of Maria Christina. The bookshelves date from the period of Charles III, Isabel II and Alfonso XII. Highlights of the collection include the Book of hours of Isabella I of Castile, a codex of the time of Alfonso XI of Castile, a Bible of Do√±a Mar√≠a de Molina and the Fiestas reales, dedicated to Ferdinand VI by Farinelli. Also important are the maps kept in the library, which analyze the extent of the kingdoms under the Spanish Empire. Also on display a selection of the best medals from the Royal Collection. Royal Pharmacy. The bookcovers demonstrate evolution of binding styles by era. Examples in the holdings include Rococo in gold with iron lace, Neoclassical in polychrome and Romantic with Gothic and Renaissance motifs. The Archives of the Royal Palace contains approximately twenty thousand articles ranging from the Disastrous decade (1823-1833) to the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. In addition, it holds some scores of musicians of the Royal Chapel, privileges of various kings, the founding order of the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, the testament of Philip II and correspondence of most of the kings of the House of Bourbon.  Royal Pharmacy  During the reign of Felipe II the Royal Pharmacy became an appendage of the royal household and ordered the supply of medicines, a role that continues today. The collection includes jars made by La Granja de San Ildefonso, 19th century, and Talavera de la Reina pottery, 18th century.  Royal Armory  Royal Armory Along with the Imperial Armoury of Vienna, the armory is considered one of the best in the world and consists of pieces as early as the 13th century. The building, designed by J.S. de Lema and E. Repulles, was opened in 1897 The collection highlights the tournament pieces made for Charles V and Philip II by the leading armourers of Milan and Augsburg. Among the most remarkable works are full armour and weapons that Emperor Charles V used in the Battle of M√ºhlberg, and which was portrayed by Titian in his famous equestrian portrait housed at the Museo del Prado. Unfortunately, parts of the collection were lost during the Peninsular War and during the Spanish Civil War. Still, the armoury retains some of the most important pieces of this art in Europe and the world, including a shield and burgonet by Francesco and Filippo Negroli, one of the most famous designers in the armourers' guild. = First floor =  King Charles III's Apartments  The Halberdier's Room, or Guard Room, was designed by Sabatini, and includes the fresco by Tiepolo, Venus and Vulcan. Two paintings by Luca Giordano depict scenes from the life of Solomon. The Hall of Columns has a ceiling fresco by Giaquinto, representing The Sun before Which All the Forces of Nature Awaken and Rejoice, an allegory of the king as Apollo. An 1878 bronze statue of Charles V Vanquishing Fury is by Ferdinand Barbedienne. The bronze chandeliers were made in Paris in 1846, and installed by Isbella II for her balls. The Throne Room dates from Charles III in 1772, and features Tiepolo's ceiling fresco, The Apotheosis of the Spanish Monarchy. Bronze sculptures include the Four Cardinal Virtues, four of the Seven Planets, Satyr, Germanicus, and four Medici lions flanking the dual throne. Charles III's Anteroom (Saleta) contains a 1774 ceiling fresco Apotheosis of Trajan by A.R. Mengs. The Antechamber of Charles III (The Conversation Room) also contains a ceiling fresco by Mengs, The Apotheosis of Hercules. This room has four royal family portraits by Goya.  The Queen's apartments and banqueting hall  Formerly the queen's apartments under Charles III, the three rooms were converted into a banquet hall by Alfonso XII in 1879, and completed in 1885. The three ceiling frescoes remained though, Dawn in Her Chariot by Raphael Mengs, Christopher Columbus Offering the New World to the Catholic Monarchs by Alejandro Gonz√°lez Vel√°zquez, and Boabdil Giving the Keys to Granada to the Catholic Monarchs by Francisco Bayeu y Sub√≠as.

He was subsequently convicted of war crimes and sentenced to 29 years in prison. Background Milo≈°eviƒá was an officer in the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) prior to 1992. The JNA posted Milo≈°eviƒá to Lukavica, near Sarajevo which is where he was when the war began. He succeeded Stanislav Galiƒá as commander of the SRK on 10 August 1994 and remained in that position until the end of the war. In December 2004, he surrendered to the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), before which he faced charges for four counts of crimes against humanity and three counts of violations of the laws or customs of war.

History E-Taf automatic door In the 1st century AD, mathematician Heron of Alexandria in Roman Egypt invented the first known automatic door. He described two different automatic door applications. The first application used heat from a fire lit by the city's temple priest. After a few hours atmospheric pressure built up in a brass vessel causing it to pump water into adjacent containers. These containers acted as weights that, through a series of ropes and pulleys, would open the temple's doors at about the time people were to arrive for prayer. Heron used a similar application to open the gates to the city. In 1931, engineers Horace H. Raymond and Sheldon S. Roby of the tool and hardware manufacturer Stanley Works designed the first model of an optical device triggering the opening of an automatic door. The invention was patented and installed in Wilcox's Pier Restaurant in West Haven, Connecticut for the benefit of waiters carrying plates of food and drink.

He was one of the lead developers of the structured analysis techniques of the 1970s and a co-developer of both the Yourdon/Whitehead method for object-oriented analysis/design in the late 1980s and the Coad/Yourdon methodology for object-oriented analysis/design in the 1990s.  Biography  Yourdon obtained his B.S. in applied mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1965, and did graduate work in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and the Polytechnic Institute of New York. In 1964 Yourdon started working at Digital Equipment Corporation developing FORTRAN programs for the PDP-5 minicomputer and later assembler for the PDP-8. In the late 1960s and early 1970s he worked at a small consulting firm and as an independent consultant. In 1974 Yourdon founded his own consulting firm, YOURDON Inc., to provide educational, publishing, and consulting services. After he sold this firm in 1986 he served on the Board of multiple IT consultancy corporations and was advisor on several research project in the software industry throughout the 1990s. In June 1997, Yourdon was inducted into the Computer Hall of Fame, along with such notables as Charles Babbage, James Martin, Grace Hopper, and Gerald Weinberg. In December 1999 Crosstalk: The Journal of Defense Software Engineering named him one of the ten most influential people in the software field.Yourdon CV, 2007, revision 51407 , retrieved online: May 16, 2009 In the late 1990s, Yourdon became the center of controversy over his beliefs that Y2K-related computer problems could result in severe software failures that would culminate in widespread social collapse. Due to the efforts of Yourdon and thousands of dedicated technologists, developers and project managers, these potential critical system failure points were successfully remediated, thus avoiding the problems Yourdon and others identified early enough to make a difference. In the new millennium, Yourdon became Faculty Fellow at the Information Systems Research Center of the University of North Texas as well as Fellow of the Business Technology Trends Council for the Cutter Consortium, where he also was editor of the Cutter IT Journal.Cutter IT Journal website. Accessed November 17, 2008.  Work  After developing structured analysis techniques of the 1970s, and object-oriented analysis/design in the late 1980s and 1990s, in the new millennium Yourdon specialized in project management, software engineering methodologies, and Web 2.0 development.About Ed Yourdon at yourdon.com, 2007. Accessed October 26, 2009. He also founded and published American Programmer magazine (now titled Cutter IT Journal). He is the author of the book Decline and Fall of the American Programmer. = Yourdon Inc. = In 1974, Yourdon founded the consulting firm Yourdon Inc. in New York, which provided consulting, educational and publishing in the field of software engineering. In the early 1980s, the company had multiple offices in North America and Europe and a staff of 150 people. They trained over 250,000 people in the topics of structured programming, structured design, structured analysis, logical data modeling and project management. In 1986, Yourdon sold the consulting company. It later became part of the Canadian (Qu√©bec) software company CGI Informatique. The publishing division had published over 150 books on software engineering topics before it became part of Prentice Hall. = Yourdon structured method = In the 1980s Yourdon developed the Yourdon structured method (YSM) in SSADM based on the functional structuring. The method supports two distinct design phases: analysis and design. YSM includes three discrete steps: the feasibility study; essential modeling; and implementation modeling.Alan M. Davis, Marilyn D. Weidner (1993). Software Requirements: Objects, Functions, and States. Page 486. It offers a series of models:Jim Cooling (2003). Software Engineering for Real-time Systems. p. 510-517. * The behavioral model: states that system behavior can be described in three ways: functions, dynamics and relationships. * The processor environment model (PEM): describes the allocation of computing functions in processor hardware. * The software environment model (SEM): defines the software architecture and its effects from each processor. * The code organizational model (COM): shows the modular structure of each task The Yourdon structured method (YSM) and structured analysis and design technique (SADT) are examples of structured design methods. = Year 2000 (Y2K) problem = During the late 1990s, he was one of the leading proponents of the theory that the 'Y2K bug' could lead to a collapse of civilization, or at least protracted economic depression and technological breakdown on a wide scale. He wrote several books on the subject, including Time Bomb 2000 (), and produced at least one video putting forth that theory (and offering advice on how to survive the coming crisis). Yourdon was criticized by some when his predictions (vigorously refuted by some experts in advance) failed to materialize at the scale predicted. This may have caused him to lose credibility with some in the software industry.  Final years and death  In his final years, Yourdon served as an internationally recognized expert witness and computer consultant specializing in project management, software engineering methodologies, and Web 2.0 development. He died on January 20, 2016, as a result of a post-surgical blood infection.  Personal life  Yourdon was married to Toni Nash. He had three children; daughter Jennifer, and sons Jamie and David. He also had five grandchildren; Liam Christopher, Owen Edward, Edward Roland (\\"Teddy\\"), Elliot Ann, and Khalil Slice. Yourdon had five sisters; Toni, Teri, Tina, Aleda, and Patrice. Yourdon was also an avid photographer whose photos were published in The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Forbes, Time/CNN, New York Observer, New York magazine, Wired, and the Huffington Post.Ed Yourdon's Flickr  Publications  Yourdon authored over 550 technical articles and authored or coauthored 26 computer books since 1967.

Life The son of John Nicholson, a biblical scholar, and his wife Annie Elizabeth Waring, he was born at Penrith, Cumbria on 11 September 1844. His younger sister was the writer Annie Elizabeth Nicholson Ireland. He was educated at Appleby Grammar School and then studied Sciences at the universities of G√∂ttingen (Ph.D., 1866) and Edinburgh (D.Sc., 1867; M.D., 1869). Geology had early attracted his attention, and his first publication was a thesis for his D.Sc. degree titled On the Geology of Cumberland and Westmoreland (1868). In 1869 he began lecturing in Natural History at the extra-mural classes linked to Edinburgh University. In 1871 he was appointed professor of natural history in the University of Toronto; in 1874 professor of biology in the Durham College of Science and in 1875 professor of natural history in the University of St. Andrews. This last post he held until 1882, when he became Regius Professor of natural history in the University of Aberdeen. In 1870 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Peter Handyside. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1897. His original work was mainly on fossil invertebrata (graptolites, stromatoporoids and corals); but he did much field work, especially in the Lake District, where he labored in company with Robert Harkness and afterwards with John Edward Marr. He was awarded the Lyell Medal by the Geological Society in 1888. In 1898 he promoted Alfred William Gibb as the first Professor of Geology at Aberdeen University. Nicholson retired in 1899.http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid;=8372061 He died at Aberdeen on 19 January 1899.

First produced in the 1930s, it is marketed under many trade names. It can be found as pure PCP, or as the sodium salt of PCP, the latter of which dissolves easily in water. It can be biodegraded by some bacteria, including Sphingobium chlorophenolicum. Uses PCP has been used as a herbicide, insecticide, fungicide, algaecide, and disinfectant and as an ingredient in antifouling paint. Some applications were in agricultural seeds (for nonfood uses), leather, masonry, wood preservation, cooling-tower water, rope, and paper. Its use has declined due to its high toxicity and slow biodegradation. Two general methods are used for preserving wood. The pressure process method involves placing wood in a pressure-treating vessel, where it is immersed in PCP and then subjected to applied pressure. In the nonpressure process method, PCP is applied by spraying, brushing, dipping, or soaking. Pentachlorophenol esters can be used as active esters in peptide synthesis, much like more popular pentafluorophenyl esters. Exposure People may be exposed to PCP in occupational settings through the inhalation of contaminated workplace air and dermal contact with wood products treated with PCP. Also, general population exposure may occur through contact with contaminated environment media, particularly in the vicinity of wood-treatment facilities and hazardous-waste sites. In addition, some other important routes of exposure seem to be the inhalation of contaminated air, ingestion of contaminated ground water used as a source of drinking water, ingestion of contaminated food, and dermal contact with soils or products treated with the chemical.ToxFAQs for Chlorophenols, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Toxicity Short-term exposure to large amounts of PCP can cause harmful effects on the liver, kidneys, blood, lungs, nervous system, immune system, and gastrointestinal tract. Elevated temperature, profuse sweating, uncoordinated movement, muscle twitching, and coma are additional side effects. Contact with PCP (particularly in the form of vapor) can irritate the skin, eyes, and mouth. Long-term exposure to low levels, such as those that occur in the workplace, can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, and nervous system. Finally, exposure to PCP is also associated with carcinogenic, renal, and neurological effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency toxicity class classifies PCP in group B2 (probable human carcinogen). =Monitoring of human exposure= Pentachlorophenol may be measured in plasma or urine as an index of excessive exposure. This is usually performed by gas chromatography with electron-capture or mass-spectrometric detection. Since urine contains predominantly conjugated PCP in chronic exposure situations, prior hydrolysis of specimens is recommended. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure to PCP are 5 mg/l in an end-of-shift plasma specimen and 2 mg/g creatinine in an end-of-shift urine specimen.Edgerton TR, Moseman RF. Determination of pentachlorophenol in urine: the importance of hydrolysis. J. Agr. Food Chem. 27: 197-199, 1979.ACGIH. 2009 TLVs and BEIs. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, Cincinnati, Ohio, 2009.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, California, 2008, pp. 1197-1200. Absorption in humans and animals PCP is quickly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract following ingestion. Accumulation is not common, but if it does occur, the major sites are the liver, kidneys, plasma protein, spleen, and fat. Unless kidney and liver functions are impaired, PCP is quickly eliminated from tissues and blood, and is excreted, mainly unchanged or in conjugated form, via the urine. Single doses of PCP have half- lives in blood of 30 to 50 hours in humans. Biomagnification of PCP in the food chain is not thought to be significant due to the fairly rapid metabolism of the compound by exposed organisms. Releases to the environment PCP has been detected in surface waters and sediments, rainwater, drinking water, aquatic organisms, soil, and food, as well as in human milk, adipose tissue, and urine. As PCP is generally used for its properties as a biocidal agent, considerable concern exists about adverse ecosystem effects in areas of PCP contamination. Releases to the environment are decreasing as a result of declining consumption and changing use methods. However, PCP is still released to surface waters from the atmosphere by wet deposition, from soil by run off and leaching, and from manufacturing and processing facilities. PCP is released directly into the atmosphere via volatilization from treated wood products and during production. Finally, releases to the soil can be by leaching from treated wood products, atmospheric deposition in precipitation (such as rain and snow), spills at industrial facilities, and at hazardous waste sites. After PCP is released into the atmosphere, it decomposes through photolysis. The main biodegradative pathway for PCP is reductive dehalogenation. In this process, the compound PCP is broken down to tetrachlorophenols, trichlorophenols, and dichlorophenols. Another pathway is methylation to pentachloroanisole (a more lipid-soluble compound). These two methods eventually lead to ring cleavage and complete degradation. In shallow waters, PCP is also quickly removed by photolysis. In deep or turbid water processes, sorption and biodegradation take place. In reductive soil and sediments, PCP can be degraded within 14 days to 5 years, depending on the anaerobic soil bacteria that are present. However, adsorption of PCP in soils is pH dependent because it increases under acidic conditions and decreases in neutral and basic conditions. Synthesis PCP can be produced by the chlorination of phenol in the presence of catalyst (anhydrous aluminium or ferric chloride) and a temperature up to about 191¬∞C. This process does not result in complete chlorination and commercial PCP is only 84-90% pure. The main contaminants include other polychlorinated phenols, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. Some of these species are even more toxic than the PCP itself. Pentachlorophenol by country In May 2015, countries which have signed the Stockholm Convention voted 90-2 to ban pentachlorophenol use. The United States is not a signatory and has not banned the chemical. =New Zealand= PCP was used in New Zealand as a timber preservative and antisapstain treatment and it was no longer used after 1988. It was also sold as a moss killer to the general public (by Shell, at least) in the form of a 115g/l aqueous solution and labelled as a poison. =United States= Since the early 1980s, the purchase and use of PCP in the U.S has not been available to the general public. Nowadays, most of the PCP used in the U.S is restricted to the treatment of utility poles and railroad ties. In the United States, any drinking-water supply with a PCP concentration exceeding the MCL, 1 ppb, must be notified by the water supplier to the public. Disposal of PCP and PCP-contaminated substances are regulated under RCRA as F-listed (F021) or D-listed (D037) hazardous wastes. Bridges and similar structures such as piers can still be treated with pentachlorophenol. =Chile= PCP was widely used in Chile until the early 1990s as a fungicide to combat the so-called \\"blue stain\\" in pine timber under the name of Basilit.

AFMC was created on July 1, 1992, through the amalgamation of the former Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) and the former Air Force Systems Command (AFSC). AFMC is headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. AFMC is one of nine Air Force Major Commands and has a workforce of approximately 80,000 military and civilian personnel. It is the Air Force's largest command in terms of funding and second in terms of personnel. AFMC's operating budget represents 31 percent of the total Air Force budget and AFMC employs more than 40 percent of the Air Force's total civilian workforce. The command conducts research, development, testing and evaluation, and provides the acquisition and life cycle management services and logistics support. The command develops, acquires and sustains the air power needed to defend the United States and its interests. This is accomplished through research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, maintenance and program management of existing and future USAF weapon systems and their components.  The United States Armed Forces procurement of military aircraft began when the United States Army's Aeronautical Division of the Signal Corps (United States Army), acquired several examples of the Wright Military Flyer of 1909. USAAF/USAF aircraft Research and Development (R&D;) was merged with aircraft procurement twice in the 20th Century (e.g., 1944, 1992). Air Materiel Command was established on March 9, 1946, and in November 1946, AMC's History Office published Materiel Research and Development in the Army Air Arm, 1914-1945. In 1947, AMC bases were transferred to the newly established United States Air Force, with facilities such as the storage depot in Maywood, California, being renamed Cheli Air Force Station. On April 1, 1961, as part of the DoD reorganization under President John F. Kennedy and his Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, the Air Force Logistics Command was established at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, replacing the Air Materiel Command and assuming the latter's supply and maintenance roles. The material procurement role was transferred. On the same date, Air Force Systems Command was also established at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, assuming the R&D; role of the former Air Research and Development Command while also inheriting AMC's materiel procurement role. =Activation of AFMC, 1992= Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) was activated on July 1, 1992, as part of a post-Cold War, USAF-wide reorganization that resulted in the merger of AFLC and AFSC into a single major command. After AFMC was established, the command's infrastructure saw significant reductions through Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions. This included the BRAC-directed closure/privatization of the San Antonio Air Logistics Center at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas and the closure of Kelly Air Force Base as an independent installation, with incorporation of its runways and remaining military flight line areas as the Kelly Field Annex to adjacent Lackland Air Force Base. The Sacramento Air Logistics Center at McClellan Air Force Base was also closed/privatized and McClellan Air Force Base totally closed. McClellan became a totally civilian airport with the exception of Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento and the Air Force Recruiting Service's 364th Recruiting Squadron. =AFMC Commanders= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - !rowspan=2 !colspan=2Commander !colspan=3Term - !Portrait !Name !Took office !Left office !Term length } Structure Air Force Materiel Command conducts research, development, test and evaluation, and provides acquisition management services and logistics support.

In 2012, there was a major reorganization (5 Center Construct) and several new centers were organized. Among them, the Air Force Sustainment Center at Tinker Air Force Base now directs the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex at Tinker Air Force Base, the Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill Air Force Base, and the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex at Robins Air Force Base. The center provides depot maintenance, supply chain management and installation support. In 2015, the command officially activated its sixth center, the Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center, which provides centralized management of installation and mission support.

The company facilitates the provision of travel services from its suppliers to its clients. Priceline.com is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, United States and is wholly owned by Booking Holdings, which also owns Kayak.com, Booking.com and other sites. History Priceline was founded by Jay S. Walker, who left the company in 2000, by which time Richard S. Braddock, Citicorp's #2, had come aboard as chief executive. Braddock left in 2004, having helped take the company public in 1999. Entrepreneur Michael Loeb assisted in the \\"creation and early funding\\". Priceline first became known for its Name Your Own Price system, where travelers would name their price for airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, and vacation packages. While the purchaser can select a general location, service level, and price. The sales are for opaque travel inventory; details are disclosed only after the transaction is complete with no possibility of cancellation. Priceline's profit from the proceeds is the difference between the price suggested by a customer and the one charged by the service provider. It has also added a more traditional model, called Express Deals, where travelers have presented prices and a geographical perimeter within which the hotel will be located but are not told the name of the establishment. Priceline have come up with one more interesting tool named Pricebreakers for Hotel bookings. It claims that the price of the hotels are up to 50% off retail. It is somewhat similar to Express Deal but instead of showing geographical location in a perimeter, it gives names of 3 hotels and one of the hotel will be allocated after the payment is done. The best way to benefit from this tool is to select an offer which have similar rating hotels and go ahead with the booking. Travelers can still choose to name their price for airline tickets, hotel rooms, and rental cars. The number of airlines, hotels and car rental company participants in the name your own price program has increased as these suppliers utilize this opaque market Priceline created to sell their perishable inventory without lowering prices through other traditional sales channels. Priceline also sells discounted cruises, as well as tours and attractions. In 2002, Priceline licensed its \\"Name Your Own Price\\" travel system to eBay. In November 2007, Priceline ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù eliminated all booking fees on published airfares. In April 2014, Priceline.com Incorporated changed its name to \\"The Priceline Group Inc.\\" The corporate name change was intended to create a clear delineation between the global Priceline business. Now, Priceline.com is one of six primary brands of Booking Holdings. Priceline announced in May 2015 that it would invest an additional $250 million in Chinese online travel company Ctrip to tap the fast-growing China market. =Other services= Priceline.com experimented with selling gasoline and groceries under the Name Your Own Price model in 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, through a partially owned affiliate, WebHouse Club. Priceline got into the online auction business with Priceline Yard Sales, where individuals would use the Priceline system to haggle for various second-hand items and trade them in person. Priceline sold long distance telephone service and automobiles under the Name Your Own Price model. These experiments were terminated in 2002. Another experiment, the Name Your Own Rate system for home loans, continues under a license with EverBank. In 2016, Brett Keller was named CEO of the priceline.com brand. In March 2020, Travala partners with Priceline.com https://blog.travala.com/travala-com-partners-with-leading-travel-provider- priceline/ Spokespeople =William Shatner= In 1997, William Shatner became the spokesman for Priceline.com, agreeing to do the spots in exchange for stock in the company. Shatner allegedly sold the stock before the burst of the dot-com bubble, making a $600 million profit; however, this number was disputed as an urban legend by CEO Jeffery Boyd. An early ad campaign featuring Shatner had him belt out popular songs in spoken word, in the style of his album, The Transformed Man. He was \\"replaced\\" in 2004 by his Star Trek co-star, Leonard Nimoy. Shatner still appeared in spots for Priceline, running into Nimoy as his replacement. When that campaign ended, Shatner again became Priceline's sole spokesperson. In 2007, an ad campaign by Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners had Shatner take on the role of the Priceline Negotiator. In commercials that began airing January 22, 2012, Shatner's Negotiator character apparently dies as a bus falls off a bridge and explodes. Subsequent ads have featured his \\"spirit,\\" still advertising Priceline.com from beyond the grave. In August 2012, Shatner was brought back in a commercial located on a stormy, cloudy beach, parodying the end of the film Point Break. A man, apparently an investigator, stands next to Shatner. Shatner is holding a wooden surfboard, wearing a suit with shortened pants and pitching the new way of booking a hotel. He states that surfing is his life now and \\"we'll see where the waves take me. Sayonara!\\" and goes charging into the waves. Priceline has been parodied on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and in multiple Saturday Night Live skits. In a September 2008 SNL skit, during the opening monologue by Olympian Michael Phelps, Shatner rose from the audience to give Phelps tips on product endorsements. =Theresa Caputo= In June 2012, Theresa Caputo, star of the television show Long Island Medium, appeared in a commercial for Priceline.com, in which she portrayed herself \\"connecting\\" with the late Priceline Negotiator character previously played by William Shatner. However, this commercial has sparked controversy, since the commercial appears to make light of the Native American belief of smudging. JREF President DJ Grothe released an open letter calling out Priceline.com for endorsing Caputo, stating, \\"It is difficult to watch the show and not feel heartbroken for those who are desperate to hear from the departed... and even more so if they are being manipulated by a charlatan.\\" Grothe urges Priceline.com to \\"invite... your new representative\\" to take the James Randi One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge and prove her credentials. =Kaley Cuoco= In January 2013, Kaley Cuoco from the sitcom The Big Bang Theory joined William Shatner as his fictitious daughter in Priceline.com commercials. Criticisms Priceline does not include resort fee amounts in the bidding. Therefore, it's possible to win a bid for a hotel and then be forced to pay mandatory resort fees (for example, often $25 per night for resort hotels in Las Vegas). Priceline continues this practice despite a 2012 warning to the industry from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC continues to state the following regarding how hotels and third parties should disclose such fees: Priceline is one of the companies accused of using the services of Wiki-PR, a public relations firm specialized in editing of Wikipedia that has been accused of subverting Wikipedia content for business interest.

Founded during the Soviet era, the ensemble consists of a male choir, an orchestra, and a dance ensemble. The Ensemble has entertained audiences both in Russia and throughout the world, performing a range of music including folk tunes, hymns, operatic arias and popular music. The group's repertoire has included The Volga Boatmen's Song, Katyusha, Kalinka, and Ave Maria. It is named for its first director, Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov (1883‚Äì1946).

The Red Army Choir singers and dancers were en route to Syria to entertain Russian troops there for Orthodox Christmas celebrations. Name At the establishment, in 1928, the choir was named Red Army Song Ensemble of the M. V. Frunze Red Army Central House (). In 1935, it was renamed Red-Bannered Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble of the USSR (). In 1949 the ensemble was officially named the A. V.

In 1978 the word \\"academic\\" was added to the title (A. V. Alexandrov Twice Red-bannered and Red-starred Academic Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army). After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ensemble received its present name in 1998.  History  =Early years = Alexander Alexandrov Born into a peasant family, Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov became the first artistic director of the ensemble, choirmaster, conductor, teacher and the public figure who wrote the music to the State Anthem of the Soviet Union. He came from a musical background of hymns and folk songs, could play the viola and had perfect pitch, so he sang in the church choir and performed at festivals. He was heard singing at the village school by PA Zalivuhin, a soloist in the choir at Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg. Zalivuhin persuaded Alexandrov's parents to let the child go to St Petersburg to learn music. In 1898, the young peasant boy became a pupil of the Saint Petersburg Court Chapel. Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg, where it all started. Here A.V. Alexandrov, who would one day create the ensemble, began to learn his trade. There are two recorded histories of the ensemble: possibly separate elements of the same history. The first says that the initiator of the ensemble was Felix Nikolaevich Danilovich, a theatre director. The first director of the ensemble was chosen from three of Moscow's conductors: Danilin, Chesnokov and Alexandrov. Seen in isolation this would signify that A. V. Alexandrov was not the creator of the ensemble. In this version the first troupe is named as follows. Singers: Tkachenko, Zyukov, Samarin, Rozanov, Koltypin, Tolskov, Golyaev, Charov. Dancers: Maximov, Svetlov. Bayanist: Surdin.Prague National Library The second version says that the ensemble was formed out of the Frunze Red Army Central House in 1928. There is also a story that Stalin then asked Alexandrov to relocate the choir to Moscow. Under the name Red Army Song Ensemble of the M. V. Frunze Red Army Central House, shortly the \\"Red Army Choir\\", twelve soldier-performers ‚Äì a vocal octet, a bayan player, 2 dancers, and a reciter ‚Äì officially performed for the first time on 12 October 1928 under the direction of their conductor, Alexandr Alexandrov, a young music professor at the Moscow Conservatory. The program, entitled The 22nd Krasnodar Division in Song, consisted mainly of short musical scenes of military life, including Songs of the First Cavalry Army, The Special Far-Eastern Army, and Song about Magnitostroi. Development In 1929, the ensemble visited the far eastern lands of the Soviet Union, entertaining the troops working on the Far Eastern Railway. With the goal of developing amateur art within the ranks of the army and to encourage soldiers' interest in good music, the ensemble grew to 300 performers by 1933, comprising three different forces of a male choir, an orchestra, and an ensemble of dancers. Some sources say that in 1933 there were 19 members; in 1935 there were 135 and in August 1937 in Paris and Prague they were 150. The Red Army Choir became known as a propagator of Soviet songs, performing original compositions by composers such as Vasily Solovyov- Sedoy, Anatoli Novikov, Matvey Blanter and Boris Mokrousov. In 1935, the choir was bestowed the Order of the Red Banner and was renamed the Red-bannered Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble of the USSR. Having traveled widely throughout the Soviet Union, from the Arctic north to the sands of Tajikistan, the choir performed at the International Exposition dedicated to Art and Technology in Modern Life held in 1937 in Paris, France; it won the Grand Prix, the highest honor bestowed by the jury. During World War II, the ensemble gave over 1500 performances at both Soviet fronts, entertaining troops about to go into battle, at gun emplacements, airfields, and in hospitals. =Under Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov= Following the death of Alexander Alexandrov, the ensemble was taken over by his son, Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov. Under his leadership, the ensemble gained fame outside the Soviet Union, making extensive tours worldwide. Boris Alexandrov retired in 1987, and was succeeded by People's Artist of Russia Igor Agafonnikov the same year, with Anatoly Maltsev as the ensemble chief. He retired as the principal conductor in 1994; he died that year and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy Cemetery. He was succeeded by Victor Fedorov, the chorus master since 1986. Under B. A. Alexandrov, the ensemble was highly disciplined. Boris's party trick was to leave the stage and allow the ensemble to perform \\"En Route\\" alone. Members were positioned so that they could not all watch one orchestral leader, and this appeared to be a trick, but there was no trick at all. Leonid Kharitonov remembers: > The Ensemble members were so disciplined and experienced that they could > feel the rhythm simultaneously and could sing and play together > automatically, without the conductor... In Canada during one concert > Alexandrov left the Ensemble to perform alone for half an hour.Information > from Leonid Kharitonov, October 2009.

Photo taken by member of choir from stage, probably using Boris Alexandrov's camera. Boris Alexandrov has posed for this, holding baton still. In 1948 much of Berlin was still ruined after World War II, and the city was divided into four occupation zones, controlled by the USSR, France, the UK and the United States. This was before the Berlin Wall was built, and it was still possible to travel between zones. An American officer suggested a concert in the Gendarmenmarkt (in the Soviet zone at the time), and the French zone commander supported the suggestion. The musicians were to be provided by the USSR, and the Alexandrov Ensemble was chosen. A temporary stage was set up in the square, with flowers all along the front. 30,000 people came to stand and watch for three hours. In 1994, towards the end of his life, Boris Alexandrov said: > \\"The visit to Germany was unforgettable. It is dominant in the history of > the ensemble. It was necessary to make a new creative leap ‚Äì from wartime > military music to postwar relaxing harmony. It was important, and the > transition had to be managed on many fronts, including getting the Ensemble > back into its original pre-war role, performing the classics and singing > folk songs. Before the war the Ensemble had 200 professional singers; > following the war it was down to 60.\\"The newspaper \\"Culture\\": Pastoral on > the Ruins, by Anatoly Kompaniets, 2000. In Russian A previous tour to East Germany had been cancelled due to the sudden death of Alexander Alexandrov in 1946 in Potsdam, when in his bed was found an annotated copy of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, showing that A. Alexandrov had been preparing the final chorus for a performance. Now Boris, his son, was ready to follow his father's plan. The 1948 peace concert was to consist of German opera extracts and Russian folk songs (Nightingales, Zemlyanka and Roads); and after an intervention by the tenor Victor Nikitin, some German folk songs were also included. The people joined in, singing Heidenr√∂slein, and Nikitin sang Kalinka three times in a row. The concert was very successful, and very moving.

The main tour season during and just after World War II appears to have run from June to October ‚Äì perhaps because the large troupe usually had to perform outdoors, to accommodate large audiences. The August 1948 Berlin concert occurred two- thirds of the way through a tour to (20 June to 18 July) Prague, Most, Brno, Devin, Bratislava, Moravsk√° Ostrava, ≈Ωilina and Kosice in Czechoslovakia; then apparently without a break (18 July to 10 October) Dresden, Weimar, Magdeburg, Stendal, Schwerin, Potsdam, Berlin, Rathenow, Leipzig, Halle, Lane, Erfurt, Chemnitz, Frankfurt an der Oder and Schwarzenberg in Germany.Alexandrov Ensemble webpage: list of tour dates (links) In RussianAlexandrov Ensemble webpage: list of tour venues 1948. In Russian In 1990, the ensemble participated in Roger Waters' The Wall concert celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall. They performed an anti-war song, Bring the Boys Back Home. = After 1991= The Leningrad Cowboys In 1993, the ensemble became an item of pop culture by performing with the Finnish band Leningrad Cowboys in Helsinki, Finland where they performed on the Senate Square in front of 70,000 listeners, and in Berlin. In the German capital, the concert of the Leningrad Cowboys with the ensemble took place on the central Lustgarten and gave the former Red Army's farewell to Berlin and the whole Germany an optimistic overtone. The Finnish concert was made into a rockumentary Total Balalaika Show by film director Aki Kaurism√§ki. That year they also made a CD and played a concert with French singer Jean-Jacques Goldman. The ensemble and the Leningrad Cowboys performed \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. Today, the ensemble is led by Honoured Artist of Russia Vyacheslav Korobko, who has been leading it since 2003. Over the years, the ensemble has collaborated with many popular artists and producers including David Foster, Jean-Jacques Goldman and Steve Barakatt. Until 1969, the standard uniform for the ensemble choir, soloists and orchestra was the tunic and riding breeches. On 1 January 1970, this was changed to dress uniform,Information from Leonid Kharitonov, who was a member of the Ensemble 1953‚Äì1972. and there have been further variations to the dress uniform as used by the ensemble since 1970.

The plane crashed with no survivors. After 5 weeks, the choir was reformed anew in time for Defender of the Fatherland Day celebrations on 18 February 2017. That first concert in weeks marks also the birth of a new era for the Ensemble, with its first international tour following the crash with concerts not just in Russia but also in select European countries.

In 2008, the 80th anniversary of the ensemble, director Leonid Malev said: > Of course everything depends on the repertoire which is quite large ‚Äì more > than two thousand works.

He began his career at Sunderland in 1998 before having two spells each with West Ham United and Leeds United. He won the 2004‚Äì05 Football League Championship with Sunderland and was named the club's player of the season award as well as being named in the 2004‚Äì05 Football League Championship PFA Team of the Year. He moved to West Ham in 2006 before returning to Sunderland under Roy Keane's managership in 2008. He spent one season, the 2010‚Äì11 season, on loan with Leeds United before returning in 2011 to play on loan for West Ham. From 2001 until 2010 he also played international football for Northern Ireland. Club career =Sunderland= Born in Belfast, McCartney was a trainee with Sunderland before signing a professional contract on 28 May 1998 and made his debut against Luton Town in the League Cup in 2000. He was made team captain in 2003‚Äì04 after Jason McAteer suffered a long-term injury and in 2004‚Äì05 was voted Player of the Season by Sunderland fans during the successful Championship winning campaign. During the season his excellent performances earned him the title \\"Mr. Consistent\\" from manager Mick McCarthy. McCartney missed a large percentage of Sunderland's ill-fated 2005‚Äì06 season due to injury. He showed glimpses of his potential once he had regained his fitness, but his return came far too late in the season for him to have any meaningful impact on the team's dreadful run of results. He made 157 appearances for Sunderland in all competitions. =West Ham United= McCartney during his first spell at West Ham United. On 8 August 2006, McCartney moved to West Ham United in a four-year deal, in exchange for Clive Clarke and an additional ¬£600,000. He made his debut in the team's 2‚Äì1 defeat to Chesterfield in the League Cup on 24 October 2006. After initially spending most of his time as substitute, regular left back Paul Konchesky joined Fulham and as a result McCartney eventually became a first team regular under Alan Curbishley and his strong forward runs and crosses played a crucial role in West Ham's eventual escape from relegation. He went on to make 25 appearances in all competitions for West Ham during the 2006‚Äì07 season. McCartney scored his first goal for The Hammers, a strong back post header, in a friendly against Roma one week before the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season. He scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham in the 1‚Äì1 home draw with Bolton Wanderers on 4 November 2007 with a magnificent volley. At the end of the 2007‚Äì2008 season McCartney received the runner up Hammer of the Year Award, having played in all 38 Premiership games. McCartney's sale back to his former club Sunderland led to West Ham manager Alan Curbishley resigning after he claimed the player was sold against his wishes. =Return to Sunderland= McCartney playing for Sunderland against Chelsea. McCartney rejoined former club Sunderland on 1 September 2008, signing a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He was a regular under manager Roy Keane, but after Steve Bruce became manager McCartney picked up an ankle injury in March 2010 and lost his place in the team to Anton Ferdinand whilst out injured. McCartney wasn't given a squad number for the 2010‚Äì11 season after suffering a knee injury in 2010‚Äì11 pre-season on a tour of Portugal. However, he was included in Sunderland's 25 man Premier League squad. Kieran Richardson changed his squad number and was given the number 3 shirt for the 2010‚Äì11 season where he became Sunderland's first choice left back and McCartney was given the number 23 jersey. =Leeds United loan= In order to help him regain match fitness after suffering a knee injury in pre-season and losing his first-team place at Sunderland, he joined Leeds United on 23 September 2010, initially on a one- month loan, a move which saw him link up with Northern Ireland assistant manager Glynn Snodin. On 25 September, he made his Leeds debut in a 1‚Äì0 victory in the Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United. In his second game, Leeds suffered a 6‚Äì4 defeat to Preston North End, and McCartney gave away a penalty in the match which was scored by Callum Davidson. On 4 October Leeds announced that McCartney's loan had been extended by a further two days so he could play in the game against Cardiff City. On 30 October 2010 McCartney signed a one-month extension to his loan deal and made an appearance against Scunthorpe United on the same day. His loan was extended for a third month on 1 December. McCartney's loan expired on 30 December and he returned to Sunderland with Leeds attempting to extend the loan deal once the transfer window had re-opened in January 2011. On 14 January 2011, McCartney re-signed for Leeds on loan until the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season. After McCartney gave an interview where he stated that Leeds players were jaded hence the poor run of form late on in the season, he was criticised by Leeds chairman Ken Bates who revealed his anger at McCartney and that he had been fined on several occasions for turning up late to training. At the end of his loan he returned to his parent club Sunderland. =Return to West Ham United= On 10 August 2011 McCartney returned for another spell at West Ham United for a season-long loan. On 19 December, McCartney was quoted as saying although Martin O'Neill had taken over at his club Sunderland, he had had no contact with the manager, and \\"To be honest, before I agreed to come to West Ham, it was decided that my contract would be left to run out in the summer and sorted out at the end of the season. \\"So there is no chance of a call back and no chance of me ever going back to Sunderland.\\" On 4 March 2012, he scored his only goal for West Ham since returning on loan, in a 2‚Äì0 away victory over Cardiff City. At the end of season awards for the 2011‚Äì12 season, he was awarded the club's Players' Player of the Year award. His performances have also helped West Ham clinched promotion back to the Premier League after winning the play-off finals. On 1 July 2012 McCartney rejoined newly promoted West Ham signing a two-year contract after agreeing to make the loan move permanent. In November McCartney suffered a serious knee injury playing against Liverpool. He made his comeback on 30 March 2013 against West Bromwich Albion but lasted only 15 minutes before a recurrence of the same injury which was expected to keep him from playing for the remainder of the 2012‚Äì13 season.https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier- league/mccartney-to-miss-rest-of-season-29164988.html McCartney returned to the first team for a League Cup game against Cheltenham Town on 27 August 2013. His Premier League return however was not until 30 November 2013, in a 3‚Äì0 win against Fulham. McCartney was released by West Ham at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. McCartney had played 82 games in all competitions in his second spell with the club, scoring a single goal. International career McCartney was capped four times for Northern Ireland national under-18 team during 2000 before earning five caps for the under-21 team from 2000 to 2001. He made his debut for the senior team in September 2001 in their World Cup qualifying win against Iceland, scoring his only goal in his professional career until that for West Ham in 2007. In 2005, he fell out with the then manager of the Northern Ireland senior team, Lawrie Sanchez and retired from international football. However, after Nigel Worthington took charge of the national team, McCartney stated his willingness to return and on 22 August 2007, he came out of international retirement and returned to international football in the 3‚Äì1 win against Liechtenstein. Following regular run of games for Leeds, in November 2010 McCartney was recalled to the Northern Ireland Squad. In February 2011 McCartney was called into the Northern Ireland squad to face Scotland, but on 8 February 2011 he once again announced his retirement from international football.

Life and academic career Cameron was born at Glasgow and received his early education in his native city. After having taught Greek in the university for twelve months, he removed to Bordeaux, where he was soon appointed a regent in the college of Bergerac. He did not remain long at Bordeaux, but accepted the offer of a chair of philosophy at the Academy of Sedan, where he passed two years. He then returned to Bordeaux, and in the beginning of 1604 he was nominated one of the students of divinity who were maintained, at the expense of the church, and who for the period of four years were at liberty to prosecute their studies in any Protestant seminary. During this period he acted as tutor to the two sons of the chancellor of Navarre. They spent one year at Paris, and two at Geneva, whence they removed to Heidelberg. In this university, on 4 April 1608, he gave a public proof of his ability by maintaining a series of theses, De triplici Dei cum Homine Foedere, which were printed among his works. The same year he was recalled to Bordeaux, where he was appointed the colleague of Dr Gilbert Primrose; and when Francis Gomarus was removed to Leiden, Cameron, in 1618, was appointed professor of divinity at the Academy of Saumur, the principal seminary of the French Protestants. In 1620, the progress of the civil troubles in France obliged Cameron to seek refuge for himself and family in England. For a short time, he read private lectures on divinity in London; and in 1622 the king appointed him principal of the University of Glasgow in the room of Robert Boyd, who had been removed from his office in consequence of his adherence to Presbyterianism. Cameron was cordially disliked for his adherence to the doctrine of passive obedience. He resigned his office in less than a year. He returned to France, and lived at Saumur. After an interval of a year he was appointed professor of divinity at Montauban. The country was still torn by civil and religious dissensions; and Cameron excited the indignation of the more strenuous adherents of his own party. He withdrew to the neighboring town of Moissac; but he soon returned to Montauban, and a few days afterwards he died at the age of about forty-six and perhaps at the hands of an assassin.George Crabbe, Universal historical dictionary, enlarged edn, 2 vols (London: Baldwin and Cradock, and J. Dowding, 1833), I, s.v. All his works were published after his death. Theology Cameron's name has a distinct place in the development of Calvinistic theology in Europe. He and his followers maintained that the will of man is determined by the practical judgment of the mind; that the cause of men's doing good or evil proceeds from the knowledge which God infuses into them; and that God does not move the will physically, but only morally, by virtue of its dependence on the judgment of the mind. This peculiar doctrine of grace and free will was adopted by Amyraut, Cappel, Bochart, Daill√© and others of the more learned among the Reformed ministers. The Cameronites (not to be confused with the Scottish sect called Cameronians) are moderate Calvinists and approach to the opinion of the Arminians. They are also wrongly called Universalists, as holding the universal scope [not application] rather than limited extent of Christ's death, and sometimes Amyraldians. The rigid adherents to the Synod of Dort accused them of Pelagianism, and even of Manichaeism, and the controversy between the parties was carried on with great zeal; yet the whole question between them was only, whether the will of man is determined by the immediate action of God upon it, or by the intervention of a knowledge which God impresses on the mind.

Gregory, The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 169See Yeates (2016a), (2016b), and (2016c). Considered by Charles Baudouin to represent a second Nancy School,Baudouin continuously spoke of a ‚ÄúNew Nancy School‚Äù: e.g., Baudouin (1920), p.13.It is significant that Cou√© never adopted Baudouin‚Äôs designation \\"New Nancy School\\"; and, moreover, according to Glueck (1923, p.112), who visited Cou√© at Nancy in 1922, Cou√© was ‚Äúrather annoyed‚Äù with Baudouin‚Äôs unauthorized characterization of his enterprise. Cou√© treated many patients in groups and free of charge.Henri Ellenberger, The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970) p. 842Whiteside, T., \\"Better and Better\\", The New Yorker, (Saturday, 16 May 1953), pp.91-115. Life and career Cou√©'s family, from the Brittany region of France and with origins in French nobility, had only modest means. A brilliant pupil in school, he initially intended to become an analytical chemist. However, he eventually abandoned these studies, as his father, who was a railroad worker, was in a precarious financial state. Cou√© then decided to become a pharmacist and graduated with a degree in pharmacology in 1876. Working as an apothecary at Troyes from 1882 to 1910, Cou√© quickly discovered what later came to be known as the placebo effect. He became known for reassuring his clients by praising each remedy's efficiency and leaving a small positive notice with each given medication. In 1886 and 1887 he studied with Ambroise-Auguste Li√©beault and Hippolyte Bernheim, two leading exponents of hypnotism, in Nancy. In 1910, Cou√© sold his business and retired to Nancy, where he opened a clinic that continuously delivered some 40,000 treatment- units per annum (Baudouin, 1920, p. 14) to local, regional, and overseas patients over the next sixteen years.Aram, G.V.

In 1913, Cou√© and his wife founded The Lorraine Society of Applied Psychology (). His book Self-Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion was published in England (1920) and in the United States (1922). Although Cou√©'s teachings were, during his lifetime, more popular in Europe than in the United States, many Americans who adopted his ideas and methods, such as Maxwell Maltz, Napoleon Hill, Norman Vincent Peale, Robert H. Schuller, and W. Clement Stone, became famous in their own right by spreading his words.  La m√©thode Cou√© (The Cou√© method)  =General= The application of his mantra-like conscious autosuggestion, \\"Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better\\" (French: Tous les jours √† tous points de vue je vais de mieux en mieux) is called Cou√©ism or the Cou√© method. Some American newspapers quoted it differently, \\"Day by day, in every way, I'm getting better and better.\\" The Cou√© method centered on a routine repetition of this particular expression according to a specified ritual‚Äîpreferably as many as twenty times a day, and especially at the beginning and at the end of each day.Marguerite Marshall. \\"Applied Auto-Suggestion of Famous French Healer Explained.\\" Boston Post, January 4, 1923, p. 13. When asked whether or not he thought of himself as a healer, Cou√© often stated that \\"I have never cured anyone in my life. All I do is show people how they can cure themselves.\\" quoted by Frederick L. Collins, \\"Three Minutes With a Headliner.\\" (Kingston Jamaica) The Gleaner, February 9, 1923, p.6. Unlike a commonly held belief that a strong conscious will constitutes the best path to success, Cou√© maintained that curing some of our troubles requires a change in our unconscious thought, which can be achieved only by using our imagination. Although stressing that he was not primarily a healer but one who taught others to heal themselves, Cou√© claimed to have effected organic changes through autosuggestion. =Self-suggestion= Cou√© identified two types of self-suggestion: (i) the intentional, \\"reflective suggestion\\" made by deliberate and conscious effort, and (ii) the involuntary \\"spontaneous suggestion\\", that is a ‚Äúnatural phenomenon of our mental life ‚Ä¶ which takes place without conscious effort [and has its effect] with an intensity proportional to the keenness of [our] attention‚Äù.Baudouin, 1920, pp. 33‚Äì34 Baudouin identified three different sources of spontaneous suggestion: ::A. Instances belonging to the representative domain (sensations, mental images, dreams, visions, memories, opinions, and all intellectual phenomena); ::B. Instances belonging to the affective domain (joy or sorrow, emotions, sentiments, tendencies, passions); ::C. Instances belonging to the active or motor domain (actions, volitions, desires, gestures, movements at the periphery or in the interior of the body, functional or organic modifications).Baudouin, 1920, p. 41 =Two minds= According to Yeates, Cou√© shared the theoretical position that Hudson had expressed in his Law of Psychic Phenomena (1893): namely, that our \\"mental organization\\" was such that it seemed as if we had \\"two minds, each endowed with separate and distinct attributes and powers; [with] each capable, under certain conditions, of independent action\\".Yeates, 2016b, p. 42; Hudson, 1893, p. 25 Further, argued Hudson, it was entirely irrelevant, for explanatory purposes, whether we actually had \\"two distinct minds\\", whether we only seemed to be \\"endowed with a dual mental organization\\", or whether we actually had \\"one mind [possessed of] certain attributes and powers under some conditions, and certain other attributes and powers under other conditions\\".Hudson, 1893, pp. 25‚Äì26 =Development and origins= Cou√© noticed that in certain cases he could improve the efficacy of a given medicine by praising its effectiveness to the patient. He realized that those patients to whom he praised the medicine had a noticeable improvement when compared to patients to whom he said nothing. This began Cou√©'s exploration of the use of hypnosis and the power of the imagination. His initial method for treating patients relied on hypnosis. He discovered that subjects could not be hypnotized against their will and, more importantly, that the effects of hypnosis waned when the subjects regained consciousness. He thus eventually turned to autosuggestion, which he describes as Cou√© believed in the effects of medication. But he also believed that our mental state is able to affect and even amplify the action of these medications. By consciously using autosuggestion, he observed that his patients could cure themselves more efficiently by replacing their \\"thought of illness\\" with a new \\"thought of cure\\". According to Cou√©, repeating words or images enough times causes the subconscious to absorb them. The cures were the result of using imagination or \\"positive autosuggestion\\" to the exclusion of one's own willpower. =Underlying principles= Cou√© thus developed a method which relied on the principle that any idea exclusively occupying the mind turns into reality, although only to the extent that the idea is within the realm of possibility. For instance, a person without hands will not be able to make them grow back. However, if a person firmly believes that his or her asthma is disappearing, then this may actually happen, as far as the body is actually able physically to overcome or control the illness. On the other hand, thinking negatively about the illness (ex. \\"I am not feeling well\\") will encourage both mind and body to accept this thought. Likewise, when someone cannot remember a name, they will probably not be able to recall it as long as they hold onto this idea (i.e. \\"I can't remember\\") in their mind. Cou√© realised that it is better to focus on and imagine the desired, positive results (i.e. \\"I feel healthy and energetic\\" and \\"I can remember clearly\\"). =Willpower= Cou√© observed that the main obstacle to autosuggestion was willpower. For the method to work, the patient must refrain from making any independent judgment, meaning that he must not let his will impose its own views on positive ideas. Everything must thus be done to ensure that the positive \\"autosuggestive\\" idea is consciously accepted by the patient; otherwise, one may end up getting the opposite effect of what is desired.Brooks, C. H., \\"The practice of autosuggestion\\" (1922) p. 62 Memorial bust of Cou√© (detail), St Mary's Park, Nancy.Monument to Cou√©, St Mary's Park, Nancy. For example, when a student has forgotten an answer to a question in an exam, he will likely think something such as \\"I have forgotten the answer\\". The more they try to think of it, the more the answer becomes blurred and obscured. However, if this negative thought is replaced with a more positive one (\\"No need to worry, it will come back to me\\"), the chances that the student will come to remember the answer will increase. Cou√© noted that young children always applied his method perfectly, as they lacked the willpower that remained present among adults. When he instructed a child by saying \\"clasp your hands and you can't open them\\", the child would thus immediately follow. =Self-conflict= A patient's problems are likely to increase when his willpower and imagination (or mental ideas) are opposing each other, something Cou√© would refer to as \\"self-conflict\\". In the student's case, the will to succeed is clearly incompatible with his thought of being incapable of remembering his answers. As the conflict intensifies, so does the problem: the more the patient tries to sleep, the more he becomes awake. The more a patient tries to stop smoking, the more he smokes. The patient must thus abandon his willpower and instead put more focus on his imaginative power in order to succeed fully with his cure. =Effectiveness= Thanks to his method, which Cou√© once called his \\"trick\\",\\"un truc ou proc√©d√© m√©canique\\" (). Note: When Cou√© referred to his \\"trick\\", he was speaking of the mechanism, or \\"the secret\\", that was responsible for the approach's success (as in, say, \\"the trick to the hook shot is ‚Ä¶\\"); he was not speaking of deceiving his subject. patients of all sorts would come to visit him. The list of ailments included kidney problems, diabetes, memory loss, stammering, weakness, atrophy and all sorts of physical and mental illnesses. According to one of his journal entries (1916), he apparently cured a patient of a uterus prolapse as well as \\"violent pains in the head\\" (migraine). C. (Cyrus) Harry Brooks (1890‚Äì1951), author of various books on Cou√©, claimed the success rate of his method was around 93%. The remaining 7% of people would include those who were too skeptical of Cou√©'s approach and those who refused to recognize it. =Medicines and autosuggestion= The use of autosuggestion is intended to complement use of medicine, but no medication of Cou√©'s time could save a patient from depression or tension. Cou√© recommended that patients take medicines with the confidence that they would be completely cured very soon, and healing would be optimal. Conversely, he contended, patients who are skeptical of a medicine would find it least effective. Criticism \\"That Cou√©‚Äôs formula could be applied with a minimum of instruction was challenging; and the accounts of Cou√©‚Äôs method curing organic disease were just as threatening to the conventional medicine of the day, as they were inspiring to Cou√©‚Äôs devotees\\" (Yeates, 2016a, p. 19). \\"Most of us are so accustomed ‚Ä¶ to an elaborate medical ritual ‚Ä¶ in the treatment of our ills ‚Ä¶ [that] anything so simple as Cou√©‚Äôs autosuggestion is inclined to arouse misgivings, antagonism and a feeling of scepticism\\" (Duckworth 1922, pp. 3‚Äì4). According to Yeates (2016a, p. 18), although Cou√© never produced any empirical evidence for the efficacy of his formula and, therefore, his claims had not been scientifically evaluated, three subsequent experimental studies, conducted more than half a century later ‚Äî i.e., those of Paulhus (1993) ‚Äî \\"seem to offer some unexpected support for Cou√©‚Äôs claims\\". =The psycho-medical establishment= According to Yeates (2016a, p. 19), the protests routinely made by those within the psychomedical establishment (e.g., Moxon, 1923; Abraham, 1926) were on one or more of the following grounds: :(1) \\"Healing of organic disease by 'self- mastery' was impossible! Aside from 'spontaneous remissions' of authentic disease (efficacious vis medicatrix natur√¶!), reported 'cures' were either due to mistaken diagnosis (it was never that disease!), or mistaken prognosis (it was always going to get better!). Anyway, even if it had been diagnosed correctly, there was no compelling evidence to suggest that Cou√©‚Äôs approach had been in any way responsible for the cure.\\" :(2) \\"Even if it was true that, in some extraordinary circumstances, healing by 'self-mastery' was possible, Cou√©‚Äôs failure to immediately eliminate those with counterproductive limitations ‚Äî such as, for example, those lacking the required dedication, mind-set, talent, diligence, persistence, patience, etc. ‚Äî resulted in many (clearly unsuited) individuals mistakenly postponing (otherwise) life-saving operations and delaying (otherwise) radical medical treatment far beyond any prospect of recovery or cure.\\" :(3) \\"Despite the obvious fact that each 'disease' had a unique cause, a unique history, and a unique (and idiosyncratic) personal impact, Cou√© treated a wide range of disparate individuals in the same, single group session, in the same way; and, moreover, he treated them without any sort of detailed examination or differential diagnosis.\\" :(4) \\"The method‚Äôs central 'magical incantation' ‚Äî a specific formula, uttered a specific number of times, in a special way, using a knotted string ‚Äî aroused strong opposition, as it reeked of outmoded superstitious practices and beliefs.\\" =The Press= While most American reporters of his day seemed dazzled by Cou√©'s accomplishments,Bronner, Milton, \\"What's Emile Coue's Game? Milt Bronner Sizes Up the Man\\", The Evening Independent, (Thursday, 18 January, 1923), p.1.Bronner, Milton, \\"Day by Day Story of Life as Coue Patient\\", The Milwaukee Journal Final, (Monday, 8 January 1923), p.1; \\"Patient Spends First Day Getting Better and Better\\", (Tuesday, 9 January 1923), p.1; \\"Give Yourself a Chance, Coue Told his Patients\\", (Wednesday, 10 January 1923), p.1; \\"Coue made ‚Äòem Forget their Ills, Day by Day\\", (Thursday, 11 January 1923), p.1; \\"Coue Patients Declared Treatment Helped Them\\", (Friday, 12 January 1923), p.1; and \\"Coue Seemed Sincere in Desire to Aid Man\\", (Saturday, 13 January 1923), p.1.Stowe, L. B. 1923. The Druggist from Nancy: I. Monsieur Cou√© at Home. The Outlook, 133(3), 122-123. and did not question the results attributed to his method, a handful of journalists and a few educators were skeptical. After Cou√© had left Boston, the Boston Herald waited six months, revisited the patients he had \\"cured\\", and found most had initially felt better but soon returned to whatever ailments they previously had. Few of the patients would criticize Cou√©, saying he did seem very sincere in what he tried to do, but the Herald reporter concluded that any benefit from Cou√©'s method seemed to be temporary and might be explained by being caught up in the moment during one of Cou√©'s events. Whilst a number of academic psychologists looked upon his work favourably,Downey, J.E., \\"Practicing Coue\\", (Wednesday, 20 December 1922), p.4. others did not.McDougall, W. (1926). An Outline of Abnormal Psychology. London: Methuen & Co.. pp.123-124. Cou√© was also criticized by exponents of psychoanalysis,Abraham, K., \\"Psycho-Analytical Notes on Cou√©'s Method of Self- Mastery\\", International Journal of Psychoanalysis, Vol.7, No.2, (April 1926), pp.190-213. with Otto Fenichel concluding: \\"A climax of dependence masked as independent power is achieved by the methods of autosuggestion where a weak and passive ego is controlled by an immense superego with magical powers. This power is, however, borrowed and even usurped\\". Memorials On 28 June 1936, a monument erected to the memory of Cou√©, funded by worldwide subscription, and featuring a bust of Cou√© created by French sculptor Eug√®ne Gatelet,Bell, K., \\"Europe of Today: Statue of Coue to be Unveiled\\", The Delmarva Star, (26 April 1936), p.36. was dedicated in St Mary's Park, in Nancy. The bust was stored for safe-keeping during World War II and, post-war, was restored to its former position in 1947.

Jean-Claude Pascal (24 October 1927 in Paris, France - 5 May 1992), born Jean-Claude Villeminot, was a French comedian and singer. After surviving World War II in Strasbourg, Pascal studied at the Sorbonne before turning to fashion-designing for Christian Dior. While working on costumes for the theater production of the play Don Juan, he was exposed to acting. His first acting role was in the film Le jugement de Dieu (1949, released in 1952) and afterwards in \\"Le rideau cramoisi\\", 1951, opposite Anouk Aim√©e, followed by several films including Die sch√∂ne L√ºgnerin (La Belle et l'empereur 1959, 'Beautiful Liar') with Romy Schneider, and Angelique and the Sultan (Ang√©lique et le sultan, 1968) with Mich√®le Mercier.

Figure 33.‚ÄîUsing pole to swing out on so that banana could be grasped. Figure 34.‚ÄîUsing stick to draw carrot within reach.\\" From The mental life of monkeys and apes; a study of ideational behavior, by Robert Mearns Yerkes, 1916 The monkey and banana problems is a famous toy problem in artificial intelligence, particularly in logic programming and planning. Formulation of the problem A monkey is in a room. Suspended from the ceiling is a bunch of bananas, beyond the monkey's reach. However, in the room there are also a chair and a stick. The ceiling is just the right height so that a monkey standing on a chair could knock the bananas down with the stick. The monkey knows how to move around, carry other things around, reach for the bananas, and wave a stick in the air. What is the best sequence of actions for the monkey? Purpose of the problem There are many applications of this problem. One is as a toy problem for computer science. Another possible purpose of the problem is to raise the question: Are monkeys intelligent? Both humans and monkeys have the ability to use mental maps to remember things like where to go to find shelter, or how to avoid danger. They can also remember where to go to gather food and water, as well as how to communicate with each other. Monkeys have the ability not only to remember how to hunt and gather but to learn new things, as is the case with the monkey and the bananas: despite the fact that the monkey may never have been in an identical situation, with the same artifacts at hand, a monkey is capable of concluding that it needs to make a ladder, position it below the bananas, and climb up to reach for them. The degree to which such abilities should be ascribed to instinct or learning is a matter of debate. According to an article in Psychology Today,What Monkeys Can Teach Us About Human Behavior: From Facts to Fiction the monkey and banana problem was inspired by a somewhat similar experiment with rhesus monkeys.Stephenson, G. R. (1967). Cultural acquisition of a specific learned response among rhesus monkeys. In: Starek, D., Schneider, R., and Kuhn, H. J.

The company also developed the LocoScript word processor for the PCW, which was a complete bootable environment in its own right with no separate underlying operating system. The company later produced a PC version of this software, but it was not very successful, partly because it was a DOS application, just as the PC market was moving to Microsoft Windows, but also because the program compared poorly to incumbents like WordPerfect in the more competitive environment of PC word processors.

The term was originally used in the United States as early as 1919 for an unintelligent or brutish man. As of the early 21st century, the \\"stereotypical bimbo\\" appearance became that of an attractive woman. It is often used to describe women who are blond, have curvaceous figures, heavy makeup, and revealing clothing. It is commonly associated with \\"the dumb blonde\\" stereotype.Encyclopedia of Hair, pp. 149-151 History The word bimbo derives from the Italian bimbo, a masculine-gender term that means \\"(male) baby\\" or \\"young (male) child\\" (the feminine form of the Italian word is bimba). Use of this term began in the United States as early as 1919, and was a slang word used to describe an unintelligentOxford English Dictionary, 1919 or brutish man, as in Portuguese. It was not until the 1920s that the term bimbo first began to be associated with females in popular culture. In 1920, Frank Crumit, Billy Jones, and Aileen Stanley all recorded versions of \\"My Little Bimbo Down on the Bamboo Isle\\", with words by Grant Clarke and music by Walter Donaldson. The songs uses the term \\"bimbo\\" is used to describe an island girl of questionable virtue. The 1929 silent film Desert Nights uses it to describe a wealthy female crook, and in The Broadway Melody, an angry Bessie Love calls a chorus girl a bimbo. The first use of its female meaning cited in the Oxford English Dictionary is dated 1929, from the scholarly journal American Speech, where the definition was given simply as \\"a woman\\". In the 1940s, bimbo was still being used to refer to both men and women, as in, for example the comic novel Full Moon by P. G. Wodehouse who wrote of \\"bimbos who went about the place making passes at innocent girls after discarding their wives like old tubes of toothpaste\\".Diarmaid √ì Muirithe, Words We Use: The Meaning of Words And Where They Come From, Gill & Macmillan Ltd, Oct 31, 2006 The term died out again for much of the 20th century until it became popular again in the 1980s, with political sex scandals.Justin Cord, The Unexpected Evolution of Language: Discover the Surprising Etymology of Everyday Words Hayes Adams Media, Sep 18, 2012 As bimbo began to be used increasingly for females, exclusively male variations of the word began to surface, like mimbo and himbo, a backformation of bimbo, which refers to an unintelligent, but attractive, man. The term is sometimes associated with men or women who dye their hair blond, indicating that physical attractiveness is more important to them than other, non-physical traits and as an extension to \\"the dumb blonde\\" stereotype. Aside from the previous paragraphs the word Bimbo appears in the British retailer Harrod's catalogue of 1912 page 1333 \\" BIMBO‚ÄîA powder for cleaning windows, mirrors, etc. per tin 0/5 \\". Usage in popular culture =Music= *In 1930, in an episode from the Dogville Comedies series of short films, entitled The Dogway Melody, one of the dogs portraying a sultan in a play, remarks on the \\"boatload of bimbos\\" he has for his harem. *In 1953, Jim Reeves recorded the song \\"Bimbo\\". *In 1974, Bimbo Jet released their hit \\"El Bimbo\\". *In 1997, the Danish band Aqua used the word bimbo in their major hit \\"Barbie Girl,\\" using the dumb blonde archetype as well (\\"I'm a blonde bimbo girl.\\"). It was noted by Mattel in the legal conflict against Aqua and their record company for the representation of the popular Barbie doll. *In 2001, the Swedish pop rock band Lambretta released a song called \\"Bimbo\\". *In 2012, Bridgit Mendler used the word bimbo in the song \\"Forgot to Laugh\\". *In 2012, Every Time I Die released a song called \\"Underwater Bimbos from Outer Space\\". =Internet= *A beauty contest game called Miss Bimbo is an online game in which players attempt to use virtual characters to win contests, earn IQ points and impress virtual boys, through makeovers, clothing, exercise, and the purchase of operations such as facelifts and breast implants. Although the game itself does not promote such activities in real life and is often viewed as a parody, it has received condemnation in the media from parent groups, especially in Europe. =Television= *The term \\"'mimbo\\", to mean a male bimbo, was first coined in the episode \\"The Stall\\" of American sitcom Seinfeld. in the context of Elaine Benes's boyfriend, Tony (Dan Cortese). *In The Amazing World of Gumball's season 2 episode \\"The Storm\\", Gumball tells Carmen he isn't a \\"cheap, reliable bimbo\\". However, only in the United States dubbing was this word replaced with \\"coward\\" despite the closed captions exposing the word when on. *In Hells Kitchen Gordon Ramsay referred to two customers as bimbos when they asked for some olive topping. *In the sitcom series How I Met Your Mother (2005-2014), the term refers to the numerous girls Ted Mosby and Barney Stinson used to date. =Politics= In American politics, the word was used in the 1990s during Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct allegations, leading to the invention of the term \\"Bimbo eruptions\\" to refer to political sex scandals.Grant Barrett, Hatchet Jobs and Hardball: The Oxford Dictionary of American Political Slang , Oxford University Press, Apr 21, 2006 The expression was also used in a 2014 report in which Colin Powell explained his reluctance to vote for Hillary Clinton in light of her husband's continued affairs with \\"bimbos\\". After the first 2015 Republican Presidential Debate, Donald Trump re-tweeted a message calling debate moderator and Fox News host Megyn Kelly a \\"bimbo\\" via Twitter. This took place after Kelly asked Trump a question that referenced his television show The Apprentice from season 6 in 2005. Shortly afterwards, Stephen Richter of The Globalist published an opinion piece in which he accused Trump of being a bimbo, noting the original definition of bimbo as 'an unintelligent or brutish male'.

History Rose State College was originally named Oscar Rose Junior CollegeBritton, Terry D., \\"Rose State College,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed May 6, 2010) in memory of Oscar V. Rose, a former Mid-Del School District school superintendent. The school was renamed Rose State College by Senate Bill Number 9 in April 1983 that went into effect on November 1, 1983. Rose State College offered its first classes on September 21, 1970. Voters in Midwest City, Del City, and portions of southeastern and northeastern Oklahoma City approved the college district in 1968. This vote followed passage of Senate Bill Number 2 in 1967, a law enabling district- operated community colleges to receive state aid. Voters then passed a $1.75 million general obligation bond issue, a two-mill levy for operating expenses in 1969, and a three-mill levy for operations in 1970. In December 1973, the junior college became a member of The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education, after approval from the Rose State College Board of Trustees. Rose State College exists as a publicly created and sustained, open-admissions, associate degree-granting college to provide comprehensive lower-division programs of higher education and related community services. To meet enrollment growth, the Communication Center was built in 1998, providing art, music, and journalism classrooms as well as a home for theatrical and musical performances. Part of the college was destroyed by a tornado on May 3, 1999; some of the damage in this area was rated high-end F4 on the Fujita scale, although F5 was considered. Popularity of the dental hygiene and dental assistant programs led to the construction of the Health Sciences Annex, completed in 2001. Rose State College has grown from an initial enrollment of 1,700 in 1970 to a regular fall enrollment of approximately 8,200. The campus now includes twenty-two buildings on approximately . Academics The college has a regular enrollment of more than 8,000 students and covers over . Rose State offers scholarships to students including Leadership Scholarships and the Ticket to Rose Program. Ticket to Rose provides free tuition and mandatory fees for graduates of Midwest City High School, Carl Albert High School, Choctaw High School, Del City High School, and Star Spencer High School. Student life Rose State's colors are blue and gold, and their mascot is the Raider, based on Doolittle's Raiders, best known for leading a bombing run on Tokyo on April 18, 1942, shortly following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, marking the U.S. entry into World War II. The college serves hundreds of military personnel each year due to its proximity to Tinker Air Force Base. The college runs a student newspaper, entitled The 15th Street News, and hosts a number of community events throughout the year.Rose State College Website (accessed May 6, 2010).

He was a grandson of Civil War general Samuel P. Heintzelman. Military career  He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of Cavalry from the United States Military Academy in 1899. For the first five years of his career, he served with the 6th Cavalry in Kansas and Idaho, the 4th Cavalry in the Philippines, and as part of the international force putting down the Boxer uprising in China. In 1904, Heintzelman began what would become a long and distinguished association with Fort Leavenworth when he was selected as the Infantry and Cavalry School honor graduate. After service in the Philippines, Heintzelman returned to Fort Leavenworth as an instructor followed by another academic assignment as the Professor of Military Art and Science at Princeton University. During World War I, as a general staff officer with the American Expeditionary Force, Heintzelman was responsible for planning the St. Mihiel Offensive. He also served with the French in the Chemin des Dames offensive in October 1917, and in winter operations in northern Italy with the French Tenth Army. He concluded his tour in France as Chief of Staff for both IV Corps and later Second Army. From 1921 to 1929, he held numerous command and staff positions including command of the 22nd Infantry Brigade, commander of the Eastern Defenses of New York, and Assistant Chief of Staff for War Plans. In 1929, he again returned to Fort Leavenworth to serve as the Commandant of the Command and General Staff College and was promoted to Major General in 1931.

The American Kennel Club. Retrieved 14 Feb 2020 The height of an American Staffordshire Terrier is 17-19 inches tall and weighs between 40-70 pounds. The American Kennel Club describes the breed as \\"confident, smart and, good-natured.\\" American Staffordshire Terriers are similar to American Pit Bull Terriers, though the American Pit Bull Terrier is not recognized by the American Kennel Club. The breed was accepted by the American Kennel Club in 1936. It should not be confused with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier of the United Kingdom.  History  One of the earliest AKC champions. Some varieties of bull and terrier from the British Isles began to find their way into America as early as 1850. Some dogs became very famous for their dog fighting skills. Already developed as an American dog, such dogs became a new breed, which was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in February 1898 as the American Pit Bull Terrier. On June 10, 1936, about 50 UKC registered Pit Bull Terrier dogs were accepted for registration in the American Kennel Club (AKC) Stud Book with a new breed name and a new purpose, belonging to the AKC terrier group. The name Staffordshire Terrier was chosen, with the claim that the ancestors of the breed originally came from Staffordshire, England. The name of the breed was revised on January 1, 1969, to American Staffordshire Terrier to distinguish it from the British Staffordshire Bull Terrier, a separate breed from the Bull-type terrier group, recognized in England in 1935. The AKC opened the AmStaff Stud Book to UKC dogs a few more times until the 1970s. Since then, only dogs with AKC registration were to be bred together, if the offspring was to be registered. This fact, along with the breed selection based entirely on conformation through decades, has transformed the American Staffordshire Terrier into a different breed, separated from the American Pit Bull Terrier. The breed's popularity began to decline in the United States following World War II. In 2018 the American Kennel Club ranked the American Staffordshire Terrier as the 85th most popular purebred breed in the United States.  Temperament  According to the American Kennel Club \\"The American Staffordshire Terrier, known to their fans as AmStaffs, are smart, confident, good-natured companions. Their courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well-socialized AmStaff is a loyal, trustworthy friend to the end.\\"  Description  A 1990s conformation champion According to AKC's published breed standard which was approved June 10, 1936, the \\"American Staffordshire Terrier should give the impression of great strength for his size, a well put-together dog, muscular, but agile and graceful, keenly alive to his surroundings. He should be stocky, not long-legged or racy in outline. His courage is proverbial.\\" His head should be medium in length with a broad skull, a distinct stop, and pronounced muscles in the cheek. The ears should be set high on their head and can be cropped or uncropped, but the latter is preferred. Height and weight should be in proportion. A height of about at shoulders for the male and for the female is to be considered preferable. The nose should always be black. Many coat colors are accepted. However, dogs with liver or black-and-tan coat, and dogs with more than 80% white are discouraged.  Health  Female blue brindle American Staffordshire TerrierTheir life expectancy is generally 12-16 years with good care. The breed may be vulnerable to skin allergies, urinary tract infections (UTI), and autoimmune diseases. Spondylosis and osteoarthritis are common in older dogs. Other notable issues may include: congenital heart disease, elbow dysplasia, hip dysplasia, luxating patella, thyroid dysfunction, and cerebellar ataxia. American Staffordshire Terrier pups should not be weaned before they are 8‚Äì10 weeks old.  Breed-specific legislation  Worldwide, the American Staffordshire Terrier has often been included in breed bans that target pit bull‚Äìtype dogs and/or fighting dog breeds. Such breed- specific legislation (BSL) may range from outright bans on possession to restrictions and conditions of ownership. Breed Specific Legislation has been enacted in various America states, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Ireland. Popularity In 2017, the breed was the 8th most popular dog according to Australian National Kennel Council. According to Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine it is the 6th most popular dog in France. According to American Kennel Club, it was the 85th most popular dog in 2019.

She translated the German chorale tradition of church hymns for English speakers, for which she is recognized liturgically by The Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. She also worked for wider educational opportunities for girls, and translated biographies of two founders of religious sisterhoods. When 16, Winkworth appears to have coined a once well-known political pun, peccavi, \\"I have Sindh\\", relating to the British occupation of Sindh. Early life Catherine Winkworth was born on 13 September 1827 at 20 Ely Place, Holborn on the edge of the City of London. She was the fourth daughter of Henry Winkworth, a silk merchant. In 1829, her family moved to Manchester, where her father had a silk mill and which city figured in the Industrial Revolution. Winkworth studied under the Rev. William Gaskell, minister of Cross Street Chapel, and with Dr. James Martineau, both of them eminent British Unitarians. Urban historian Harold L. Platt notes that in the Victorian period \\"The importance of membership in this Unitarian congregation cannot be overstated: as the fountainhead of Manchester Liberalism it exerted tremendous influence on the city and the nation for a generation.\\" She subsequently moved with the family to Clifton, near Bristol. Her sister Susanna Winkworth (1820‚Äì1884) was also a translator, mainly of German devotional works. Chorale tradition Catherine Winkworth spent a year in Dresden, during which time she took an interest in German hymnody. Around 1854, she published her book Lyra Germanica, a collection of German hymns which she had chosen and translated into English. A further collection followed in 1858. During 1863, she published The Chorale Book for England, which was coedited by the composers William Sterndale Bennett and Otto Goldschmidt. In 1869 she followed this with Christian Singers of Germany. According to The Harvard University Hymn Book, Winkworth \\"did more than any other single individual to make the rich heritage of German hymnody available to the English-speaking world.\\" Four examples of translations by her hand are published in The Church Hymn Book 1872 (Nos 344, 431, 664 and 807). Women's education Winkworth was also involved deeply in promoting women's education, as the secretary of the Clifton Association for Higher Education for Women, and a supporter of the Clifton High School for Girls, where a school house is named after her,Susan Drain: Winkworth, Catherine (1827‚Äì1878).

She was likewise governor of the Red Maids' School in Westbury-on-Trym in the city of Bristol. Winkworth translated biographies of two founders of sisterhoods for the poor and the sick: Life of Pastor Fliedner, 1861, and Life of Amelia Sieveking, 1863. Winkworth has been described as \\"an early feminist\\". Peccavi Punch, 18 May 1844 According to the Encyclopedia of Britain by Bamber Gascoigne (1993), it was Catherine Winkworth who, learning of General Charles James Napier's ruthless and unauthorised, but successful campaign to conquer the Indian province of Sindh, \\"remarked to her teacher that Napier's despatch to the governor-general of India, after capturing Sindh, should have been Peccavi\\" (Latin for \\"I have sinned\\": a pun on \\"I have Sindh\\"). She sent her joke to the new humorous magazine Punch, which printed it on 18 May 1844. She was then sixteen years old. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations attributes this to Winkworth, noting that it was assigned to her in Notes and Queries in May 1954. The pun has usually been credited to Napier himself. The rumour's persistence over the decades led to investigations in Calcutta archives, as well as comments by William Lee-Warner in 1917 and Lord Zetland, Secretary for India, in 1936.PECCAVI': A Good Story Killed\\", The Manchester Guardian, 14 February 1936. Death Catherine Winkworth died suddenly of heart disease near Geneva on 1 July 1878 and was buried in Monnetier, in Upper Savoy. A monument to her memory was erected in Bristol Cathedral. She is commemorated as a hymn writer with John Mason Neale on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 7 August and on the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 1 July.

It is one of two public university systems, the other being the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR). It consists of three primary campuses in Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Martin; a health sciences campus in Memphis; a research institute in Tullahoma; and various extensions throughout the state. The UT system has a combined student enrollment of more than 49,000 students, over 320,000 living alumni, and a total endowment that tops $1 billion. History The University of Tennessee was founded in Knoxville as Blount College in 1794. It became East Tennessee College in 1807, and gained university status in 1840. It was designated as the state's land-grant institution in 1869, and was renamed the \\"University of Tennessee\\" in 1879.Milton M. Klein (University Historian 1988-1997), University of Tennessee, Knoxville History , accessed September 11, 2010. The medical campus, the UT Health Science Center, was founded in Memphis in 1911. An adult education extension center was founded in Nashville in 1947. In 1927, UT founded the University of Tennessee Junior College, and bought the campus of the former UT acquired the property of the Hall-Moody Institute, a Baptist institution in the northwest Tennessee town of Martin, to use for the new college. In 1951, the school began awarding bachelor's degrees and became the University of Tennessee Martin Branch. In 1967, the campus was elevated to an autonomous four-year institution under the name of the University of Tennessee at Martin. In 1968, the UT system was officially formed, with the Knoxville and Martin campuses as primary campuses. That same year, the Tennessee state legislature gave UT permission to establish a campus in Chattanooga, which was the largest city in Tennessee without a public university. The private University of Chattanooga determined that it could not raise enough private capital to compete with a public institution, and agreed to merge with another private school, Chattanooga City College, to form the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 1969. Also in 1968, UT announced plans to expand the Nashville extension center into a full-fledged University of Tennessee at Nashville. Rita Sanders Geier filed a desegregation lawsuit against the state. Geier contended that if UT were allowed to build a campus in Nashville, where Tennessee State University was located, it would perpetuate a dual system of higher education. As a result, the UT Nashville campus was eventually merged with TSU by court order in 1979. Campuses There are five educational units of the university system, three of which are separate universities within this statewide higher education system. =University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UT)= UT Knoxville is the flagship campus of the UT system, based in Knoxville. The largest university in the state, it has a current total enrollment of 27,523. UT awarded 6,345 degrees in over 300 programs in the 2009-10 academic year. While not a separate entity, UT Knoxville operates a campus in Nashville that is part of the UT Knoxville College of Social Work. The Nashville Campus awards the M.S.S.W. in conjunction with UT Knoxville. =University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC)= UTC is a large university located in downtown Chattanooga. The university was founded as a private school in 1886, joined the UT system in 1969, and currently has over 10,000 students. =University of Tennessee at Martin (UT Martin)= Located in rural northwest Tennessee in Martin, UT Martin began in 1900 as Hall-Moody Institute, a private Baptist school. In 1927, the Tennessee Baptist Convention merged Hall-Moody Institute with Union University. The University of Tennessee System took over and the school became known as The University of Tennessee Junior College in Martin. It operated under this name until 1951 when four- year fields of study leading to bachelor's degrees were added. The name was then changed to The University of Tennessee Martin Branch. In 1967, it was designated a primary campus in the UT system and was given its current name, The University of Tennessee at Martin. With approximately 8,000 students, UT Martin comprises the main campus in Martin and four extended campuses located in Parsons, Selmer, Jackson, and Ripley. =University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC)= The University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) has its main campus in Memphis. UTHSC offers a wide variety of degree programs among its six colleges: Allied Health Sciences, Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy. UTHSC also has colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy, in addition to an Allied Health Sciences unit in Knoxville, as well as a College of Medicine campus in Chattanooga. In addition, UTHSC has more than 100 clinical and educational sites statewide. =University of Tennessee Space Institute (UT Space Institute)= The University of Tennessee Space Institute is located in Tullahoma. The Institute awards master's and doctoral degrees in conjunction with UT Knoxville. Other units The University of Tennessee system has several other units that provide service to the state of Tennessee and to the nation. =University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture= The Institute of Agriculture is composed of the Agricultural Experiment Station, UT Extension, and Knoxville's Herbert College of Agriculture and College of Veterinary Medicine. The Institute has a presence in all 95 counties through its educational programs in agriculture, home economics, resource development, and 4-H programs. =University of Tennessee Institute of Public Service= The Institute for Public Service was created in 1971 as a part of the university \\"to provide continuing research and technical assistance to state and local government and industry and to meet more adequately the need for information and research in business and government.\\" Components include the County Technical Assistance Service, the Municipal Technical Advisory Service, the Center for Industrial Services, the Law Enforcement Innovation Center, and the Naifeh Center for Effective Leadership. =UT-ORNL partnership= UT Knoxville and Battelle Memorial Institute are 50-50 partners in UT-Battelle, which manages the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the United States Department of Energy. Governance The University of Tennessee system is governed by the Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee. After the passage of the UT FOCUS Act in 2018, the board is made up of 12 trustees. These trustees include one ex officio voting member, the Commissioner of Agriculture, 10 voting members appointed by the Governor, and a single non-voting student member appointed by the board as a whole. One of the board's committees includes a single faculty representative. Both the Student Trustee and faculty representative rotate each year between the four main campuses. Administration The university system is administered by a president. Beginning in 1970, presidents served the University of Tennessee system. Prior to that, the president served the Knoxville flagship campus.

Name and discovery Fibrous, brownish crystals of cummingtonite - Locality: Dannemora Mine, Uppsala L√§n, Uppland, Sweden Cummingtonite was named after the town of Cummington, Massachusetts, where it was discovered in 1824.Chester Dewey, \\"A Sketch of the Geology and Mineralogy of the Western Part of Massachusetts, and a Small Part of Adjoining States\\", in American Journal of Science, first series, vol. 8, part 2, 1824, p. 1-60 It is also found in Sweden, South Africa, Scotland, and New Zealand. Chemistry Cummingtonite is a member of the cummingtonite-grunerite solid solution series which ranges from for magnesiocummingtonite to the iron rich grunerite endmember . Cummingtonite is used to describe minerals of this formula with between 30 and 70 per cent . Thus, cummingtonite is the series intermediate. Manganese also substitutes for ) within cummingtonite amphibole, replacing B site atoms. These minerals are found in high-grade metamorphic banded iron formation and form a compositional series between (tirodite) and (dannemorite). Calcium, sodium and potassium concentrations in cummingtonite are low. Cummingtonite tends toward more calcium substitution than related anthophyllite. Similarly, cummingtonite has lower ferric iron and aluminium than anthophyllite. Amosite is a rare asbestiform variety of grunerite that was mined as asbestos only in the eastern part of the Transvaal Province of South Africa. The origin of the name is Amosa, the acronym for the mining company \\"Asbestos Mines of South Africa\\". Occurrence Cummingtonite is commonly found in metamorphosed magnesium-rich rocks and occurs in amphibolites. Usually it coexists with hornblende or actinolite, magnesium clinochlore chlorite, talc, serpentine-antigorite minerals or metamorphic pyroxene. Magnesium-rich cummingtonite can also coexist with anthophyllite. Cummingtonite has also been found in some felsic volcanic rocks such as dacites. Manganese rich species can be found in metamorphosed Mn-rich rock units. The grunerite end member is characteristic of the metamorphosed iron formations of the Lake Superior region and the Labrador Trough. With prograde metamorphism cummingtonite and grunerite morph to members of the olivine and pyroxene series.

History The laughter epidemic began on January 30, 1962, at a mission-run boarding school for girls in Kashasha. It started with three girls and spread throughout the school, affecting 95 of the 159 pupils, aged 12‚Äì18. Symptoms lasted from a few hours to 16 days. The teaching staff were unaffected and reported that students were unable to concentrate on their lessons. The school closed on March 18. The epidemic spread to Nshamba, a village where several of the girls lived. In April and May, 217 mostly young villagers had laughing attacks. The Kashasha school reopened on May 21, and reclosed at the end of June. Earlier that month, the laughing epidemic spread to Ramashenye girls' middle school, near Bukoba, affecting 48 girls. The Kashasha school was sued for allowing the children and their parents to transmit it to the surrounding area. Other schools, Kashasha itself, and another village were affected to some degree. Eighteen months after it started, the phenomenon died off. The laughter reports were widely accompanied by descriptions of fainting, flatulence, respiratory problems, rashes, crying and screaming. In all, 14 schools were shut down and 1000 people were affected. Causes Christian F. Hempelmann, then of Purdue University, has theorized that the episode was stress-induced. In 1962, Tanganyika had just won its independence, he said, and students had reported feeling stressed because of higher expectations by teachers and parents. MPI, he says, usually occurs in people without a lot of power. \\"MPI is a last resort for people of a low status. It's an easy way for them to express that something is wrong.\\" Sociologist Robert Bartholomew and psychiatrist Simon Wessely both put forward a culture-specific epidemic hysteria hypothesis, pointing out that the occurrences in 1960s Africa were prevalent in missionary schools and Tanganyikan society was ruled by strict traditional elders, so the likelihood is the hysteria was a manifestation of the cultural dissonance between the ‚Äútraditional conservatism‚Äù at home and the new ideas challenging those beliefs in school, which they termed ‚Äòconversion reactions‚Äô.

Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and Maximilian von Welsch, representatives of the Austrian/South German Baroque style, were involved in the construction, as well as Robert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand, who were followers of the French Style. Balthasar Neumann, court architect of the Bishop of W√ºrzburg, was the principal architect of the Residence, which was commissioned by the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg Johann Philipp Franz von Sch√∂nborn and his brother Friedrich Carl von Sch√∂nborn in 1720, and completed in 1744. The Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, assisted by his son, Domenico, painted frescoes in the building. Interiors considered masterworks of Baroque/Rococo or Neoclassical architecture and art include the grand staircase, the chapel, and the Imperial Hall. The building was reportedly called the \\"largest parsonage in Europe\\" by Napoleon. It was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II, and restoration has been in progress since 1945. Since 1981, the Residence has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  History =18th century= The Prince-Bishops of W√ºrzburg resided in the Marienberg Fortress on a hill west of the Main river until the early 18th century. Johann Philipp Franz von Sch√∂nborn (1719‚Äì24) moved the court to a palace erected in 1701‚Äì4, the predecessor of the Residence. However, the rather small palace did not, in his opinion, measure up to his position as an absolute monarch - he was looking for something comparable to the Palace of Versailles or Sch√∂nbrunn Palace. Having won a sum of 600,000 fl. (a fortune at the time) in a court case in the year of his accession, he used the funds to undertake a building project that would proclaim his political standing to all. In this, he was eagerly supported by two relatives, his uncle the Archbishop of Mainz and Elector of Mainz, Lothar Franz von Sch√∂nborn (who confessed to have been possessed by a \\"Bauwurm\\", a building bug) and his brother Friedrich Carl von Sch√∂nborn, from 1704 to 1734 Imperial Vice- Chancellor in Vienna. Both supplied ideas and, crucially, artists from their circles. Friedrich Carl had met Hildebrandt in Vienna during the construction of the Belvedere. The foundation stone was laid on 22 May 1720. The construction started with the north block. However, Johann Phillip Franz' successor, Prince-Bishop Christoph Franz von Hutten (1724-9) had no great interest in building such an enormous palace. He only wanted the northern block to be finished. This construction was concluded in the year of his death. All other works ceased. Garden fa√ßade of the Residence, leading into the Court Gardens Front of the Residence and Cour d'honneur In the year 1730, however, under Prince-Bishop Friedrich Carl von Sch√∂nborn (1729‚Äì46), work on the south block began once more. In 1732-3, the front of the Cour d'honneur was completed. From 1735 onwards, the work on the central building took place with the participation of Lucas von Hildebrandt. In 1737, the main staircase by Balthasar Neumann was constructed. The garden front was completed in 1740 and the whole shell in December 1744. Neumann was mostly responsible for the Residence's town front, while Hildebrandt's work dominated on the garden side. The four interior courts of the side wings were an idea of von Welsch. The completion of the vaulted ceilings over the Emperor's Hall and the White Hall took place in 1742; the vault over the staircase in 1743. At the same time, the decorations of the Court Chapel were realized and its consecration performed in 1743. From 1740-5, the southern Kaiserzimmer (Imperial Apartments) and the Mirror Cabinet (Spiegelkabinett) were decorated by ornamental carver Ferdinand Hundt, by Johann Wolfgang van der Auvera, and Johann Rudolf Byss. Bossi also created the stucco-work in the White Hall during the years 1744-5. Under the rule of Prince-Bishop Anselm Franz von Ingelheim (1746-9), all building work on the Residence ceased once again. After his death, once Karl Philipp von Greifenclau zu Vollraths (1749‚Äì54) became Prince-Bishop, he ordered a resumption of construction. In the same year, Antonio Bossi completed the stucco-work in the Garden Hall, the painting of which was finished in the next year. In 1750, Lorenz Jakob Mehling, a merchant at Venice, sent Giovanni Battista Tiepolo to the bishopric residence, after the painter Giuseppe Visconti had failed.http://www.zum.de/Faecher/Materialien/ludwig/wagner/tiepolo/htms/tie- in-w.htm Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, assisted by his sons, decorated the Imperial Hall and the ceiling above the staircase with frescoes in the early 1750s. In 1753, Balthasar Neumann died. Under Prince-Bishop Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim (1755‚Äì79), and Ludovico Bossi created the stucco-work decoration over the staircase and in the first and second guest rooms of the northern Kaiserzimmer (Imperial Apartments) between 1769 and 1772. At the same time, the Green Lacquered Room and the Neoclassical F√ºrstensaal (Princes' Hall) were finished. From 1776 to 1781, the Ingelheimer R√§ume (Ingelheim Rooms) were decorated, including stucco-work by Materno Bossi. The total construction cost came to over 1.5 million guilders, at a time when a day labourer could expect a weekly wage of one guilder. =19th and early 20th centuries= The episcopal principality of W√ºrzburg was abolished with secularization in 1802/03. An eight-year interregnum by Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany (reigned 1806‚Äì1814) followed, during which he had several rooms of the south block, the so-called Toskanar√§ume (Tuscany Rooms), decorated in Empire style. Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte slept in the Residence when he stopped in W√ºrzburg three times between 1806 and 1813. On 2 October 1806 he signed the declaration of war against Prussia here. A Neoclassical double bed and bedside tables were installed in the sleeping room of the northern Imperial Apartments for him and his wife Marie Louise in 1812. In 1814, W√ºrzburg became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The wrought-iron gates across the Cour d'honneur, which had effectively separated this inner area from the large Residence Square, were demolished in 1821. In their place today is the Frankoniabrunnen (fountain) created by Ferdinand von Miller the Younger. This was unveiled in 1894 as a tribute by the city of W√ºrzburg and the whole of Franconia to Prince Regent Luitpold, who was born in 1821 in the W√ºrzburg Residence itself. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert stayed at the Residence on their way to Schloss Rosenau, Coburg, in August 1845. In 1921, the Residence was opened to the public. =Destruction in World War II= As a result of a devastating air raid on 16 March 1945, the residence was almost completely burnt out and only the central building with the Vestibule, Garden Hall, Staircase, White Hall and Imperial Hall survived the inferno, their roofs destroyed. From the attic the fire ate down through wooden ceilings and floors, and all the furnishings and wall panelling which had not been stored elsewhere were devoured by the flames. Much of the furnishing and large sections of the wall panelling of the period rooms had been removed in time and thus escaped destruction. Neumann's stone vaults withstood the collapse of the burning attic. However, because the roofs had gone, further damage was incurred in the ensuing period due to dampness. In the Court Chapel, for example, most of the ceiling frescoes by Byss succumbed to the subsequent consequences of the fire, in spite of the intact vault, and had to be laboriously reconstructed. =Post-war rebuilding= upright=1.2 From 1945 to 1987, the building and its interiors were reconstructed to their current state. The rebuilding cost about ‚Ç¨20m. =Inclusion in UNESCO World Heritage List= The W√ºrzburg Residence with its Court Gardens and Residence Square was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1981. According to the Advisory Body Evaluation, the inclusion in the List was a \\"measure... so clearly desirable that the proposal of the Federal Republic of Germany does not require lengthy justification... The Residence is at once the most homogeneous and the most extraordinary of the Baroque palaces... It represents a unique artistic realization by virtue of its ambitious program, the originality of creative spirit and the international character of its workshop.\\" Description Map of W√ºrzburg Residence with Court Gardens, including the Rosenbach Park (left) =Exterior= The Residence was constructed on a baseplate of 92 √ó 167 meters. The main structure consists of a central wing with two side wings, the north and south blocks, each with two interior courts. On the town side the side wings extend 55 m from the main structure, partially enclosing the Cour d'honneur. Beneath the mansard roof there is a cornice, decorated with vases and trophies. The fa√ßade around the main portal in the Cour d'honneur is particularly richly decorated. It lacks the lower mezzanine floor (see below) but sports a large balcony above the three portals accessible from the Weisser Saal (White Hall). Above the entrance a large coat-of-arms of Friedrich Carl von Sch√∂nborn is located. The Hofkirche (court chapel) is completely integrated into the western part of the southern wing and barely distinguishable from the outside. Originally, the Cour d'honneur was limited by a wrought-iron enclosure. This masterpiece of ironworks by Joh. Georg Oegg was demolished in 1821 and sold at auction, because a member of the family of the King of Bavaria did not like them. The square in front of the Residence today measures around 200 meters by 100 meters and is mostly used for parking. The :de:Frankoniabrunnen from 1894 is located in the square. =Interior= The Residence has four floors, a high-ceiling ground and upper floor with a mezzanine floor above each. These served to enliven the fa√ßade and offered room for servants' quarters, kitchens and administrative offices. The residence has almost 400 rooms. Staircase Main staircase In Baroque style, the staircase gained importance as part of a formal reception room. The staircase of the W√ºrzburg Residence spans its vault, an area of 18 √ó 32 meters, without pillars. Beneath an unsupported trough vault, a masterpiece of construction with a maximum height of 23 meters. The lowest part of the stair leads away from the reception hall, towards a blank wall and then splits into two stairs which double back. Thus, the host on the upper landing was able to see his visitors first who initially walked away from him. When the guests turned and approached, the vast ceiling fresco above was increasingly revealed to them. Tiepolo-residenz-wuerzburg.jpg W√ºrzburg tiepolo 1.jpg Tiepolo-residence- wuerzburg-africa.jpg Tiepolo-residence-wuerzburg-apollon-asia.jpg Tiepolo- residence-wuerzburg-africa-europe.jpg Tiepolo-residence-wuerzburg-asia.jpg Tiepolo-residence-wuerzburg-america-africa.jpg Tiepolo-residence-wuerzburg- europe.jpg Tiepolo-residence-wuerzburg-europe-asia.jpg Tiepolo-residence- wuerzburg-asia-america.jpg This fresco, the largest in the world, created from 1750-3 by Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo shows paintings of the four continents: Europe, America, Asia and Africa. Each continent is represented by a typical landscape and animals (or the painter's vision of these animals) and a female allegorical figure. Europe holds a sceptre, is symbolized by a bull, and has a boy playing with a cannon. America has natives with feathers, who practice cannibalism of prisoners, and a crocodile. Asia has a tiger and elephant, the crosses of Golgotha are visible in the background. Africans have a camel, and a caravan of turbanned Magi. Tiepolo was helped in his labors by his son Giandomenico and the stuccoist Antonio Bossi.Tiepolo, 1696-1770 pages 302. There is also a picture of the Prince- Bishop with Mercury approaching from Olympus while Apollo launches the sun horses, surrounded by incarnations of the stars. The fresco also shows Tiepolo himself (in the southwest corner) and Neumann, in the center of the southern front, leaning on a cannon. In preparation for his rendering of the large fresco, Tiepolo sketched a scaled-down version of the work; this sketch is on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Court architect Balthasar Neumann had to fight concerns about the dangers of such an enormous vault. Contrary to the vault with its colors, the stairs and the walls have hardly any decoration at all. While the vault is decorated in the Baroque style, the rest of the staircase is already decorated in the following Neoclassical style. Neumann originally wanted to add a second staircase on the other side of the White Hall, but this was vetoed by the Prince-Bishop's advisers due to the costs involved. The staircase was depicted on the back of the final version of 50 Deutsche Mark banknotes, which featured Neumann on the front. White Hall Detail of the stucco work of the White Hall The Weisser Saal or White Hall in Rococo style was the audience chamber and is dominated by the stucco decorations of Antonio Bossi. The white stucco works on a light gray background are composed of a large quantity of rocailles, mixed with images of real items, especially of military purpose. The lack of gold and colour allows the eye to rest between the splendours of the staircase and the Kaisersaal beyond. Five crystal chandeliers were used to light the room. Imperial Hall or Kaisersaal Kaisersaal The marriage of Emperor Frederick II and Beatrix of Burgundy, by Tiepolo This hall opens to the east from the White Hall and is located in the center of the garden front. It was used to receive visiting dignitaries, including the Emperors-to-be on their voyage to Frankfurt and on the return trip to Vienna. It was created in 1749-51 at enormous cost. The walls of the Imperial Hall consist of stucco work marble in shades of red, white and yellow. The dome is painted in white colour, decorated with golden stucco work and also frescoes by Tiepolo, showing an idealized history of the diocese of W√ºrzburg. One picture, Die Trauung Kaiser Barbarossas und der Beatrix von Burgund durch den W√ºrzburger F√ºrstbischof 1156 shows the marriage of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Countess Beatrix of Burgundy, consecrated by Gerold, Bishop of W√ºrzburg. The opposite picture shows Frederick II appointing the Bishop of W√ºrzburg Duke of Franconia. On top of the dome a painting shows the Brautfahrt: Apollo in the sun chariot leads the bride Beatrix surrounded by Venus, Ceres and Bacchus towards the Emperor Frederick II, who is accompanied by the Bishop of W√ºrzburg. Giovanni's son Domenico created the supraportes: Emperor Justinian I publishes the Corpus Juris Civilis, Emperor Constantine the Great orders the execution of Gallus, Ambrose denies access to the church to Emperor Theodosius I. Bossi's figures show Poseidon and Juno as well as Flora and Apollo. Southern and Northern Imperial Apartments or Kaiserzimmer When all the doors are opened between these halls they create an enfilade stretching along the garden front extending a total of 150 meters. These rooms served as reception halls and as accommodation for important guests. The impact of both apartments is generated by a sequence of rooms of increasing degrees of decoration. The most decorated room of the Southern Apartment is the Spiegelsaal or Mirror Cabinet. Its walls consist entirely of glass panels, decorated on the back using either paintings, or drawings engraved into a gold ground and then underlaid with dark gloss paint. All the paintings and drawings show oriental, especially Chinese, scenes. The southern part also includes the Toskanasaal. The highlight of the Northern Apartment is the Green Lacquered Room. Its multilayered wall coverings consist of a metallic green color decorated with paintings and golden ornaments. Court Chapel (Hofkirche) Interior of the Residence Hofkirche The Court Chapel is a prime example of the sacral Baroque style in Germany. The interior design is dominated by the curving walls and three intergradient oval dome vaults. It extends upwards through both of the main floors of the Residence. The supporting columns are made from agate-coloured marble. The columns of the two side altars and the six statues are made from white marble, carved at Genoa. The side altars are based on designs by Hildebrandt and were painted in 1752 by Tiepolo (Assumption of Mary to the south, War in Heaven to the north). The high altar is made from stucco created to look like marble by Antonio Bossi. Above the altar is a matroneum with a statue of the Immaculate Conception in the centre and oratories on both sides. Bossi was also responsible for the colourful stucco work on the ceiling (1735) and with painters H√∂gler and Thalhofer created the frescoes in the domes (1735-6): martyrdom of the three Franconian apostles Kilian, Totnan and Kolonat (over the choir), Coronation of the Virgin (in the centre) and War in Heaven (above the organ). =Court Gardens= View of the Residence from the Court Gardens with the Abduction of Proserpina in the front The Residence was built when W√ºrzburg was still a fortified town. Therefore, the garden too had to be planned within the fortifications. The solution included two bastions of the fortified town wall, using its differences in height to create a very special landscape. From west to east there is a rise in ground, until the level of the wall is reached. Near the residence itself, the Hofgarten (or Court Gardens) is designed in a very formal, Baroque style. Farther away, the style changes to an English garden with small forests and meadows. Designs for the former part were made by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, Neumann and Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s. It was mainly created in 1759-70. Johann Peter Alexander Wagner added putti, vases, urns and two monumental sculpture groups, the Rape of Europa and the abduction of Proserpina, sited in the central axis between the Orangery and the southern pavilion of the Residence. The figures were added to the park under Prince-Bishop Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, who had the park at Veitsh√∂chheim similarly decorated. Three monumental gates lead to the Court Gardens, commissioned by Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn from Joh. Georg Oegg.

It provides interpretation of Washington's life and achievements, as well as interpretation of 1850s slavery and farming through the use of buildings, gardens, crafts and animals. Congress authorized the Booker T. Washington Memorial half dollar to fund the purchase of the site. This commemorative half dollar was the first US coin to feature an African American, and was minted from 1946 to 1951 at three different mints. 18 varieties of the coin were produced, and more than 1.5 million were sold (primarily to collectors). Yet, after the coin's production was finished, the BTW Commission owed more money than it had assets, and the Commonwealth of Virginia had to step in to provide funds to purchase the site.

It was built at the request of King Louis XIV of France as a retreat for himself and his ma√Ætresse-en-titre of the time, the Marquise de Montespan, and as a place where he and invited guests could take light meals (collations) away from the strict √©tiquette of the royal court. The Grand Trianon is set within its own park, which includes the Petit Trianon (a smaller ch√¢teau built in the 1760s, during the reign of King Louis XV). Trianon de porcelaine Between 1663 and 1665, Louis XIV purchased the hamlet of Trianon, on the outskirts of Versailles. In 1670, he commissioned the architect Louis Le Vau to design a porcelain pavilion (Trianon de porcelaine) to be built there. The fa√ßade was made of white and blue Delft-style porcelain (ceramic) tiles from the French manufactures of Rouen, Lisieux, Nevers and Saint-Cloud. Construction began in 1670 and was finished in 1672. Since it was made of porcelain, the building suffered from deterioration. Louis XIV ordered its demolition in 1686 and replaced it with a larger building. Trianon de marbre =Under Louis XIV= By 1686, the fragile porcelain tiles of the Trianon de porcelaine had deteriorated to such a point that Louis XIV ordered the demolition of the pavilion and its replacement with one made of stronger material. Commission of the work was entrusted to the architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Hardouin-Mansart's new structure was twice the size of the porcelain pavilion, and the material used was red marble from Languedoc.ASMOSIA 4, 1999, p. 66. Begun in June 1687, the new construction (as we see it today) was finished in January 1688. It was inaugurated by Louis XIV and his secret wife, the Marquise de Maintenon, during the summer of 1688. Hardouin-Mansart's early plans for the building were substantially altered during construction, with the original intention of keeping the core of the Trianon de porcelaine intact vetoed in favor of an open-air peristyle with a screen of red marble columns facing onto the garden. At least three other structures were built at the center of the new building and then torn down before the peristyle was settled on, during the frantic building activity of the summer of 1687. The sloping Mansard roof of the original design, meant to harmonize with the roof of the Trianon de porcelaine, was vetoed by the king, who felt it looked too \\"heavy\\" on the structure.Walton, 1986; p.152-153 The long interior gallery which forks west from the main wing was built on the spot of a favorite outdoor promenade that Louis XIV enjoyed at the old Trianon de porcelaine. The interior design scheme departed significantly from what Louis XIV and his architects had established at the Palace of Versailles. Louis reputedly ordered the architects to \\"Paint everything white. No gilt or color for the walls of Trianon.\\"Walton, 1986; p.160 This was a departure from the variegated marbles, rich colors, and gilding which defined the interiors at Versailles. Instead of the heavy ornamentation on display in the palace, the walls of the Trianon were covered in delicately carved wood boiseries, with plaster friezes, pilasters, and capitals of noticeably more refined, delicate appearance.Walton, 1986; p.160 The Trianon was home to Louis XIV's extended family, housing his son and heir le Grand Dauphin from 1703 to 1711. The domain was also a favourite retreat of the Duchess of Burgundy, the wife of his grandson Louis de France, the parents of Louis XV. In the later years of Louis XIV's reign, the Trianon was the residence of the king's sister-in-law Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, Dowager Duchess of Orl√©ans and known at court as Madame. Her son, Philippe d'Orl√©ans, future son-in-law of Louis XIV and Regent of France, lived there with his mother. Louis XIV even ordered the construction of a larger wing for the Trianon, which was begun in 1708 by Mansart; this wing, called Trianon- sous-Bois, housed the Orl√©ans family, including Louis XIV's legitimised daughter Fran√ßoise-Marie de Bourbon. The king's youngest grandson, Charles de France, and his wife Marie Louise √âlisabeth d'Orl√©ans also resided there. The Orl√©ans family, who had apartments at the Palace of Versailles, were later replaced by Fran√ßoise-Marie's sister; the Duchess of Bourbon, Madame la Duchesse, lived at the Trianon and later built the Palais Bourbon in Paris, the design of which copied the Trianon. Andr√©-Charles Boulle, commode Mazarine (Mazarine cabinet), 1708, made for the Grand Trianon In 1708, the prototypes for the commodes Mazarine, then called bureaux, were delivered to the Trianon by Andr√©-Charles Boulle. The first Duke of Antin, Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin, director of the king's buildings, wrote to Louis XIV: \\"I was at the Trianon inspecting the second writing desk by Boulle; it is as beautiful as the other and suits the room perfectly.\\"Commode Mazarine In 1717, Peter the Great of Russia, who was studying the palace and gardens of Versailles, resided at the Trianon; the Peterhof Palace was inspired by Versailles. =Louis XV and after= The Grand Trianon's interior Louis XV did not bring any changes to the Grand Trianon. In 1740 and 1743, his father-in-law, Stanislas Leszczynski, former king of Poland, stayed there during his visits to Versailles. Later, it was during a stay at Trianon that Louis XV fell ill before being transported to the Palace of Versailles, where he died on 10 May 1774. No more than his predecessor had, Louis XVI brought no structural modifications to the Grand Trianon. His wife, Queen Marie Antoinette, who preferred the Petit Trianon, gave a few theatrical representations in the galerie des Cotelle, a gallery with paintings by Jean l'A√Æn√© Cotelle representing the bosquets of Versailles and Trianon.insecula.com During the French Revolution of 1789, the Grand Trianon was left to neglect. At the time of the First French Empire, Napoleon made it one of his residences, and he furnished it in the Empire Style. Napoleon lived at Trianon with his second wife, Marie Louise of Austria. The next royals to live at the Grand Trianon were the King and Queen of the French ‚Äì Louis Philippe I and his Italian wife Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies. He was a descendant of the Regent Philippe d'Orl√©ans, and she was a niece of Marie Antoinette. In October 1837, Marie d'Orl√©ans (daughter of Louis Philippe I) married Alexander of W√ºrttemberg at the Grand Trianon. In 1920, the Grand Trianon hosted the negotiations and signing of the Treaty of Trianon, which left Hungary with less than one-third of its pre-World War I land size. To Hungarians, the word \\"Trianon\\" remains to this day the symbol of one of their worst national disasters. In 1963, Charles de Gaulle ordered a renovation of the building. A popular site today for tourists visiting Versailles, it is also one of the French Republic's presidential residences used to host foreign officials.

He is on the editorial board of Catalyst, on the board of the Scott Trust, a council member of the Overseas Development Institute, and a visiting fellow at the University of Hertfordshire. Elliott's book Fantasy Island (2007) argued that the British economy was weaker than it appeared and a recession could dramatically damage its base of services. He supported Britain leaving the European Union after having voted to leave the EEC in 1975. Elliott is an outspoken critic of the European Union, authoring articles for the Guardian such as ‚ÄúBrexit is a rejection of Globalisation,‚Äù saying that the decision of the UK population to leave the European Union in 2016, is testament to the failure of the E.U. to act on promises it previously made to protect its member states from the worst extends of Globalisation. In Elliott's view, these include the funding of more affordable homes, and the provision of more employment opportunities.

It is native to Eastern North America in the United States and Canada, but has been introduced elsewhere in North America, as well as to Iceland, Europe, and Asia. In parts of its range, it is also known as the eastern brook trout, speckled trout, brook charr, squaretail, or mud trout, among others.Common names of Salvelinus fontinalis FishBase, retrieved 22 May 2015 A potamodromous population in Lake Superior, as well as an anadromous population in Maine, is known as coaster trout or, simply, as coasters. The brook trout is the state fish of nine U.S. states: Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia, and the Provincial Fish of Nova Scotia in Canada. Systematics and taxonomy The brook trout was first scientifically described as Salmo fontinalis by the naturalist Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1814. The specific epithet \\"fontinalis\\" comes from the Latin for \\"of a spring or fountain\\", in reference to the clear, cold streams and ponds in its native habitat. The species was later moved to the char genus Salvelinus. Though commonly called a trout, the brook trout is thus actually one of the chars, which in North America also include the lake trout, bull trout, Dolly Varden, and the Arctic char. There is little recognized systematic substructure in the brook trout, but two subspecies have been proposed. On the other hand, three ecological forms are distinguished. =Subspecies= The aurora trout, S. f. timagamiensis, is a subspecies native to two lakes in the Temagami District of Ontario, Canada. The silver trout, (Salvelinus agassizii or S. f. agassizii), is an extinct trout species or subspecies last seen in Dublin Pond, New Hampshire, in 1930. It is considered by fisheries biologist Robert J. Behnke as a highly specialized form of brook trout. =Ecological forms= Robert J. Behnke describes three ecological forms of the brook trout. A large lake form evolved in the larger lakes in the northern reaches of its range and are generally piscivorous as adults. A sea- run form that migrates into saltwater for short periods of time to feed evolved along the Atlantic coastline. Finally, a smaller generalist form that evolved in the small lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams throughout most of the original native range. This generalist form rarely attains sizes larger than or lives for more than three years. All three forms have the same general appearance. =Hybrids= Tiger trout (top 3), splake (bottom) The brook trout produces hybrids both with its congeners Salvelinus namaycush and Salvelinus alpinus, and intergeneric hybrids with Salmo trutta. The splake is an intrageneric hybrid between the brook trout and lake trout (S. namaycush). Although uncommon in nature, they are artificially propagated in substantial numbers for stocking into brook trout or lake trout habitats. Although they are fertile, back-crossing in nature is behaviorally problematic and very little natural reproduction occurs. Splake grow more quickly than brook trout and become piscivorous sooner and are more tolerant of competitors than brook trout. The tiger trout is an intergeneric hybrid between the brook trout and the Eurasian brown trout (Salmo trutta). Tiger trout occur very rarely naturally, but are sometimes artificially propagated. Such crosses are almost always reproductively sterile. They are popular with many fish-stocking programs because they can grow quickly, and may help keep coarse fish (wild non \\"sport\\" fish) populations in check due to their highly piscivorous (fish- eating) nature. The sparctic char is an intrageneric hybrid between the brook trout and the Arctic char (S. alpinus). Description Wyoming's Wind River Range Captive brook trout in an aquarium The brook trout has a dark green to brown color, with a distinctive marbled pattern (called vermiculation) of lighter shades across the flanks and back and extending at least to the dorsal fin, and often to the tail. A distinctive sprinkling of red dots, surrounded by blue halos, occurs along the flanks. The belly and lower fins are reddish in color, the latter with white leading edges. Often, the belly, particularly of the males, becomes very red or orange when the fish are spawning. Typical lengths of the brook trout vary from , and weights from . The maximum recorded length is and maximum weight . Brook trout can reach at least seven years of age, with reports of 15-year-old specimens observed in California habitats to which the species has been introduced. Growth rates are dependent on season, age, water and ambient air temperatures, and flow rates. In general, flow rates affect the rate of change in the relationship between temperature and growth rate. For example, in spring, growth increased with temperature at a faster rate with high flow rates than with low flow rates. Range and habitat U.S. native and introduced ranges of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) Native Appalachian brook trout Brook trout are native to a wide area of Eastern North America, but are increasingly confined to higher elevations southward in the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia and northwest South Carolina, Canada from the Hudson Bay basin east, the Great Lakes‚ÄìSaint Lawrence system, the Canadian maritime provinces, and the upper Mississippi River drainage as far west as eastern Iowa. Their southern historic native range has been drastically reduced, with fish being restricted to higher-elevation, remote streams due to habitat loss and introductions of brown and rainbow trout. As early as 1850, the brook trout's range started to extend west from its native range through introductions. The brook trout was eventually introduced into suitable habitats throughout the western U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th centuries at the behest of the American Acclimatization Society and by private, state, and federal fisheries authorities. Acclimatization movements in Europe, South America, and Oceania resulted in brook trout introductions throughout Europe, in Argentina, and New Zealand. Although not all introductions were successful, a great many established wild, self-sustaining populations of brook trout in non-native waters. =Habitat= Typical southern Appalachian brook trout habitat The brook trout inhabits large and small lakes, rivers, streams, creeks, and spring ponds. They prefer clear waters of high purity and a narrow pH range and are sensitive to poor oxygenation, pollution, and changes in pH caused by environmental effects such as acid rain. The typical pH range of brook trout waters is 5.0 to 7.5, with pH extremes of 3.5 to 9.8 possible. Water temperatures typically range from . Warm summer temperatures and low flow rates are stressful on brook trout populations‚Äîespecially larger fish. Coasters A potamodromous population of brook trout native to Lake Superior, which migrate into tributary rivers to spawn, are called \\"coasters\\". Coasters tend to be larger than most other populations of brook trout, often reaching in size. Many coaster populations have been severely reduced by overfishing and habitat loss by the construction of hydroelectric power dams on Lake Superior tributaries. In Ontario and Michigan, efforts are underway to restore and recover coaster populations. Salters When Europeans first settled Eastern North America, semianadromous or sea-run brook trout, commonly called \\"salters\\", ranged from southern New Jersey, north throughout the Canadian maritime provinces, and west to Hudson Bay. Salters may spend up to three months at sea feeding on crustaceans, fish, and marine worms in the spring, not straying more than a few miles from the river mouth. The fish return to freshwater tributaries to spawn in the late summer or autumn. While in salt water, salters gain a more silvery color, losing much of the distinctive markings seen in freshwater. However, within two weeks of returning to fresh water, they assume typical brook trout color and markings. Ecology and reproduction =Diet= Brook trout have a diverse diet that includes larval, pupal, and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies, and aquatic dipterans), and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers, and crickets) that fall into the water, crustaceans, frogs and other amphibians, molluscs, smaller fish, invertebrates, and even small aquatic mammals such as voles. =Reproduction= The female constructs a depression in a location in the stream bed, sometimes referred to as a \\"redd\\", where groundwater percolates upward through the gravel. One or more males approach the female, fertilizing the eggs as the female expresses them. A majority of spawnings involve peripheral males which directly influences the number of eggs that survive into adulthood. In general, the larger the number of peripheral males present, the more likely the eggs will be cannibalized. The eggs are slightly denser than water. The female then buries the eggs in a small gravel mound; they hatch in 95 to 100 days. Angling The brook trout is a popular game fish with anglers, particularly fly fishermen. Nathan Currier lithograph of Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait's painting \\"Catching a Trout\\", 1854 - depicts fishermen catching a brook trout near South Haven Church in a mill pond on Carmans River Long Island, New York. Purportedly it illustrates an occasion when Daniel Webster, an avid angler, caught a large (about ) brook trout at the location in 1823 (or 1827). Brook trout chasing an artificial fly from American Fishes (1903) Until it was displaced by introduced brown trout (1883) and rainbow trout (1875), the brook trout attracted the most attention of anglers from colonial times through the first 100 years of U.S. history. Sporting writers such as Genio Scott Fishing in American Waters (1869), Thaddeus Norris American Anglers Book (1864), Robert Barnwell Roosevelt Game Fish of North America (1864) and Charles Hallock The Fishing Tourist (1873) produced guides to the best-known brook trout waters in America. As brook trout populations declined in the mid-19th century near urban areas, anglers flocked to the Adirondacks in upstate New York and the Rangeley lakes region in Maine to pursue brook trout. In July 1916 on the Nipigon River in northern Ontario, an Ontario physician, John W. Cook, caught a brook trout, which stands as the world record. Today, many anglers practice catch-and-release tactics to preserve remaining populations, and organizations such as Trout Unlimited have been in the forefront of efforts to institute air and water quality standards sufficient to protect the brook trout. Revenues derived from the sale of fishing licenses have been used to restore many sections of creeks and streams to brook trout habitat. The current world angling record brook trout was caught by Dr. W. J. Cook on the Nipigon River, Ontario, in July 1915. The trout weighed only because, at the time of weighing, it was badly decomposed after 21 days in the bush without refrigeration. A brook trout, caught in October 2006 in Manitoba, is not eligible for record status since it was released alive. This trout weighed about based on the accepted formula for calculating weight by measurements, and it currently stands as the record brook trout for Manitoba. Tenkara fly rod in Yosemite National Park. Artificial propagation and aquaculture Brook trout are also commercially raised in large numbers for food production, being sold for human consumption in both fresh and smoked forms. Because of its dependence on pure water and a variety of aquatic and insect life forms, the brook trout is also used for scientific experimentation in assessing the effects of pollution and contaminated waters. Brook trout are also raised commercially and sold to angling organisations or groups to stock their own lakes or ponds. There are businesses that hold a \\"U-fish license\\", where the public can come fish at their lake or pond and buy the fish that they catch. Brook trout are not commonly raised on a commercial scale because they do not grow as fast as other types of fish. Brook trout raised commercially are often kept in large circular tanks with a constant flow of water going through them. This allows for a current to circulate through the tank and keep it clean, acting as a flush of water that takes fish waste with it. Some more elaborate systems operate on a re-circulation system where the water is filtered and reused. The fish are typically fed a pelleted food consisting of 40‚Äì50% protein and 15% fat. The fish food is usually made from fish oil, animal protein, plant protein and vitamins and minerals. The protein is often sourced from soy beans. Conservation status Brook trout populations depend on cold, clear, well-oxygenated water of high purity. As early as the late 19th century, native brook trout in North America became extirpated from many watercourses as land development, forest clear-cutting, and industrialization took hold. Streams and creeks that were polluted, dammed, or silted up often became too warm to hold native brook trout, and were colonized by transplanted smallmouth bass and perch or other introduced salmonids such as brown and rainbow trout. The brown trout, a species not native to North America, has replaced the brook trout in much of the brook trout's native water. Brook trout populations, if already stressed by overharvest or by temperature, are very susceptible to damage by the introduction of exogenous species. Many lacustrine populations of brook trout have been extirpated by the introduction of other species, particularly percids, but sometimes other spiny-rayed fishes. In addition to chemical pollution and algae growth caused by runoff containing chemicals and fertilizers, air pollution has also been a significant factor in the disappearance of brook trout from their native habitats. In the U.S., acid rain caused by air pollution has resulted in pH levels too low to sustain brook trout in all but the highest headwaters of some Appalachian streams and creeks. Brook trout populations across large parts of eastern Canada have been similarly challenged; a subspecies known as the aurora trout was extirpated from the wild by the effects of acid rain. Today, in many parts of the range, efforts are underway to restore brook trout to those waters that once held native populations, stocking other trout species only in habitats that can no longer be recovered sufficiently to sustain brook trout populations. Organizations such as Trout Unlimited and Trout Unlimited Canada are partnering with other organizations such as the Southern Appalachian Brook Trout Foundation, the Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture, and state, provincial, and federal agencies to undertake projects that restore native brook trout habitat and populations. =As an invasive species= Although brook trout populations are under stress in their native range, they are considered an invasive species where they have been introduced outside their historic native range. In the northern Rocky Mountains, non-native brook trout are considered a significant contributor to the decline or extirpation of native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) in headwater streams. Non-native brook trout populations have been subject to eradication programs in efforts to preserve native species. In Yellowstone National Park, anglers may take an unlimited number of non-native brook trout in some drainages. In the Lamar River drainage, a mandatory kill regulation for any brook trout caught is in effect. In Europe, introduced brook trout, once established, have had negative impacts on growth rates of native brown trout (S. trutta).

Biography  Lambek was born in Leipzig, Germany, where he attended a Gymnasium. He came to England in 1938 as a refugee on the Kindertransport. From there he was interned as an enemy alien and deported to a prison work camp in New Brunswick, Canada. There, he began in his spare time a mathematical apprenticeship with Fritz Rothberger, also interned, and wrote the McGill Junior Matriculation in fall of 1941. In the spring of 1942, he was released and settled in Montreal, where he entered studies at McGill University, graduating with an honours mathematics degree in 1945 and an M.Sc. a year later. In 1950, he completed his doctorate under Hans Zassenhaus becoming McGill's first Ph.D. in mathematics. Lambek became assistant professor at McGill; he was made a full professor in 1963. He spent his sabbatical year 1965‚Äì66 in at the Institute for Mathematical Research at ETH Zurich, where Beno Eckmann had gathered together a group of researchers interested in algebraic topology and category theory, including Bill Lawvere. There Lambek reoriented his research into category theory. Lambek retired in 1992 but continued his involvement at McGill's mathematics department. In 2000 a festschrift celebrating Lambek's contributions to mathematical structures in computer science was published. On the occasion of Lambek's 90th birthday, a collection Categories and Types in Logic, Language, and Physics was produced in tribute to him.  Scholarly work  Lambek's PhD thesis investigated vector fields using the biquaternion algebra over Minkowski space, as well as semigroup immersion in a group. The second component was published by the Canadian Journal of Mathematics. He later returned to biquaternions when in 1995 he contributed \\"If Hamilton had prevailed: Quaternions in Physics\\", which exhibited the Riemann‚ÄìSilberstein bivector to express the free-space electromagnetic equations. Lambek supervised 17 doctoral students, and has 75 doctoral descendants as of 2020. He has over 100 publications listed in the Mathematical Reviews, including 6 books. His earlier work was mostly in module theory, especially torsion theories, non-commutative localization, and injective modules. One of his earliest papers, , proved the Lambek‚ÄìMoser theorem about integer sequences. In 1963 he published an important result, now known as Lambek's theorem, on character modules characterizing flatness of a module. His more recent work is in pregroups and formal languages; his earliest works in this field were probably and . He is noted, among other things, for the Lambek calculus, an effort to capture mathematical aspects of natural language syntax in logical form, and a work that has been very influential in computational linguistics, as well as for developing the connections between typed lambda calculus and cartesian closed categories (see Curry‚ÄìHoward‚ÄìLambek correspondence).

In the 1980s, it was standard industry practice to bundle a BASIC interpreter with microcomputers, and the PCW followed this practice. While it was primarily a LocoScript word processor for business use, it also ran the CP/M operating system. Though there were existing implementations of BASIC for CP/M, such as Digital Research's CBASIC and the third-party ZBasic, they followed the earlier 1970s model of compilers that were fed source code prepared in a separate text editor. Mallard was more like a traditional microcomputer ROM BASIC, with an integrated editor that was tailored for the PCW's non-standard 90-column screen. Although the PCW actually had excellent monochrome graphics support for its time and specification, closely comparable to the Hercules Graphics Card for IBM PC compatible computers, Mallard BASIC had no graphics support whatsoever. Instead, Locomotive Software optimised it for business use, with, for instance, full ISAM random-access file support, making it easier to write database applications. It was also optimised for speed ‚Äî it is named after the LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard locomotive, the fastest steam locomotive in the world, once again displaying the company's fondness for railway-oriented nomenclature. In fact, the Locomotive Software name came from the phrase \\"to run like a train\\" and it was this theme that was used to name Mallard BASIC ‚Äî no other Locomotive Software product was named after anything railway-oriented. The Acorn version was designed simply to run the Compact Software small business accounting products Acorn was including to target its Z80 second processor at small businesses. Mallard's major innovation designed specifically for Acorn was the addition of the Jetsam B*-tree keyed access filing system to give similar (but superior) features to the Miksam product Compact had originally designed around. Graphics could be implemented by loading the GSX extension to CP/M, but this was cumbersome for BASIC programmers. The lack of graphics support was rectified by several BASIC toolkits, of which the most popular was Lightning Extended BASIC (LEB ‚Äî see external links). This patched Mallard BASIC, replacing the redundant LET keyword with LEB, which could be followed by a wide variety of parameters to allow sophisticated graphics (for the time) to be drawn on screen, saved to disc, printed, and so on. Probably the most widespread Mallard application ever was RPED, the text editor supplied with the PCW. The name was short for Roland Perry's EDitor, the program having being quickly written by Roland Perry, the Amstrad executive running the computer product development, when it was realised that CP/M-80 came with no usable full-screen editor, but users had a requirement to edit configuration files. The same problem was apparent with DOS Plus and MS-DOS supplied with IBM-compatible Amstrad computers, but the RPED for those machines was written in Intel 8086 assembler, and not Mallard BASIC. The IBM PC version of Mallard Basic is still available from LocoScript Software as an MS-DOS program, which will run under Windows as a disc-only version with licence or with the full Introduction & Reference manual.

Background Abu Bakar was one of two sons of Cheikh Anta Diop, a sister of the founding emperor Sundiata Keita. He was the last of a mini-dynasty within the Keita clan of emperors descending from Kolonkan. After his abdication in 1311, the Faga Laye mini-dynasty would control the empire.

Al-Umari visited Cairo after Mansa Musa stopped there during his historic hajj to Mecca, and recorded a conversation between Musa and his host, Abu'l Hasan Ali ibn Amir Habib. According to Musa, Abu Bakr became convinced that he could find the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, and outfitted two expeditions to find it.\\"The Legend of How Mansa Abu Bakr II of Mali Gave up the Throne to Explore the Atlantic Ocean\\", Ancient Origins, 21 Feb. 2016.\\"Abbas Hamdani, An Islamic Background to the Voyages of Discovery.

Following Abu Bakr II's failure to return from the second of those expeditions, Mansa Musa acceded to the throne. =Atlantic expeditions= The Arab-Egyptian scholar Al-Umari quotes Mansa Musa as follows: =Trans-Atlantic travel= Ivan van Sertima and Malian researcher Gaoussou Diawara, proposed that Abu Bakr II traveled to the New World.Garifuna Foundation Africa's Greatest Explorer - BBC (2000) Van Sertima cites the abstract of Columbus's log made by Bartolom√© de las Casas, according to which the purpose of Columbus's third voyage was to test both the claims of King John II of Portugal that \\"canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea [West Africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise\\" as well as the claims of the native inhabitants of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola that \\"from the south and the southeast had come black people whose spears were made of a metal called guan√≠n ... from which it was found that of 32 parts: 18 were gold, 6 were silver, and 8 copper.\\" However, many archaeologists, anthropologists, ethnohistorians, linguists, and other modern pre-Columbian scholars say that there is no evidence of any such voyage reaching the Americas, and that there are insufficient evidentiary grounds to suppose there has been contact between Africa and the New World at any point in the pre- Columbian era. For views representative of this point of view, see the considerations on the question advanced in Haslip-Viera et al. (1997), who for example note \\"no genuine African artifact has ever been found in a controlled archaeological excavation in the New World\\".

Ortiz de Montellano et al. (1997, passim.) continues the case against Africa-Americas contacts.

He is best remembered for the four films he made with Powell & Pressburger, particularly as Conductor 71 in A Matter of Life and Death and as Julian Craster in The Red Shoes, and also for the title role in the long- running TV drama series, The Expert. He regularly performed French and German roles. Life and career Goring was born in Newport, Isle of Wight, the son of an eminent physician and researcher, Dr Charles Goring, the author of The English Convict, and Kate Macdonald. After attending the Perse School in Cambridge, where he became a friend of an older boy, the future documentary film maker Humphrey Jennings, he studied at the universities of Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna and Paris.GORING, Marius, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2015; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014Tom Vallence Obituary: Marius Goring, The Independent, 2 October 1998 He made his professional debut in 1927, playing Harlequin, and toured the continent playing classical roles with the Compagnie des Quinze under the directorship of Michel Saint-Denis who he would later encourage to come to England and work as a director. He also studied under Harcourt Williams and at the Old Vic dramatic school from 1929 to 1932. His early stage career included appearances at the Old Vic, Sadler's Wells, Stratford and several European tours; he was fluent in French and German. During the 1930s, he played a variety of Shakespearean roles at the Old Vic, including the title role in Macbeth and Romeo in Romeo and Juliet (1933), Feste in Twelfth Night (1937), in addition to Trip in Sheridan's The School for Scandal. He first worked in the West End in a 1934 revival of Granville- Barker's The Voysey Inheritance at the Shaftesbury Theatre. In 1929, he became a founding member of British Equity, the actors' union, served on its council from 1949 and was three times its vice president from 1963 to 1965, 1975 to 1977 and again from 1980 to 1982. Goring's relationship with his union was fraught with conflict: he took it to litigation on three occasions. In 1978, regarding the issue of the supremacy of a referendum to decide Equity rules, he took it as far as the House of Lords and won his case. In 1992, he unsuccessfully sought to end the restriction on the sale of radio and television programmes to apartheid South Africa. This particular litigation nearly bankrupted him, due to the heavy amount of court costs. In November 1931, at the age of nineteen, he married twenty-nine year old Mary Westwood Steel (1902-1994) at Gretna Green, Scotland (they had a second marriage ceremony in a London register office in February 1932) and their only child, a daughter Phyllida, was born in March 1932. The marriage did not succeed and he became engaged in 1935 to ballet choreographer and designer, Susan 'Susy' Salaman, older sister of Merula Salaman Guinness, wife of Alec Guinness. Susy contracted acute encephalitis in late 1935 and was left brain damaged. Goring wanted to go ahead with the wedding but Susy's father, Michel Salaman, would not allow it. In 1935, he co-founded the London Theatre Studio with Michel Saint-Denis, George Devine and Glen Byam Shaw. It trained actors, directors and designers and was a precursor of the Old Vic Theatre School. Marius taught Shakespeare there to the students. Unfortunately, it had to close in late 1939 due to the outbreak of war. Goring (left) played the part of Conductor 71 with David Niven as Peter Carter in A Matter of Life and Death. Goring's film career began with an uncredited role in The Amateur Gentleman (1936) with Douglas Fairbanks Jr and a small speaking role in Rembrandt (also 1936). He shared his one scene in this film with the star Charles Laughton, with whom he had previously worked on stage at The Old Vic. He made two further films released in 1939: Flying Fifty-Five with Derrick de Marney where he showed off his comedic skills playing an amusing drunkard and co-starred with Conrad Veidt in his first Powell and Pressburger film, The Spy in Black, an intriguing spy thriller set during World War One, where he played a German officer for the first of many times in his film career. When war was declared in September 1939, he was back in the West End as Pip in a production of Great Expectations, adapted for the stage by Alec Guinness. Along with all other plays, it was closed down temporarily by the war but was the first to resume when theatres were reopened in early 1940. He joined the British Army in June 1940, and was seconded in 1941 to the BBC as supervisor of radio productions broadcasting to Germany. He made broadcasts under the name Charles Richardson (using his father's first name and maternal grandmother's maiden name), because of the association of his name with Hermann G√∂ring. In 1944 he became a member of the intelligence staff of SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force) where he attained the rank of colonel. Because of the broadcasts he had been making to Germany, set up by the Foreign Office as an antidote to William Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw), he was put on a Nazi hit-list. In 1941, he married his second wife, the German actress Lucie Mannheim (1899-1976). Mannheim, who was Jewish, had been a principal actress in the Berlin Theatre but had to leave Germany when the Nazis came to power. She worked with Goring in many stage productions from the 1930s onwards and in seven episodes of The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel, one of which he wrote especially for her, as well as in several films. Mannheim died in 1976, and the next year Goring married television director/producer Prudence Fitzgerald (1930-2018), who had directed him in many episodes of The Expert. In the film A Matter of Life and Death (1946) Goring played Conductor 71 whose role is to ‚Äòconduct‚Äô Peter Carter (David Niven) to the afterlife. In the film The Red Shoes, he played Julian Craster, a young composer who wins the heart of ballerina Vicky Page (Moira Shearer) and clashes with the imperious ballet impresario, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). In the film Odette released in the UK in 1950, Goring played the role of Colonel Henri, a German Abwehr (Military Intelligence) officer who deceived and captured Odette. The film is based on the true story of Odette Sansom, the first living woman to be awarded the George Cross. The real Odette Sansom was later a witness at his marriage to Prudence Fitzgerald in 1977. He played Colonel G√ºnther von Hohensee in So Little Time (1952), which also featured Maria Schell, one of his rare romantic leads and frequent roles playing a German officer. He considered the film as one of his favourites, alongside the four films he made with Powell and Pressburger. His TV work included starring as Sir Percy Blakeney in The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel (ITV, 1955) (a role which he also performed in a 1952-53 radio show), a series which he also co-wrote and produced; Theodore Maxtible in the Doctor Who story The Evil of the Daleks (BBC, 1967); Professor John Hardy in The Expert (BBC, 1968‚Äì1976); Paul von Hindenburg in Fall of Eagles (BBC, 1974); King George V in Edward & Mrs. Simpson (Thames, 1980) and Emile Englander in The Old Men at the Zoo (BBC, 1983). Goring's voice provides the narration of the sound and light show performed regularly in the evening at the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1979 and appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1991. He died from stomach cancer in 1998 aged 86 at his home in Rushlake Green, East Sussex, survived by his third wife, Prudence and daughter, Phyllida. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Warbleton, East Sussex near Rushlake Green with his wife, Prudence, who died in 2018.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11800586/marius-goring\\" Complete filmography * The Amateur Gentleman (1936) - Minor Role (uncredited) * Rembrandt (1936) - Baron Leivens (uncredited) * Dead Men Tell No Tales (1938) - Greening * Consider Your Verdict (1938 short) - The Novelist * Flying Fifty- Five (1939) - Charles Barrington * The Spy in Black (1939) - Lt.

Grenland, Gr√¶nafylket and Vestmar In the early Viking Age, before Harald Fairhair, Grenland, was a petty kingdom. Originally Grenland was probably the name of the region surrounding the lake Norsj√∏ in Nedre Telemark, however, not identical with Gr√¶nafylket which also included the coastal villages. Gr√¶nafylket (or Grenafylket) contained the coastal region Vestmar and the landscapes further inland. Vestmar is assumed to signify the land to the west of the sea (mar), however sea in this case should be interpreted as fjord, i.e. Langesundsfjorden. Vestmar was described as a county already in the 8th century AD. The name Grenland is derived from a people, the Grener, i.e. \\"the land of the Grener\\". It is mentioned as a Gothic nation by Jordanes in his work Getica from about 551 AD: \\"Sunt quamquam et horum positura Granii, Agadii, Eunixi, Thelae, Rugi, Harothi, Ranii.\\" (Getica, III:24) Metropolitan Grenland Grenland is also the name of an agglomeration consisting of the cities Skien and Porsgrunn. { border -bgcolor=#dddddd !

The municipalities had been closely integrated since the establishment of the Hydro factory at Her√∏ya, and conurbation between the settlements was also significant. However, the idea was opposed by Solum as well as Porsgrunn, Eidanger and Brevik and soon fell out of grace. Eidanger proposed a merger with Brevik and Porsgrunn, and the enlarged Porsgrunn municipality was finally created on 1 January 1964. Brevik lost its city status in the process. In light of this merger, the central authorities saw only one possible solution; a similar merger between Solum, Gjerpen and Skien. Unlike the first proposal, this was met by protests from Gjerpen - to no avail, as the case went to the Norwegian Parliament. The result was a significantly enlarged Skien municipality. On 1 January 1968 an area from the old Gjerpen and Solum municipalities with 3,554 inhabitants was moved to Porsgrunn. In addition, the urban municipalities Langesund and Stathelle was incorporated into the rural municipality Bamble. Like Brevik, both Langesund and Stathelle lost their city status. Siljan municipality remained unaffected by the mergers, contrary to the initial expectations. Today Brevik, Stathelle and Langesund have all regained their city status.

The term MoSCoW itself is an acronym derived from the first letter of each of four prioritization categories (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have), with the interstitial Os added to make the word pronounceable. While the Os are usually in lower-case to indicate that they do not stand for anything, the all-capitals MOSCOW is also used.  Background  This prioritization method was developed by Dai Clegg and first used extensively with the agile project delivery framework Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM). MoSCoW is often used with timeboxing, where a deadline is fixed so that the focus must be on the most important requirements, and as such is a technique commonly used in agile software development approaches such as Scrum, rapid application development (RAD), and DSDM.  Prioritization of requirements  All requirements are important, but they are prioritized to deliver the greatest and most immediate business benefits early. Developers will initially try to deliver all the Must have, Should have and Could have requirements but the Should and Could requirements will be the first to be removed if the delivery timescale looks threatened. The plain English meaning of the prioritization categories has value in getting customers to better understand the impact of setting a priority, compared to alternatives like High, Medium and Low. The categories are typically understood as: ; Must have : Requirements labelled as Must have are critical to the current delivery timebox in order for it to be a success. If even one Must have requirement is not included, the project delivery should be considered a failure (note: requirements can be downgraded from Must have, by agreement with all relevant stakeholders; for example, when new requirements are deemed more important). MUST can also be considered an acronym for the Minimum Usable Subset. ; Should have : Requirements labelled as Should have are important but not necessary for delivery in the current delivery timebox. While Should have requirements can be as important as Must have, they are often not as time-critical or there may be another way to satisfy the requirement so that it can be held back until a future delivery timebox. ; Could have : Requirements labelled as Could have are desirable but not necessary and could improve the user experience or customer satisfaction for a little development cost. These will typically be included if time and resources permit. ; Won't have (this time) : Requirements labelled as Won't have, have been agreed by stakeholders as the least-critical, lowest-payback items, or not appropriate at that time. As a result, Won't have requirements are not planned into the schedule for the next delivery timebox. Won't have requirements are either dropped or reconsidered for inclusion in a later timebox. (Note: occasionally the term Would like to have is used; however, that usage is incorrect, as this last priority is clearly stating something is outside the scope of delivery). =Variants= Sometimes W is used to mean Wish (or Would), i.e. still possible but unlikely to be included (and less likely than Could). This is then distinguished from X for Excluded for items which are explicitly not included.  Use in new product development  In new product development, particularly those following agile software development approaches, there is always more to do than there is time or funding to permit (hence the need for prioritization). For example, should a team have too many potential epics (i.e., high-level stories) for the next release of their product, they could use the MoSCoW method to select which epics are Must have, which Should have, and so on; the minimum viable product (or MVP) would be all those epics marked as Must have. Oftentimes, a team will find that, even after identifying their MVP, they have too much work for their expected capacity. In such cases, the team could then use the MoSCoW method to select which features (or stories, if that is the subset of epics in their organisation) are Must have, Should have, and so on; the minimum marketable features (or MMF) would be all those marked as Must have. If there is sufficient capacity after selecting the MVP or MMF, the team could then plan to include Should have and even Could have items too.  Criticism  Criticism of the MoSCoW method includes: * Doesn't help decide between multiple requirements with same rank. * Lack of rationale around how to rank competing requirements: why something is must rather than should. * Ambiguity over timing, especially on the Won't have category: whether it is not in this release or not ever. * Potential for political focus on building new features over technical improvements (such as refactoring).

The Titleist brand, established in 1932 by Philip E. Young, focuses on golf balls. The name Titleist is derived from the word \\"titlist\\", which means \\"title holder\\". Several marketing mottos have been promoted for the Titleist brand, including \\"The #1 ball in golf\\", \\"Serious clubs for serious golfers\\", and \\"It's not how you mark your golf ball, it's how you mark your Titleist\\".  History  Phillip E. \\"Skippy da Do\\" Young, a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded Titleist in 1932. When playing a round of golf with his dentist, Young missed a sure putt that seemed to be caused by the weight of the ball. He then asked his dentist friend to X-ray the ball and the film showed that the rubber core was off-center. After this initial discovery, Young took X-rays of more golf balls and found that most were poorly constructed with off-center cores and prone to erratic shots. This inspired Young to produce his own line of golf balls, which would become known as Titleist. 1930: Young developed a machine that could uniformly wind rubber string around a rubber core, making a \\"dead center\\" golf ball. He named the ball \\"Titleist,\\" noting it was the \\"winner\\" of the quest to create the best for the game. 1935: The golf division of the Acushnet Process Company produced the Titleist golf ball, which had consistently been the company's most successful product. 1948: Introduced \\"Dynamite Thread\\" to increase the yardage of their balls. 1949: Titleist became the most used ball at the U.S. Open Tournament. 1976: Titleist was purchased by American Brands (now known as Fortune Brands). 1985: Fortune Brands sold off the Acushnet Company's Acushnet Rubber division, which was Acushnet's original business (circa early 1900s). 2002: Titleist reached the $1 billion mark in annual revenues. On December 8, 2010, Fortune Brands announced that it would soon sell or spin off Titleist and some other brands.Aaron Smith, Jim Beam, neat, is company's new strategy, CNN Money, December 8, 2010.Fortune Brands Announces Intent to Separate Company's Three Businesses, The Wall Street Journal, December 8, 2010.Fortune Brands to split into three companies , Lake Country News-Sun, December 9, 2010.

Golf equipment The Pro V1 ball made its debut on the PGA Tour at Las Vegas on October 11, 2000, the first week it was available to the pros. A longtime Titleist user, Billy Andrade, won that first tournament with the new ball. The Pro V1 was available to the public by December. The Pro V1 was a dramatic change in innovation for the golf ball market as a whole and for the brand, which had traditionally used a wound-ball construction (with a liquid-filled core center) for its top-of-the-line golf balls. Shortly after its introduction the Titleist Pro V1 became the most played ball on the PGA Tour and has been for the past 20 odd years, picking up the most worldwide wins from both direct brand ambassadors (meaning they play Titleist equipment) and players who are not directly under contract and considered brand ambassadors from Titleist.,http://www.thetourvan.com and three years after Titleist's initial breakthrough with the Pro V1 came the Pro V1x, a ball with 60 fewer dimples. The combination of a larger firmer core, a thinner cover, and 60 fewer dimples resulted in a ball that retained the same soft feel of the Pro V1 while reducing spin and increasing distance. In December 2007, Acushnet lost a patent infringement suit brought by Callaway. The following November, Callaway won an injunction in a Delaware court, ruling that sales of the Pro V1 golf balls must be stopped from January 1, 2009, with professionals being able to continue with their use until the end of the year. Acushnet immediately announced that they would be appealing the decision. Acushnet somewhat redesigned the Pro-V1 during the dispute. On August 14, 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment against Acushnet and ordered a new trial. On March 29, 2010, a federal jury ruled in favor of Acushnet (Titleist), and found that the Callaway patents were invalid.  Reputation  Titleist store at the Mitsui Outlet Park of Osaka, Japan, April 2015 Titleist is a respected and popular golf brand, with such players as Adam Scott, Steve Stricker, Bill Haas, Geoff Ogilvy, and Jordan Spieth under contract. Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Matteo Manassero, and Nick Watney were also contracted to use Titleist before moving to Nike. Phil Mickelson was also a contracted Titleist player shortly after his 2004 Masters Tournament before switching to Callaway. It is not uncommon that even if players switch equipment brands, they insist on being able to play the Titleist PRO V1 ball. Some players like Tiger Woods also continue to use their Scotty Cameron putters. His Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS has been in his bag for 14 of his 15 major championship wins. He used a prototype Scotty Cameron TE I3 in his 1997 Masters win. Early in his Nike contract, Woods refused to use Nike drivers for a long time and continued to use his Titleist one. Up until the 2010 British Open, Woods carried a Titleist putter, but switched to a Nike Method putter; he has since reverted to the Scotty Cameron. In the 2018, his Scotty was briefly replaced by a TaylorMade Ardmore 3 putter; However, Woods has since switched back to his Titleist putter (Scotty Cameron). Many players under contract with other brands use Titleist balls. In 2017 the professional players recorded 206 victories with the nearest competitor having 28. Out of the 206 wins, 22 came from the PGA Tour, 27 from the European Tour, 25 from the LPGA Tour, and the remaining from other notable professional golf tours around the world.https://www.titleist.com/teamtitleist/b/tourblog/posts/the-1-ball-in- golf-2017-wins Tour players A number of tour professionals have endorsement deals for Titleist and are contracted to use their equipment, including the following: * Andrew Dodt * Michael Sim * Greg Chalmers * Adam Scott * Marc Leishman * Graham DeLaet * Anders Hansen * S√∏ren Hansen * Kenneth Ferrie * Ian Poulter * Gr√©gory Bourdy * Daisuke Maruyama * Rafael Cabrera- Bello * Jos√© Mar√≠a Olaz√°bal * Andrew Armstrong * Tim Clark * George Coetzee * Kim Kyung-tae * Thongchai Jaidee * Pan Cheng-tsung * Ben Curtis * Jay Haas * Ben Crane * Kevin Na * Jordan Spieth * D.

TAs include graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), who are graduate students; undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs), who are undergraduate students; secondary school TAs, who are either high school students or adults; and elementary school TAs, who are adults (also known as paraprofessional educators or teacher's aides). By definition, TAs assist with classes, but many graduate students serve as the sole instructor for one or more classes each semester as a teaching fellow or graduate student instructor, although in some states, such as Florida, they are called \\"teaching assistants\\". Graduate and adult TAs generally have a fixed salary determined by each contract period (usually a semester or an academic year); however, undergraduates and high school students are sometimes unpaid and in the US and other countries with the credit system, receive course credits in return for their assistance. Teaching assistants often help the main teacher by supporting students with learning disabilities, such as ADHD, Autism, or physical disabilities, such as blindness or deafness. Graduate Graduate teaching assistants (often referred to as GTAs or simply TAs) are graduate students employed on a temporary contract by a department at a college or university in teaching- related responsibilities. In New Zealand, Australian, and some Canadian universities, graduate TAs are known as tutors. North American graduate TA positions provide funding for postgraduate research‚Äîalthough the main purpose is to provide teaching support‚Äîand it often serves as a first career step for aspiring academics.Park, C. (2004). The graduate teaching assistant: Lessons from a North American experience. Teaching in Higher Education, 9 (3). 349‚Äì361 TA responsibilities vary greatly and may include: tutoring; holding office hours; invigilating tests or exams; and assisting a professor with a large lecture class by teaching students in recitation, laboratory, or discussion sessions. Professors may also use their teaching assistants to help teach discussions during regular class. This gives the graduate student opportunity to use their teaching skills, as many are in pursuit of teaching careers. Some graduate students assist in distance education courses by meeting with the students as professors are not able to. Graduate TAs should not be confused with teaching fellows (TFs) or graduate student instructors (GSIs), who are graduate students who serve as the primary instructors for courses. However, at some universities, such as those in the Florida State University System, there are neither teaching fellows nor graduate student instructors, and \\"teaching assistant\\" is the only title used. =Tutorials= In British, Australian, New Zealand, South African, Italian, Irish and some Canadian universities, a tutor is often, but not always, a postgraduate student or a lecturer assigned to conduct a seminar for undergraduate students, often known as a tutorial. The equivalent of this kind of tutor in the United States and the rest of Canada is known as a graduate teaching assistant or a graduate student instructor (GSI). Undergraduate UTAs or JTAs (Junior Teacher Assistants) usually serve as true assistants to a class; they typically have taken the course with which they are assisting, often with the same professor, and have performed well in it. This case is less common for GTAs, since many would have been undergraduates at other institutions. Unlike professors and GTAs, UTAs generally do not have a fixed salary but instead are paid by the hour, earn credit hours, or volunteer their time. High school The term teaching assistant is used in the high school and middle school setting for students or adults that assist a teacher with one or more classes. The responsibilities, situations, and conditions of these individuals' involvement differ from those in higher education. A less formal position, a TA job in secondary education is generally determined by the supervising teacher. Common tasks include assisting students with their work, and taking attendance. Most of the responsibilities of Teaching Assistants do not require the academic expertise of the professor in charge. Some teaching assistants at this level may teach portions of the class lessons, or teach lessons to small groups of students who need extra instruction. Many TAs work \\"one-on-one\\" with special needs students; these TAs shadow their student and assist with classwork, organization, and behavior management. In some parts of the United States it is customary or even required that each classroom have one certified teacher and one or more co-teachers or teaching assistants. Students attending high school and middle schools can take a course, usually an elective, and perform tasks such as grade and record scores on homework or tests. The teacher in this setting reviews the grading to assign partial credit on tests and uses discretion. Elementary school An elementary school teaching assistant is an adult who is hired to help a teacher with class-related duties, which are similar to those encountered in middle and high school settings. They are sometimes referred to as paraprofessionals (\\"paras\\" for short) or teacher's aides. Elementary school teaching assistants are generally hired on a contract that lasts the entire academic year. Teaching assistants aide with multiple duties within schools and can be hired in special education as well.

His brother Edmund was appointed secretary, and Marian Bey was the team captain. At the founding meeting, white and green were chosen as statutory colors. As part of the difficulties introduced by the partitioning authorities, matches involving Polish teams were forbidden. This prohibition accelerated the decision to organize the first Wielkopolska championship in 1913, in which three teams participated: Warta Pozna≈Ñ, Posnania and Ostrovia Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski. The results were as follows: Posnania - Warta 1‚Äì1, Warta - Ostrovia 3‚Äì2, Ostrovia - Warta 3‚Äì4, Warta - Posnania 2‚Äì2. The first champion of Wielkopolska league was Warta Pozna≈Ñ. The inaugural championship of the region resulted in an surge of football popularity in Pozna≈Ñ. New football leagues, including only Polish youth, began to emerge at a rapid pace. Such teams were: Trytonia founded in ≈Åazarz and a team called Sparta established in Je≈ºyce. In 1914, despite the start of hostilities related to the outbreak of World War I, efforts were made in Pozna≈Ñ to organize sports life as much as possible, which was not easy at all due to the martial law imposed by the Germans. In general, the regulations did not allow any kind of meeting or assembly to be held without proper permits. Despite these difficulties, in 1914 the second Wielkopolska Championships were held, in which only two teams participated: Warta Pozna≈Ñ and KS Posnania. The results of this two-legged match were as follows: in the first one, Warta quite smoothly defeated Posnania 6‚Äì3, and in the second competition the same outcome happened, beating there opponent 2‚Äì1. In 1915, Warta played matches with the Fever Ko≈õcian club, in which the white and greens turned out to be worse than the guests; first losing to them 3‚Äì1, then drawing 5‚Äì5. One of the mysteries of 1915 is finding reliable information about who won the next championships of Wielkopolska. From the chronicle of the Ostrovia club, you can learn that it was them that won the championship. However, many researchers doubt that this is true, as there are no other source materials on the basis of which this record could be confirmed. Another theory is possible, provided by J. Owsia≈Ñski and T. Siwi≈Ñski. Namely, that Ostrovia assigned the championship title to itself after winning the match against Warta Pozna≈Ñ. It would be a logical explanation of the record in the chronicle about winning the Wielkopolska championship. In this aggregate match, the first match ended with Warta's victory 4‚Äì2, the second match ended with the victory of the team from Ostr√≥w 4‚Äì1. The year 1915 was not only about matches between Polish teams, but also matches with German teams. It is worth mentioning here about the match that was played in December between Warta Pozna≈Ñ and probably the strongest German team DeutscherSportverein (DSV). The match itself ended with a score of 2‚Äì2, which can be considered a great success for the Polish team, and also a very good sports forecast for the coming years. The matches between the Pozna≈Ñ teams took place in the following years of World War I. In 1916, there were surprises at the very beginning, when Warta's team first succumbed to Unia 1‚Äì2, then unexpectedly drew 2‚Äì2 with Stella Gniezno. In the same year, another match between the DSV team and Warta took place, where the team from Pozna≈Ñ turned out to outclass the German club, beating the German opponent by 4‚Äì0. The year 1917 is, in turn, a jubilee year for the club, which celebrated its 5th birthday. The great celebrations that took place during the 5th anniversary of the team can be found in the club's chronicle. For this reason, a tournament was organized with the participation of the best teams from Pozna≈Ñ. This year is not only the celebration of the 5th anniversary of the team. There was also a change in the head of the club - Franciszek Rotnicki now stood at the helm of the team, about whom it was written at the time: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ A man of great authority, energetic and enterprising. It is he, together with a skillfully selected group of associates, who builds solid foundations for the future size of the club in this difficult period. Anticipating the inevitable end of the invasive Prussian imperialism, he focuses the efforts of the management primarily on consolidating the club tradition, on sticking to the colors of the Warta ... ‚Äù. For Warta, 1917 is not only a time of celebration, but also more matches between the teams from Pozna≈Ñ. On top of all this, there was cooperation with the Polish Military Organization. The last year of the war brought more sports skirmishes between the teams from Wielkopolska. However, the most important news was the information about the end of World War I and about the peace arrangements, which spoke about the restoration of a free and independent Poland. =Interwar period= 1918 was not only a great joy for the country of Poland to regain independence after 123 years, but also new opportunities for Polish sport, organized within the territory of the Polish state, without the interference of powers as to the shape and manner of development of sports societies or clubs. Organization and reconstruction took place on the ruins that remained after the hostilities. During the conflict, many good athletes died, as well as many distinguished activists, the already modest sports base was essentially destroyed. Another fight awaited Wielkopolska, a national uprising which was the Greater Poland Uprising, which was successful and resulted in the expulsion of the German partitioning authorities. During this national uprising, every footballer who was then staying in Pozna≈Ñ, regardless of the consequences that could meet him, volunteered for military service in order to be able to fight for his homeland. With the arrival of 1919, it was decided to reactivate the sports structures that was trying to be formed before the outbreak of World War I, and it was also decided to play the first post-war Wielkopolska championship. 5 teams, including 4 from Pozna≈Ñ, entered the competition. These clubs were: Unia, Warta, Posnania, and Pogo≈Ñ. However, the fifth team that entered the championship was the team from Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski, which was Ostrovia. The results of these championships were as follows: Posnania - Ostrovia 3‚Äì1, Ostrovia - Warta 1‚Äì7, Unia - Pogo≈Ñ 9‚Äì1, Warta - Posnania 7‚Äì0, Ostrovia - Pogo≈Ñ 3‚Äì2, Unia - Warta 2‚Äì3, Pogo≈Ñ - Posnania 3‚Äì3, Unia - Ostrovia 4‚Äì0, Warta - Pogo≈Ñ 7‚Äì0, Unia - Warta 4‚Äì1. The matches of the Wielkopolska championship were not the only matches that took place in Pozna≈Ñ. There were also friendly matches with the participation of Warsaw teams. And so, among others, the capital of Wielkopolska was visited by clubs such as the Polonia and Korona, which played matches with Pozna≈Ñ Warta. In 1921, the Klasa A district championship began, with football clubs from Wielkopolska such as Warta, Pogo≈Ñ, and Stella Gniezno. The team of Warta Pozna≈Ñ turned out to be the victor team again.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, and San Francisco Giants. He batted and threw right-handed. While with the Padres, he won the 2007 NL Cy Young Award after recording the Pitching Triple Crown that year. He was traded from the White Sox to the Red Sox in 2013 and helped them to a World Series title later that season. A year later, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants, where he helped them win a World Series title later in the season. He is the second starting pitcher after Don Gullett to win two consecutive World Series championship titles with two different teams in both leagues. He is one of seven players in Major League history to have won back-to-back World Series championships titles on two different teams (Ben Zobrist, Jack Morris, Bill Skowron, Clem Labine, Don Gullett, and Ryan Theriot). Peavy wore the number 44 for most of his career. When he was traded to the San Francisco Giants, he took number 43, as 44 was retired in honor of Willie McCovey. After struggling in the middle of the 2014 season, he changed to 22. Professional career =Draft and minor leagues= Peavy was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 15th round (472nd overall) of the 1999 MLB draft out of high school (St. Paul's Episcopal School). He was named the high school player of the year in the state of Alabama. Peavy declined an offer to pitch for Auburn University in order to accept the Padres' contract offer. Peavy pitched for the Arizona League Padres and the Idaho Falls Braves in 1999 and the Fort Wayne Wizards in 2000. In 2001, Peavy played with the Lake Elsinore Storm and the Mobile BayBears. He split the 2002 season between the BayBears and the San Diego Padres. =San Diego Padres= 2002‚Äì2006 Peavy was called up from Double-A to make his major league debut on June 22, 2002, against the New York Yankees at Qualcomm Stadium. He lost the game, allowing one run on three hits in six innings while striking out four. In total, Peavy had six wins and seven losses with a 4.52 earned run average (ERA) and 90 strikeouts. The Padres won just 66 games and were in the cellar of the NL West. In his sophomore season, Peavy started 32 games (194.2 IP), with a 4.11 earned run average, a 12‚Äì11 record, and 156 strikeouts. The Padres finished last in their division again at a 64‚Äì98 record. During his third year of major league experience in 2004, Peavy emerged as the Padres' ace starting pitcher and one of the best pitchers in baseball. He compiled a 15‚Äì6 record, struck out 173 in 166 innings, and led Major League Baseball with a 2.27 ERA. He became the youngest pitcher to win an ERA title since Dwight Gooden in 1985. On September 17, 2004, Peavy allowed Barry Bonds' 700th career home run. On March 5, 2005, he signed a four-year, $14.5 million contract and held a club option for 2009 extension with the Padres. During the 2005 season, Peavy was selected for the National League All-Star team and ended the regular season leading the National League in strikeouts with 216 (in 203 innings). He was second in the majors to Minnesota's Johan Santana who had 238 strikeouts. In addition he finished the season with a 13‚Äì7 record, 2.88 ERA, a strikeout-to-walk ratio of over 4:1 and WHIP of 1.044. After the Padres won the National League West in 2005, Peavy missed the rest of the season with a broken rib, which he apparently suffered while celebrating. Peavy was the captain of Team USA in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, held in San Diego. He started the opening game for the U.S., a 2‚Äì0 win over Mexico, giving up just one hit and no runs over three innings. He did not factor in the decision in the second-round game against Japan, as he gave up three runs in five innings in a game that the U.S. won, 4‚Äì3. In 2006, Peavy got off to a rocky start, in part due to mechanical adjustments brought on by various off-season injuries. Although Peavy would go only 11‚Äì14 with a 4.09 ERA, he still managed to finish second in the National League in strikeouts with 215, one shy of both his 2005 league-leading total and of the 2006 NL strikeout leader, Aaron Harang, who logged 32 more innings than Peavy. In the playoffs, the Padres again faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the first round. As the game one starter, Peavy had a much stronger outing than his 2005 playoff game, but the Padres again lost to the Cardinals. San Diego Padres in 2007 2007‚Äì2009 On July 1, 2007, for the second time in his career, Peavy was named to the 2007 NL All-Star Team. On July 9, he was named as the starting pitcher for the NL. On August 2, Peavy struck out Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Jeff DaVanon, for his 1000th career strikeout. Peavy won the pitching Triple Crown in 2007, leading the National League with 19 wins, 240 strikeouts, and a 2.54 ERA. Since the divisional play era started in 1969, Peavy is only the eighth player to accomplish this feat. On October 23, Peavy won the Players Choice Award for Outstanding NL Pitcher. He added the NL Cy Young award‚Äîas a unanimous choice‚Äîon November 15, becoming just the 10th National League player in history to win the Cy Young Award in a unanimous vote (Sandy Koufax was unanimously selected three times). The completion of the 2007 campaign represented Peavy's sixth year in the league. Over that six- year period Peavy collected two strikeout champion awards, two major league ERA titles, and a unanimous, triple-crown Cy Young Award. On December 12, 2007, he signed a 4-year extension, worth $52 million with the Padres. At the time the contract was the largest in Padres history. The contract included a $22 million option for 2013. On April 5, 2008, Peavy pitched a two-hit complete game over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The following day, still-images from FOX sports video feed from the game showed a dirty, brown substance on the index and middle fingers, along with his thumb. Manager Bud Black defended Peavy saying that \\"it was a mixture of dirt and rosin\\". In the two games immediately following the report, Peavy posted a 1‚Äì0 record with a 1.92 ERA. In May, he went on the DL with a sore throwing elbow. He returned on June 12 and pitched six shutout innings with four strikeouts. He ended 2008 with only a 10‚Äì11 record, but had one of the lowest run support per start of any pitcher in the league, and finished the season with a 2.85 ERA. Peavy had been the subject of numerous trade rumors during the 2008 offseason, amidst reports that the Padres were looking to reduce salaries and build on young players for the future. In November 2008, Peavy added the New York Yankees to the list of teams he would accept a trade to. The list included several teams from the NL including the Atlanta Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, the Chicago Cubs, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Houston Astros. Peavy preferred to be in the NL, so the Yankees would not be involved. The Astros and Cardinals decided they would not pursue Peavy after talking with GM Kevin Towers on what they would have to give up. In November 2008, the Padres were working with the Braves on a Peavy trade, in which Peavy would be traded to Atlanta for SS Yunel Escobar, OF Gorkys Hern√°ndez, P Blaine Boyer and one of P Charlie Morton or P Jo-Jo Reyes. The Padres wanted the two top prospects in the organization as well, pitcher Tommy Hanson and outfielder Jordan Schafer, but after a few weeks, the Braves decided to move on to bring in a few free agents. In spring training, Peavy pitched 14 total innings with no runs allowed, 10 strikeouts and no walks.Peavy Ends Spring Training with 0.00 ERA Yahoo! Sports, April 2, 2009 He rejected a trade to the Chicago White Sox, which included Aaron Poreda and Clayton Richard, saying that remaining in San Diego was best for him and his family. On May 22, Peavy hurt his ankle rounding third base against the Chicago Cubs in a start where he earned the win with 6 scoreless innings and 10 strikeouts a day after rejecting a trade to the White Sox. On June 12, Peavy learned he had a strained tendon in the back of his ankle, suffered in the May 22 start. He was placed on the DL the same day. At the time of his injury, Peavy was 6‚Äì6 with 3.96 ERA and 92 strikeouts. =Chicago White Sox= On July 31, Peavy agreed to a trade to the Chicago White Sox in a last-minute trade deadline day deal for Clayton Richard, Aaron Poreda, Adam Russell and Dexter Carter.The Chicago White Sox acquire Jake Peavy in a 4-for-1 deal, ESPN, July 31, 2009 In his first start for the White Sox, Peavy pitched 5 innings, giving up 3 runs (all earned), and striking out 5, getting the win against the Kansas City Royals.

He was diagnosed with a detached latissimus dorsi muscle in his back. He underwent surgery on July 14, 2010 at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and was knocked out for the remainder of the season. Due to various injuries and fatigue, Peavy was limited to only pitching in 19 games in 2011. Peavy started 18 games and came out of the bullpen once for the first time ever in his MLB career.

On July 8, 2012, Peavy was selected to the All-Star Game as a replacement for C. J. Wilson. Peavy was awarded the 2012 American League Gold Glove Award, sharing the award with Tampa Bay's Jeremy Hellickson. It was the first Gold Glove award of his career. On October 30, 2012, Peavy signed a two-year, $29 million extension with a vesting option for 2015, keeping him with the White Sox at least through the 2014 season. On June 4, 2013, Peavy came out of a game against the Seattle Mariners in the fourth inning with a left rib fracture and was placed on the disabled list. Prior to that he had registered a 4.30 ERA, 1.16 WHIP and 66/15 K/BB ratio in 67 innings. He was activated from the DL and made his first start against the Atlanta Braves on July 20. =Boston Red Sox= On July 30, 2013, Peavy was traded to the Boston Red Sox along with Brayan Villarreal in a three-team trade, in which Jos√© Iglesias went to the Detroit Tigers and Avisail Garc√≠a, J. B. Wendelken, Francellis Montas and Cleuluis Rondon went to the White Sox. On August 3, Peavy had a winning debut as the Red Sox defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 5‚Äì2. On October 30, 2013, Peavy and his fellow Boston Red Sox teammates won the World Series, the first of Peavy's career. After the victory parade, in which Red Sox players and coaches rode through the streets of Boston on duck boats, Peavy purchased the duck boat that carried him and teammate Jon Lester, to commemorate the season.Boston.com =San Francisco Giants= On July 26, 2014, the Boston Red Sox traded Peavy to the San Francisco Giants along with cash considerations for pitching prospects Edwin Escobar and Heath Hembree. This trade reunited Peavy with manager Bruce Bochy. Having worn number 44 throughout his career, Peavy wore jersey number 43, since number 44 is retired in honor of Giants' Hall of Famer Willie McCovey. After losing his first three quality starts as a Giant, including a perfect game through innings, Peavy switched his jersey number from 43 to 22 for good luck; number 22 was his jersey number from Mobile, Alabama. On August 13, 2014, in a 7‚Äì1 home win over his former team the Chicago White Sox, Peavy recorded his first career win as a Giant after switching numbers. On August 30, 2014, in a 3‚Äì1 home win against the Milwaukee Brewers, Peavy struck out Aramis Ram√≠rez for his 2,000th career strikeout, three days after teammate Tim Hudson got his. He did not allow a hit until the eighth inning to Mark Reynolds. He won the first game of the 2014 NLDS against the Washington Nationals on October 3, 2014. On October 29, 2014, Peavy won his second consecutive World Series ring, despite losing both his starts, after the Giants defeated the Royals, 3‚Äì2, in Game 7. Peavy became the second starting pitcher after Don Gullett to win two consecutive World Series championship titles with two different teams in both leagues. He is one of seven players in Major League history to have won back-to-back World Series championship titles on two different teams. (Ben Zobrist, Jack Morris, Bill Skowron, Clem Labine, Don Gullett, and Ryan Theriot) On December 19, 2014, Peavy agreed to a two-year deal worth $24 million to stay with the Giants. He went on to play with San Francisco through the 2016 season; in his three years with the Giants he had a 19‚Äì19 record and 3.97 ERA, with 238 strikeouts and 78 walks in 308 innings pitched. He became a free agent on November 3, 2016. =Late career= Peavy did not pitch in MLB or the minor leagues during the 2017 season. In May 2018, he stated his interest in a comeback. He officially announced his retirement on May 5, 2019. Scouting report Peavy's repertoire included six pitches, although he mostly used a four-seam fastball at 88‚Äì92 mph and a slider in the low 80s. He also had a two-seam fastball, a curveball, a changeup, and a cutter. Peavy tended to throw the curve and change more against lefties, and he did not use his two-seamer or cutter often. As of June 23, 2016, Peavy had the 12th lowest career WHIP of any active Major Leaguer. Peavy's two-seam fastball acted primarily as a sinker and induced many ground balls.Krasovic, Tom. Peavy, 'pen stifle Cards for Padres' 16th shutout, The San Diego Union-Tribune. Published August 8, 2007. This allowed Peavy to induce many double plays when runners were on base. Peavy liked to run his fastballs in on lefties and make the pitch break back into the zone, similar to a power version of Greg Maddux's technique.

In 2008, Peavy bought a ranch in Wilcox County, Alabama called Southern Falls Plantation. The property includes a bowling alley, saloon, hunting lodge, and replica of Fenway Park. In 2013, Peavy bought for the plantation a World War II duck boat formerly used by Boston Duck Tours for tourist purposes and special events like the 2013 World Series Parade. He hopes it will become a family heirloom. During a World Series Game 6 pre-game press conference, Peavy's son let the media know that his dad would purchase the family a cable car for the ranch if the Giants won the 2014 World Series, which they did. Once shipped to Alabama, it was planned to be converted into a bar. Peavy is a fan of Alabama Crimson Tide football and was invited to be a guest for ESPN's College Gameday on the campus of Alabama in 2013.http://wapc.mlb.com/cutfour/2013/11/09/63812694/jake-peavy-visits-espns- college-gameday In 2015, Peavy admitted to being a smokeless tobacco user since he was in fifth grade. Peavy started playing guitar in 2002 when he and Tim Flannery were with the San Diego Padres. He has since performed at several benefit concerts. During the San Francisco Giants' 2016 spring training camp, Peavy learned that he had been the victim of a Ponzi-like scheme at the hands of his financial advisor who had siphoned away some $15 million to $20 million of his retirement savings.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2756799-i-need- a-miracle-every-day-jake-peavy-picks-up-pieces-of-a-shattered-life See also * List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders * List of San Diego Padres team records * List of Major League Baseball Cy Young Award winners * Major League Baseball Pitcher of the Month * Triple crown References External links * : Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:American League All-Stars Category:Arizona League Padres players Category:Baseball players from Alabama Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Charlotte Knights players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Cy Young Award winners Category:Fort Wayne Wizards players Category:Gold Glove Award winners Category:Idaho Falls Braves players Category:Lake Elsinore Storm players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Mobile BayBears players Category:National League All-Stars Category:National League ERA champions Category:National League Pitching Triple Crown winners Category:National League strikeout champions Category:National League wins champions Category:People from Semmes, Alabama Category:San Diego Padres players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Sportspeople from Mobile, Alabama Category:World Baseball Classic players of the United States Category:2006 World Baseball Classic players Category:2009 World Baseball Classic players ","title":"Jake Peavy"},{"id":"1250549","text":"The Euskobar√≥metro (\\"Basque-barometer\\") is a sociological statistical survey in the Basque Country (Pa√≠s Vasco), an autonomous community of Spain.

It is based on personal interviews at home.Trabajo de campo  On Basque separatism  Because the Spanish government has passed laws outlawing formal referendums about the possibility of Basque independence, the Euskobar√≥metro is one of the better gauges available of the extent of Basque separatist sentiment. According to the survey, a significant number of Basques support independence of their region from Spain, but rather few support the violence of groups such as ETA: * 33% favor Basque independence, 31% federalism, 32% autonomy, 2% centralism. (2% undecided or not answering) *Asked whether they agree or disagree with the statement, \\"Today in Euskadi it is possible to defend all political aspirations and objectives without the necessity of resorting to violence\\", 87% agree and only 4% disagree (9% undecided or not answering). In fact, 33% of those who identify politically with ETA-affiliated Batasuna agreed with the statement. *Asked directly about their views of ETA, 60% rejected ETA totally and another 18% identified themselves as former ETA sympathizers who no longer support the group.

The assembly consists of a mounting block which houses a bearing. The block is mounted to a foundation and a shaft is inserted allowing the inner part of the bearing / shaft to rotate. The inside of the bearing is typically larger than the shaft to ensure a tight fit. Set screws, locking collars, or set collars are commonly used to secure the shaft. Housing material for a pillow block is typically made of cast iron or cast steel. Typical Plummer Block Selection A pillow block usually refers to a housing with an included anti-friction bearing. A pillow block refers to any mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units. A pillow block may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of rolling element defines the type of pillow block. These differ from \\"plummer blocks\\" which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing. Plummer block bearings are designed for more corrosive environments. The fundamental application of both types is the same, which is to mount a bearing safely enabling its outer ring to be stationary while allowing rotation of the inner ring. The housing is bolted to a foundation through the holes in the base. Bearing housings may be either split type or solid type. Split type housings are usually two-piece housings where the cap and base may be detached, while solid are single-piece housings. Various sealing arrangements may be provided to prevent dust and other contaminants from entering the housing. Thus the housing provides a clean environment for the environmentally sensitive bearing to rotate free from contaminants while also retaining lubrication, either oil or grease, hence increasing its performance and duty cycle. Bearing housings are usually made of grey cast iron. However, various grades of metals can be used to manufacture the same, including ductile iron, steel, stainless steel, and various types of thermoplastics and polyethylene- based plastics. The bearing element may be manufactured from 52100 chromium steel alloy (the most common), stainless steel, plastic, or bushing materials such as SAE660 cast bronze, or SAE841 oil impregnated sintered bronze, or synthetic materials. ISO 113 specifies internationally accepted dimensions for plummer blocks.

It is primarily used as a teaching tool, having been replaced by other chromatography methods, such as thin-layer chromatography. A paper chromatography variant, two-dimensional chromatography involves using two solvents and rotating the paper 90¬∞ in between. This is useful for separating complex mixtures of compounds having similar polarity, for example, amino acids. The setup has three components. The mobile phase is a solution that travels up the stationary phase, due to capillary action. The mobile phase is generally mixture of non-polar organic solvent, while the stationary phase is polar inorganic solvent water. Here paper is used to support the stationary phase, water. Polar water molecules are held inside the void space of cellulose network of the host paper. Difference between TLC and paper chromatography is that stationary phase in TLC is a layer of adsorbent (usually silica gel, or aluminium oxide), and stationary phase in paper chromatography is water.  R∆í value, solutes, and solvents  The retention factor (R∆í) may be defined as the ratio of the distance traveled by the solute to the distance traveled by the solvent. It is used in chromatography to quantify the amount of retardation of a sample in a stationary phase relative to a mobile phase. R∆í values are usually expressed as a fraction of two decimal places. * If R∆í value of a solution is zero, the solute remains in the stationary phase and thus it is immobile. * If R∆í value = 1 then the solute has no affinity for the stationary phase and travels with the solvent front. For example, if a compound travels 9.9 cm and the solvent front travels 12.7 cm, the R∆í value = (9.9/12.7) = 0.779 or 0.78. R∆í value depends on temperature and the solvent used in experiment, so several solvents offer several R∆í values for the same mixture of compound. A solvent in chromatography is the liquid the paper is placed in, and the solute is the ink which is being separated. Pigments and polarity Paper chromatography is one method for testing the purity of compounds and identifying substances. Paper chromatography is a useful technique because it is relatively quick and requires only small quantities of material. Separations in paper chromatography involve the same principles as those in thin layer chromatography, as it is a type of thin layer chromatography. In paper chromatography, substances are distributed between a stationary phase and a mobile phase. The stationary phase is the water trapped between the cellulose fibers of the paper. The mobile phase is a developing solution that travels up the stationary phase, carrying the samples with it. Components of the sample will separate readily according to how strongly they adsorb onto the stationary phase versus how readily they dissolve in the mobile phase. When a colored chemical sample is placed on a filter paper, the colors separate from the sample by placing one end of the paper in a solvent. The solvent diffuses up the paper, dissolving the various molecules in the sample according to the polarities of the molecules and the solvent. If the sample contains more than one color, that means it must have more than one kind of molecule. Because of the different chemical structures of each kind of molecule, the chances are very high that each molecule will have at least a slightly different polarity, giving each molecule a different solubility in the solvent. The unequal solubility causes the various color molecules to leave solution at different places as the solvent continues to move up the paper. The more soluble a molecule is, the higher it will migrate up the paper. If a chemical is very non-polar it will not dissolve at all in a very polar solvent. This is the same for a very polar chemical and a very non-polar solvent. It is very important to note that when using water (a very polar substance) as a solvent, the more polar the color, the higher it will rise on the papers. Types =Descending= Development of the chromatogram is done by allowing the solvent to travel down the paper. Here, mobile phase is placed in solvent holder at the top. The spot is kept at the top and solvent flows down the paper from above. =Ascending= Here the solvent travels up the chromatographic paper. Both descending and ascending paper chromatography are used for the separation of organic and inorganic substances. The sample and solvent move upward. =Ascending-descending= This is the hybrid of both of the above techniques. The upper part of ascending chromatography can be folded over a rod in order to allow the paper to become descending after crossing the rod. =Circular chromatography= A circular filter paper is taken and the sample is deposited at the center of the paper. After drying the spot, the filter paper is tied horizontally on a Petri dish containing solvent, so that the wick of the paper is dipped in the solvent. The solvent rises through the wick and the components are separated into concentric rings. =Two- dimensional= In this technique a square or rectangular paper is used. Here the sample is applied to one of the corners and development is performed at a right angle to the direction of the first run.  History of paper chromatography  The discovery of paper chromatography in 1943 by Martin and Synge provided, for the first time, the means of surveying constituents of plants and for their separation and identification. There was an explosion of activity in this field after 1945.

Brand New Monty Python Bok was the second book to be published by the British comedy troupe Monty Python. Edited by Eric Idle, it was published by Methuen Books in 1973 and contained more print-style comic pieces than their first effort, Monty Python's Big Red Book. The white dust jacket was printed with some realistic looking smudged fingerprints on the front, leading to several complaints and returned copies from booksellers. These complaints paled in comparison to the fuss created about the cover printed on the actual book. The title of the fake cover was Tits 'n Bums, appearing as a pornographic magazine with a background photo of several intertwined naked women, but purporting to be a church magazine with articles such as \\"Are you still a verger?\\", and a 'weekly look at church architecture'. As Michael Palin remembered: \\"Our publisher Geoffrey Strachan told the story of an elderly lady bookseller from Newbury who refused to believe the fingerprints were put there deliberately. 'In that case I shall sell the books without their jackets', she said and slammed the phone down so quickly that Geoffrey was unable to warn her that beneath each dust-cover was a mock soft-core magazine\\".Palin, Michael Diaries 1969‚Äì1979: The Python Years, p.136, 2006, Weidenfeld & Nicolson. The book contained an amalgamation of print-style pieces and material derived from Flying Circus sketches. Examples of the former include an interconnected series of jokes based on figures of speech and an advertisement for the fictional Welsh martial art of Llap Goch, which claims to be able to teach students how to grow taller, stronger, faster, and more deadly in a matter of days. Examples of the latter include Sam Peckinpah's \\"Salad Days\\" and the Travel Agent sketch, a collection of stereotypes about annoying tourists and the perils of inter-country air travel. In 1974 a paperback edition was issued as The Brand New Monty Python Papperbok, containing the same contents minus the Tits 'n Bums book cover. In 1981 both this book and Monty Python's Big Red Book were reissued as a hardback book entitled The Complete Works Of Shakespeare And Monty Python: Volume One - Monty Python. Paperback editions of both these books were reissued again in 1986 as The Monty Python Gift Boks, sold together inside an outer cover which folded out into a mini poster.

Life and career  Harb was born in Chaat, Lebanon, and emigrated to Canada to study at the University of Ottawa in 1973. He subsequently worked as an engineer at Northern Telecom and a professor at Algonquin College in Ottawa. Harb was elected to Ottawa City Council in 1985 and served as deputy mayor in 1987 and 1988. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1988 federal election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Ottawa Centre. He supported Jean Chr√©tien's bid to succeed John Turner as leader of the Liberal Party in 1990, and remained a Chr√©tien loyalist throughout his career as an MP. In September 2003, Harb was appointed to the Senate of Canada on Chr√©tien's recommendation. In March 2009, Harb attempted to introduce a bill that would have limited the East Coast seal hunt to only those with aboriginal treaty rights. He also attempted to introduce a bill in June 2011 that would outlaw commercial seal hunting, and had introduced a third bill against the seal hunt in May 2012. PETA subsequently honoured him as their \\"Canadian Person of the Year\\".  Senate expense scandal  On December 6, 2012, Mac Harb was named in relation to the Canadian Senate expenses scandal due to expenses for a property in Pembroke, Ontario.Timeline: Key dates in the evolution of the Senate expense- claim controversy In May 2013, the Senate Internal Economy Committee found that Mac Harb had incorrectly claimed $51,482.92 of living and travel expenses and ordered him to repay it, which was done by July 5, 2013. The committee had earlier advised Harb to repay $231,000 of claimed expenses dating back to 2005 to avoid an extensive audit into his finances. Harb stated that his repayment was done \\"under protest\\" since he intended to challenge the validity of the committee's findings in the Ontario Divisional Court. On August 26, 2013, he repaid a further $180,166.17, for a total reimbursement of $231,649.07, after which he resigned his Senate seat. In February, 2014, Harb was criminally charged with fraud and breach of trust in connection with these expense claims. Those charges were later withdrawn by the Crown in May, 2016, after the acquittal of Senator Mike Duffy on his own expense-related criminal charges.

In 2010, the ICCC had 148 congregations with 68,300 members. Membership is concentrated primarily in the Midwest. However, there are several congregations in California, New York, and Florida. According to the World Council of Churches, the council has 108,806 members worldwide. History In 1950, the Biennial Council of the Peoples Church of Christ and Community Centers led by Dr. Joseph M. Evans (until then all Afro- American) and the National Council of Community Churches led by the Rev. Roy A. Burkhardt (until then all Caucasian) joined in a historic merger. At the time, their joining represented the largest interracial merger of religious bodies in America. The new creation was the International Council of Community Churches. Member churches united to be a fellowship of ecumenically minded, freedom-loving congregations cooperating in fulfilling the mission of the Church in the world. As a post-denominational movement, the council has witnessed and worked for Christian unity, justice and reconciliation in human society. Governance The council operates with an ‚Äúinverted‚Äù pyramid of authority. The local congregations own the council and determine its emphases and operation. They do so by sending delegates to an Annual Conference. Each local church is entitled to two voting delegates, of which both may be laity or one each lay and clergy (but not two clergy.) Decisions about Council policy are made by the local church delegates voting in Annual Conference. Delegates elect a volunteer board. The board hires and supervises staff and oversees everyday operations. The Rev. Phil Tom is the current Council Minister.

The two episodes were respectively first broadcast in January and December 1972 and were shot entirely on film and mostly on location in Bavaria, with the first episode recorded in German and the second recorded in English and then dubbed into German.  Production  While visiting the UK in the early 1970s, German entertainer and TV producer Alfred Biolek became aware of the Pythons and, excited by their innovative and absurd sketches, invited them to Germany in 1971 to write a special German episode of their Flying Circus show and to act in them. Despite mixed audience reception, a second episode was produced in 1972. According to producer Biolek, the Pythons were initially somewhat reluctant to the idea of going to Germany to produce comedy for a German audience. Biolek had only seen a few shows, but he was impressed with the concept of the Flying Circus. Specifically, it stood out to him that they were both good comedians and good actors‚Äîa combination that Biolek rarely saw in the German comedy scene at the time. Biolek arranged to meet with the Pythons in the BBC's bar in London to convince them \\"with many arguments and even more gin tonics\\" to come to Germany for a brief visit. Eric Idle has described the conception of the specials as \\"The Germans came to us and said 'Look, we haven't got a sense of humour, but we understand you do. Can we use yours? Terry Jones recalls Biolek's inquiry as an opportunity \\"to do silly things in Germany\\". The Pythons agreed to visit Biolek in Munich in order to explore options for possible material, but did not want to commit at this point. During their visit, the troupe wanted to get a better understanding of German culture and humour. In fact, the visit, and the resulting two shows \\"can be viewed as a considered attempt to broaden the stereotypical picture of Germans\\" by the Pythons. Michael Palin also noted that \\"All I know is that it reversed all one's prejudices. Python has done very, very well in Germany, and the movies do extremely well. ... Whenever anyone says, you know, the Germans have no sense of humour, say no, hang on, hang on, they got Monty Python before a lot of other countries.\\" During their visit to Germany, the Pythons attended the Oktoberfest and Olympiastadion in Munich, and also visited nearby Dachau concentration camp. The Pythons' visit to Germany in 1971 coincided with the widely celebrated 500th birthday of painter Albrecht D√ºrer, and the group's second visit with the highly anticipated 1972 Summer Olympics. Both events had an obvious impact on the material created by the Pythons for their first episode, including the Silly Olympics skit, and the Anita Ekberg Sings Albrecht D√ºrer skit, thus situating their style of humour in a local cultural context. Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus was produced by Biolek and translator Thomas Woitkewitsch in co- production with Westdeutscher Rundfunk. The first episode was written in English, and then translated by Woitkewitsch. However, translating humour within this transnational production‚Äîespecially when based on idioms‚Äîwas a general challenge, as Palin recalls. Since none of the Pythons spoke German sufficiently, Woitkewitsch needed to provide them with phonetic transcriptions of the skits, which they then needed to learn by heart. Jones recalls that this posed a considerable challenge to the troupe; he also mentions that because of the rigorous repetition required in production, he was still able to recite the German version of \\"The Lumberjack Song\\" over forty years later. Despite the coaching and re-iterative translation efforts, the Pythons' accents remained rather strong, and according to Woitkewitsch the overall pacing was off. While these language issues may have contributed to the first show's weak critical reception, Woitkewitsch suggests that they also lent it a \\"secret charm\\". The second episode was recorded in English due to aforementioned issues with the German accents and timing of some of the members; only John Cleese and Palin delivered their lines in German well enough to be easily understood by native speakers. The other Python performers all had very thick accents (particularly Jones), making them difficult to understand. In some cases the episode was broadcast with German subtitles. The second episode was the final television show that Cleese recorded with the group, having already announced his decision to only commit to film and stage productions in future. The episode also featured Terry Gilliam taking more acting roles than before.  Sketches  The \\"Colin \\"Bomber\\" Harris vs Colin \\"Bomber\\" Harris\\" and \\"Hearing Aid Shop\\" sketches in the second show had previously featured in At Last the 1948 Show. Footage of the \\"Silly Olympics,\\" \\"Little Red Riding Hood,\\" \\"Flashers' Love Story,\\" and \\"The Philosophers' Football Match\\" sketches from these German specials was regularly used to fill time between live stage performances, as seen in Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (the former two re-dubbed in English). \\"Silly Olympics\\" (minus the relay for the deaf part) and \\"The Philosophers' Football Match\\" were also used in the 2014 reunion shows at London's O2 arena. Several new sketches were written specifically for this show, including \\"William Tell\\", \\"Little Red Riding Hood,\\" and \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" as performed by a herd of cows. Only \\"The Lumberjack Song\\" was translated from the its original appearance on Monty Python's Flying Circus (Series 1, Episode 9), although \\"Ten Seconds of Sex\\" from the second show also appeared in Series 3, Episode 9 of Flying Circus around the same time. Both Alfred Biolek and Thomas Woitkewitsch are featured in guest roles, while the German footballer Franz Beckenbauer makes an appearance in The Philosophers' Football Match skit. The first skit of the first episode also features Claudia Doren, then an announcer at the Westdeutscher Rundfunk.

An abridged version of \\"The Tale of Happy Valley\\" was recorded for the English language record Monty Python's Previous Record. \\"Colin 'Bomber' Harris vs Colin 'Bomber' Harris\\" and \\"I Want a Hearing Aid\\" were both originally performed on At Last the 1948 Show, which predated Monty Python. Reception The first show received mixed reviews. Opinion surveys taken after the episode was broadcast revealed that 8% of the audience found the show to be very good, 15% found it to be very bad, and 43% found it to be good. Producer Biolek recalls that \\"This [the first show] was an absolute flop, it cannot be stated differently, as well as in terms of viewership and especially in terms of reviews.\\" Biolek retrospectively believes that the German audience was not ready for Pythonesque humour, since it was more used to more traditional sketch comedy, by comedians such as Rudi Carrell and Heinz Erhardt. In fact, the producers did expect early on that especially the older parts of the German audience would not connect with the Pythons' style of humour. Biolek attributes the production of the second show to Westdeutscher Rundfunk's general progressive stance towards entertainment production at the time, and specifically to the support of the head of the entertainment sector, Hannes Hoff.  Alternate Versions  The versions of the two episodes released on home video outside Germany differ from the versions aired on ARD. The ARD version of the first episode is missing the 6-minute \\"Bavarian Restaurant\\" sketch. The ARD version of the second episode trims some shots, mostly from 'The Tale of Happy Valley' sketch. On the other hand, the ARD version also features two sequences missing from the DVD version: 'Schwimmkurs mit Arthur Lustgarten' (Swimming Course with Arthur Lustgarten) and 'Eine wichtige Information f√ºr Raucher' (An Important Information for Smokers). Also, in the ARD version, Eric Idle's 'I Want A Hearing Aid' sketch has been moved to the end of the episode.  Media  Guerilla Films released both episodes on a single VHS tape in 1998, available in either PAL or NTSC format. The American A&E; Network used this release as the basis of their DVD releases of the same material, with the first episode being included on Monty Python Live and the second episode included on The Life of Python. (This arrangement resulted in the second episode being omitted from A&E;'s otherwise-complete 16-DVD box set of Monty Python's Flying Circus.) The Australian DVD company Rainbow Entertainment also released both episodes on one DVD. The Swiss publisher Haffmans released a hardbound book containing the scripts of both episodes, with introductions and essays by the German producers, in 1998. This book has not been translated into English as of 2007. Both episodes have been shown on the Paramount Comedy Channel in the UK and on PBS in the US in 2007. As of April 2018, both episodes are available for streaming on Netflix. The German DVD label Pidax has released the German DVD of the series in 2018. Episode 1 is featured in German language only; Episode 2 has German and English audio (with previously cut scenes being in English with German subtitles). The German TV-exclusive sketches of Episode 2, 'Schwimmkurs mit Arthur Lustgarten' and 'Eine wichtige Information f√ºr Raucher' are contained as separate bonus features; also, the German TV cut of 'The Tale of Happy Valley' sketch is available as a bonus feature.  Lost sketches  Several behind-the-scenes photos from the specials' production were published in the group's autobiography, some of which were from sketches cut from the specials: * A version of the \\"Marriage Guidance Counsellor\\" sketch. * A sketch involving a flute player (Graham Chapman) in front of a German sign. * A version of the \\"Sir Edward Ross\\" sketch * An alternate ending to the first special, in which two stage hands are carrying a giant sign that says ENDE off a huge field.

TIFR is considered as one of the outstanding research institutes in India. It is a Deemed University and works under the umbrella of the Department of Atomic Energy of the Government of India. It is located at Navy Nagar, Colaba, Mumbai, with an affiliated campus in Serilingampally near Hyderabad. TIFR conducts research primarily in the natural sciences, mathematics, the biological sciences and theoretical computer science and is considered to be one among India's outstanding research centres. TIFR has a graduate programme leading to a PhD in all the major fields of study. History In 1944, Homi J. Bhabha, known for his role in the development of the Indian atomic energy programme, wrote to the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust requesting financial assistance to set up a scientific research institute. With support from J.R.D. Tata, then chairman of the Tata Group, TIFR was founded on 1 June 1945, and Homi Bhabha was appointed its first director. The institute initially operated within the campus of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore before relocating to Mumbai later that year. TIFR's new campus in Colaba was designed by Chicago-based architect Helmuth Bartsch and was inaugurated by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 15 January 1962. Shortly after Indian Independence, in 1949, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) designated TIFR to be the centre for all large-scale projects in nuclear research. The first theoretical physics group was set up by Bhabha's students B.M. Udgaonkar and K.S. Singhvi. In December 1950, Bhabha organised an international conference at TIFR on elementary particle physics. Several world-renowned scientists attended the conference, including Rudolf Peierls, L√©on Rosenfeld, William Fowler as well as Meghnad Saha, Vikram Sarabhai and others providing expertise from India. In the 1950s, TIFR gained prominence in the field of cosmic ray physics, with the setting up of research facilities in Ooty and in the Kolar gold mines. In 1957, India's first digital computer, TIFRAC was built in TIFR. Acting on the suggestions of British physiologist Archibald Hill, Bhabha invited Obaid Siddiqi to set up a research group in molecular biology. This ultimately resulted in the establishment of the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore twenty years later. In 1970, TIFR started research in radio astronomy with the setting up of the Ooty Radio Telescope. Encouraged by the success of ORT, Govind Swarup persuaded J. R. D. Tata to help set up the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune, India TIFR attained the official deemed university status in June 2002. To meet the ever-growing demand of space needed for research labs and accommodation institute is coming up with a new campus at Hyderabad. Research Research at TIFR is distributed across three schools, working over the mathematical sciences, natural sciences, technology and computer science. =School of Mathematics= Since its birth in the 1950s, several brilliant contributions to mathematics have come from TIFR School of Mathematics. Notable contributions from TIFR mathematicians include Raghavan Narasimhan's proof of the embedding of open Riemann surfaces in \\\\mathbb{C}^3, C. S. Seshadri's work on projective modules over polynomial rings and M. S. Narasimhan's results in the theory of pseudo differential operators. Narasimhan and Seshadri wrote a seminal paper on stable vector bundles, work which has been recognised as one of the most influential articles in the area. M. S. Raghunathan started research at TIFR on algebraic and discrete groups, and was recognised for his work on rigidity. =School of Natural Sciences= The School of Natural Sciences is further split into seven departments working in several areas of physics, chemistry and biology. Within physics, the Department of Theoretical Physics was set up by Bhabha, who conducted research in high energy physics and Condensed Matter Physics. The department worked on the major advances in this period such as gauge theories, string theory, renormalisation and superconductivity. The Department of Astrophysics works in areas like stellar binaries, gravitational waves and cosmology. TIFR is involved in building India's first gravity wave detector. The High Energy Physics Department, TIFR has been involved in major accelerator projects like the KEK, Tevatron, LEP and the LHC. TIFR also runs the Pelletron particle accelerator facility. Bhabha's motivation resulted in the development of an NMR spectrometer for solid state studies. The Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Material Sciences also conducts experimental research in high-temperature superconductivity, nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. =School of Technology and Computer Science= The School of Technology and Computer Science grew out of early activities carried out at TIFR for building digital computers. Today, its activities cover areas such as Algorithms, Complexity Theory, Formal Method, Applied Probability, Mathematical Finance, Information Theory, Communications, etc. =Department of Biological Sciences= The Department Of Biological Sciences was set up by Obaid Siddiqui in early 1960s as a molecular biology group. Over the years has expanded to encompass various other branches of modern biology. The department has fourteen labs covering various aspects of modern molecular and cell biology. Research facilities TIFR has a Linear particle accelerator and a Pelletron capable of accelerating particles to moderate energies for studying heavy ion atomic interactions and a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facility to study complex molecules housed in campus in addition to several other facilities. The Institute's Dental Section has been actively involved in investigations pertaining to carcinogenic effects of tobacco. In addition to in campus facilities the institute has several field stations and research facilities in different parts of the country. A Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, the largest of its kind in the world, is operational at Khodad near Narayangaon, north of Pune and a large equatorially mounted cylindrical radio telescope and a high energy cosmic ray laboratory are operational at Udhagamandalam in Tamil Nadu. High Energy Cosmic ray and Gamma Ray laboratories are operated from Pachamarhi in Madhya Pradesh. TIFR runs a National Balloon Facility in Hyderabad which is among the best in the world and has the geographical advantage of being close to the geomagnetic equator. At Gauribidanur, TIFR scientists have built an extremely sensitive balance to study the difference between gravitational and inertial mass. In addition to the research laboratories, the facilities of TIFR include: * A library with more than one hundred thousand books and journals in its collection. The library is fully computerised and provides microfilm, microfiche, audio - video and compact disk reading facilities. * A central computing facility together with individually assigned personal computers and workstations for computation, control and monitoring of experiments and data analysis. * A network connected to the world grid through high speed communication networks. * A liquid helium facility for very low temperature experimental studies. * A large workshop and glass blowing section for manufacturing high precision instruments. Pioneering work done in the Institute in several areas has resulted in the establishment of new National organisations such as the Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering and Research (SAMEER) and the National Centre for Software Technology (NCST). In addition, several projects for which technology was developed at the Institute, were transferred to the industry and other departments of the Government of India. Other facilities =Canteens= TIFR houses two canteens called as the West and the East Canteen. The West Canteen provides western continental food and the east canteen offers Indian cuisine. Another canteen located in the housing complex - the Jagdish Canteen - is sublet to a private contractor.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, she moved to Puerto Rico, where she was a student leader and spokesperson of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party's branch in Rio Piedras. As an advocate for Puerto Rican independence, she was sentenced to eight years in a U.S. federal penitentiary, for refusing to recognize the sovereign authority of the United States over Puerto Rico. Early years Olga Isabel Viscal Garriga was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1929. Her parents, Francisco Viscal Bravo and Laura Garriga Gonzalez, had moved there from Puerto Rico in the early 1920s. Olga was one of seven children born to the couple. The children were the fourth-great- grandchildren of Field Marshal Don Juan Andres Daban y Busterino, who served as the Spanish-appointed Governor and General Captain of Puerto Rico from 1783 to 1789.Nationalist Heroines: Puerto Rican Women History Forgot, 1930s-1950s; Markus Wiener Publishers; Page: 166War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America‚Äôs Colony; Author: Nelson Antonio Denis; Publisher: Nation Books (April 7, 2015); .Las Heroinas Olvidadas de Puerto RicoLas Mujeres Nacionalistas Her parents returned with the family to Puerto Rico, settling in Rio Piedras. Viscal was raised and educated there, after having witnessed discrimination against Puerto Ricans in New York. As she grew up, she strongly disagreed with U.S. policies that limited human rights, freedom of speech, and self-determination in Puerto Rico. Student activist Viscal enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico, where she earned her Doctoral Degree in Political Sciences. During the late 1940s, and while finishing her Ph.D., she became a student leader and spokesperson of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party's branch in Rio Piedras. The Party was headed by Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos, and favored the forceful expulsion of the U.S. from Puerto Rico. The arrest of (L to R) Nationalists Carmen Mar√≠a P√©rez Gonzalez, Olga Viscal Garriga and Ruth Mary Reynolds on November 2, 1950 On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements in the archipelago. The Senate, controlled by the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD) and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill that day. This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. Viscal, who befriended Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos, was a talented orator and political activist. Although she was not directly involved in any violent act in 1950, Viscal was arrested because she participated in a demonstration that turned deadly in Old San Juan, after the police and other authorities opened fire on the demonstrators, one of whom was killed. She was detained on November 2, along with Carmen Mar√≠a P√©rez Roque and Ruth Mary Reynolds (The American/Puerto Rican Nationalist) and held in the La Princesa jail. During her trial in the federal court in Old San Juan, she was uncooperative with the U.S. government prosecution and refused to recognize the authority of the U.S. over Puerto Rico. She was sentenced to eight years in prison for contempt of court, and released after serving five. Later years After her release from prison, Viscal went to Cuba, where she was the Puerto Rican representative to the Cuban Parliament. As such, she met with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. She was a devout Catholic, and thus became disillusioned with Castro's politics and selectively atheist policies. After publicly criticizing Castro, she escaped from Cuba with the help of her younger sister, Irma. Olga Viscal Garriga died in June 1995 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She was the mother of three children, Pedro, Olga and Maria Luz. Legacy Viscal Garriga was the inspiration for the main character Ant√≠gona, in the play La Pasi√≥n Seg√∫n Ant√≠gona P√©rez (The Passion According to Ant√≠gona P√©rez), written by Puerto Rican playwright Luis Rafael S√°nchez.S√°nchez, Luis Rafael There is a plaque, located at the monument to the Jayuya Uprising participants in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, honoring the women of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.

The shop was named after the Amazons, a mythological tribe of fierce and independent women. In 1994 Amazon.com was founded and within a year, problems started for Amazon bookstore. Terms of a lawsuit by Amazon bookstore resulted in a small settlement, and a requirement that Amazon bookstore go by the name 'Amazon Bookstore Collective' to reduce confusion with Amazon.com. Early years In 1970 when Amazon was founded by Rosina Richter Christy and Julie Morse Quist, it was far from a full-fledged bookstore. The books were kept in the front room of the women's collective they lived in and books were only available from 3 to 6 PM or by special arrangement. This arrangement lasted for about two years before the book store moved to Minneapolis' Lesbian Resource Center and then migrated through a series of different storefront addresses. Working conditions were sometimes difficult and included an unsafe neighborhood and a building with no heat where pipes froze and people had to wear gloves inside the store. Lawsuit In 1999, the cooperative sued Amazon.com for trademark infringement. After sometimes acrimonious legal proceedings, the case was settled in November of that year, with Amazon Bookstore assigning its common law rights in the Amazon name to Amazon.com; and Amazon.com giving a license back to Amazon Bookstore Cooperative for use of the Amazon name. True Colors The store in 2012 with a \\"going out of business\\" sign in the window. The business announced that they were closing down at the end of June 2008, and buyers came forth to carry on the store as an independent bookstore. Ruta Skujins, with the help of her partner, Joann Bell, decided to take over the store. Transfer of the ownership of the store happened at the end of June, according to an e-mail sent by the store to customers on June 17. In November 2008 it was announced that the store changed ownership and as a result, the Amazon name could not be used by the new owner as it was owned by Amazon.com. The new owner of the bookstore, Ruta Skujins, changed the name of the store to True Colors Bookstore, and both names were in use during the transition period. The bookstore began experiencing financial difficulties in late 2011, with the store closing in February 2012 due to this. Influence and significance Amazon became \\"the oldest independent feminist bookstore in North America\\" and was probably \\"the oldest in the English speaking world\\". It had an impact that extended both beyond its immediate area and beyond the United States. It also had a presence in popular culture. Cartoonist and graphic novelist Alison Bechdel was inspired to create the fictional Madwimmin Books in Dykes to Watch Out For based on experiences at the store.

The term deep inference is generally reserved for proof calculi where the structural complexity is unbounded; in this article we will use non-shallow inference to refer to calculi that have structural complexity greater than the sequent calculus, but not unboundedly so, although this is not at present established terminology. Deep inference is not important in logic outside of structural proof theory, since the phenomena that lead to the proposal of formal systems with deep inference are all related to the cut-elimination theorem. The first calculus of deep inference was proposed by Kurt Sch√ºtte,Kurt Sch√ºtte. Proof Theory. Springer-Verlag, 1977. but the idea did not generate much interest at the time. Nuel Belnap proposed display logic in an attempt to characterise the essence of structural proof theory. The calculus of structures was proposed in order to give a cut-free characterisation of noncommutative logic. Cirquent calculus was developed as a system of deep inference allowing to explicitly account for the possibility of subcomponent-sharing.

Overview A proof system includes the components: * Language: The set of formulas admitted by the system, for example, propositional logic or first-order logic. * Rules of inference: List of rules that can be employed to prove theorems from axioms and theorems. * Axioms: Formulas in L assumed to be valid. All theorems are derived from axioms. Usually a given proof calculus encompasses more than a single particular formal system, since many proof calculi are under-determined and can be used for radically different logics. For example, a paradigmatic case is the sequent calculus, which can be used to express the consequence relations of both intuitionistic logic and relevance logic. Thus, loosely speaking, a proof calculus is a template or design pattern, characterized by a certain style of formal inference, that may be specialized to produce specific formal systems, namely by specifying the actual inference rules for such a system. There is no consensus among logicians on how best to define the term. Examples of proof calculi The most widely known proof calculi are those classical calculi that are still in widespread use: *The class of Hilbert systems, of which the most famous example is the 1928 Hilbert-Ackermann system of first-order logic; *Gerhard Gentzen's calculus of natural deduction, which is the first formalism of structural proof theory, and which is the cornerstone of the formulae-as-types correspondence relating logic to functional programming; *Gentzen's sequent calculus, which is the most studied formalism of structural proof theory. Many other proof calculi were, or might have been, seminal, but are not widely used today. *Aristotle's syllogistic calculus, presented in the Organon, readily admits formalisation. There is still some modern interest in syllogistic, carried out under the aegis of term logic. *Gottlob Frege's two-dimensional notation of the Begriffsschrift (1879) is usually regarded as introducing the modern concept of quantifier to logic. *C.S. Peirce's existential graph easily might have been seminal, had history worked out differently. Modern research in logic teems with rival proof calculi: *Several systems have been proposed which replace the usual textual syntax with some graphical syntax. Proof nets and cirquent calculus are among such systems. *Recently, many logicians interested in structural proof theory have proposed calculi with deep inference, for instance display logic, hypersequents, the calculus of structures, and bunched implication.

The college was founded in 1959 by a group of Chicago businessmen who wanted to establish a college providing students with a Christian higher education in a Reformed tradition as a college in Illinois. It offers degrees in more than 70 programs of study.  Campus  The Martin and Janet Ozinga Chapel, a 1200-seat facility, provides practice and rehearsal rooms for the music department, and houses the campus ministries program under the direction of the campus chaplain. The Grand Lobby has hosted a variety of events beneath its striking stained glass window, the first of a series of stained glass panels hung throughout the building designed to celebrate Trinity Christian's mission in Reformed higher education. The Heritage Science Center is a facility, comprising 38,000-square feet (3,500 m¬≤) of classroom and lab space for chemistry, biology, and physics programs, as well as classrooms and a lecture hall for technology and computer science studies. The Art and Communication Center (ARCC), provides Trinity Christian students with art and design studios, a graphic design lab, student gallery, The Marg Kallemeyn (black box) Theatre for the performing arts, and the Seerveld Gallery that welcomes guest artists and student artists, alike. New athletics fields and a new athletics complex have been in development with completion of the DeVos Athletics and Recreation Center celebrated in the fall of 2013. The facility features a state of the art lab for exercise students, a bouldering wall, and a fitness center.  Academics  Trinity Christian College claims a cohesive approach to its core curriculum of philosophy, history, English, and theology. The traditional (not including adult learners) student body has grown to more than 1000 undergraduates taught by more than 80 instructors. Although students are drawn from predominantly Reformed and Presbyterian church backgrounds, students also come from other Christian traditions such as Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic. In Fall 2012, Trinity began its first two master's degree programs, in counseling psychology and special education. Both programs take about two years to complete and utilize hybrid courses that combine face-to-face classroom sessions with online learning components. The school also began a three-year speech and language pathology program, in which students take classes at Trinity for three years majoring in communication disorders. Then for two years students can attend either Saint Xavier University in Chicago, IL or Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan to finish their bachelor's degree from Trinity and receive a master's degree in speech language pathology. = Accreditation and memberships = Trinity Christian College is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) and the Council for Independent Colleges (CIC). The college is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission. =Adult undergraduate programs= In 1998 Trinity Christian College opened the TRACS department, now called Adult Undergraduate Programs, to serve the needs of the non-traditional student. Adults 23 years of age and older can complete their college degree through this program. The Adult Undergraduate Programs are offered in a cohort format, so students begin the program as part of a group (20 maximum) and move through each course together. The cohort format encourages friendships and creates a supportive environment. Each course in the Adult Programs is accelerated. Courses that would normally require 16 weeks to finish are completed in five-, six- or seven-week periods. Classes will cover the necessary course material in a shorter time frame, helping students finish their degrees and/or teaching license in less than two years. To simplify the process further, courses are held on the same night of the week during the same time period (usually 6 p.m.-10 p.m.) throughout the program. =Graduate Studies= In 2012 Trinity Christian College began offering two graduate level programs: a Master of Arts in Special Education and a Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology. The Graduate Studies Special Education program is for those who have already completed an undergraduate degree and have a valid teaching license. Students attend class just one night a week, on the same evenings throughout the entire program, for 1 ¬Ω years. Some courses are blended with online instruction. The program is offered at our main campus in Palos Heights, Illinois.  Athletics  Trinity Christian athletic teams are known as the Trolls; the college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), competing in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC). The Trolls also compete in the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and track & field, and volleyball.

November 10, 1916) was an American geneticist and physician whose most significant contribution to present-day biology was his theory that the Mendelian laws of inheritance could be applied to chromosomes at the cellular level of living organisms. This is now known as the Boveri-Sutton chromosome theory. Early life Sutton was born in Utica, New York, and was raised on a farm as the fifth of seven sons to Judge William B. Sutton and his wife, Agnes Black Sutton, in Russell, Kansas. On the farm, he developed a mechanical aptitude by maintaining and repairing farm equipment, an aptitude that proved helpful later as he worked on oil drilling rigs and with medical instrumentation. University of Kansas After graduating high school in Russell, he enrolled at the University of Kansas in engineering in 1896. Following the death of his younger brother (John) from typhus in 1897, Sutton switched his major to biology with an interest in medicine. While at the University of Kansas, both he and his older brother, William Sutton, played basketball for Dr. James Naismith. Sutton distinguished himself as student being elected to both Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi and receiving both bachelor's and master's degrees by 1901. For his Masters thesis, he studied the spermatogenesis of Brachystola magna,SUTTON, W. S., 1900 The spermatogonial divisions of Brachystola magna.. Kansas Univ. Q. 9:135-160. a large grasshopper indigenous to the farmlands upon which Sutton was raised. Columbia University Considering the advice of his mentor at KU, Dr. C. E. McClung, Sutton moved to Columbia University for further study of zoology under Dr. Edmund B. Wilson. It was here that Sutton wrote his two significant works in genetics ‚Äì ‚ÄúOn the morphology of the chromosome group in Brachystola magna‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe chromosomes in heredity‚Äù.SUTTON, W. S., 1902 On the morphology of the chromosome group in Brachystola magna.. Biol Bull. 4:24-39SUTTON, W. S., 1903 The chromosomes in heredity. Biol. Bull 4:231-251 Effectively, Sutton could now explain ‚Äúwhy the yellow dog is yellow‚Äù. The German biologist Theodor Boveri independently reached the same conclusions as Sutton, and their concepts are often referred to as the Boveri-Sutton chromosome theory. Sutton's hypothesis was widely accepted by most scientists, particularly cytologists, at the time. The continued work of Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia brought the theory to universal acceptance by 1915 through his studies of Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, even as William Bateson continued to question the theory until 1921. Sutton did not complete his PhD in Zoology as he originally planned. At the age of 26, he returned to the Kansas oil fields for 2 years. There he was able to perfect a device to start large gas engines with high pressure-gas and develop hoisting apparatuses for deep wells. Sutton's mechanical aptitudes never left him. His father finally directed him to return to his medical studies and he did so returning to Columbia University in 1905. Sutton's medical studies proceeded through the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. While he continued to work on patents associated with oil drilling, Sutton also began at this stage to apply his mechanical aptitude to improving medical instruments. With credit for his graduate studies at both the University of Kansas and Columbia University, Sutton obtained his doctorate in medicine in 1907 graduating with ‚Äúhigh standing‚Äù. He then began an internship at Roosevelt Hospital in New York working in the surgical division headed by Dr. Joseph Blake. Career In addition to his clinic duties at Roosevelt Hospital, Sutton was also able to work with the Surgical Research Laboratory at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. With that support, he was able to begin developing and improving a variety of medical and surgical practices including improving anesthetic techniques, and perfecting abdominal irrigation. In 1909, Sutton returned to Kansas City, Kansas where his family had relocated and his father and brother were in law practice. Sutton was appointed assistant professor of surgery at the four-year-old University of Kansas Medical School. The tenuous nature of the appointment at the young school led him to also maintain a private practice and serve on the staff of St. Margaret's Hospital as well as the University's Bell Memorial Hospital. For six years, Sutton performed a wide range of surgeries carefully documenting the procedures. He published several articles related to these cases going back to his internship at Roosevelt.SUTTON, W. S., 1910a Anesthesia by colonic absorption of ether. Ann. Surg. 51:457-479SUTTON, W. S., 1910b A new incision for epithelioma of the upper and lower lips on the same side. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 55:647.SUTTON, W. S., 1910c The proposed fistulo-enterostomy of Von Stubenrauch. Ann.

Assoc. 56:736-738.SUTTON, W. S., 1914 Anesthesia by colonic absorption of ether. J. T. Gwathmey's Anesthesia. Macmillan, New York, NY. In 1911, he had accepted a commission as a First Lieutenant in the United States Army Medical reserve Corps. This eventually led to his taking a leave of absence from the University in February 1915 to serve at the American Ambulance Hospital outside Paris. Sutton and others from his days at Columbia and Roosevelt arrived at College of Juilly on February 23 where hospital facilities had been set up only 40 miles from the front lines of World War I. Within 2 months, he was surgeon-in-chief handling administrative duties in addition to his surgical responsibilities. His inventive aptitude was perhaps never more valued as he developed fluoroscopic techniques to identify and localize shrapnel within the soldier's bodies and then removed the foreign items with instruments of his own design. After his return, he documented these techniques in Binnie's Manual of Operative Surgery.SUTTON, W. S., 1916 War Surgery. In J. F. Binnie's Manual of Operative Surgery. 7th ed., 1285-1316, Blakiston, Philadelphia, PA. Sutton's return sailing from France was on June 26, 1915 having stayed only four months, but have made a significant contribution to wartime medical treatment. Dr. Sutton died rather unexpectedly at the age of 39 due to complications from acute appendicitis.

Prior to 2006 the Gila trout was federally listed as endangered. In July 2006, after much work by the Game and Fish departments in New Mexico and Arizona, the US Forest Service and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Gila trout was down-listed to threatened, with a special provision called a \\"4d rule\\" that will allow limited sport fishing ‚Äì for the first time in nearly half a century. This possibility is distinct: there may be no one alive today that has legally angled a pure Gila trout from its native waters. By the time the Gila trout was closed to fishing in the 1950s, its numbers and range were so depleted and so reduced this copper-colored trout simply wasn't very accessible to anglers. As of 2011 there is fishing in both states for this fish. Range The Gila trout is native to tributaries of the Gila River in Arizona and New Mexico. The Gila trout is found historically in the Verde and Agua Fria drainages in Arizona. Natural fish barriers prevented Gila trout from entering the upper Tonto Creek drainage (AZ). Gila trout have persisted in five streams within the Gila National Forest, New Mexico, including: Iron, McKenna, and Spruce creeks in the Gila Wilderness Area, along with Main and South Diamond creeks in the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Area.Loudeslager, E.J., J.N.

Conservation The Gila trout has been threatened by competition and hybridization with introduced game fish such as the rainbow trout. However, the primary cause of reduced Gila trout populations is habitat loss caused by loss of water flow and shade-giving trees, caused in turn by fires, human destruction of riparian vegetation, livestock overgrazing, agricultural irrigation and water diversion, and channelization of streams in the Gila trout's native range. By the time the Gila trout was listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1967 its range had reduced from several hundred miles of stream to just 20 in the Gila Wilderness and Aldo Leopold Wilderness.Gila Trout at Center for Biological Diversity. After listing USFWS began an aggressive program of stream restoration, removing the introduced trout, restoring and repairing riparian vegetation (to maintain cooler water temperatures), and restocking restored streams with young Gila trout. The Mora National Fish Hatchery and Technology Center in northern New Mexico keeps brood stocks of the Gila trout and supplies the fish for restocking. The species is now more secure than it was in the 1970s, having been moved to 10 new streams, though populations and habitat are still far below those originally established.Springer, Craig (27 September 2006) \\"Gila trout down-listed to threatened status,\\" Fishing World Conservationists hope to eventually delist the species and allow fishing, thus forming alliances with fishermen in order to help preserve the species. Major wildfires and drought will always play a major role in the status of any trout species.

Located in northeastern Arizona, it is within the boundaries of the Navajo Nation and lies in the Four Corners region. Reflecting one of the longest continuously inhabited landscapes of North America, it preserves ruins of the indigenous tribes that lived in the area, from the Ancestral Puebloans (formerly known as Anasazi) to the Navajo. The monument covers and encompasses the floors and rims of the three major canyons: de Chelly, del Muerto, and Monument. These canyons were cut by streams with headwaters in the Chuska Mountains just to the east of the monument. None of the land is federally owned. Canyon de Chelly is one of the most visited national monuments in the United States. Etymology The name Chelly (or Chelley) is a Spanish borrowing of the Navajo word , which means \\"canyon\\" (literally \\"inside the rock\\" < ts√© \\"rock\\" + -yi º \\"inside of, within\\"). The Navajo pronunciation is '. The Spanish pronunciation of de Chelly was adapted into English, apparently through modelling after a French- like spelling pronunciation, and now . History Canyon de Chelly long served as a home for Navajo people before it was invaded by forces led by future New Mexico governor Lt. Antonio Narbona in 1805. In 1863, Col. Kit Carson sent troops through the canyon, killing 23 Indians, seizing 200 sheep, and destroying hogans, as well as peach orchards and other crops. The resulting demoralization led to the surrender of the Navajos and their removal to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico. Description Canyon de Chelly is entirely owned by the Navajo Tribal Trust of the Navajo Nation. It is the only National Park Service unit that is owned and cooperatively managed in this manner. About 40 Navajo families live in the park. Access to the canyon floor is restricted, and visitors are allowed to travel in the canyons only when accompanied by a park ranger or an authorized Navajo guide. The only exception to this rule is the White House Ruin Trail. Spider Rock The park's distinctive geologic feature, Spider Rock, is a sandstone spire that rises from the canyon floor at the junction of Canyon de Chelly and Monument Canyon. Spider Rock can be seen from South Rim Drive. It has served as the scene of a number of television commercials. According to traditional Navajo beliefs, the taller of the two spires is the home of Spider Grandmother. Most park visitors arrive by automobile and view Canyon de Chelly from the rim, following both North Rim Drive and South Rim Drive. Ancient ruins and geologic structures are visible, but in the distance, from turnoffs on each of these routes. Deep within the park is Mummy Cave. It features structures that have been built at various times in history. Private Navajo-owned companies offer tours of the canyon floor by horseback, hiking or four-wheel drive vehicle. The companies can be contacted directly for prices and arrangements. No entrance fee is charged to enter the park, apart from any charges imposed by tour companies. Accommodations for visitors are located in the vicinity of the canyon, on the road leading to Chinle, which is the nearest town. The National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1970.  Climate  The data below were compiled starting in 1908 via the WRCC.

The national monument is one of fifteen new National Park Service units designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980. It was initially declared a national monument under the authority of the Antiquities Act by President Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978. Cape Krusenstern is primarily a coastal plain, containing large lagoons and rolling hills of limestone. The bluffs record thousands of years of change in the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea, as well as evidence of some 9,000 years of human habitation. The park's central features, 114 beach ridges at the eponymous cape, alternate between sandy and gravelly ridges and narrow ponds. Located entirely above the Arctic Circle in a region of permafrost, the monument's lands include typical thermokarst features. Description Cape Krusenstern National Monument comprises the coast of the Chukchi Sea from the opening of the Hotham Inlet at the mouth of the Kobuk River, extending northwards along the coast to a point just short of Imikruk Lagoon. It extends inland toward the Kobuk Valley about , with a high point in the north at Kikmiksot Mountain () in the Mulgrave Hills and in the south at Mount Noak () in the Igichuk Hills. The coastline is marked by a series of lagoons separated from the sea by sandspits. The largest is the Krusenstern Lagoon at Cape Krusenstern.Others include the Kotlik Lagoon, Imik Lagoon and Aukulak Lagoon. The local bedrock is composed of limestone, dolomite, phyllite and chert from the Precambrian through Devonian times. The land was glaciated during the Illinoian glaciation, but was free of permanent ice during the Wisconsonian glaciation. Longshore currents have deposited beach ridges since then for 6,000 years. =Archaeological district= The archeological district comprises 114 ancient beach ridges which formed approximately 60 years apart. They provide a sequential look at over 5000 years of habitation. The area in the National Historic Landmark is vast, making this one of the largest NHLs in the U.S., along with the Adirondack Park. The national historic landmark was designated on November 7, 1973. The beach ridges are the primary reason for the area's preservation, which serves to safeguard evidence of 5,000 years of occupation by the Inupiat people, and more than 9,000 years of human occupation. Initial investigations by archaeologist J. Louis Giddings in the late 1940s found campsites on the cape as much as 4,000 years old, and even older sites on the mainland. University of Washington researchers have undertaken several years of excavations to document about one third of the beach complex. Researchers found campsites, hearths and animal bones, with a few stone tools and pieces of pottery. In newer locations the team documented the remains of semi-subterranean houses built into the beach ridges. The oldest mainland sites such as Battle Rock, Rabbit Mountain and the Lower Bench date to the Paleo-Arctic Tradition, about 10,000 to 7,000 years before present. Similar materials have been recovered in the Trail Creek caves of Bering Land Bridge National Preserve on the Seward Peninsula. The Palisades site has yielded materials from the Northern Archaic period dating to about 6,000 years before the present. Later periods described in the region include the Arctic Small Tool tradition and the Northern Maritime tradition. The western Thule culture, which used dogs and seal oil extended from 950 AD to 1400, and was succeeded by the Kotzebue culture from about 1400 to about 1850, when Europeans began to affect native cultures. Kotzebue sites are widespread within the monument. =Later history= Europeans visited the Cape Krusenstern region to pursue whales beginning in the 1850s. During the American Civil War the Confederate raider CSS Shenandoah captured whalers in the area. In early modern times the Kotzebue area was the site of an Iqatngut,\\" a kind of trade fair for the region's native people. The Iqatngut tradition died out with the foundation of Nome as the region's principal town in the early 20th century. A short-lived gold rush brought prospectors to the Seward Peninsula and Kotzebue in the 1890s. A few 20th century structures exist in the monument, including an Alaska Road Commission cabin at Anigaaq that has been evaluated for historic significance. In the 1950s the area's lack of good natural harbors, a desire to develop the Alaskan frontier facing the Soviet Union and the Operation Plowshare drive for the peaceful use of nuclear weapons brought proposals for Operation Chariot, a proposed deepwater harbor at Cape Thompson northwest of the monument, to be excavated using nuclear devices. The project, though popular elsewhere in Alaska, was opposed by native leaders and was discarded. Ecology and environment Muskoxen at Cape Krusenstern The lands within the monument, which lies entirely above the Arctic Circle, are all tundra in which the permafrost dominates soils and vegetation. The monument is in a permafrost region. In the lowland areas the land is shaped by thermokarst forces. Typical thermokarst features seen in the monument include pingos, polygon ice wedges and thaw ponds. Low vegetation covers the land, mainly in tussocks of cottongrass, with shrubby growth of willow, Labrador tea, dwarf birch, mountain alder and other species in moist tundra areas. Wetter areas in the southern part of the monument feature grasses and sedges. Upland regions are Arctic tundra, with lichen, saxifrage, willow and heather. Few trees grow, and the white spruce that do grow are confined to the southeastern corner of the monument. The coastal region supports a variety of large terrestrial and marine mammals. The abundant caribou are part of the West. Large predators include brown bears and wolf packs. Smaller mammals include snowshoe and Arctic hares, weasels, minks, otters, porcupines and a few wolverines. Marine mammals in or near monument waters include fin, bowhead, gray and beluga whales. Seal species include ringed, spotted, bearded and ribbon seals, with occasional walruses. Ringed seals are hunted by native subsistence hunters, and occasionally beluga whales and walrus are hunted as well. Fish species include five species of salmon, burbot, several species of whitefish, Arctic char, Dolly Varden trout, herring and northern pike. Water birds of all kinds nest in the monument. Nesting species include tundra swan, mallard, green-winged teal, common eider, Canada goose, and horned and red-necked grebes. Sandhill cranes also nest on the tundra, with common, Arctic and yellow-billed loons. Seabirds include glaucous gulls, Arctic terns, long-tailed jaegers and common murres. Landbirds include willow and rock ptarmigans. Predatory landbirds include peregrine falcons, snowy owls and goshawks. Endangered species at Cape Krusenstern include the possibly extinct Eskimo curlew, and threatened spectacled eider and Steller's eider. Weather in the coastal monument is subject to extremes. Average low temperatures in January are , and can reach nighttime lows of . Summer temperatures average around , and can reach . Since the park is above the Arctic Circle, the sun does not set from June 3 to July 9, and the sun is visible for only 1-1/2 hour on the winter solstice, with long periods of twilight on either side of sunrise and sunset. As is the case over all of northern Alaska, the aurora borealis is often visible on winter nights when solar activity is high. Snow can happen at any time of the year. The coast can be stormy, with winds of to . Visitors must take care against hypothermia in the cool, damp environment. =Mining= The Red Dog mine is the world's largest zinc mine. The mine opened in 1989, located about northeast of the monument, close to Noatak National Preserve on land owned by the NANA Regional Corporation, an Alaskan native corporation.The mine is operated by Teck Cominco Alaska. A haul road from the mine crosses monument lands to a small port facility on the monument's shore a few miles south of the northern boundary, from which the concentrated lead and zinc powder is shipped during the 100 ice-free days of the year. About of the road are within the monument. A 2006 study measured high lead and cadmium concentrations in voles and birds sampled near the road compared to those at a control location. The animal sample was a follow-up to an earlier study that found elevated lead and cadmium levels in mosses near the road. The contamination is attributed to dust blown from trucks on the haul road. Following the first study changes were made to the trucks to contain dust and a sampling program was put into effect to monitor dust release. History and administration Muskoxen with rainbow Cape Krusenstern National Monument was established as one of fifteen new National Park Service properties established by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980. It was first declared a national monument by President Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978 using his authority under the Antiquities Act when Congressional negotiations on the proposed ANILCA bill were stalled. ANILCA was finally passed in 1980, and signed by Carter on December 2, 1980. As is the case in most national park lands in Alaska, subsistence hunting by local residents is permitted. No part of the monument is designated as a national preserve, which would allow sport hunting. About 19% of monument lands are owned by native corporations. The monument's headquarters are at the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center in Kotzebue, across the Hotham Inlet from Cape Krusenstern. Offices and visitor services for Kobuk Valley National Park and Noatak National Preserve are in the same facility. The units are managed together as the Western Arctic National Parklands, with a single Park Service superintendent in charge.

The school was founded in 1584 by Archdeacon Robert Johnson, along with Uppingham School, a few miles away. They share a common badge design (and a strong rivalry), but while Uppingham's colours tend towards blue and white, Oakham's are black and red. Under Headmaster John Buchanan, in 1971 Oakham was the first boys' independent secondary school in Britain to accept both male and female pupils throughout the whole school and not just in the Sixth Form. In 1995, it was the first public school to go on-line. Leicestershire County Cricket Club occasionally plays games on the school grounds. History Inscription above the door of the Old School Oakham School was founded in 1584 by Archdeacon Robert Johnson. Johnson received an income from four church positions and used this wealth to set up a number of charitable institutions, including the two free grammar schools at Oakham and Uppingham. As someone on the Puritan wing of the Church of England he had a strong belief in the benefits of education.see J. L. Barber: The Story of Oakham School pp18-24 According to Johnson's statutes for the school, \\"the schoolmaster shall teach all those grammar scholars that are brought up in Oakham, freely without pay, if their parents be poor and not able to pay, and keep them constantly to school.\\" The master of the school was to teach Hebrew, Latin and Greek. Of course, although the schooling was free, permanent attendance meant the loss to a family of an income, so not many very poor would have attended, or wanted the education. The master could supplement his income of ¬£24 per year by taking in boarders. Johnson was careful to ensure that his schools were sufficiently endowed. This endowment was confirmed by Royal Charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I. The original school building was restored in the eighteenth century and remained the sole classroom for 300 years. In 1749 a case involving payment of rates recorded that \\"the school of Uppingham is not nor hath been of equal repute with that of Oakham.\\" The headmastership of Dr John Doncaster (1808‚Äì46), himself a previous pupil at the school, saw the school advance academically: \\"This was the man who returned to his old school at the age of thirty-six, with University honours and university experience, to give it fresh life, and to set a mark on it which it never quite lost\\".W. L. Sargant, The Book of Oakham School, p31 Even so, numbers attending were well below 50, and while Uppingham flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century, Oakham did not to the same extent. Even so, in 1869 Oakham was one of the founding members of the Headmasters' Conference (HMC). In 1875 as a result of the Endowed Schools Act that threatened the continued existence of the school, there were just 2 day boys and 2 boarders in the school. The exhausted headmaster, William Spicer Wood (1846‚Äì75), retired and the new headmaster lasted just three years before being dismissed.J. L. Barber: The Story of Oakham School pp85-89 All classes were still taught in the one room - the original old school, which still exists next to the Parish Church. The school did see some development. Science and Modern Languages had recently been added to the curriculum. The subjects examined for a scholarship within the school were: English History (1066-1603), Geography of the British Isles, English Grammar, Arithmetic, English Composition and Dictation. A more successful headmaster, the Rev. E.V. Hodge, headmaster from 1879 to 1902, saw numbers increase, to 125 in 1896, with slightly more boarders than day boys. Then followed onto the scene three successful headmasters - Walter Lee Sargant (1902‚Äì29) under whom numbers rose to over 200 with consequent new buildings, Francis Cecil Doherty (1929‚Äì34), who went on to be headmaster of Lancing), and Grosvenor Talbot Griffith (1935‚Äì57) who took the numbers to over three hundred - before the advent of John Buchanan. The 125 of Hodge's time was a temporary peak - by 1905 numbers had fallen back to 66. Sargant's response to the obvious financial difficulties which accompanied this decline (there were just 80 boys in the school when he commenced his headmastership) was to apply in 1910 for Direct Grant status, and to become in effect the boys' grammar school for Rutland at the same time as continuing as a public school for the boarders. New facilities for Science teaching were created, boarding accommodation was improved with new building and extensions, and then a new school house was built. Pupil numbers rose again, to 105 in 1910, and to 200 in 1923. The Memorial Chapel was dedicated on 29 October 1925; it was built as a memorial to the 68 old boys and masters who were killed in the First World War. The Memorial Library was opened in 1955 by The Duke of Gloucester as a memorial to the 82 old boys who were killed in the Second World War. John David Buchanan took over from Talbot Griffith in 1958, and played himself in quietly until the Circular 10/65 which demanded comprehensivisation of maintained schools, of which Oakham was one as a Direct Grant school for the Rutland dayboys. He and the Rutland Local Education Authority did not see eye to eye on the possibilities of re-organisation of Rutland's schools, and as a result in 1970 the school (then 700 in size, all boys) reverted to full independence from the local authority, and in 1971, Oakham admitted female pupils for the first time, with the intention from the beginning of being co- educational throughout. The school is fully co-educational throughout the whole age range (10-18), with an approximately 50:50 split at all levels (c550 boys and c500 girls in 2011-12). There are an equal number of girls' houses (8) to boys' houses. When Buchanan retired in 1977 the school was 950 in total size (c550 boys and 400 girls), and the next headmaster, Richard Bull (1977‚Äì84, before he went on to be headmaster of Rugby) continued the co- education process; but it was not until 1990 that the process was completed during the headmastership of Graham Smallbone (1985‚Äì96) and equality of numbers gained. When Tony Little, later headmaster of Eton, took over in 1996 there were 528 boys and 510 girls in a school of 1038. Furthermore, the school is pretty evenly spread between boarders and day, although there do exist \\"day boarders\\" from 13 and \\"transitional boarders\\" from 10-13. In 1981, the school was the subject of an action brought by Novello & Co and the Music Publishers Association (UK) for photocopying sheet music for Christmas carols. This was the first case of its kind in the UK. The High Court settlement ordered the school to pay ¬£4250 in damages plus costs.\\"School Music Copies Illegal, Rules Court\\" The Glasgow Herald, 18 February 1981 In 1984 the Quatercentenary of the school was celebrated by a visit from The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh. In 2005 Oakham School was one of fifty independent schools found guilty of unintentionally running an illegal price-fixing cartel which had allowed them, it was alleged, to drive up fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of ¬£10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. The Lower School School entrance in Oakham Market Place The current school set-up comprises three distinct \\"levels\\" of education. The Lower School, for children aged 10‚Äì13, is also known as \\"Jerwoods\\" after the benefactor Old Oakhamian John Jerwood, MC. The buildings that comprise it mostly date back to the early 70s, when the four houses that comprise the area were established, but the main building, now the boys' boarding house, Peterborough House, was the old vicarage, which was bought by the school in 1870.Oakham School Chronology.pdf - A timeline of events published by the Oakham School Foundation The girls' boarding house, Lincoln, is in a round building to the west, while the two day houses, Sargants for boys and Ancaster for girls, are found on different floors of the main eastern building, which also houses all seven classrooms. During their time in the Lower School, pupils study all of the core subjects (Mathematics, English, Science, History and Geography) as well as French and either German or Spanish, Religious Education, Latin and ICT. There is also a carousel system of Creative and Performing Arts courses, which include textiles, 2D art and sculpture, and pupils take part in a Physical Education scheme of swimming and general ball skills. The Middle School All pupils study English (Language and Literature), Mathematics, a dual-award Science course, RE and a foreign language (French, German or Spanish) to GCSE, as well as at least two of History, Geography and French, which is offered as an alternative to a second humanities subject. Pupils then choose two subjects from a selection, including a second foreign language, Drama and Theatre Studies, Art and Design subjects, Food Studies, Sports Science and a combined Greek and Latin course. Structure: There are ten houses in the Middle School, six boarding and four day houses, split evenly between boys and girls. The day houses are located at the north end of campus, in the grounds of the former Oakham Workhouse, later Catmose Vale Hospital. The main building houses the two girls' houses, Gunthorpe and Hambleton, while the boys' houses, Barrow and Clipsham, are in a much newer house alongside. The Upper School The Upper School academic curriculum is designed to give students a wide range of choices that will prepare them for higher education and future careers. Oakham offers both the International Baccalaureate (IB) and AS/A2 levels. =AS/A2 levels= The AS/A2 levels structure at Oakham has been designed to encourage students to take a wider variety of subjects. Most students take 4 subjects at AS Level and continue to A2 level in at least 3 of those subjects. =International Baccalaureate (IB)= Studying within the Upper School, all students take six subjects. Usually, students take a literature course in their own language, another modern or classical language, a science and a mathematics course, a humanities and an arts course. These are at standard or higher level. In addition, all students complete an extended essay, take a course in theory of knowledge and complete a programme of creativity, action and service (CAS). In recent years the GCSE pass rate has been just short of 100%, with an average of over 10 passes above C (with most at A / A*) per pupil; the A level / IB pass rate similarly has been just under 100%, with over 80% at A / A* or IB equivalent. Houses Oakham School has a total of 16 houses; 2 in the Upper School (1 for boys and 1 for girls), 10 in the Middle School (5 boys houses, 5 girls; 4 full boarding, 2 flexi-boarding, 4 day) and 4 in the Lower School (Jerwoods) (2 boys, 2 girls). =Upper School= There are two boarding houses for the Seventh Form, School House for boys and Round House for girls. Both are in Chapel Close. Sport Oakham offers a range of sports to its pupils; main sports for boys are rugby (Daily Mail champions twice), hockey, cricket and athletics, and for girls are hockey, netball, tennis and athletics. The school has won the Ashburton Shield at shooting on three occasions. The school offers, on a voluntary basis, both the Combined Cadet Force and The Duke of Edinburgh's Award; in the latter it has gained over 5000 awards at the three levels of bronze, silver and gold, and is the leading educational establishment in terms of awards gained. In November 2000 the Duke of Edinburgh came to the school to present the 1000th Gold Award. Old Oakhamians For details of notable alumni - see List of Old Oakhamians References See also * W. L.

They have been awarded each year at the Small Press Expo since 1997,\\"Small Press Expo Initiates First Festival Prize for Comic Books: Ignatz Award,\\" Comics Buyer's Guide (September 12, 1997), p. 8 only skipping a year in 2001 due to the show's cancellation after the September 11 attacks. SPX has been held in either Bethesda, North Bethesda, or Silver Spring, Maryland. The Ignatz Awards are named in honour of George Herriman and his strip Krazy Kat, which featured a brick-throwing mouse named Ignatz.  Awards criteria  As one of the few festival awards rewarded in comics, the Ignatz Awards are voted on by attendees of the annual Small Press Expo (SPX, or The Expo, its corporate name), a weekend convention and tradeshow showcasing creator-owned comics. Nominations for the Ignatz Awards are made by a five-member jury panel consisting of comic book professionals. The jury panel remains anonymous (from both the public as well as each other) until the announcement of the awards. Jurors are prohibited from nominating their own work. However, there is no prohibition of one jury member's work being nominated for an award by his or her fellow jurors.  History  The first comics industry awards given the title \\"Ignatz\\" originated at the OrlandoCon,Harvey, R. C. \\"\\"Blood & Thunder: Two for Cho, The Comics Journal #219 (Jan. 2000), p. 3. held in Orlando, Florida, from 1974-1994. The current Ignatz Awards are not connected with OrlandoCon. The SPX Ignatz Awards were conceived in 1996 by SPX organizer Chris Oarr and cartoonist Ed Brubaker. Their original mandate, to set the Ignatz apart from \\"mainstream\\" awards like the Eisner Awards, was that the work nominated be creator-owned, and focus more on work done by a single writer/artist. The Award was administered by Jeff Alexander from 1998‚Äì2006,McElhatton, Greg. \\"Goodbye, Jeff,\\" GregMcE.com (Jan. 30, 2011). when they were taken over by Greg McElhatton.

Allan Skyway, originally called the Burlington Bay Skyway and simply known as the Burlington Skyway, is a pair of high-level freeway bridges (built in 1958 and 1985) spanning the Burlington Bay Canal. The Skyway, as it is locally known, is located in Hamilton and Burlington, Ontario, Canada, and is part of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) highway linking Fort Erie with Toronto. 1958 arch bridge Construction of the skyway in 1957. The first bridge (steel structure) was completed in 1958 and officially opened October 30, 1958, crossing the narrow bar separating Hamilton Harbour and the Port of Hamilton from Lake Ontario. This allows for Great Lakes ship traffic to flow underneath while four lanes of Golden Horseshoe road traffic may flow on top of it, neither disturbing the other. The bridge was designed by John Turner Bell. Construction of the entire Skyway required of steel and of concrete. The bridge had tolls when constructed, but these were removed December 28, 1973 after they were found to heavily impede traffic flow. The toll plaza was located near Tower's Drive. Truck drivers in particular had refused to take the tolled bridge since not only were they charged the full toll but also it took them extra fuel to ascend the Skyway. With the lifting of tolls on the bridge, trucks were then banned from using Beach Boulevard. 1985 twin bridge When traffic volume became more than the bridge could accommodate in the early 1980s, the bridge was twinned. The 1985 bridge was a conventional precast concrete box girder. When the new skyway (concrete structure) was opened on October 11, 1985, traffic was temporarily rerouted to it so that the old bridge could be extensively rehabilitated and this work was completed August 22, 1988. Afterwards, there were eight lanes of traffic crossing the harbour. The twinning project also saw a major upgrade of the freeway approaches to the bridge. The entire project resulted in the QEW being widened to eight lanes from Burlington Street to Highway 403, with modern Parclo interchanges at Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard (former Highway 2), and Fairview Street/Plains Road. This section has a variable lighting system to overcome the frequent fog found in the area. It is also the site of Ontario's first freeway traffic management system which incorporates traffic cameras and changeable message signs. =Design= The 1958 steel bridge is a suspended deck through-arch truss bridge. The approach to the main span has elements of a through-truss bridge, but the arch shape takes the truss higher than the roadway deck, so hangers are used to suspend the deck from the arch truss. The 1958 bridge is long overall. The main span of is flanked by two back spans each long; there are 72 total approach spans, and the bridge has of vertical clearance below the bottom of the deck. alternate URL A second bridge, completed in 1985, is shorter. The roadway deck for each bridge is 30 m (97 ft) wide. =Naming= The original name of the first bridge was the Burlington Bay Skyway. After it was twinned, the proposed names of James N. Allan Skyway (in honour of the Ontario Minister of Highways James Noble Allan, who had championed the 1958 bridge) and James N. Allan Burlington Bay Skyway were rejected. The official name since 1988 has been Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway. Lift bridge A federally owned low-level lift bridge, Burlington Canal Lift Bridge, linking Beach Boulevard in the Hamilton neighbourhood of Hamilton Beach and Lakeshore Road in the Burlington neighbourhood of Burlington Beach continues to operate. Built in 1962, the current bridge is the sixth bridge spanning the waters since 1830.http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ontario/burlington-eng.html This is mainly used by local traffic, although ramps from the QEW have been configured to allow easy access to the bridge and re-entry to the highway, should the Skyway bridge close because of high winds and adverse weather conditions, exacerbated by its towering height. The federal government attempted to transfer ownership of the bridge, but neither the province nor the Hamilton Port Authority were interested in assuming the estimated $2 million annual operating costs. Refurbishment and events In fall 2008, most of the older Aluminum Tapered Leg (ATL) overhead sign gantries (commonly referred by the MTO as a \\"Type 1\\" structure) which had been installed back in the late 1980s were replaced with the newer triangular truss gantries. On July 31, 2014, a man driving a dump truck in its raised position crashed onto the top of the bridge frame on the Toronto-bound lanes. The bridge was closed for the weekend to effect temporary repairs; permanent repairs to the bridge structure took seven months and cost $1.224 million. The driver was charged with impaired driving and tried in 2016, resulting in a conviction for dangerous driving in March 2016 and a one- year jail sentence.

OpenGL 2 through OpenGL 4 is fully supported. jMonkeyEngine is a community-centric open-source project released under the new BSD license. It is used by several commercial game studios and educational institutions. The default jMonkeyEngine 3 download comes readily integrated with an advanced SDK. jMonkeyEngine 3 SDK By itself, jMonkeyEngine is a collection of libraries, making it a low-level game development tool. Coupled with an IDE like the official jMonkeyEngine 3 SDK it becomes a higher level game development environment with multiple graphical components. The SDK is based on the NetBeans Platform, enabling graphical editors and plugin capabilities. Alongside the default NetBeans update centers, the SDK includes its own plugin repository and a selection between stable point releases or nightly updates. Since March the 5th of 2016, the SDK is not officially supported anymore by the core team. Ever since then it is still being actively maintained by the community. Note: The \\"jMonkeyPlatform\\" and the \\"jMonkeyEngine 3 SDK\\" are exactly the same thing. History jMonkeyEngine was built to fulfill the lack of full featured graphics engines written in Java. The project has a distinct two-part story, as the current core development team includes none of the original creators. =jMonkeyEngine 0.1 ‚Äì 2.0= Version 0.1 to 2.0 of jMonkeyEngine marks the time from when the project was first established in 2003, until the last 2.0 version was released in 2008. When the core developers at that time gradually discontinued work on the project throughout the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, the 2.0 version had not yet been made officially stable. Regardless, the codebase became adopted for commercial use and the community actively supported the 2.0 version more than any other. =jMonkeyEngine 3.0= Since the departure of jME's core developers in late 2008 the codebase remained practically stagnant for several months. The community kept committing patches, but the project was not moving in any clear direction. Version 3.0 started as nothing more than an experiment. The first preview release of jME3 in early 2009 created a lot of buzz in the community, and the majority agreed that this new branch would be the official successor to jME 2.0.

The first public release came January 2, 2009, with new releases following every few months thereafter. In 2011, Ardor3D was used in the Mars Curiosity mission both by NASA Ames and NASA JPL, for visualizing terrain and rover movement. On March 11, 2014, Joshua Slack announced that the project would be abandoned, although the software itself would remain under zlib license and continue to be freely available. However, a subset of Ardor3D called \\"JogAmp's Ardor3D Continuation\\" is still actively maintained by Julien Gouesse.

Founded in 1956, it was named for theologian and Rhode Island cofounder Roger Williams. The school enrolls over 5,000 students and employs over 480 academic staff. History The university‚Äôs operations date to 1919, when Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, opened a branch campus in the YMCA building in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1940, the YMCA Board of Directors began directing the school, and the YMCA Institute granted its first associate's degrees in 1948. In 1956, the Institute received a state charter to become a two-year, degree-granting institution under the name of Roger Williams Junior College. During the 1960s, Roger Williams College began granting bachelor‚Äôs degrees. Needing a larger campus, the college purchased of waterfront land and moved its main campus to Bristol in 1969. (RWU continues to operate a branch campus in Providence.) In 1989 new president Dr. Natale A. Sicuro initiated the Roger Williams Plan for the 90s, and became concurrently the president of the newly established Roger Williams School of Law and, in 1992, led the name change of Roger Williams College to Roger Williams University. RWU celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006. Ioannis Miaoulis was appointed the eleventh president of Roger Williams University in 2019. President Miaoulis previously served as both the President and Director of the Boston Museum of Science since 2003 and brings a champion STEM philosophy to the University as he seeks to guide the University's mission and commitment in providing an outstanding education through community-engaged learning and civic scholarship. In 2012, Roger Williams University initiated a tuition freeze in which all entering freshmen would have a guarantee that their tuition would not increase for the next four years. The university renewed this promise for all freshmen entering in fall of 2015. As a result of this program, enrollment at the university has been steadily increasing, while enrollment at many peer institutions has been decreasing. Academics Roger Williams University enrolls approximately 3,800 undergraduate and 850 graduate students in eight schools. These schools offer more than 50 liberal arts majors and professional degrees, such as law, architecture, construction management, and historic preservation. The university has a student to faculty ratio of 15:1 while almost half of the classes offered have less than 20 students. The largest majors are business, management, and marketing (24%); architecture (10%); security, law enforcement, and related protective services (9%); communication and journalism (8%); and psychology (7%). Roger Williams University has several degree programs that are unique: * Marine Biology program: offers a B.S. in Marine Biology, which is one of about fifteen in the country. * Architecture program: One of a few M. Arch. (Master‚Äôs of Architecture) in a traditional liberal arts environment. The program is the only one of its kind in which architects from leading firms across the country give lectures, critique student work, and bring a professional perspective into the classroom. * Historic Preservation program: the B.S. in Historic Preservation is one of seven offered in the country and the M.S. in Historic Preservation is one of about 35 offered in the country. * Construction Management program: offers a B.S. in Construction Management (CM). RWU's CM majors automatically get a minor in Business. CM program offers one of the top construction degrees in the country as RWU CM students consistently place in top 3 among their peers in regional and national student competitions. Most of these competitions are organized by the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC) and the Design Build Institute of America (DBIA). RWU Construction Management program is accredited by the American Council for Construction Education (ACCE) and a member of ASC's Northeast Region (Region 1). * Law program: Only Juris Doctor available in Rhode Island; offers a Master of Studies in Law (MSL). School of Art, Architecture, and Historic Preservation In 2012, the School of Architecture, Art and Historic Preservation initiated a technology pilot program which led to a partnership with Samsung in the fall of 2013 to install 27-inch touchscreen monitors in classrooms across the university linked to a cloud computing network. Student life Approximately 63% of students live on campus. 88% of the students attend school full-time. About 14% have a family income of less than $40k. 75% of the student population is white, 5% is Hispanic, and 2% is African American; less than 1% of the students are from other races or ethnicities. The university's campus newspaper, The Hawks' Herald, publishes approximately 20 issues per academic year. An FM radio station, WQRI 88.3, plays everything from college alternative to hip hop. The college's 20 varsity athletic teams play at the Division III level as members of the Commonwealth Coast Conference. In 2012, Roger Williams University was named as one of the best colleges for food.

Reputation and campus culture Roger Williams University has been ranked by US News and World Report in the top 25% of regional universities in the northern region of the United States Forbes ranks Roger Williams University as 412 (out of 650) overall in the United States, 288 out of all private colleges, and 149 in the Northeast. According to the US Government‚Äôs College Scorecard, 83% of students return after their first year while the 6-year graduation rate is 62% (both figures are above average). The median earnings of students, 10 years after graduation is $47,200, which is above average. The university established a program in civil discourse, including the journal Reason and Respect, which brought in speakers such as Salman Rushdie, David Gergen, First Minister and Nobel Prize‚Äìwinner David Trimble, Khaled Hosseini, author of Kite Runner, Bob Geldof of Live Aid, and others to campus. The university has established campuses in London and Florence; collaborates with sister institutions in France, Brazil, Vietnam, and Hong Kong; features a broad portfolio of study-abroad opportunities encompassing over 30 countries; and is home to a Center for Macro Projects and Diplomacy, which brings together engineering, architecture, technology, economic development, and international relations for a common purpose. Furthermore, it was recently recognized as a non-governmental member of the United Nations. In January 2009, a group of Communication majors worked to create a catalog of video vignettes on sustainability issues; a portion of that work appeared on the PBS special Planet Forward. One of those students, Kyle Toomey, also appeared on the Planet Forward special, which aired on April 15, 2009.

Typical sugars that participate in glycation are glucose, fructose, and their derivatives. Glycation is the non-enzymatic process responsible for many (e.g. micro and macrovascular) complications in diabetes mellitus and is implicated in some diseases and in aging. Glycation end products are believed to play a causative role in the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus. In contrast with glycation, glycosylation is the enzyme-mediated ATP-dependent attachment of sugars to protein or lipid. Glycosylation occurs at defined sites on the target molecule. It is a common form of post-translational modification of proteins and is required for the functioning of the mature protein. Biochemistry Glycation pathway via Amadori Rearrangement (in HbA1c, R is typically N-terminal valine). Imidazolones (R = CH2CH(OH)CH(OH)CH2OH) are typical glycation products. They arise by the condensation of 3-deoxyglucosone with the guanidine group of an arginine residue. Glycations occur mainly in the bloodstream to a small proportion of the absorbed simple sugars: glucose, fructose, and galactose. It appears that fructose has approximately ten times the glycation activity of glucose, the primary body fuel. Glycation can occur through Amadori reactions, Schiff base reactions, and Maillard reactions; which lead to advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Biomedical implications Red blood cells have a consistent lifespan of 120 days and are accessible for measurement of glycated hemoglobin. Measurement of HbA1c‚Äîthe predominant form of glycated hemoglobin‚Äîenables medium-term blood sugar control to be monitored in diabetes. Some glycation product are implicated in many age-related chronic diseases. Glycation cardiovascular diseases (the endothelium, fibrinogen, and collagen are damaged), Alzheimer's disease (amyloid proteins are side-products of the reactions progressing to AGEs), Long-lived cells (such as nerves and different types of brain cell), long- lasting proteins (such as crystallins of the lens and cornea), and DNA can sustain substantial glycation over time. Damage by glycation results in stiffening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, leading to high blood pressure, especially in diabetes. Glycations also cause weakening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, which may lead to micro- or macro- aneurysm; this may cause strokes if in the brain.

Morgan was built at Mobile, Alabama in 1861-62. She operated in the waters around Mobile from the time of her completion early in 1862 to the close of hostilities. One reference of October 1862 gave her name as Admiral. Morgan, commanded by Commander George W. Harrison, CSN, took an active part in the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. Situated well to the right of the Confederate line of battle as the enemy proceeded up the channel, she was able to deliver a telling broadside raking fire against USS Hartford and others. Toward the end of the engagement, she was pursued by USS Metacomet but succeeded in driving her off. Morgan, attempting to avoid capture, then turned toward shallow water, grounded briefly, but continued on her perilous route and reached the guns at Fort Morgan. She dispatched a boat which effected the destruction of the Union gunboat USS Philippi below the fort. When the Union victory was apparent, Captain Harrison initially wanted to scuttle the ship, but was persuaded by his second in command, Lieutenant Thomas Locke Harrison (no relation) that she could be saved by boldly running the gauntlet up to Mobile. Although hotly pursued and shelled by cruisers for a large part of the 25-mile starlight voyage, she reached the outer obstructions near Mobile at daybreak, and that afternoon was permitted to pass through. Morgan continued to serve in the Mobile area. In April 1865 she participated in the battle off Blakely Island in the last days of the Civil War. Blakely Island is located just off the docks of Mobile between the city and Old Spanish Fort located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. It was commanded by Captain Fry and sustained considerable damage in her final battle, but survived the war. CSS Morgan stood alone between the City of Mobile and the invading Union troops. On May 4, 1865, Commodore Ebenezer Farrand, commanding Confederate Naval Forces in the State of Alabama, ordered the surrender of Morgan to the United States Navy. She was sold the following December.

These ecological effects of biodiversity in turn are affected by both climate change through enhanced greenhouse gases, aerosols and loss of land cover, and biological diversity, causing a rapid loss of biodiversity and extinctions of species and local populations. The current rate of extinction is sometimes considered a mass extinction, with current species extinction rates on the order of 100 to 1000 times as high as in the past. The two main areas where the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function have been studied are the relationship between diversity and productivity, and the relationship between diversity and community stability. More biologically diverse communities appear to be more productive (in terms of biomass production) than are less diverse communities, and they appear to be more stable in the face of perturbations. Also animals that inhabit an area may alter the surviving conditions by factors assimilated by climate. Definitions In order to understand the effects that changes in biodiversity will have on ecosystem functioning, it is important to define some terms. Biodiversity is not easily defined, but may be thought of as the number and/or evenness of genes, species, and ecosystems in a region. This definition includes genetic diversity, or the diversity of genes within a species, species diversity, or the diversity of species within a habitat or region, and ecosystem diversity, or the diversity of habitats within a region. Two things commonly measured in relation to changes in diversity are productivity and stability. Productivity is a measure of ecosystem function. It is generally measured by taking the total aboveground biomass of all plants in an area. Many assume that it can be used as a general indicator of ecosystem function and that total resource use and other indicators of ecosystem function are correlated with productivity. Stability is much more difficult to define, but can be generally thought of in two ways. General stability of a population is a measure that assumes stability is higher if there is less of a chance of extinction. This kind of stability is generally measured by measuring the variability of aggregate community properties, like total biomass, over time. The other definition of stability is a measure of resilience and resistance, where an ecosystem that returns quickly to an equilibrium after a perturbation or resists invasion is thought of as more stable than one that does not. Productivity and stability as indicators of ecosystem health The importance of stability in community ecology is clear. An unstable ecosystem will be more likely to lose species. Thus, if there is indeed a link between diversity and stability, it is likely that losses of diversity could feedback on themselves, causing even more losses of species. Productivity, on the other hand, has a less clear importance in community ecology. In managed areas like cropland, and in areas where animals are grown or caught, increasing productivity increases the economic success of the area and implies that the area has become more efficient, leading to possible long term resource sustainability. It is more difficult to find the importance of productivity in natural ecosystems. Beyond the value biodiversity has in regulating and stabilizing ecosystem processes, there are direct economic consequences of losing diversity in certain ecosystems and in the world as a whole. Losing species means losing potential foods, medicines, industrial products, and tourism, all of which have a direct economic effect on peoples lives. Effects on community productivity * Complementarity Plant species coexistence is thought to be the result of niche partitioning, or differences in resource requirements among species. By complementarity, a more diverse plant community should be able to use resources more completely, and thus be more productive. Also called niche differentiation, this mechanism is a central principle in the functional group approach, which breaks species diversity down into functional components. * Facilitation Facilitation is a mechanism whereby certain species help or allow other species to grow by modifying the environment in a way that is favorable to a co-occurring species.Vandermeer, J. H. 1989. The ecology of intercropping. Cambridge Univ. Press., Cambridge, England. Plants can interact through an intermediary like nitrogen, water, temperature, space, or interactions with weeds or herbivores among others. Some examples of facilitation include large desert perennials acting as nurse plants, aiding the establishment of young neighbors of other species by alleviating water and temperature stress,Turner, R.M., Alcorn, S.M., Olin, G. and Booth, J.A. 1966. The influence of shade, soil, and water on saguaro seedling establishment.Bot. Gaz. 127: 95-102. and nutrient enrichment by nitrogen-fixers such as legumes. * The Sampling Effect The sampling effect of diversity can be thought of as having a greater chance of including a species of greatest inherent productivity in a plot that is more diverse. This provides for a composition effect on productivity, rather than diversity being a direct cause. However, the sampling effect may in fact be a compilation of different effects. The sampling effect can be separated into the greater likelihood of selecting a species that is 1) adapted well to particular site conditions, or 2) of a greater inherent productivity. Additionally, one can add to the sampling effect a greater likelihood of including 3) a pair of species that highly complement each other, or 4) a certain species with a large facilitative effect on other members of the community. =Review of data= Field experiments to test the degree to which diversity affects community productivity have had variable results, but many long-term studies in grassland ecosystems have found that diversity does indeed enhance the productivity of ecosystems. Additionally, evidence of this relationship has also been found in grassland microcosms. The differing results between studies may partially be attributable to their reliance on samples with equal species diversities rather than species diversities that mirror those observed in the environment. A 2006 experiment utilizing a realistic variation in species composition for its grassland samples found a positive correlation between increased diversity and increased production. However, these studies have come to different conclusions as to whether the cause was due more to diversity or to species composition. Specifically, a diversity in the functional roles of the species may be a more important quality for predicting productivity than the diversity in species number. Recent mathematical models have highlighted the importance of ecological context in unraveling this problem. Some models have indicated the importance of disturbance rates and spatial heterogeneity of the environment, others have indicated that the time since disturbance and the habitat's carrying capacity can cause differing relationships. Each ecological context should yield not only a different relationship, but a different contribution to the relationship due to diversity and to composition. The current consensus holds at least that certain combinations of species provide increased community productivity. =Future research= In order to correctly identify the consequences of diversity on productivity and other ecosystem processes, many things must happen. First, it is imperative that scientists stop looking for a single relationship. It is obvious now from the models, the data, and the theory that there is no one overarching effect of diversity on productivity. Scientists must try to quantify the differences between composition effect and diversity effects, as many experiments never quantify the final realized species diversity (instead only counting numbers of species of seeds planted) and confound a sampling effect for facilitators (a compositional factor) with diversity effects. Relative amounts of overyielding (or how much more a species grows when grown with other species than it does in monoculture) should be used rather than absolute amounts as relative overyielding can give clues as to the mechanism by which diversity is influencing productivity, however if experimental protocols are incomplete, one may be able to indicate the existence of a complementary or facilitative effect in the experiment, but not be able to recognize its cause. Experimenters should know what the goal of their experiment is, that is, whether it is meant to inform natural or managed ecosystems, as the sampling effect may only be a real effect of diversity in natural ecosystems (managed ecosystems are composed to maximize complementarity and facilitation regardless of species number). By knowing this, they should be able to choose spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate for their experiment. Lastly, to resolve the diversity-function debate, it is advisable that experiments be done with large amounts of spatial and resource heterogeneity and environmental fluctuation over time, as these types of experiments should be able to demonstrate the diversity-function relationship more easily. Effects on community stability * Averaging Effect If all species have differential responses to changes in the ecosystem over time, then the averaging of these responses will cause a more temporally stable ecosystem if more species are in the ecosystem. This effect is a statistical effect due to summing random variables. * Negative Covariance Effect If some species do better when other species are not doing well, then when there are more species in the ecosystem, their overall variance will be lower than if there were fewer species in the system. This lower variance indicates higher stability. This effect is a consequence of competition as highly competitive species will negatively covary. * Insurance Effect If an ecosystem contains more species then it will have a greater likelihood of having redundant stabilizing species, and it will have a greater number of species that respond to perturbations in different ways. This will enhance an ecosystem's ability to buffer perturbations. * Resistance to Invasion Diverse communities may use resources more completely than simple communities because of a diversity effect for complementarity. Thus invaders may have reduced success in diverse ecosystems, or there may be a reduced likelihood that an invading species will introduce a new property or process to a diverse ecosystem. * Resistance to Disease A decreased number of competing plant species may allow the abundances of other species to increase, facilitating the spread of diseases of those species. =Review of temporal stability data= Models have predicted that empirical relationships between temporal variation of community productivity and species diversity are indeed real, and that they almost have to be. Some temporal stability data can be almost completely explained by the averaging effect by constructing null models to test the data against. Competition, which causes negative covariances, only serves to strengthen these relationships. =Review of resistance and resilience stability data= This area is more contentious than the area of temporal stability, mostly because some have tried generalizing the findings of the temporal stability models and theory to stability in general. While the relationship between temporal variations in productivity and diversity has a mathematical cause, which will allow the relationship to be seen much more often than not, it is not the case with resistance/resilience stability. Some experimenters have seen a correlation between diversity and reduced invasibility, though many have also seen the opposite. The correlation between diversity and disease is also tenuous, though theory and data do seem to support it. =Future research= In order to more fully understand the effects of diversity on the temporal stability of ecosystems it is necessary to recognize that they are bound to occur. By constructing null models to test the data against (as in Doak et al. 1998) it becomes possible to find situations and ecological contexts where ecosystems become more or less stable than they should be. Finding these contexts would allow for mechanistic studies into why these ecosystems are more stable, which may allow for applications in conservation management. More importantly more complete experiments into whether diverse ecosystems actually resist invasion and disease better than their less diverse equivalents as invasion and disease are two important factors that lead to species extinctions in the present day. Theory and preliminary effects from examining food webs One major problem with both the diversity-productivity and diversity-stability debates discussed up to this point is that both focus on interactions at just a single trophic level. That is, they are concerned with only one level of the food web, namely plants. Other research, unconcerned with the effects of diversity, has demonstrated strong top-down forcing of ecosystems (see keystone species). There is very little actual data available regarding the effects of different food webs, but theory helps us in this area. First, if a food web in an ecosystem has a lot of weak interactions between different species, then it should have more stable populations and the community as a whole should be more stable. If upper levels of the web are more diverse, then there will be less biomass in the lower levels and if lower levels are more diverse they will better be able to resist consumption and be more stable in the face of consumption. Also, top-down forcing should be reduced in less diverse ecosystems because of the bias for species in higher trophic levels to go extinct first. Lastly, it has recently been shown that consumers can dramatically change the biodiversity-productivity-stability relationships that are implied by plants alone. Thus, it will be important in the future to incorporate food web theory into the future study of the effects of biodiversity. In addition this complexity will need to be addressed when designing biodiversity management plans.

A town of up to 500 colonial residents had grown up outside the fort; it was laid out following principles of the Oglethorpe Plan for towns in the Georgia Colony. The town was named Frederica, after Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of King George II. The monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. History In the early 18th century, Europeans called the land lying between British South Carolina and Spanish Florida the \\"Debatable Land\\". Today's state of Georgia was then the center of a centuries-old imperial conflict between Spain and Britain. After the philanthropist James Oglethorpe founded the colony of Georgia in 1733, to provide a place where poor debtors could settle, colonists from England and Scotland, and refugees from the German Electorate of the Palatinate built Fort Frederica in 1736 to defend their new territory. They named Frederica for Frederick, Prince of Wales, (1707‚Äì1751). The name was feminized to distinguish it from Fort Frederick in South Carolina. In the 1742 battles of Bloody Marsh and Gully Hole Creek, forces under Oglethorpe successfully repulsed Spanish attempts to invade St. Simons Island. Afterward the Spanish no longer threatened the colony; in 1749 the government disbanded the garrison at Frederica. Soon the village fell into economic decline, and by 1755 it was mostly abandoned. The town survived a fire in 1758, but after a few more years, it was abandoned.para.6 , Dept. of Interior Naturalist William Bartram visited the site in March, 1774. Though it was in ruins he noted that there was still a small garrison there.T. B. BARTOW The Georgia Historical Quarterly Vol. 1, No. 4 (DECEMBER, 1917), pp. 347-349 Fort Frederica was documented and authorized as a National Monument on May 26, 1936, under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression.para.7 During this period, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) sponsored numerous surveys of historic areas and buildings across the country to identify, document and protect the resources for the future, as well as to provide employment. Starting in 1947, the National Park Service and the Ft. Frederica Association, a citizens' interest group, sponsored a series of archaeological investigations at the Frederica site. Using information from 18th-century maps and journals as guides, the archaeologists excavated sections of the fort and village. By correlating the archaeological data with the historic documents and excavating remains of structures, the archaeologists have provided important insight into Frederica's past and colonial history, a complex time of international rivalries. As a historic area under the National Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Fort Frederica is open to the public and admission is free.

It preserves Fort Pulaski; during the American Civil War, the Union Army successfully tested rifled cannon in combat in 1862 there, the success of which rendered brick fortifications obsolete. The fort was also used as a prisoner-of-war camp. The National Monument includes most of Cockspur Island (containing the fort) and all of the adjacent McQueens Island.  Construction  After the War of 1812, US President James Madison ordered a new system of coastal fortifications to protect the United States from a foreign invasion. Construction of a fort to protect the port of Savannah began in 1829 under the direction of Major General Babcock and later Second Lieutenant Robert E. Lee, a recent graduate of West Point. The new fort would be on Cockspur Island, at the mouth of the Savannah River. In 1833, the facility was named Fort Pulaski in honor of Kazimierz Pulaski, a Polish soldier and military commander who fought during the American Revolution under the command of George Washington. Pulaski was a noted cavalryman, played a large role in training Revolutionary troops, and took part in sieges at Charleston and Savannah. Fort Pulaski belonged to what is known as the Third System of coastal fortifications, which were characterized by greater structural durability than the earlier works. Most of the nearly 30 Third System forts built after 1816 still exist along the Atlantic and the Gulf Coasts. Wooden pilings were sunk up to into the mud to support an estimated 25 million bricks. Fort Pulaski was finally completed in 1847, after 18 years of construction and nearly $1 million in construction costs. Walls were 11 feet thick and were thought to be impenetrable except by only the largest land artillery. The smooth bore cannon of the time had a range of only around half- a-mile, and the nearest land (Tybee Island) was much further away than that. It was assumed that the fort would be invincible to enemy attack. Lee remarked that \\"one might as well bombard the Rocky Mountains as Fort Pulaski.\\" Civil War Fort Pulaski used as Confederate prison camp from 1861 to 1862 Col. Charles H. Olmstead Though completed in 1847, Fort Pulaski was under the control of only two caretakers until 1860, when South Carolina seceded from the United States and set in motion the Civil War. Georgia Governor Joseph E. Brown ordered Fort Pulaski to be taken by his state. A steamship carrying 110 men from Savannah traveled downriver, and the fort was seized by the state. After the secession of Georgia in February 1861, the state joined the Confederate States of America, and Confederate troops moved into the fort. By December 1861, Tybee Island was thought to be too isolated and unprepared for conflict and so was abandoned by Confederate forces. This allowed Union troops to gain a foothold across the Savannah River from Fort Pulaski. Union forces, under Quincy A. Gillmore, began constructing batteries along the beaches of Tybee Island. =Confederate fort= =Siege and reduction of Fort Pulaski= Closeup of damage inflicted on Fort Pulaski by Union artillery on Big Tybee Island, April 12‚Äì14, 1862 Wall that was breached and repaired with moat around the fort On the morning of April 10, 1862, Union forces asked for the surrender of the Fort to prevent needless loss of life. Colonel Charles H. Olmstead, commander of the Confederate garrison, rejected the offer. Fort Pulaski was prepared for a possible infantry attack, but it never endured a direct land assault. Using 36 guns, including the new James Rifled Cannon and Parrott rifles, Union troops began the long bombardment of Fort Pulaski. The rifled projectiles could be accurately fired farther (4‚Äì5 miles) than the larger and heavier smoothbore cannonballs. Within 30 hours, the new rifled cannon had breached one of the fort's corner walls. Shells now passed through the fort dangerously close to the main powder magazine. Reluctantly, Colonel Olmstead surrendered the fort. Only two soldiers (one Confederate and one Union) were injured in the attack. Olmstead's decision to surrender haunted him for decades: > We were absolutely isolated beyond any possibility of help from the > Confederate authorities, and I did not feel warranted in exposing the > garrison to the hazard of the blowing up of our main magazine -- a danger > which had just been proved well within the limits of probability....

Gillmore's triumph won him promotion from engineer captain to brigadier general. =Union control= Sign of the southwest magazine in which prisoners were kept in \\"dark confinement\\" Historical marker about General Orders No. 7 Within six weeks of the surrender, Union forces repaired the fort, and all shipping into and out of Savannah ceased. The loss of Savannah as a viable Confederate port crippled its war effort. With the Fort securely in Union control, General David Hunter, commander of the Union garrison issued General Order Number 7, which stated that all slaves in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina were now free. President Abraham Lincoln quickly rescinded the order but later issued his own Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. Fort Pulaski was made a final destination on the Underground Railroad, as slaves throughout the area were freed upon their arrival to Cockspur Island. The garrison of Union soldiers reached 600 during the initial occupation, but as the war dragged on, Southern forces would obviously not be able to retake the fort. The garrison was later reduced to about 250. Late in the war, the fort was turned into a prison for a group of captured Confederate officers known as \\"The Immortal Six Hundred.\\" Thirteen of the men would die at the fort. After the war ended, Fort Pulaski continued briefly as a military and political prison. It would house a Confederate Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War, Assistant Secretary of War as well as three state governors, a senator, and the men who had commanded the fort after it had been taken by the South. Postwar Aerial view of the fort Entrance to Fort Pulaski Between 1869 and 1872 the demilune to the rear of the Fort was covered with powder magazines, and the few gun positions that were left were enlarged for heavier guns. By the turn of the 20th century, the fort began to fall into disrepair. In an effort to save the old fort, the War Department finally declared Fort Pulaski a National Monument on October 15, 1924 by presidential proclamation of Calvin Coolidge. The monument was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. Repairs were then started, and members of the Civilian Conservation Corps arrived on Cockspur Island and began rehabilitation of the fort. Fort Pulaski was opened to the public only for a short time before the beginning of World War II, which would see further use of Cockspur Island as a section base for the US Navy. After the war, Fort Pulaski reverted to the control of the Park Service and was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Fort Pulaski remains open to the public, with a museum opened in the 1980s. In November 2009, Fort Pulaski was used in the filming of Robert Redford's movie The Conspirator, based on the conspiracy involving the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln, most notably as the site for the gallows used to hang Mary Surratt and others. It was used once again in filming the 2012 action comedy horror B-movie Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies for the shooting of scenes in which Lincoln confronts zombies who had overrun a Confederate stronghold.

Cultivation Sweet sorghum has been widely cultivated in the U.S. since the 1850s for use in sweeteners, primarily in the form of sorghum syrup. In the early 1860s, the American Civil War not only disrupted both interstate and maritime commerce but also diverted commodities from civilian to military purchases; these factors rendered some food and fiber supplies, including sugar cane and the sugar and molasses made from it, unreliable and expensive. In particular, the South was under naval blockade by the Union navy, making importation of Caribbean cane sugar and molasses expensive and scarce via blockade running. Under these conditions, some farms grew sweet sorghum for syrup to substitute for cane sugar and molasses, which helped ensconce sweet sorghum in Southern food culture. By the early 1900s, the U.S. produced of sweet sorghum syrup annually. Making syrup from sorghum (as from sugar cane) is heavily labor-intensive. Following World War II, with the declining availability of farm labor, sorghum syrup production fell drastically. Currently, less than are produced annually in the U.S. In Central India it was introduced in the early 1970s by Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute. Presently it is grown on large area as a fodder crop. Most sorghum grown for syrup production is grown in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Uses Horse-driven, antique sorghum-cane juicer being operated at an organic farm in central North Carolina, for syrup production Adding freshly squeezed juice to a simmering pan of syrup on an open fire, much as it was done in the 19th century Madhura sweet sorghum syrup sold in India Sorghum syrup and hot biscuits are a traditional breakfast in the Southern United States. Sorghum syrup is also used on pancakes, cornmeal mush, grits and other hot cereals. It can be used as a cooking ingredient with a similar sweetening effect as molasses, though blackstrap molasses still has a higher nutritional value than sorghum syrup in most regards. In India sweet sorghum syrup is presently being promoted as a health food. In the U.S. since the 1950s, sorghum has been raised primarily for forage and silage, with sorghum cultivation for cattle feed concentrated in the Great Plains (Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska are the leading producers) where insufficient rainfall and high temperature make corn production unprofitable. Grain sorghum has also been used by the ethanol industry for quite some time because it yields about the same amount of ethanol per bushel as corn. As new-generation ethanol processes are studied and improved, sorghum's role may continue to expand. Texas A&M; University ran trials to ascertain the best varieties for ethanol production from sorghum leaves and stalks in the USA.Ceres and Texas A&M; to Develop and Market High-Biomass Sorghum for Biofuels In India and other places, sweet sorghum stalks are used for producing biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into ethanol. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions, as it only extracts one-seventh of the water used by sugarcane. A study by researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers' incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food, feed, and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million ha in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.Sweet sorghum for food, feed and fuel New Agriculturalist, January 2008.

He is considered to be the first white child to be born in the Americas, apart from Greenland. He became an important figure in the Christianisation of Iceland. Name Snorri is an Old Norse name derived from the word snerra, meaning \\"a fight.\\" √ûorfinnsson is a patronymic, meaning \\"son of √ûorfinnr\\", (see Icelandic naming conventions). Snorri was named for his great-grandfather, Snorri √û√≥r√∞arson, or after Snorri √ûorbrandsson who was not a kinsman but a participant in Karsefni's expedition  Family  There is speculation about the birth date of Snorri Thorfinnsson. Birth years such as 1005, 1009, and 1012 have been postulated, but all sources agree that he was born between 1005 and 1013. According to the Vinland sagas, when Snorri was 3 years old, his family left Vinland because of hostilities with indigenous peoples (called Skr√¶lingar by the settlers, meaning \\"barbarians\\"). The family returned to the Glaumb√¶r farm in Seyluhreppur.Glaumb√¶r (Historical Places in Northwest Iceland) Snorri Thorfinnsson had two children; a daughter named Hallfrid, and a son named Thorgeir. Hallfrid was the mother of Thorlak Runolfsson, bishop of Sk√°lholt in the south of Iceland. One of the descendants of Snorri's brother Thorbjorn, Bjorn Gilsson, was also a bishop of H√≥lar. Thorgeir was the father of Yngvild who was the mother of Brand S√¶mundarsson, bishop of H√≥lar. (1983 ed., p.71) The sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen claimed descent from Snorri Thorfinnsson in the 19th century. Christianisation of Iceland In the 13th century texts Snorri Thorfinnsson and Snorri Thorrgrimsson are considered the two main figures responsible for the early Christianisation of Iceland. Consequently, they were portrayed by various writers of the 13th and 14th century as \\"Christian chieftain models\\". According to Gr≈ìnlendinga saga, Snorri had built the first church of Glaumbaer, which would later increase Christian influence in the area. His descendants became the first Bishops of Iceland, and published the first Christian Code of Iceland. Legacy *Snorri Thorfinnsson was purported to be born in Vinland (America), making him the first European child known to be born in the Americas, provided that Greenland is defined as being outside the Americas. *In 2002, American archaeologists discovered the remains of a thousand-year-old longhouse located on Iceland's northern coast. It is believed that it was Snorri Thorfinnsson's farmhouse. The longhouse was found near the Glaumbaer Folk Museum, at the Skagafjordur Heritage Museum outside the coastal village of Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur. The museum was once thought to have been built on the site of Snorri's farmhouse. According to archaeologists it was \\"a classic Germanic fortress longhouse like the Great Hall of Beowulf\\". *There is a non-profit organisation called The Snorri Program that focuses on the history of Icelandic settlers in North America and regularly runs exchange programs for youth and adults. \\"The Snorri Program\\" Genealogy Below is the genealogy of descendants of Snorri, as given in the close of each saga, Gr≈ìnlendinga saga ch. 9 and Eir√≠ks saga ch. 14.The saga texts obviously do not bother to reiterate the patronymic form in nominative case at every instance.

It was provisioned in large part by farmers and ranchers of what is now Mora County (formally created in 1860), including the town of Mora, where the grist mill established by Ceran St. Vrain in 1855 produced most of the flour used at the fort. The fort served as the headquarters of the 8th Cavalry in the early 1870s and as the headquarters of the 9th Cavalry in the late 1870s during the Apache Wars. F. Stanley wrote and published a book titled Fort Union New Mexico in 1953, giving a colorful history of this fort and individuals such as Davey Crockett.Stanley, F. Fort Union (New Mexico). Denver, Colo.: World Press, 1953. Land ownership In its forty years (1851‚Äì1891) as a frontier post, Fort Union had to defend itself in the courtroom as well as on the battlefield. When the United States Army built Fort Union in the Mora Valley in 1851, the soldiers were unaware that they had encroached on private property, which was part of the Mora Grant. The following year Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner expanded the fort to an area of eight square miles by claiming the site as a military reservation. In 1868, President Andrew Johnson declared a timber reservation, encompassing the entire range of the Turkey Mountains (part of the Sangre de Cristo range) and comprising an area of fifty-three square miles, as part of the fort.U.S. Congress, Senate, Committee on Military Affairs, \\"Title to Certain Military and Timber Reservations\\", Senate Report 621, 45th Congress, 3rd Session, 1879, pp. 3-4 The claimants of the Mora Grant immediately challenged the government squatters and took the case to court. By the mid-1850s, the case reached Congress. In the next two decades, the government did not give any favorable decision to the claimants, until 1876 when the Surveyor-General of New Mexico reported that Fort Union was \\"no doubt\\" located in the Mora Grant. But the army was unwilling to move to another place or to compensate the claimants because of the cost. The Secretary of War took \\"a prudential measure\\", protesting the decision of the acting commissioner of the General Land Office. He argued that the military had improved the area and should not give it up without compensation. This stalling tactic worked; the army stayed at the fort until its demise in 1891, not paying a single penny to legitimate owners.

Fossil Butte National Monument is a United States National Monument managed by the National Park Service, located west of Kemmerer, Wyoming, United States. It centers on an extraordinary assemblage of Eocene Epoch (56 to 34 million years ago) animal and plant fossils associated with Fossil Lake‚Äîthe smallest lake of the three great lakes which were then present in what are now Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. The other two lakes were Lake Gosiute and Lake Uinta. Fossil Butte National Monument was established as a national monument on October 23, 1972. Fossil Butte National Monument preserves the best paleontological record of Cenozoic aquatic communities in North America and possibly the world, within the 50-million-year-old Green River Formation ‚Äî the ancient lake bed. Fossils preserved ‚Äî including fish, alligators, bats, turtles, dog-sized horses, insects, and many other species of plants and animals ‚Äî suggest that the region was a low, subtropical, freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated, over about a 2 million-year period.Geologic travel guide from American Geological Institute Geologic formations Yellowstone (upper left), southwest across the state from Devils Tower (upper right). During the Eocene this portion of Wyoming was a sub-tropical lake ecosystem. The Green River Lake System contained three ancient lakes, Fossil Lake, Lake Gosiute, and Lake Uinta. These lakes covered parts of southwest Wyoming, northeast Utah and northwestern Colorado. Fossil Butte is a remnant of the deposits from Fossil Lake. Fossil Lake was long from north to south and wide. Over the two million years that it existed, the lake varied in length and width. Fossil Buttes National Monument contains only 13 square miles () of the 900-square-mile () ancient lake. The ancient lake sediments that form the primary fossil digs is referred to as the Green River Formation. In addition to this fossil-bearing strata, a large portion of the Wasatch Formation, river and stream sediments, is within the national monument. The Wasatch Formation represents the shoreline ecosystem around the lake and contains fossil teeth and bone fragments of Eocene mammals. Among these are early primates and horses. History Coal mining for the railroad led to the settlement of the nearby town of Fossil, Wyoming. When the fossils were discovered, miners dug them up to sell to collectors. In particular, Lee Craig sold fossils from 1897 to 1937. Commercial fossil collecting is not allowed within the National Monument, but numerous quarries on private land nearby continue to produce extraordinary fossil specimens, both for museums and for private collectors. Exhibits The Fossil Butte National Monument Visitor Center features over 80 fossils and fossil casts on exhibit, including fish, a crocodile, turtle, bats, birds, insects and plants. A 13-minute video is shown about the fossils found at the site and what scientists have learned. Interactive exhibits let visitors create fossil rubbings to take home, and a computer program discusses fossils, geology and the current natural history of the monument. Activities During the summer, lab personnel prepare fossils in public. Summer activities also include ranger programs, hikes, paleontology and geology talks, and participation in fossil quarry collections for the park. Stingray prepared by R. Lee Craig (asterotrygon maloneyi). In the collection of Fossil Shack. Prepared circa 1920. A Junior Ranger program can be completed by children aged 5‚Äì12 (with exercises scaled to the child's age) in 3‚Äì4 hours. A highlight is hiking 3/4 mile up the butte to the dig, where interns from the Geological Society of America talk about their excavation and let children help them flake apart sedimentary deposits to discover fish fossils and coprolites.

The installation is located in Montgomery, Alabama, US. Occupying the site of the first Wright Flying School, it was named in honor of Second Lieutenant William C. Maxwell, a native of Atmore, Alabama. The base is the headquarters of Air University (AU), a major component of Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and is the U.S. Air Force's center for Joint Professional Military Education (PME). The host wing for Maxwell-Gunter is the 42d Air Base Wing (42 ABW). The Air Force Reserve Command's 908th Airlift Wing (908 AW) is a tenant unit and the only operational flying unit at Maxwell. The 908 AW and its subordinate 357th Airlift Squadron (357 AS) operates eight C-130H Hercules aircraft for theater airlift in support of combatant commanders worldwide. As an AFRC airlift unit, the 908th is operationally gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC). Gunter Annex is a separate installation under the 42 ABW. Originally known as Gunter Field, it later became known as Gunter Air Force Station (Gunter AFS) when its runways were closed and its operational flying activity eliminated. It was later renamed Gunter Air Force Base (Gunter AFB) during the 1980s. As a hedge against future Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) closure actions, Gunter AFB was consolidated under Maxwell AFB in March 1992 to create a combined installation known as Maxwell/Gunter AFB. Maxwell AFB is also the site of Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery, a minimum security facility for male inmates.  History  =Origins= Toward the end of February 1910, the Wright Brothers decided to open one of the world's earliest flying schools at the site that would subsequently become Maxwell AFB. The Wrights taught the principles of flying, including take-offs, balancing, turns, and landings. The Wright Flying School closed on May 26, 1910. The field served as a repair depot during World War I. In fact, the depot built the first plane made in Montgomery and exhibited it at the field on September 20, 1918. Repair activity at the depot was sharply curtailed at the end of the war. =Interwar years= The Aviation Repair Depot's land was leased by the U.S. Army during World War I, and later purchased on January 11, 1920 for $34,327. Diminished postwar activity caused the U.S. War Department in 1919 to announce that it planned to close thirty-two facilities around the country, including the Aviation Repair Depot. In 1919, the Aviation Repair Depot had a $27,000 monthly civilian payroll, and was a vital part of the city's economy. The loss of the field would have been a serious blow to the local Montgomery economy. The field remained open into the early 1920s only because the War Department was slow in closing facilities. After this initial reprieve, the War Department announced in 1922 that facilities on the original closure list would indeed close in the very near future. City officials were not surprised to hear that Aviation Repair Depot remained on the list, because 350 civilian employees had been laid off in June 1921. left On November 8, 1922, the War Department redesignated the depot as Maxwell Field in honor of Atmore, Alabama native, Second Lieutenant William C. Maxwell. On 12 August 1920, engine trouble forced Lieutenant Maxwell to attempt to land his DH-4 in a sugarcane field in the Philippines. Maneuvering to avoid a group of children playing below, he struck a flagpole hidden by the tall sugarcane and was killed instantly. On the recommendation of his former commanding officer, Major Roy C. Brown, the Montgomery Air Intermediate Depot, Montgomery, Alabama, was renamed Maxwell Field. In 1923, it was one of three U.S. Army Air Service aviation depots. Maxwell Field repaired aircraft engines in support of flying training missions such as those at Taylor Field, southeast of Montgomery. Maxwell Field, as most Army air stations and depots developed during World War I, was on leased properties with temporary buildings being the mainstay of construction. These temporary buildings/shacks were built to last two to five years. By the mid-1920s, these dilapidated wartime buildings had become a national disgrace. Congressional investigations also showed that the manning strength of the U.S. Army's air arm was seriously deficient. These critical situations eventually led to the Air Corps Act of 1926 and the two major programs that dramatically transformed Army airfields. The Air Corps Act changed the name and status of the Army Air Service to the U.S. Army Air Corps and authorized a five-year expansion program. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, this program and its companion, the 1926 Army Housing Program, produced well-designed, substantial, permanent buildings and infrastructure at all Army airfields retained after World War I. Taking up the cause of Maxwell Field was freshman Congressman J. Lister Hill, a World War I veteran who served with the 17th and 71st U.S. Infantry Regiments. He, as well as other Montgomery leaders, recognized the historical significance of the Wright Brother's first military flying school and the potential of Maxwell Field to the local economy. In 1925 Hill, a member of the House Military Affairs Committee, affixed an amendment to a military appropriations bill providing $200,000 for the construction of permanent buildings at Maxwell Field. This amendment did not have the approval of the War Department nor the Army Air Corps, but as a result of this massive spending on Maxwell Field, the War Department kept it open. Hill recognized that to keep Maxwell Field open, it needed to be fiscally or militarily valuable to the War Department. In September 1927, Hill met with Major General Mason M. Patrick, chief of the Army Air Corps, and his assistant, Brigadier General James E. Fechet, to discuss the placement of an attack group at Maxwell Field. Both made it clear that Maxwell Field was too close to Montgomery and was not a suitable location for an attack group. In fact, they asked Hill as \\"a friend of the Air Corps\\" not to \\"embarrass\\" the Corps by asking that the group be placed there. They warned that if he persisted, they would \\"very much oppose\\" the effort. However, General Patrick not wanting to alienate the new and up and coming Congressman (who was also a member of the House Military Affairs Committee) sought to appease Hill by offering to create an observation squadron at Maxwell Field. Hill welcomed the gesture; however, the creation of an observation squadron fell short of the long term on-going mission sought by Hill for Maxwell Field. Hill continued to argue for the attack group to be placed at Maxwell Field. He argued that because of the permanent buildings scheduled to be built, it would be fiscally advantageous for the placement of the attack group at Maxwell Field. Hill's arguments were an extension of ones that had been presented to him by Major Roy S. Brown, former commandant of Maxwell Field from 1922-1925. In 1927, Major Brown was the commander of the Air Corps Tactical School located at Langley Field, Virginia. Major Brown urged Hill to keep his name out of it because of the easily traceable insider information. Hill, frustrated with the lack of positive response from Generals Patrick and Fechet, moved up the chain of command and passed on the correspondence he had with General Fechet to Secretary of War Dwight Davis, Assistant Secretary of War for Air F. Trubee Davison, and Army Chief of Staff Charles P. Summerall. His request to them was given the answer: that they would give the matter \\"full consideration.\\" The depot's first official flying mission was carried out after that. Observation missions originated there in 1927‚Äì1929. Pilots from the field were also involved in completing the first leg of a test designed to establish an airmail route between the Gulf Coast and the northern Great Lakes area. The successful test played a major role in the eventual establishment of permanent airmail service in the Southeast. By early 1928, the decision of basing a new Army Air Corps attack group had come down to Shreveport, Louisiana, and Montgomery. Both cities vied for the federal money to be spent in their respective local areas, but Shreveport the more economically developed city than its counterpart Montgomery won the day. In April 1928 Hill, via his contacts in the War Department, found out that Montgomery would not be getting the attack group. Flexing his congressional muscle, Hill persuaded Assistant Secretary Davidson and now chief of the Air Corps Major General Fechet to hold off the official announcement until Montgomery had a second look by the War Department. During the interim Montgomery leaders had set forth actions to acquire over for Maxwell Field's expansion in hopes of wooing the War Department into placing the attack group in Montgomery. In May 1928 General Benjamin Foulois, General Fechet's assistant, during an inspection visit with Third Army commander General Frank Parker to Maxwell Field mentioned that the Air Corps Tactical School would be moving from Langley Field to a still undecided location. During his stay General Foulois met with local Chamber of Commerce chairman Jesse Hearin and Maxwell Field post commandant, Major Walter R. Weaver. Hearin and Weaver touted the feasibility of Maxwell Field and the Montgomery area for the placement of the attack group at Maxwell Field. However, General Foulois guided the conversation towards the impending movement of the Air Corps Tactical School and he favored Maxwell Field for the new home. Hearin immediately worked up an option on another one thousand acres (4 km¬≤) for the Air Corps Tactical School should Montgomery not be favored with the attack group. In July 1928, word \\"via rumor\\" of the decision for the establishment of an attack group came out that Shreveport was indeed the victor of the final decision. In December 1928, after much debate and political maneuvering it was announced officially by the Assistant Secretary of War that Shreveport would be getting the attack group and that the Army Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) would be coming to Maxwell Field. The move to Maxwell Field from Langley Field was initially expected to increase Maxwell Field's population by eighty officers and 300 enlisted. It was expected that the ACTS would be to the Army Air Corps what Fort Benning, Georgia was to the infantry. On January 15, 1929, it was announced that the ACTS would be twice as large as originally planned. On February 11, it was announced that $1,644,298 had been allowed for ACTS construction. This was not including an additional $324,000 the Secretary of War had approved previously for non- commissioned officer barracks and a school building after a conference with Congressman Hill. On March 12, a conference between a Major Kennedy, Chief of Buildings and Grounds of the Army Air Corps and commandant of the ACTS, and Congressman Lister Hill to determine the locations of the buildings and types of construction. In March 1929, personnel at Maxwell provided flood relief to citizens of Montgomery. This was the first time at which food and supplies were airdropped by U.S. military forces during a major civilian emergency. On July 9, 1929, Captain Walter J. Reed and a battery of attorneys checked titles for the land. The War Department also announced the same day that the plan had changed to where the ACTS would now be four times as large as originally planned with 200 officers and 1,000 enlisted men. At the time, this made Maxwell Field the largest (as far as personnel) Army Air Corps installation in the southeast. Approximately 300 signatures to the deed of the land occupied by the Air Corps Tactical School were signed, of which one was signed by a minor. Chairman of the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce James Hearin said, \\"...several cases had to be taken to court.\\" Despite the obvious rush for signatures, by October 5, deeds to the land were signed and mailed to the War Department. On December 17, 1929, Congressman Lister Hill introduced a bill to appropriate $320,000 for the acquiring of of land in Montgomery County as a part of an expansion program for Maxwell Field. This was a particularly bold move at the time by Hill because of the stock market crash. Effects of the crash had yet to take place; however, the panic caused by the crash had certainly captured Montgomery's attention. Austin Hall was built in 1931 to serve as the Air Corps Tactical School's main building. On January 25, 1930, President Herbert Hoover asked Congress to re-appropriate an additional $100,000 for the main school building at Maxwell Field. President Hoover's policy was to speed public works to offset unemployment. In February 1930, Congressman Hill's resolution was passed in the House of Representatives and were to be added to Maxwell Field for expansion purposes. George B. Ford and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., were hired by the Army Quartermaster Corps and they designed the overall layout of ACTS at Maxwell. Ford used an approach that clustered similar functions together. This technique provided plenty of open space and gave each cluster a distinct appearance. On September 17, 1931, the first ACTS training occurred at Maxwell Field. Forty-one students met at 8:40 a.m. in the operations office conference room for general instruction. Classes were divided into sections, with some pilots sent on check flights, while others were sent out to become familiar with the surrounding countryside to become familiar with emergency landing field locations. On the morning of September 22, 1931, opening exercises of the Air Corps Tactical School were held. On September 24, the Air Corps Tactical School was officially launched. The address was made by Major General James E. Fechet, chief of the Army Air Corps also attending were Congressman Lister Hill and commandant of the Air Corps Tactical School, Major John F. Curry. General Fechet, along with announcing his impending retirement, declared that the forty-one student officers could be future generals of the Air Corps. At a later luncheon, General Fechet also lauded Montgomery's attitude toward the Air Corps. left The 1931-1932 faculty included Army Air Corps (AC), Army Infantry (Inf), Army Chemical Warfare Service (CWS), and Army Field Artillery (FA) instructors. Initially, the school's curriculum reflected the dominating influence of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. Mitchell was a strong believer in the importance of gaining and maintaining air superiority during a conflict. He argued strongly for pursuit (e.g., \\"fighter\\") aircraft in combination with bombers and regarded enemy pursuit forces as the most serious threat to successful bombing operations and felt that the task of American pursuit was not necessarily to escort bombers, but to also seek out and attack enemy fighters. During the first five years of the school's operation, Mitchell's beliefs formed the basis for instruction at the tactical school. However, by the mid-1930s the school's emphasis had shifted from pursuit to bombardment aviation. On July 16, 1933, Congressman Lister Hill secured approval from the War Department for $1,650,075 for immediate spending at Maxwell Field. Hill's request was justified by increased enrollment at the Air Corps Tactical School and the desperate need for employment for the local Montgomery population. At the start of October 1933 bids opened for four construction projects that were to start immediately; 1933-1934 construction at Maxwell Field later employed an average of more than 500 workers. The Air Corps Tactical School opened July 15, 1931. The school evolved into the Army Air Corps (later, U.S. Air Force's) first tactical center until the imminence of American involvement in World War II forced a suspension of classes in June 1940 that resulted in permanent closure of the school. One of the school's notable achievements was its development of two aerial acrobatic teams: the \\"Three Men on a Flying Trapeze\\", put together by then-Captain Claire L. Chennault in 1932, and the Skylarks in 1935. = World War II = left In 1940, it was announced that the installation was to be converted into a pilot-training center. On 8 July 1940 the Army Air Corps redesignated its training center at Maxwell Field, Alabama as the Southeast Air Corps Training Center. The Southeast Air Corps Training Center at Maxwell handled flying training (basic, primary and advanced) at airfields in the Eastern United States. An Air Force Pilot School (preflight) was also activated which instructed Aviation Cadets in the mechanics and physics of flight and required the cadets to pass courses in mathematics and the hard sciences. Then the cadets were taught to apply their knowledge practically by teaching them aeronautics, deflection shooting, and thinking in three dimensions. In June 1941, the Army Air Corps became the U.S. Army Air Forces, and on 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and redesignated the school as the 74th Flying Training Wing (preflight). During following years, Maxwell was home to six different schools that trained U.S. military aviators and their support teams for wartime service. As World War II progressed, the number of required pilot trainees declined, and the Army Air Forces decided not to send more aircrew trainees to Maxwell Field. The following known sub-bases and auxiliaries were constructed to support the flying school: * Passmore Auxiliary Field *Troy Auxiliary Field * Autaugaville Auxiliary Field Maxwell Field 1943 photo pictorial On 31 July 1943, the Southeast Air Corps Training Center was redesignated as the Eastern Flying Training Command. Also in July, the Army Air Forces announced a specialized school for pilots of four-engine aircraft. The first B-24 Liberator landed at the field later that month and in early 1945, B-29 Superfortress bomber training replaced the B-24 program. =Cold War= Training at Maxwell continued until 15 December 1945, when the Eastern Flying Training Command was inactivated and was consolidated into the Central Flying Training Command at Randolph Field, Texas. Air University, an institution providing continuing military education for Army Air Forces personnel, was established at Maxwell in 1946, prior to the U.S. Air Force becoming an independent service the following year. Today, it remains the main focus of base activities at Maxwell. In 1992, the 3800th Air Base Wing (3800 ABW) was disbanded and the 502d Air Base Wing (502 BW) took over as the host wing, which two years later gave way to the current 42d Air Base Wing. As home of the Air University, Maxwell became the postgraduate academic center of the U.S. Air Force. Air University evolved first as an institution influenced by air power as shaped in World War II, then by the Cold War under the threat of nuclear annihilation, and by air power as applied during the Cold War's Korean and Vietnam conflicts. In the early twenty-first century, the emphasis shifted to air power's role in confronting international and transnational terrorism by both state-sponsored and non-state actors. AU grew materially from inadequate quarters, classrooms, and instructional technology into a campus that is as modern and up-to-date as those of any other in the U. S. armed forces. Construction of Maxwell's Academic Circle, Air University's primary education complex, began in the 1950s. Its centerpiece was the Air University Library, eventually one of several major libraries on a military installation. Over the years, other activities were established or relocated to Maxwell AFB, to include Headquarters, Civil Air Patrol - USAF; the Air Force Reserve's 908th Tactical Air Support Group (908 TASG), which evolved into the present day 908th Airlift Wing; the Ira C. Eaker Center for Professional Development; the Air Force Financial Systems Operation office (SAF/FM); the Center for Aerospace Doctrine, Research and Education (CADRE); and the Air Force Historical Research Agency, a support organization and repository for air power scholars and AU students. In 1994, Air Force Officer Training School (OTS) was also relocated from Lackland AFB/Medina Annex, Texas to Maxwell AFB, joining the national headquarters of the Air Force's other non-Academy officer accession source, Air Force ROTC.

It has 383 inhabitants according to the 2006 census, and has an area of 18.94 km¬≤. The municipality was annexed in 1969 by Markina-Xemein and recovered its independence on January 1, 2005. Records indicate its existence since the 11th century. Etymology The name Bolibar comes from the Basque language, meaning \\"windmill valley\\" (bolu = \\"windmill\\" and ibar = \\"valley\\"). Ziortza/Cenarruza is derived from a local name for polygonum ziaurri (historically *zinaurri) and the suffix -tza denoting a place of abundance of something.  Puebla de Bol√≠var  Bol√≠var or Bolibar (in Basque) is the urban centre of the municipality, situated along the stream with the same name, at the foot of Mount Oiz. From 1969 to 2004 it belonged, along with the neighbourhood of Cenarruza (Ziortza in Basque), to the municipality of Markina-Xemein, until a community movement managed to merge both neighbourhoods into an independent municipality. The last name Bol√≠var has its origins in this locality; Sim√≥n Bol√≠var de la Rementer√≠a, a colonist born in this neighbourhood, took it from Europe to the America, where his famous descendant Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, one of the Libertadores of America, made it famous around the world. There are a couple of statues and a museum in his honour; there was a family house in Rementer√≠a, behind the local church, but it does not exist anymore. Other illustrious people from this small village are: Diego de Irusta, who participated in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa; the abbots of the Collegiate church of Cenarruza; Diego and Bernardino de Irusta; general Francisco de Longa, hero of the Spanish Independence War; and general Pedro de Zubiaur. Collegiate Church of Cenarruza Cloister of the Collegiate Church of Santa Mar√≠a de Cenarruza The Collegiate Church of Cenarruza or Ziortza is located roughly two kilometers from the urban nucleus. It was an important enclave in the Route of Santiago de Compostela, and its influence extended beyond the comarca and surpassed the religious scope. Tradition marks its founding in the 10th century. According to legend, on the day of the Assumption in the year 968 the local inhabitants held a mass in the Church of Santa Lucia de Garay, when an eagle picked up a skull from an opened tomb and dropped it in the place where the Collegiate Church is situated today. The people understood this event to be a sign and raised the religious complex in that place. The complex consists of: *The church, originally built in the 14th century but continually rebuilt until it obtained, in the 15th century, the Gothic style it currently has. In its interior there is a magnificent organ, one of the most ancient in Biscay, and a large group of sculptures. The portico has curious carvings in its beams, and the front door has a group of sculptures representing Jesus Christ and two musician angels. *The cloister, built in the Renaissance period. It has a square floor-plan, and the spandrels are decorated with shells and Fleur-de-lis crosses. *The Eastern Gate is the main entrance to the religious complex. It bears the coat- of-arms of the M√∫gica and Butr√≥n families, as well as an image of the legendary eagle holding the skull in its claws. Eagle with a skull in its claws *The Western Gate, smaller than the Eastern one but bearing the same coat-of-arms and the same image of the eagle. There was a hospital for pilgrims that was destroyed in a fire and was subsequently rebuilt as a hostel managed by Cistercian monks and is the property of the monastery of Oliva in Navarra. There are remains of a walkway which formed part of the Santiago Route. Other monuments in Bol√≠var Monument to Sim√≥n Bol√≠var *Church of Saint Thomas, built in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 17th and 18th centuries. It has the structure of a fortress-temple, with only one nave and a rib vault, as well as two cylindrical towers. The altarpiece is neoclassical. *The government of Venezuela erected a monument in honour of the \\"Liberator\\" (Sim√≥n Bol√≠var) in 1927, the first one in Spain.

Colonel Sun is the first James Bond continuation novel published after Ian Fleming's 1964 death. Before writing the novel, Amis wrote two other Bond related works, the literary study The James Bond Dossier and the humorous The Book of Bond. Colonel Sun centres on the fictional British Secret Service operative James Bond and his mission to track down the kidnappers of M, his superior at the Secret Service. During the mission he discovers a communist Chinese plot to cause an international incident. Bond, assisted by a Greek spy working for the Russians, finds M on a small Aegean island, rescues him and kills the two main plotters: Colonel Sun Liang-tan and a former Nazi commander, Von Richter. Amis drew upon a holiday he had taken in the Greek islands to create a realistic Greek setting and characters. He emphasised political intrigue in the plot more than Fleming had done in the canonical Bond novels, also adding revenge to Bond's motivations by including M's kidnapping. Despite keeping a format and structure similar to Fleming's Bond novels, Colonel Sun was given mixed reviews. Colonel Sun was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper from 18 March 1968 to 30 March 1968 and adapted as a comic strip in the same newspaper in 1969‚Äì1970. Elements from the story have been used in the Eon Productions Bond series: The 1999 instalment The World Is Not Enough used M's kidnapping, whilst the villain of 2002 film Die Another Day, Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, owes his name to Colonel Sun Liang-tan. Chapter 19 ('The Theory and Practice of Torture') was adapted for the torture scene in Spectre (2015). Though Blofeld replaced Sun as Bond's tormentor, much of Blofeld's dialogue in the scene was written by Amis for Sun, resulting in an acknowledgement to Amis' estate in the end title credits, though no mention of the book itself. Plot Kidnappers violently take the Secret Service chief M from his house and almost capture James Bond, who is visiting. Intent on rescuing M, Bond follows the clues to Vrakonisi, one of the Aegean Islands. In the process, Bond discovers the complex military- political plans of Colonel Sun of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Sun had been sent to sabotage a Middle East d√©tente conference which the Soviet Union is hosting. He intends to attack the conference venue and use M and Bond's bodies to blame Great Britain for the disaster, leading to a world war. Bond meets Soviet agents in Athens and they realise that not only is a third country behind the kidnap, but that there is a traitor in the organisation. An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek Communist. As he is dying, the Soviet leader encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident. Ariadne persuades Litsas, a former Second World War resistance fighter and friend of her late father, to help them by telling him about the involvement in the plot of former Nazi, Von Richter. Trying to find M and Colonel Sun, Bond is nearly captured by the Russians, but is saved by Litsas. Finally, Bond finds Sun's headquarters, but is knocked out by one of Sun's men; Bond learns that Von Richter will use a mortar to destroy the conference venue and that Bond will be tortured by Sun, before his inevitable demise. Sun tortures him brutally, until one of the girls at the house is ordered by Sun to caress Bond fondly. In the process she cuts one of Bond's hands free and provides him with a knife. She tells Sun that Bond is dead: when examined Bond stabs Sun. He then frees other captives who help Bond stop Von Richter. However Sun survives the stab wound and kills several of the other escapees. Bond tracks down Sun and kills him in the confrontation. The Soviets thank Bond for saving their conference, offering him the Order of the Red Banner for his work, which he politely turns down. Characters and themes The main character of the novel is James Bond. Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson described Amis's Bond as a humourless interpretation of the character that Fleming used in his earlier novels. Benson describes this personality as a natural continuation of the Bond developed in the final three Fleming novels. In all three novels, the events take a toll on Bond: he loses his wife in On Her Majesty's Secret Service; he loses his memory in Japan in You Only Live Twice; and he is brainwashed in Russia, is de-programmed by MI6 and almost dies from Francisco Scaramanga's poisoned bullet in The Man with the Golden Gun. Benson identifies Bond's desire for revenge as a central theme to the novel. The plot centres on Bond's need to avenge the death of the Hammonds and M's kidnapping. Benson describes this as particularly striking: \\"Bond is particularly brutal in achieving his goal ... The revenge is very satisfying. This is Bond at his toughest.\\" Benson considered that M's character evokes an emotional response from the reader because of the change from his usual, business-like manner to a semi-catatonic state upon being kidnapped. However, Amis envisaged something different for the character: he did not like M and, as one reviewer pointed out, in The James Bond Dossier, he had \\"spent a chapter running him down.\\" The main villain of the novel is Colonel Sun Liang-tan. Sun is a member of the Special Activities Committee of the Chinese People's Liberation Army as well as a sadist and skilled torturer. Raymond Benson called him \\"very worthy of inclusion in the Bond saga\\". Raymond Benson notes increased political intrigue in the novel compared to earlier Bond novels. In Colonel Sun, Bond acts in concert with the Russians against the Chinese, which demonstrates one of the main themes of the book: a peacekeeping between nations. Military historian Jeremy Black describes the novel reflecting a shift in the balance of world power away from two-party Cold War politics. To accentuate this idea of Oriental threat, the novel demonstrates a disregard by the Chinese for human life, a position similar to the treatment of the East in Fleming's Dr. No. Black also notes an emotional and social sadness throughout Colonel Sun. The social sadness is a reaction to the culture of modernity and mourning what was being lost in its place. This treatment by Amis is similar to Fleming's nostalgia in describing Paris in \\"From a View to a Kill\\". Background Amis drew upon a holiday in the Aegean islands to create a realistic Greek setting. The original creator of James Bond, Ian Fleming, died in the early morning of 12 August 1964, eight months before the publication of The Man with the Golden Gun. After his death, Glidrose Productions (now Ian Fleming Publications) held the rights to Fleming's works. The company decided to publish two short stories, \\"Octopussy\\" and \\"The Living Daylights\\", on 23 June 1966. As the Bond character could not be copyrighted, and to retain rights in the Bond product, Glidrose decided to commission a sequel. Initially the company approached author James Leasor to write a continuation novel, but he declined. Glidrose then commissioned Amis, who wrote Colonel Sun. Critic and future novelist Sally Beauman noted that it was \\"unusual, not to say unprecedented, for an established author to pick up the torch in this way,\\" though she admits that \\"Bond [is] too big, and too profitable, a property to be placed in the hands of an unknown.\\" Fleming's wife, Ann, did not endorse any further Bond works and disliked Amis, saying that he would create \\"a petit bourgeois red brick Bond\\". In 1965, Amis produced The James Bond Dossier‚Äîa critical analysis of the Bond books under his own name‚Äîand The Book of Bond, a tongue-in-cheek manual for prospective agents, using the pseudonym Lt.-Col. William (\\"Bill\\") Tanner. Amis followed these books with the 1966 novel, The Anti-Death League, which had a plot filled with popular fiction elements and helped Amis prepare for Colonel Sun. Amis and his wife Jane spent September 1965 holidaying on the Greek island of Spetses and Amis used his experiences as the background to the novel. Amis followed a tradition set by Fleming of using the names of people he knew or had met during the researches for his book and Amis drew on the names of people he met in Greece for Colonel Sun. The boat Bond uses‚ÄîThe Altair‚Äîwas the name of the boat Amis and his wife used on holiday, whilst the Bond girl's fictitious colleagues, \\"Legakis\\" and \\"Papadogonas\\" were friends who helped Amis in Greece, whilst the doctor who treats Bond in Chapter two was named after Amis and Jane's own doctor. In a 21 May 1967 letter to Philip Larkin, Amis mentioned that he had already finished writing the Bond novel. Release and reception Jonathan Cape published Colonel Sun on 28 March 1968; the book was 255 pages long and priced at a guinea. The novel sold well ‚Äì journalist and author Eric Hiscock claims that by 1980 it had sold over 500,000 copies worldwide ‚Äì and was listed second best seller in the \\"Books in demand\\" list of the Financial Times for March and April 1968. Harper & Row published the novel in the US on 1 May 1968; the United States edition ran to 244 pages. =Reviews= Colonel Sun was broadly welcomed by the critics, although a number noted that despite Amis's abilities as a writer, Fleming's own persona was missing from the novel. Roger Baker, writing in The Times, noted that from one angle Colonel Sun is a \\"neat, not over-inventive thriller, low on sex, high on violence and more than usually improbable\\"; however, he noted that once the elements of the re-incarnation of Bond and the writing of Kingsley Amis were taken into account, things were different. Baker thought that with Amis writing the story, \\"one might, justifiably, have expected a joyous rejuvenation or at least a devastating detour from the Fleming pattern. We get neither. It is a pale copy.\\" D. J. Enright, writing in The Listener, considered that, in literary terms, Fleming's \\"inheritance has been well and aptly bestowed.\\" He said that \\"Colonel Sun offers apt literary pabulum for Bond's fish-and-chip culture, for his neurotics, alcoholics and suicides. Good dirty fun, once read and soon forgotten\\". Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Simon Gray, unimpressed with the novel, called the Bond in Colonel Sun \\"a chuckle-headed imposter whose arthritic thought processes would be a liability in a 'physical tussle' down at the pub.\\" He went on to comment that the novel only \\"offers the frustrated Bond addict ... a small academic problem, of swiftly passing interest.\\" The Daily Mirror's reviewer, Alexander Muir, considered the book to be \\"an exciting, violent, sadistic and sexy piece of reading matter\\", although, partly because of Amis' abilities as a writer, Colonel Sun \\"is altogether too meticulous and well written ‚Äì Fleming was a hypnotic but slapdash writer. And, at times, I sensed parody. This could be fatal.\\" Writing in The Guardian, Malcolm Bradbury called the novel \\"a reasonable read but no more: neither vintage Fleming nor vintage Amis.\\" Bradbury also noted that \\"it lacks a convincing rhetoric ... and the traditional Fleming frissons emerge only in muted form.\\" Maurice Richardson, reviewing Colonel Sun for The Observer, wrote that when being judged as a thriller, the novel \\"is vigorous, quite exciting, rather disorderly, a bit laboured\\". He went on to say that \\"Some of the action is quite well done and little more preposterous than in the later Flemings. The real trouble is the absence of spontaneous √©lan\\". The reviewer for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Champlin, noted that the novel \\"lacks the garish, outrageous, ridiculous, symbol-witted touch of the original article\\"; despite that, he still enjoyed the novel, commenting that it left \\"intact the reputations of both Messrs. Amis and Fleming.\\" Donald Stanley, writing in Life magazine praised the villain Sun, saying he \\"is the kind of villain to make a Bondophile salivate.\\" In general Stanley praised Amis for emulating \\"the celebrated Fleming Effect\\". Stanley was less convinced by Bond, observing that his \\"essential swinishness is being replaced by some kind of dilute humanism\\". The reviewer for The New York Times noted the reduced numbers of gadgets employed in the book, when compared with the films, that they felt had \\"overshadowed the personality of the secret agent\\"; overall the reviewer felt that \\"Mr. Amis has now given Bond back to the readers.\\" Oberbeck commented that Bond \\"has become a sensitive man-of-ethics who suffers pangs of doubt and remorse over the 'senseless' violence of his profession\\". Oberbeck went on to say that Amis \\"never quite captures the bizzare beat of a Fleming pace\\"; most telling, according to Oberbeck, was that \\"the greatest flaw in Amis' conception of Bond is that he has attempted to transform the consummate spy-hero into something he was never meant to have been: a man with a job\\". Sally Beauman, writing for New York, believed that \\"Amis has all the obvious ingredients for success\\", including \\"an exotic troubled international setting, a beautiful girl, frequent imbibings, and even more frequent killings; and, most imperative, a villain. Yet the book drags and becomes a bore.\\" Beauman complains that the story lacks suspense and that Bond is far too gloomy: he's more like Ingmar Bergman's creations than Ian Fleming's hero. Beauman attributes the novel's failure to the \\"differing characters of the authors.\\" A fiftieth anniversary review in The Guardian called Col. Sun \\"the most repellant racial caricature of all, a descendant of Fu Manchu and other fiendish orientals, noting that \\"Amis channels Fleming . . . as a connoisseur of ethnicities.\\" The review notes that \\"Amis, by March 1968, had already made public his Damascene conversion from left to right, and signed a group letter to the Times titled Backing for US Policies in Vietnam.\\" Adaptations ;Serialisation (1968) Colonel Sun was serialised on a daily basis in the Daily Express newspaper from 18 March 1968 to 30 March 1968. ;Comic strip (1969‚Äì1970) Colonel Sun is the only non-Fleming Bond novel adapted as a comic strip by the Daily Express newspaper. It was adapted by Jim Lawrence and drawn by Yaroslav Horak and published in the Daily Express from 1 December 1969 to 20 August 1970 and was subsequently syndicated worldwide. In December 2005, Titan Books reprinted Colonel Sun and included River of Death, another original James Bond comic strip story published before the Colonel Sun strip in 1969. ;The World Is Not Enough (1999) The kidnap of M was borrowed from Colonel Sun and used as a plot device in the 1999 Bond film The World Is Not Enough. ;Die Another Day (2002) For the 2002 film Die Another Day, Eon Productions wanted to use the name Colonel Sun Liang-tan for the main villain, but when the Fleming estate insisted on royalties for the use of the name, they changed the name to Colonel Tan-Sun Moon. ;Spectre (2015) The 2015 film Spectre features a torture scene which was lifted from Colonel Sun.

Fossils of Hesperosaurus have since 1985 been found in the state of Wyoming and Montana in the United States of America. The type species Hesperosaurus mjosi was named in 2001. It is from an older part of the Morrison Formation, and so a little older than other Morrison stegosaurs. Several relatively complete skeletons of Hesperosaurus are known. One specimen preserves the first known impression of the horn sheath of a stegosaurian back plate. Hesperosaurus was six to seven metres long and two to three tonnes in weight. It was a member of the Stegosauridae, quadrupedal plant-eaters protected by vertical bony plates and spikes. It was closely related to Stegosaurus and was similar to it in having two rows of, possibly alternating, plates on its back and four spikes on its tail end. The plates on its back were perhaps not as tall, but were longer. It possibly had a deeper skull than Stegosaurus. Discovery and species In 1985, fossil hunter Patrick McSherry, at the ranch of S.B. Smith in Johnson County, Wyoming, found the remains of a stegosaur. As he had difficulty securing the specimen due to the hard rock matrix, he sought help from Ronald G. Mjos and Jeff Parker of Western Paleontological Laboratories, Inc. They, in turn, cooperated with paleontologist Dee Hall of Brigham Young University. At first, it was assumed it represented an exemplar of Stegosaurus. However, Clifford Miles, while preparing the remains, recognised that they belonged to a species new to science. Size comparison The type species Hesperosaurus mjosi was named and described in 2001 by Kenneth Carpenter, Clifford Miles, and Karen Cloward. The generic name is derived from the Greek ·ºïœÉœÄŒµœÅŒøœÇ, hesperos, \\"western\\", in reference to its location in the western United States. The specific name honours Mjos who, apart from his involvement in the process of collecting and preparing the holotype, also had a cast of it made, exhibited with the inventory number DMNH 29431 in the Denver Museum of Natural History. The holotype, HMNH 001 (later HMNS 14), was found in the Windy Hill Member, stratigraphic zone 1 of the lower Morrison Formation, dating from the early Kimmeridgian, about 156 million years old. In 2001, it represented the oldest known American stegosaur. It consists of a nearly complete skull and much of the skeleton. It includes the disarticulated elements of the skull, the rear lower jaws, a hyoid, thirteen neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, three sacrals, forty-four tail vertebrae, neck ribs, dorsal ribs, chevrons, a left shoulderblade, a complete pelvis, ossified tendons and ten neck and back plates. The skeleton was partly articulated and, in view of healed fractures, belongs to an old individual. It was obtained by the Japanese Hayashibara Museum of Natural Science at Okayama. Deltopectoral crest of the \\"Lilly\\" specimen From 1995 onward at the Howe-Stephens Quarry in Big Horn County, Wyoming, named after the historic location of the Howe Ranch, once explored by Barnum Brown, and the new owner Press Stephens, Swiss palaeontologist Hans Jacob Siber excavated stegosaur specimens. The first was SMA 3074-FV01 (also SMA M04), a partial skeleton dubbed \\"Moritz\\" after Max und Moritz as an earlier Galeamopus sauropod skeleton from the site had been nicknamed \\"Max\\". In 1996/97, specimen SMA 0018 (also mistakenly referred to as SMA V03) was uncovered, dubbed \\"Victoria\\" after the feeling of victory the exploring team felt when they discovered Allosaurus \\"Big Al Two\\" after the original \\"Big Al\\" had been confiscated as federal property. It represents a rather complete skeleton with skull, also preserving skin and horn sheath impressions. A third specimen was found in 2002: SMA L02, dubbed \\"Lilly\\" after the sisters Nicola and Rabea Lillich assisting the excavations as volunteers. The specimens are part of the collection of the Aathal Dinosaur Museum in Switzerland. At first they were considered Stegosaurus exemplars. In 2009, initially only \\"Moritz\\" and \\"Lilly\\" were reclassified as cf. Hesperosaurus mjosi. In 2010, \\"Victoria\\" was referred to Hesperosaurus mjosi by Nicolai Christiansen and Emanuel Tschopp. Carpenter had originally concluded that Hesperosaurus was a rather basal stegosaur. However, Susannah Maidment and colleagues in 2008 published a more extensive phylogenetic study in which it was recovered as a derived form, closely related to Stegosaurus and Wuerhosaurus. They proposed that Hesperosaurus should be considered a species of Stegosaurus, with Hesperosaurus mjosi becoming Stegosaurus mjosi; at the same time Wuerhosaurus was renamed into a Stegosaurus homheni. Carpenter, considering the problem more of a philosophical than a scientific nature, in 2010 rejected the synonymy of Hesperosaurus with Stegosaurus stating that in his opinion Hesperosaurus was sufficiently different from Stegosaurus to be named a separate genus. Christiansen in 2010 judged likewise. In 2017, Raven and Maidment recognized both Miragaia and Hesperosaurus as genera distinct from Stegosaurus. In 2015, additional specimens were reported: a concentration of at least five individuals discovered at the JRDI 5ES Quarry near Grass Range, Montana, and two individuals found in the Meilyn Quarry at Como Bluff.> In 2018, new specimen of H. mjosi was described from Montana. Description Hesperosaurus is a large stegosaurid. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at 6.5 meters (21.3 ft), the weight at 3.5 tonnes (3.86 short tons). In 2012 Thomas Holtz gave a lower estimation of 5 meters (16 ft) and a weight range of 454-907 kg (1.000-2.000 lbs). Skeleton in front view In 2001 Carpenter provided a diagnosis. Due to his conclusion that Hesperosaurus were rather basal, in it many comparisons were made with the basalmost known stegosaurian Huayangosaurus, that lost their relevance once it became clear that the phylogenetic position was in fact quite derived. In 2008 Maidment indicated three autapomorphies: the possession of eleven back vertebrae; the fourth sacral not being fused to the sacrum; back plates that are longer (from front to rear) than tall. Maidment also provided some traits in which Hesperosaurus was more basal than Stegosaurus armatus. In the atlas, even in adult specimens the neural arches are not fused to the intercentrum. The postzygapophyses, the rear joint processes, of the rear neck vertebrae do not prominently protrude upwards. In the back vertebrae, the neural arches, above the level of the neural canal, are not especially lengthened to above. At the hip region ossified tendons are present. The ribs are expanded at their lower ends. The neural spines of the tail vertebrae are not bifurcated. The lower end of the pubic bone is expanded (spoon-shaped in side view). To Carpenter this differential diagnosis was problematic because he considered Stegosaurus armatus, the type species of Stegosaurus, a nomen dubium and rejected Maidment's lumping of all North-American Stegosaurus material into a single species, the great variability of which making it difficult to establish any differences with Hesperosaurus. He considered Stegosaurus stenops, the name historically given to several well-preserved specimens, a separate species and provided a new differential diagnosis of Hesperosaurus compared to S. stenops. The antorbital fenestra is large instead of very small. The maxilla is short and deep, half as tall as long, instead of having a height a third of the length. The basisphenoid of the lower braincase is short instead of long. Thirteen neck vertebrae are present instead of ten. Thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae are present instead of seventeen. The middle dorsals have a basal form in possessing a low neural arch rather than a high one. The cervical ribs have expanded lower ends. In the front tail vertebrae, the tops of the neural spines are rounded instead of bifurcated. The front edge of the shoulderblade is indented instead of running parallel to the rear edge. The front blade of the ilium diverges strongly sideways instead of weakly. The rear blade of the ilium has a knob-shaped expansion at the rear end. The front end of the prepubic process has an upward expansion. The plates of the hip and tail base are oval and low instead of high and triangular. Restoration The various published descriptions of Hesperosaurus contradict each other because of changes and differences in interpretation. Originally, Carpenter reconstructed the disarticulated skull elements into a very convex head, modelling it on the shape of Huayangosaurus. The discrepancies in the vertebral count are caused by applying different criteria to the problem whether (and which) cervicodorsal vertebrae should be considered part of the neck or the back. The exact shape of the plates is hard to determine due to erosion. Paul considered the neck plates to be low, but the back plates as taller. Also the Aathal specimens are as yet undescribed. A complete description of the entire material is in preparation by Oct√°vio Mateus. The number of maxillary teeth were twenty per side, lower than the number with Stegosaurus. Carpenter described them as similar to the teeth of Stegosaurus, though somewhat larger. Peter Malcolm Galton in 2007 established some differences: there are rough vertical ridges present on the upper part of the crown, one per denticle; the fine grooves on the tooth surface are weakly developed. =Osteoderms and skin impressions= \\"Thagomizer\\" Carpenter in 2001 identified ten plates as part of the holotype. He described them as long and low. Asymmetrical bases would indicate that they ran in two rows. The end of the tail bore a \\"thagomizer\\" of two pairs of spikes, the front pair being thicker, the rear pair thinner and more horizontally directed to behind. In 2012, an histological study concluded that these osteoderms, skin ossifications, of Hesperosaurus are essentially identical in structure to those of Stegosaurus. CAT-scans showed that the plates have thin but dense outer walls, filled with thick spongy bone. The bone shows signs of having been remodelled during a metaplastic growth process. Extensive long and wide arterial canals were visible. The spikes have thicker walls and the hollows in the spongy interior are smaller. A single large blood vessel ran along the longitudinal axis of the spike. In 2010, a study was published on the soft parts visible with the \\"Victoria\\" specimen. It preserves both true impressions of the skin into the surrounding sediment, and natural casts, where the spaces left behind by the rotting of the soft body parts have been filled in with sediment. Additionally on some areas a black layer is present, possibly consisting of organic remains or bacterial mats. A part of the lower trunk flank shows rows of small hexagonal, non-overlapping, convex scales, two to seven millimetres in diameter. Higher on the flank two rosette structures are visible with larger central scales, one being twenty by ten millimetres in size, the other ten by eight millimetres. Apart from the scales, an impression of the lower side of a back plate has been found, covering about two hundred square centimetres. This shows no scales but a smooth surface with low parallel vertical ridges. As it is a true impression, with the life animal grooves would have been present. These grooves would have been about half a millimetre deep and stood about two millimetres apart. The impression probably represented the horn sheath of the plate, as would be confirmed by vertical traces of veins. It is the first direct proof of such sheaths with any stegosaurian. The study considered the presence of a sheath to be a strong indication that the plate had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate as a whole and provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly coloured. Thermoregulation, on the other hand ‚Äî another often assumed r√¥le of the plates ‚Äî would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the horn covering. Phylogeny Life restoration with Othnielia In 2001 Carpenter performed a cladistic analysis showing that Hesperosaurus was rather basal and related to Dacentrurus: Carpenter was aware that his analysis was limited in scope. More extensive phylogenetic studies by Maidment recovered Hesperosaurus as a very derived stegosaurid, and the sister species of Wuerhosaurus. The position of Hesperosaurus in the stegosaurid evolutionary tree according to a study from 2009 is shown by this cladogram: In a 2019 re-evaluation of dacentrurine stegosaurids, Costa and Mateus suggested that, based on their revised diagnosis for the clade Dacentrurinae, Hesperosaurus appears to heave been closely related to Dacentrurus after all, though they refrained from formally re-assigning it to that group pending the completion of an expanded phylogenetic analysis. Paleobiology Wide and tall plate morphs In 2015, a study by Evan Thomas Saitta based on the finds in the JRDI 5ES Quarry concluded that Hesperosaurus showed sexual dimorphism. Plates found in the quarry came in two types: a taller one, and a low broad one. Though the back plates of the various individuals were not articulated, Saitta managed to order them into cervical, dorsal and caudal series for each type. This seemed to show that some individuals had tall plates exclusively while others bore broad plates only, which was confirmed by earlier specimens also possessing plates of one kind. Saitta suggested that the tall plates typified the females, while the males were equipped with low plates. The findings of the study were questioned by palaeontologists Kevin Padian and Kenneth Carpenter although no formal scientific studies were published as a rebuttal.

Life He was born at Great Snoring, Norfolk. From Eton College he passed to Queens' College, Cambridge, and was elected a scholar of King's College, Cambridge in April 1632, and a fellow in 1634. On taking orders in 1639 he was collated to the Salisbury prebend of Nether-Avon. In 1640 he was appointed chaplain to the lord-keeper Finch, by whom he was presented to the living of Thorington in Suffolk. In the Civil War he acted as chaplain to George Goring's forces in the west. In 1654 he was made weekly preacher at St Clement's, Eastcheap, in London. With Peter Gunning he disputed against two Roman Catholics, John Spenser and John Lenthall, on the subject of schism, a one-sided account of which was printed in Paris by one of the Roman Catholic disputants, under the title Scisme Unmask't (1658). Pearson also argued against the Puritan party, and was much interested in Brian Walton's polyglot Bible. In 1659 he published in London his celebrated Exposition of the Creed, dedicated to his parishioners of St Clement's, Eastcheap, to whom the substance of the work had been preached several years before. For example, in relation to the Christian cross, he wrote in his commentary on the Apostles' Creed that the Greek word stauros originally signified \\"a straight standing Stake, Pale, or Palisador\\", but that, \\"when other transverse or prominent parts were added in a perfect Cross, it retained still the Original Name\\", and he declared: \\"The Form then of the Cross on which our Saviour suffered was not a simple, but a compounded, Figure, according to the Custom of the Romans, by whose Procurator he was condemned to die. In which there was not only a straight and erected piece of Wood fixed in the Earth, but also a transverse Beam fastned unto that towards the top thereof\\".Pearson, John (1715) [1659]. https://books.google.com/books?id=xigOAAAAQAAJ&pg;=PA203&dq;=Pearson+stake+procurator&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=Hd22U_LaE5Pe7Ab3o4CABQ&redir;_esc=y#v=onepage&q;=Pearson%20stake%20procurator&f;=false An Exposition of the Creed (10th ed.). London: W. Boyer. p. 203. Soon after the Restoration he was presented by Juxon, Bishop of London, to the rectory of St Christopher-le-Stocks; and in 1660 he was created doctor of divinity at Cambridge, appointed a royal chaplain, prebendary of Ely, archdeacon of Surrey, and Master of Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1661 he was appointed Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity; and on the first day of the ensuing year he was nominated one of the commissioners for the review of the liturgy in the conference held at the Savoy. There he won the esteem of his opponents and high praise from Richard Baxter. On 14 April 1662 he was made Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1667 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society. Upon the death of John Wilkins in 1672, Pearson was appointed bishop of Chester. He died at Chester on 16 July 1686, and is buried in Chester Cathedral. Theology According to Margaret Drabble, Pearson was one of the most erudite theologians of his age. Pearson's Exposition of the Creed, is considered as one of the best production of English dogmatic theology. His soteriological views are discussed among scholars: Nicholas Tyacke have noted that Pearson, maintained the Arminian view of conditional election, in his Lectiones de Deo et Attributis (1660). On the other hand, Jake Griesel and Stephen Hampton have observed that Pearson upheld a Calvinist position on the doctrines of election and grace both in his Exposition (1659) and his Cambridge lectures, and did so explicitly against the Arminians or Remonstrants (contra Remonstrantes, sive eos quos Arminianos vocant).Cf. John Pearson, The Minor Theological Works of John Pearson, ed. Edward Churton, vol. 1 (Oxford, 1844), 243‚Äì67; idem, An Exposition of the Creed, 4th ed.

Also in 1659 was published his Exposition of the Creed in which the lectures which were given at the church of St Clement, Eastcheap, London, were included. (The notes are a rich mine of patristic learning.) In 1672 he published at Cambridge Vindiciae epistolarum S. Ignatii, in 4to, in answer to Jean Daill√©. His defence of the authenticity of the letters of Ignatius has been confirmed by J. B. Lightfoot and other scholars. In 1682 his Annales cyprianici were published at Oxford, with John Fell's edition of Cyprian's works. His last work, the Two Dissertations on the Succession and Times of the First Bishops of Rome, formed with the Annales Paulini the principal part of his Opera posthuma, edited by Henry Dodwell in 1688. See the memoir in Biographia Britannica, and another by Edward Churton, prefixed to the edition of Pearson's Minor Theological Works (2 vols., Oxford, 1844).

It summarizes the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin tenets in eight chapters with a total of around 600 verses. The text was widely respected and used by schools of Buddhism in India, Tibet and East Asia. Vasubandhu wrote a commentary to this work called the Abhidharmako≈õabhƒÅsya. In it, he critiques the interpretations of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins, VaibhƒÅ·π£ikas and others of the tenets he presented in his previous work from a SautrƒÅntika perspective.Gold, Jonathan C., \\"Vasubandhu\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . This commentary includes an additional chapter in prose refuting the idea of the \\"person\\" (pudgala) favoured by some Buddhists of the Pudgalavada school. However, later SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin master Samghabhadra considered that he misrepresented their school in the process, and at this point designated Vasubandhu as a SautrƒÅntika (upholder of the sutras) rather than as an upholder of the Abhidharma. Chapters An English translation of the chapter titles, including the title of the 9th chapter of Vasubandhu's commentary, is: ::1: The DhƒÅtus ::2: The Indriyas ::3: Reality of Suffering ::4: Reality of Origin of Suffering ::5: The Latent Defilements ::6: The Paths and Persons ::7: Wisdom ::8: The Absorptions ::9: Refutation of the Pudgala Karma Chapter four of the Ko≈õa is devoted to a study of karma, and chapters two and five contain formulation as to the mechanism of fruition and retribution. This became the main source of understanding of the perspective of early Buddhism for later MahƒÅyƒÅna philosophers. Vasubandhu elaborates on the causes and conditions involved in the production of results, karma being one source of causes and results, the \\"ripening cause\\" and \\"ripened result.\\"Berzin, Alexander. \\"Causes, Conditions, and Results.\\" Generally speaking, the conditions can be thought of as auxiliary causes. Vasubhandhu draws from the earlier SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin Abhidharma treatises to establish an elaborate Buddhist etiology with the following primary components: Six Causes: * Acting causes ‚Äì all phenomena, other than the result itself, which do not impede the production of the result. This includes (a) potent acting causes, such as a seed for a sprout, and (b) impotent acting causes, such as the space that allows a sprout to grow and the mother or the clothes of the farmer who planted the seed. * Simultaneously arising causes ‚Äì causes that arise simultaneously with their results. This would include, for instance, characteristics together with whatever it is that possesses the characteristics. * Congruent causes ‚Äì a subcategory of simultaneously arising causes, it includes causes share the same focal object, mental aspect, cognitive sensor, time, and slant with their causes‚Äîprimarily referring to the primary consciousness and its congruent mental factors. * Equal status cause ‚Äì causes for which the results are later moments in the same category of phenomena. For example, one moment of patience can be considered the cause of the next moment of patience. * Driving causes ‚Äì disturbing emotions and attitudes that generate other subsequent disturbing emotions and attitudes in the same plane of existence, though the two need not be of the same ethical status. * 'Ripening cause - the karmic cause or efficacy. Four Conditions * Causal conditions - corresponds to five of the six causes, excepting the kƒÅra·πáahetu, which corresponds to the three conditions below * Immediately preceding conditions - a consciousness which precedes a sense or mental consciousness without any intervening consciousness and which produces the subsequent consciousness into an experience-ready entity * Focal condition - or \\"object condition\\" - an object which directly generates the consciousness apprehending it into having its aspect, e.g. the object blue causes an eye consciousness to be generated into having the aspect of blue * Dominating condition Five Types of Results: * Ripened results - karmic results. * Results that correspond to their cause - causally concordant effects * Dominating results - the result of predominance. All conditioned dharmas are the adhipatiphala of other conditioned dharmas.A Study of Dependent Origination: Vasubandhu, Buddhaghosa, and the Interpretation of Pratƒ´yasamutpƒÅda. by Susan C. Stalker Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania, 1987 pg. pg 25 * Man-made results - a result due to the activity of another dharma * Results that are states of being parted - not actually a result at all, but refers to the cessation that arises from insight.

The population in 2011 was 704,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 12.80 km¬≤.Eurostat Geography =Physical geography= The parish of Cinco Ribeiras is situated on the southwest coast of the island of Terceira, occupying a roughly trianglur swath from the coast to the summit of the volcano of Santa B√°rbara in the island's interior. It is an area of approximately , that reaches an altitude of above sea level. It is bordered on the east by the civil parish of S√£o Bartolomeu de Regatos and west by the parish of Santa B√°rbara das Nove Ribeiras, as well as, along a short frontier to the north, with the parish of Altares. The parish's southern coast is formed from a high arriba, marked by its only major geological structure, the Ponta das Cinco, a rocky spur formed by a basaltic dike that penetrated one of the radial faults, along the Serra de Santa B√°rbara. Yet, running through the region are several smaller volcanic cones composed of black or red basaltic rock. The lower part of the parish developed along a planar zone that corresponds with the terminal area of basaltic fissural flows from the region of Pico da Bagacina, resulting in a gently sloping area towards the northwest. This area is occupied by relatively recent lava flows, with little evidence of pyroclastic eruptive material, translating into shallow soils and rocky covering. Towards the west and interior, the slope gradually increases, passing into a transition zone towards the cone of the Serra de Santa B√°rbara. The highest part of the parish, the apex of the administrative frontier corresponds to the watercourses that divide the ravines of Praia da Vit√≥ria and Cinco Ribeiras, an area of accentuated slopes, reaching the summit of the caldera of Santa B√°rbara (the highest point on the island of Terceira). Apart from this volcano, the parish is little accented, with only the Pico da Praia, at above sea level, representing the highest altitude in the parish. Cinco Ribeiras is crossed by three primary ravines: the Ribeira do Mouro, the Ribeira das Cinco and the Ribeira da Praia, that are part of the radial drainage system, of the Santa B√°rbara Massif. =Climate= Situated along the southwest of the Serra de Santa B√°rbara, the parish occupies a transition zone between oceanic and Mediterranean climate (on the K√∂ppen-Geiger classification between Csb, on the lower areas, and Cfb, on higher altitudes), exposed to strong southwest winds, resulting in elevated humidity during periods of atmospheric instability, intense orthographic precipitation in the higher altitudes. Precipitation along the massif results in flooding along the shallow ravines, which are unable to transport the water that flows from the higher altitudes. =Human geography= { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:left;\\"  } Urban development, much like the other settlements of Terceira, is constituted by a linear structure, that follows the main roadway that circles the island, with little expansion into the fields. The lateral roads normally accompany the ravines, except for the area between Ribeira do Mouro and Ribeira das Cinco, where smaller urban agglomerations developed along the municipal road of Canadinhas, the circuits above the Regional Roadway to connect Cinco Ribeiras and Terra Ch√£ (through S√£o Bartolomeu de Regatos). Another nucleus in development, constituted by primarily summer homes, developed around the porto of Cinco Ribeiras, circling the small hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Lurdes, in addition to a few homes in the Canada do Porto alongside. Following the 1991 census the parish included 650 inhabitants (138 males and 114 female residents), included in the localities referred to as Ribeira das Cinco (51 inhabitants), Ribeira do Mouro (84 inhabitants) and Cinco Ribeiras (418 inhabitants). The population decreased during the 20th century, from its apex of 1180 residentes around 1900. The evolution of the parish has been marked by emigration, primarily to Brasil, then the United States and finally to Canada. During the 20th century, the population maintained stable until the middle of the 1960s; then, following facilitated emigration laws and the consequence of the Kennedy- Pastore Act, the population began a rapid decline until it stabilized following the Carnation Revolution. Architecture The traditional architecture of Cinco Ribeiras resembles much of the rural homes of the western Terceira region, and is generally constructed around a single floor. The settlement is also distinguished for its many white-washed homes, bordered by multi-coloured trim around the corners, doors and windows (unique for the island of Terceira). * Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar () * Imp√©rio of Holy Spirit of Cinco Ribeiras References ;Notes Category:Parishes of Angra do Hero√≠smo ","title":"Cinco Ribeiras"},{"id":"1250903","text":"Abertzale (; English: \\"patriot\\", literally \\"fond of the fatherland\\") is a Basque term usually referring to people or political groups who are associated with Basque nationalism.

The term ezker abertzalea (abertzale left) is used to refer to parties or organisations which are Basque nationalist, but at the same time, left-wing. This may be marxist, communist, socialist or social-democratic. The term is used to distinguish these organisations from the usual traditionalist or conservative character of the Basque Nationalist Party.

Born to a Lutheran pastor in Hanover, in 1819 Lehzen entered the household of the Duke of Kent, fourth son of King George III. Five years later, Lehzen was appointed governess to his only child, Princess Alexandrina Victoria. The young princess became second-in-line to the British throne in 1827. Victoria's upbringing was dominated by the controlling Kensington System, implemented by the now widowed Duchess of Kent and her comptroller Sir John Conroy. Lehzen was strongly protective of Victoria, and encouraged the princess to be strong, informed, and independent from the Duchess and Conroy's influence, causing friction within the household. Attempts to remove the governess were unsuccessful, as Lehzen had the support of Victoria's royal uncles. \\"Dear, good Lehzen\\" soon came to supersede all others ‚Äì including her own mother ‚Äì in Victoria's eyes. When Victoria became queen in 1837, Lehzen served as a sort of unofficial private secretary, enjoying apartments adjacent to Victoria. The queen's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 led to significant changes in the royal household. Albert and Lehzen detested each other, and after an illness of the princess royal in 1841, Lehzen was dismissed. Her close relationship with the queen came to an end, although the two continued to correspond. Lehzen spent her final years in Hanover on a generous pension, dying in 1870. Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character, in particular giving her the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and life as a young queen. Family and early life Johanna Clara Louise Lehzen was born in the Kingdom of Hanover on 3 October 1784, the youngest of ten children born to the Lutheran pastor Joachim Friedrich Lehzen and his wife Melusine Palm. Forced by circumstances to work for her living since she was young, Lehzen was employed by an aristocratic German family von Marenholtz. She served as governess to the family's three daughters, and earned positive references. Based on these references, Lehzen became part of the household of Princess Victoria, Duchess of Kent in December 1819. In that role, she held the position of governess to twelve-year-old Princess Feodora of Leiningen, the daughter of the princess from her first marriage. In her second marriage, Princess Victoria had married Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, who was, at the time, fourth in line for the British throne. Lehzen and the entire household were moved to England in 1817 so that the new Duchess of Kent's child might be born there, strengthening the child's claim to the throne. The baby was a girl, christened Alexandrina Victoria after her mother and her godfather, Alexander I of Russia; she would grow up to be Queen Victoria. Tutor to Princess Victoria Princess Victoria with her spaniel Dash in a painting by George Hayter, 1833 The Duke of Kent died quite suddenly in 1820, followed quickly by his father, King George III. Victoria's uncle, the Prince Regent, ascended the throne as King George IV. Victoria was now third in line to the throne, after her uncles the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence, both of whom were well past middle age and neither of whom had legitimate heirs. As the likely eventual heir, Victoria had to be educated accordingly. Feodora was now 14, and no longer required the services of a governess. After the dismissal of nursemaid Mrs. Brock, Lehzen ‚Äì as she was always known in the household ‚Äì took over five-year-old Victoria's care in 1824. The Duchess and her comptroller, John Conroy made the appointment not only because Lehzen was German (rather than English), but also because they believed she was unlikely to operate independently of their wishes. The historian Christopher Hibbert describes Lehzen as \\"a handsome woman, despite her pointed nose and chin, clever, emotional, humourless.\\" Though she at first feared Lehzen's stern manner, \\"dear, good Lehzen\\" soon came to occupy a place in Victoria's heart that superseded all others, including her own mother, the Duchess of Kent. Lehzen encouraged the princess to distrust her mother and her mother's friends, and to maintain her independence. The governess was uninterested in money and lacked ambition for herself, instead choosing to devote her time and energy to the princess. Victoria took to calling Lehzen \\"Mother\\" and \\"dearest Daisy\\" in private, writing Lehzen was \\"the most affectionate, devoted, attached, and disinterested friend I have.\\" As part of the controlling Kensington System devised by Conroy, after 1824 Victoria was to be accompanied by Lehzen at all times during the day; consequently Lehzen was not allowed out to leave Victoria's side until the Duchess dismissed her at nighttime, and was required to hold the princess' hand when Victoria descended a staircase. =Baroness Lehzen= In 1827, the Duke of York died, making the Duke of Clarence heir presumptive, and Victoria second-in-line to the throne. King George IV expressed doubt that Lehzen was the proper candidate to prepare Victoria. In response, her mother and Conroy persuaded the king to award them both titles, so that the princess would not be surrounded by commoners; Lehzen became a baroness of the Kingdom of Hanover. George IV died in 1830, and was succeeded by his brother the Duke of Clarence, who became King William IV. William formally recognised Victoria as his heir presumptive. According to Lehzen, around this time an infamous scene took place, in which Lehzen slipped a copy of the genealogy of the House of Hanover into one of the princess's lesson books. After perusing it for some time, Victoria came to see that her father had been next in line after the king, and that Queen Adelaide had no surviving children. This was the first time Victoria came to realise the destiny that had been assumed by many since her birth; that she would be the next British monarch. After a pause, Victoria is reported to have said \\"I will be good.\\" This story entered into folk legend for future English generations. King William appointed his friend, the Duchess of Northumberland, as Victoria's official governess in 1831, but the role was mostly ceremonial, and the princess continued to depend on Lehzen. The Duchess was dismissed in 1837 by Victoria's mother for attempting to become more influential in her royal charge's education. During this time, Lehzen held no official position at court; despite her recently acquired title, her commoner status continued to be a hindrance. =Educating Victoria= The wish of the Duchess and Conroy to keep Victoria dependent on their will was circumvented by Lehzen, who wanted her charge to become a strong, informed woman. As Victoria grew older, attempts were made by Conroy and the Duchess for Lehzen's removal, or at least the lessening of her influence. Such tactics proved unsuccessful, as the princess became more devoted to Lehzen than before, as evident in her journals. Lehzen's only true friend in the household, Baroness Spath, had been suddenly dismissed in 1828 on the orders of Conroy; rumours abounded that the baroness witnessed \\"familiarities\\" between him and the Duchess. Members of George IV's court speculated that Lehzen would be the next to leave, but she remained silent on the issue and preserved her position. In 1835, the Duchess of Kent wrote her daughter a stern letter demanding that Victoria develop a more formal and less intimate relationship with Lehzen. The same year (in which Victoria turned sixteen), plans to dismiss Lehzen fell apart after she devotedly nursed Victoria through a five-week illness. Lehzen aided a weakened Victoria in her refusal to sign a document prepared for her by Conroy and the Duchess that would guarantee him a position when she became queen. During her tenure, Lehzen had the support of George IV, William IV, and another of Victoria's uncles, Leopold I of Belgium, who all believed that she was vital to the princess' health, happiness, and continued resistance to Conroy's influence. The education Victoria received from Lehzen was rudimentary but solid. Contrary to the prevailing attitudes of the time, Lehzen, tutor Dr. George Davys, and others successfully encouraged Victoria to enjoy acquiring knowledge. Davys was put in charge of the \\"solid department of her studies\\", while Lehzen concentrated on the \\"more ornamental departments\\", such as dancing. Gaining an \\"enlightened education\\", the princess learned to speak French, German, Latin, and English, liked history and was taught economics, geography, mathematics, politics, art, and music. Lehzen was strict, but rewarded the princess when she was obedient. In another departure from the era, Lehzen employed little to no corporal punishment; at least, there is no record of it in the household accounts. Victoria in power When Victoria ascended the throne in 1837, Lehzen enjoyed a prominent position at the coronation, and remained at court. At her request, she was given no official position, but agreed on a new title, \\"lady attendant\\". In her role, she was installed at Buckingham Palace as a sort of unofficial private secretary, served as chief liaison for the royal residences, and carried the household keys as a sign of her position; her signature was required for all payments of tradesmen's bills. At this point, it seems that Lehzen had totally replaced Victoria's mother both in terms of influence and affection; Lehzen's apartments adjoined the queen's, while the Duchess of Kent was installed in a suite of rooms far removed from Victoria. For the first few years of Victoria's reign, especially before her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha in 1840, Lehzen had a very strong influence on the queen's outlook on both politics and personal matters, despite the fact that she did not overtly involve herself in state affairs. Even after the queen's marriage, Lehzen retained the private doorway into the royal bedroom, a source of displeasure for Victoria's new husband. =Supplanted by Prince Albert= Victoria's marriage to Prince Albert led to disagreements and Lehzen's eventual dismissal. The arrival of Prince Albert led to significant changes in Victoria's household. Lehzen had opposed Coburg ambitions of Victoria marrying Albert, believing the princess to be a \\"second Queen Elizabeth, virgin and independent of male influence.\\" Albert was well-educated, and had just completed a tour of Europe, preceded by years at the University of Bonn. Victoria's court dismayed his puritan German sensibilities. Lehzen and Albert soon developed a dislike for each other; she regularly thwarted Albert's will in the running of the household; meanwhile, he found her personally repellent and unworthy of befriending the queen, openly referring to her as \\"the hag\\" and a \\"crazy stupid intriguer\\". When Victoria's first child, the Princess Royal, was born, Victoria trusted Lehzen to make the arrangements for the nursery. Lehzen placed it in the care of various staff as well as Sir James Clark, despite Albert's objections that the physician was wholly unsuited to the post, having already discredited himself during the affair of Lady Flora Hastings a year previously. At fourteen months the Princess Royal fell ill, losing her appetite and appearing pale and feverish. Dr Clark declared it a minor ailment, incorrectly prescribing her with calomel, a medication laced with mercury and laudanum. In fact, it is more likely that the precocious princess was simply expressing her dismay at changes in the royal nursery, then occurring with the arrival of her younger brother. Albert, a devoted father, confronted Victoria on the incompetence of the staff selected by Lehzen. There was a quarrel, after which Albert declared that he would leave the affair in her queenly hands, and placed it on her conscience if the child died. Soon after this argument Victoria conceded to her husband, not wishing to see him unhappy. She made a final attempt to defend Lehzen, describing her as a selflessly loyal woman who deserved to remain close to her former charge. But in the face of Albert's resolve, Victoria dismissed Lehzen, ostensibly for her health. To Albert, Lehzen was a servant who had attempted to rise above her place in life, and he wanted Victoria to rely on him alone. Lehzen accepted the fiction of ill health, and agreed to depart. In the days leading up to her exit, she taught some of her duties to Marianne Skerrett, one of Victoria's dressers, and returned her keys to the queen. Lehzen departed on 30 September 1842, leaving a note rather than speaking directly with Victoria, believing that this would be less painful. The queen was initially unaccustomed to Lehzen's absence, having spent almost her whole life up to that point in the presence of the former governess. \\"It was very painful to me... waking this morning, and recollecting she was really quite away,\\" Victoria said. Word of Lehzen's departure spread through the court and elsewhere. Reports of the cause varied; the court diarist Charles Greville noted she was leaving \\"for her health (as she says), to stay five or six months, but it is supposed never to return.\\" The Times however reported that she was simply visiting friends in Germany. After her departure, family adviser Baron Stockmar remarked of the affair that > [I]t was not without great difficulty that the Prince succeeded in getting > rid of [Lehzen]. She was foolish enough to contest his influence, and not to > conform herself to the change in her position... If she had done so, and > conciliated the P[rince], she might have remained in the Palace to the end > of her life. Death and legacy When Lehzen was dismissed from the court she returned to her native Germany, living in B√ºckeburg. She lived with her sister on the generous pension provided by Victoria, a yearly sum of ¬£800. She covered the walls of her house with portraits of the queen. Though her sister died several months later, the baroness continued to support financially her many nieces and nephews. Lehzen continued to regard Victoria with affection, and the queen wrote regularly to her former governess, weekly at first and later monthly at Lehzen's request. When visiting relations in Germany, the queen came to visit her twice in private. The Baroness Lehzen died in B√ºckeburg on 9 September 1870, where she is buried in Jetenburger cemetery. Queen Victoria ordered the erection of a memorial to her. After Lehzen's death, Queen Victoria spoke of her gratitude for their relationship, but commented \\"after I came to the throne she got to be rather trying, and especially so after my marriage... [This was not] from any evil intention, only from a mistaken idea of duty and affection for me.\\" During her time at the British court, Lehzen attracted attention outside of the royal household for her close relationship with Victoria. She was criticised for her influence with the queen, particularly from those who disliked German influences at court. Pamphlets, many released by the Tory party, complained of the \\"stranger harboured in our country\\" and the \\"evil counsellors\\" surrounding Victoria. One in particular, published as the Warning Letter to Baroness Lehzen, declared that a \\"certain foreign lady pulled the wires of a diabolical conspiracy of which Lady Flora was to be the first victim,\\" a reference to the Flora Hastings affair. More positive, The Times once described her as having simply \\"held a highly and strictly confidential situation about the person of the Sovereign.\\" As a sign of the perceived political influence she possessed, in 1838 false rumours suggested that Lehzen had been \\"converted\\" to the Whig party, and that she had been offered \\"an urgent proposal of marriage\\" by Whig prime minister Viscount Melbourne. Despite all of this criticism, the historian Gillian Gill describes how Lehzen was honest and frugal; even after Victoria ascended the throne, she seems to have made no demands for money or rank, preferring instead to simply be in the queen's company. The historian K. D. Reynolds adds that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character and moral development, in particular giving the queen the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and young queenship. Not all of her influence was positive, however; Reynolds also speculates that the 1839 Bedchamber crisis stemmed partly from Victoria's unwillingness to lose Lehzen. Baroness Lehzen has been portrayed numerous times in film and television. She was played by Ren√©e Stobrawa in the 1936 German film M√§dchenjahre einer K√∂nigin, Greta Schr√∂der in the films Victoria the Great and Sixty Glorious Years, Barbara Everest in 1941's The Prime Minister, Magda Schneider in the 1954 television serial The Story of Vickie, Olga Fabian in an episode of Hallmark Hall of Fame, Patience Collier in Edward the Seventh, Diana Rigg in the 2001 television serial Victoria & Albert, Jeanette Hain in the 2009 film The Young Victoria and Daniela Holtz in the 2016 television series Victoria.

Cayuga is about a 20-minute drive from Lake Erie and 30 minutes south of Hamilton and 115 minutes south of Toronto and consequently it has some cottages and recreational properties in the area. In the past, there was some light industry. It has the local district detachment for the Ontario Provincial Police. It is also uniquely located among larger communities on both the American and Canadian sides of the border boasting television reception from Toronto, Buffalo, New York, Hamilton, Kitchener and Erie, Pennsylvania. History Cayuga was incorporated as a village in 1859 and became the county seat for Haldimand County because of its central location. It is named after the Cayuga, one of the Six Nations of the Grand River Natives who were awarded land in the area for siding with the British in the American Revolution. As the county seat, it is the location of the Court House, jail and a museum. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, public hangings were held in the courtyard and the prisoners buried on site. The Highway 3 bridge over the Grand River (Cayuga Bridge) is a very well recognized bridge over the Grand River and is commonly used as a symbol of Haldimand County and the Grand River. The same bridge was also used in a movie that commemorated Terry Fox. That bridge no longer remains a symbol of the Grand River and Haldimand County as it was replaced in the summer of 2014 with a concrete bridge. The village's population grew to about 2,500 in the mid-19th century because the Grand River was an important commercial route. There were locks constructed at Indiana just north of Cayuga. However, when the Welland Canal was completed, the Grand became an obsolete route. Further, an impassable dam was built downriver from Cayuga at Dunnville. Although originally part of the Welland Canal, the purpose of the dam and a canal at Port Maitland is to keep the level of the Welland Canal consistent. Presently the population of Cayuga has recovered to approximately 1,500 after having been around 1,000 for almost a century. In 1974, the village was amalgamated into the new town of Haldimand within the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk. Despite nearby Caledonia being the largest community in the town, the town hall was located in Cayuga because of its central location. In 2001, Haldimand and all other municipalities within the region were dissolved and the region was instead divided into two single tier municipalities with city-status but called counties. Cayuga is now an unincorporated community in Ward 2 of Haldimand County. Politics Cayuga is in Ward 2 of Haldimand County. The current councillor for Ward 2 is Fred Morison 2010‚ÄìPresent. Before Fred Morison, it was Buck Sloat from 2003 to 2010. The current Mayor Of Haldimand County is Ken Hewitt 2010‚ÄìPresent. The previous Mayor was Marie Trainer from 2003 to 2010. Before Marie Trainer, the mayor was Lorraine Bergstrand 2001-2003. The current Clerk is Evelyn Eichenbaum who works in Cayuga at the Haldimand County Cayuga Administration building. The current Chief Administrative Officer of Haldimand County is Don Boyle who works in Cayuga at the Haldimand County Cayuga Administration building. Demographics Cayugians are overwhelmingly British by national background but many can trace their roots to an original German settlement near Cayuga in the 19th century. There was also a large Dutch migration to the area after the Second World War. Landmarks Cayuga, Ontario Cayuga is perched on the Banks of the Grand River, along a navigable portion of the river that stretches some 20 miles, ending at Lake Erie. The main office of the Haldimand Press is located in Cayuga. Cayuga has one of the oldest Courthouses in the area, located at 55 Munsee St. Until the late 1960s, a functioning jail surrounded by tall rock walls was attached to the Courthouse. Previously the New York Central Railroad went through Cayuga but the track has been torn up. One of the termini for the Underground Railway was St. Catharines, Ontario, which is about 45 minutes northeast of Cayuga. Harriet Tubman's nephew Lorne Barnes was the barber in Cayuga and was held out to the still-enslaved as an example of the success to be found by escaping to Canada. There is a National bank and a credit union in town along with a United Church of Canada (Presbyterian, Methodist and Congregational), an Anglican Church and a Catholic Church. The main street has a \\"rural brick charm\\" to it and many older houses continue to reflect Cayuga's prosperous past. Cayuga very much retains its small-town character. Uniquely isolated for years by the Six Nations Indian Reservation to the North and the Lake to the South, it has its own independent atmosphere and does not feel attached to anyone larger community. Cayuga has had a small town feel for decades, and the residents who have lived there for those decades appreciate the small town charm. Notable people Paul Baird Frank Martin played over 300 games for the Chicago BlackHawks in the late 1940s and the early 1950s.

Both Marty McSorley and Ray Emery grew up playing minor league hockey in Cayuga. Canadian Filmmaker Jeremy LaLonde grew up in Cayuga attending Cayuga Secondary School where he was a prominent member of the drama club. He has since gone on to direct multiple feature films including How to Plan an Orgy in a Small Town, Sex After Kids, The Go-Getters, The Untitled Work of Paul Shepard, and James vs His Future Self. He has also directed the tv series Baroness Von Sketch Show. Athletic accomplishment Just south of Cayuga and demographically associated is the hamlet of Fisherville. In 1954 a hockey team composed of local players which played out of the Cayuga Arena was sponsored by 'Fisherville Seed' and consequently known as the Fisherville Seedmen. It won the Ontario Intermediate Hockey Championship. Jack Melenbacher a local who was at the time an NHL referee mentored the team and a young Roy Edwards who played goal for the Seedmen later starred in the NHL for the Detroit Red Wings. Climate history =2009 Grand River flood= On February 13, 2009, the Grand River flooded when the river ice thawed, damaging Cayuga and Dunnville.

People from all around the \\"Golden Horseshoe\\" take advantage of great fishing and recreational activities along this part of the Grand River. Cayuga features two boat ramps, a water gassing station and riverside restaurant, open during summer months. In more recent years Cayuga has become known for auto racing. The oldest continually operating dragstrip in Canada and the fastest high bank oval race track in Canada, are located near the townsite; Cayuga International Speedway. It is a 5/8-mile oval auto racing track, which recently underwent major renovations. The drag strip was originally a runway built for training British Commonwealth pilots during the Second World War. Cayuga has a number of restaurants, including \\"River3\\", \\"The Cayuga Restaurant\\", \\"Twisted Lemon\\", and \\"The Back Forty (pub)\\". These restaurants cater to a variety of tastes and range in price and atmosphere from \\"very affordable\\" and family-oriented, to \\"moderately expensive\\" and urban-chic.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 5, 2000. In the episode, Homer discovers that Springfield has two different area codes and ends up leading a revolt that splits the town in two. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Shaun Cashman and guest starred the Who. The episode was inspired by Don Payne, based on the area where his mother lived, where one side of town would spread rumors about the other side. Larry Doyle then pitched that the two sides of Springfield would be divided because of a telephone area code. The episode features cultural references to the Who and the Norman Rockwell painting Freedom of Speech, and has received positive reviews from critics. Plot A badger takes up residence in Santa's Little Helper's doghouse. After several failed attempts to lure it out (including sending in Homer, whom the badger attacks), Homer calls animal control. When he is unable to get through, Marge explains that the phone company has introduced a new area code to Springfield. Half of the town keeps the original 636 area code, the other has 939. At a town meeting, Homer rallies an angry mob to protest the change, noting that the upper class side of town got to keep their area code while the poorer half were forced to switch. Homer proposes that the town split into two halves, and the mob agrees. Homer is declared mayor of New Springfield and tensions arise between the two towns. Old Springfield businesses discriminate against customers from New Springfield, and condescend to them on the nightly news. Bart and Homer shut off the power to Old Springfield. Old Springfield hijacks a beer truck heading for New Springfield and dumps its contents in the river; Homer and New Springfield then cut off their water supply. When the lack of water reveals gold in the river bed, making Old Springfield even richer, an enraged Homer has a wall built between the two towns. However, a lack of supplies and sanitation drives all of the New Springfield residents over to Old Springfield, leaving the Simpsons alone. Bitter, Homer attempts to sabotage a concert in Old Springfield by the Who by convincing them to play in New Springfield instead. When the people of Old Springfield realize this, they confront the Simpsons at the wall. After a brief riot, the members of the Who hear about the area code problem and suggest that the townspeople get speed dial. Pete Townshend's opening riff from \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" crumbles the wall, and the citizens of Springfield reunite and dance to the music as the badger leads an animal invasion of the town. Production Drummer Keith Moon, who died in 1978, is in the Who's line-up in this episode The episode was pitched by John Frink and Don Payne. The episode was inspired by Don Payne's mother's neighborhood, where one side would spread rumors about the other side. Larry Doyle then pitched that the sides split apart because of different area codes. During production the staff did not want one side to be slobs like Homer Simpson and the other snobs like Mr. Burns, but this ended up happening in the final product. The writers later created a website about what badgers eat. The phone from the educational cartoon was voiced by Dan Castellaneta. Pete Townshend did not guest star in the episode as he did not know he would be providing his own voice and assumed someone else would, as in Yellow Submarine. Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle and Pete's brother Paul Townshend provided guest voices in the episode. After a number of calls were made by the show's casting director in Los Angeles to the Who's managers in London, the group agreed to appear on the show. The Who recorded their lines in England, but weighed in on script details. During the production the staff decided to animate Keith Moon in honor of him since he died in 1978 instead of the Who's current drummer Zak Starkey. =Deleted scenes= When Roger Daltrey hits Marge with his microphone he improvised and said \\"Shut the fuck up, Marge.\\" This was later included in the deleted scenes on The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Twelfth Season DVD release. In the TV broadcast version, Daltrey says \\"Get out of the way, Marge\\". Cultural references The episode title is a play on the name of Charles Dickens' novel, A Tale of Two Cities. When Homer stands up in the press conference it is a reference to Norman Rockwell's painting Freedom of Speech. When it is suggested that Homer be the mayor of New Springfield, he imagines himself in the opening sequence of The Rifleman, instead as the Mayor. The scene in which Homer and Marge take a picture is a staff in-joke about \\"Trash of the Titans\\" when the voice director told Bono to smile. The episode also features several references to the Who, including \\"Magic Bus\\" and Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy. Moe's comment \\"That fat, dumb, and bald guy sure plays a mean hardball\\" is a reference to a Who song, \\"Pinball Wizard\\". The wall itself is a reference to the Berlin Wall, with \\"New Springfield\\" representing East Berlin. The two telephone area codes used in the episode are actual area codes in the North American Numbering Plan. 636 is assigned to phone numbers in the western suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri, while 939 is primarily used by mobile phones on the island of Puerto Rico. Reception Colin Jacobson of the DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a positive review saying \\"Maybe it‚Äôs the low expectations that accompany 21st century Simpsons episodes, but ‚ÄúTale‚Äù works for me. It takes a simple premise and turns in a good number of strong comedic bits. Hey, and a mention of ‚Äúgolden showers‚Äù keeps the Season 12 perverted sexual practices streak going!\\", although he criticized the animation of the Who other than Daltrey, saying that \\"That‚Äôs particularly odd in the case of Pete, as he‚Äôd gone awfully bald and gray by 2000.\\" Jennifer Malkowski of the DVD Verdict said the Greatest Moment was a tie between \\"Sacred bond\\" and \\"Who huddle.\\" Nancy Basile of About.com gave the episode a 5 writing \\"Finally! I loved this episode because, flashy guest stars aside, it got back to the heart and soul of the show.\\" In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed the Who's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. There was a backlash from Internet fans who found the scene of Homer nearly getting disemboweled by the badger and showing his internal organs to Lisa to be too disgusting for The Simpsons, citing the gore to be more at home in such animated shows as South Park and Family Guy.

Awarded the title Grandmaster by FIDE in 1970, he won the U.S. Chess Championship six times. Browne was known to sell interesting chess related items at tournaments where he played, such as the National Open, to earn extra money. Many of these items were sourced from different parts of the world during his chess travels and were unique. Early years Browne was born to an American father and an Australian mother in Sydney. His family moved to the New York area when he was age 3. Browne moved to California in 1973. Browne in 1972 Browne won the U.S. Junior Championship in 1966. Browne had dual Australian and American citizenship until he was 21, and represented Australia for a short time. He won the 1969 Australian Chess Championship. He tied first with Renato Naranja while representing Australia at the 1969 Asian Zonal tournament in Singapore, earning the International Master title, though Naranja qualified for the 1970 Interzonal on tie breaks. His zonal result earned him an invitation to an international grandmaster tournament in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, he gained the Grandmaster title by tying for 2nd‚Äì4th places, with Bruno Parma and Arthur Bisguier, behind reigning world champion Boris Spassky.

Many aspects of the present-day American medical profession stem from the Flexner Report and its aftermath. The Report (also called Carnegie Foundation Bulletin Number Four) called on American medical schools to enact higher admission and graduation standards, and to adhere strictly to the protocols of mainstream science in their teaching and research. The report talked about the need for revamping and centralizing medical institutions. Many American medical schools fell short of the standard advocated in the Flexner Report and, subsequent to its publication, nearly half of such schools merged or were closed outright. Colleges in electrotherapy were closed. Homeopathy, traditional osteopathy, eclectic medicine, and physiomedicalism (botanical therapies that had not been tested scientifically) were derided; some doctors were jailed. The Report also concluded that there were too many medical schools in the United States, and that too many doctors were being trained. A repercussion of the Flexner Report, resulting from the closure or consolidation of university training, was reversion of American universities to male-only admittance programs to accommodate a smaller admission pool. Universities had begun opening and expanding female admissions as part of women's and co-educational facilities only in the mid-to-latter part of the 19th century with the founding of co-educational Oberlin College in 1833 and private colleges such as Vassar College and Pembroke College. Background Abraham Flexner In 1904 the American Medical Association (AMA) created the Council on Medical Education (CME), whose objective was to restructure American medical education. At its first annual meeting, the CME adopted two standards: one laid down the minimum prior education required for admission to a medical school; the other defined a medical education as consisting of two years training in human anatomy and physiology followed by two years of clinical work in a teaching hospital. Generally speaking, the council strove to improve the quality of medical students, looking to draw from the society of upper-class, educated students. In 1908, seeking to advance its reformist agenda and hasten the elimination of schools that failed to meet its standards, the CME contracted with the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to survey American medical education. Henry Pritchett, president of the Carnegie Foundation and a staunch advocate of medical school reform, chose Abraham Flexner to conduct the survey. Neither a physician, a scientist, nor a medical educator, Flexner held a bachelor of arts degree and operated a for-profit school in Louisville, Kentucky. He visited every one of the one hundred fifty-five North American medical schools then in operation, all of which differed greatly in their curricula, methods of assessment, and requirements for admission and graduation. Summarizing his findings, he wrote: The Report became notorious for its harsh description of certain establishments, describing Chicago's fourteen medical schools, for example, as \\"a disgrace to the State whose laws permit its existence . . . indescribably foul . . . the plague spot of the nation.\\" Nevertheless, several schools received praise for excellent performance, including Western Reserve (now Case Western Reserve), Michigan, Wake Forest, McGill, Toronto, and particularly Johns Hopkins, which was described as the 'model for medical education'.Raffel MN, Raffel NK. The US Health System: origins and functions. 4th ed. Albany, NY: Delmar Publishers; 1994:11. Recommended changes To help with the transition and change the minds of other doctors and scientists, John D. Rockefeller gave more than $100 million to colleges, hospitals and founded a philanthropic front group called \\"General Education Board\\" (GEB). When Flexner researched his report, many American medical schools were small \\"proprietary\\" trade schools owned by one or more doctors, unaffiliated with a college or university, and run to make a profit. A degree was typically awarded after only two years of study. Laboratory work and dissection were not necessarily required. Many of the instructors were local doctors teaching part-time, whose own training left something to be desired. The regulation of the medical profession by state governments was minimal or nonexistent. American doctors varied enormously in their scientific understanding of human physiology, and the word \\"quack\\" flourished. Flexner carefully examined the situation. Using the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as the ideal,UNMC's Flexner's Impact on American Medicine he issued the following recommendations: # Reduce the number of medical schools (from 155 to 31) and poorly trained physicians; # Increase the prerequisites to enter medical training; # Train physicians to practice in a scientific manner and engage medical faculty in research; # Give medical schools control of clinical instruction in hospitals # Strengthen state regulation of medical licensure Flexner even expressed that he found Hopkins to be a \\"small but ideal medical school, embodying in a novel way, adapted to American conditions, the best features of medical education in England, France, and Germany.\\" In his efforts to ensure that Hopkins was the standard to which all other medical schools in United States were compared, Flexner went on to claim that all the other medical schools were subordinate in relation to this \\"one bright spot.\\" Flexner believed that admission to a medical school should require, at minimum, a high school diploma and at least two years of college or university study, primarily devoted to basic science. When Flexner researched his report, only 16 out of 155 medical schools in the United States and Canada required applicants to have completed two or more years of university education. By 1920, 92 percent of U.S. medical schools required this of applicants. Flexner also argued that the length of medical education should be four years, and its content should be what the CME agreed to in 1905. Flexner recommended that the proprietary medical schools should either close or be incorporated into existing universities. Medical schools should be part of a larger university, because a proper stand-alone medical school would have to charge too much in order to break even financially. Less known is Flexner's recommendation that medical schools appoint full-time clinical professors. Holders of these appointments would become \\"true university teachers, barred from all but charity practice, in the interest of teaching.\\" Flexner pursued this objective for years, despite widespread opposition from existing medical faculty. Flexner was the child of German immigrants, and had studied and traveled in Europe. He was well aware that one could not practice medicine in continental Europe without having undergone an extensive specialized university education. In effect, Flexner demanded that American medical education conform to prevailing practice in continental Europe. By and large, medical schools in Canada and the United States have followed Flexner's recommendations down to the present day. Recently, however, schools have increased their emphasis on public health matters. Consequences of the report To a remarkable extent, the following present-day aspects of the medical profession in North America are consequences of the Flexner Report: * In a very short time, medical colleges were streamlined and had curricula standardized; * A physician receives at least six, and preferably eight, years of post-secondary formal instruction, nearly always in a university setting; * Medical training adheres closely to the scientific method and is thoroughly grounded in human physiology and biochemistry. Medical research adheres fully to the protocols of scientific research; * Average physician quality has increased significantly; * No medical school can be created without the permission of the state government. Likewise, the size of existing medical schools is subject to state regulation; * Each state branch of the American Medical Association has oversight over the conventional medical schools located within the state; * Medicine in the US and Canada has become a highly paid and well-respected profession. The Report is now remembered because it succeeded in creating a single model of medical education, characterized by a philosophy that has largely survived to the present day. \\"An education in medicine,\\" wrote Flexner, \\"involves both learning and learning how; the student cannot effectively know, unless he knows how.\\" Although the report is over 100 years old, many of its recommendations are still relevant‚Äîparticularly those concerning the physician as a \\"social instrument... whose function is fast becoming social and preventive, rather than individual and curative.\\" =Medical school closings= Flexner sought to reduce the number of medical schools in the US. A majority of American institutions granting MD or DO degrees as of the date of the Report (1910) closed within two to three decades. (In Canada, only the medical school at Western University was deemed inadequate, but none was closed or merged subsequent to the Report.) In 1904, there were 160 MD- granting institutions with more than 28,000 students. By 1920, there were only 85 MD-granting institutions, educating only 13,800 students. By 1935, there were only 66 medical schools operating in the US. Between 1910 and 1935, more than half of all American medical schools merged or closed. The dramatic decline was in some part due to the implementation of the Report's recommendation that all \\"proprietary\\" schools be closed and that medical schools should henceforth all be connected to universities. Of the 66 surviving MD-granting institutions in 1935, 57 were part of a university. An important factor driving the mergers and closures of medical schools was that all state medical boards gradually adopted and enforced the Report's recommendations. In response to the Report, some schools fired senior faculty members as part of a process of reform and renewal. =Impact on African- American doctors and patients= Flexner advocated closing all but two of the historically black medical schools. His opinions were followed and only Howard and Meharry were left open, while five other schools were closed. His perspective was that black doctors should only treat black patients and should serve roles subservient to white physicians. The closure of these schools and the fact that black students were not admitted to many medical schools in the US for 50 years after Flexner has contributed to the low numbers of American born physicians of color and the ramifications are still felt more than a century later. Additionally, Flexner's findings marginalized opportunities for African-American physicians in the medical sphere. Despite Howard and Meharry as the only institutions remaining open to offer medical education to African- Americans, these schools struggled to remain open following the Flexner Report, having to meet the institutional requirements of white medical schools, reflecting a divide in health care access among white and African- Americans. Following the Flexner Report, African-American students sued universities, challenging the precedent set by Plessy V. Ferguson. However, these students were met by opposition from schools, who remained committed to segregating medical education. It was not until 15 years after Brown V Board of Education in 1954 that the AAMC ensured access to medical education for African-Americans and minorities by supporting the diversification of medical schools. Furthermore, given his adherence to germ theory, he argued that, if not properly trained and treated, African-Americans posed a health threat to middle/upper class whites. =Impact on alternative medicine= When Flexner researched his report, \\"modern\\" medicine faced vigorous competition from several quarters, including osteopathic medicine, chiropractic medicine, electrotherapy, eclectic medicine, naturopathy and homeopathy. Flexner clearly doubted the scientific validity of all forms of medicine other than that based on scientific research, deeming any approach to medicine that did not advocate the use of treatments such as vaccines to prevent and cure illness as tantamount to quackery and charlatanism. Medical schools that offered training in various disciplines including electromagnetic field therapy, phototherapy, eclectic medicine, physiomedicalism, naturopathy, and homeopathy, were told either to drop these courses from their curriculum or lose their accreditation and underwriting support. A few schools resisted for a time, but eventually most complied with the Report or shut their doors. =Impact on osteopathic medicine= Although almost all the alternative medical schools listed in Flexner's report were closed, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) brought a number of osteopathic medical schools into compliance with Flexner's recommendations to produce an evidence-based practice. The curricula of DO- and MD-awarding medical schools are now nearly identical, the chief difference being the additional instruction in osteopathic schools of osteopathic manipulative medicine. = Impact on role of physician = The vision for medical education described in the Flexner Report narrowed medical schools‚Äô interests to disease, and not on the system of health care or society‚Äôs health beyond disease. Preventive medicine and population health were not considered a responsibility of physicians, bifurcating ‚Äúhealth‚Äù into two separate fields: scientific medicine and public health.

It has been around since the early 1970s. History The band was formed in 1970 by Anton Perera, a confectioner at the Glucorasa company, composed of his five sons (Sunil, Nihal, Piyal, Nimal, Lal) - all of whom had recently completed high school. Lead singer Sunil Perera was schooled at St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa and St. Peter's College, Colombo. Anton renovated a portion of his house on Galle Road (in Rathmalana) into a recording studio and began recording their first album. In the thirty years that followed, many changes have occurred in the group's membership that have led to the eight members present today. Sunil Perera and Piyal Perera are the two surviving members from the original line up. Their early success was due to a series of 5albums they released in late 1970s (entitled Dance With the Gypsies). In the 1980s the group released their first audio cassette containing their novelty hit \\"Kurumitto\\" (\\"Dwarfs\\"), which is a translated cover of Dutch musician Father Abraham's \\"The Smurf Song\\". With the arrival of CDs in Sri Lanka, they released their first CD Gypsies Gold containing 17 songs and following its success there, with two other CDs, Dance With the Gypsies and Signore, both well received as well. The group has since released other records and continues to enjoy success. Sunil Perera and the Gypsies are world-famous for their baila music. The Gypsies have also successfully collaborated with other Sri Lankan stars like Desmond De Silva. They are also credited for having the first ever baila non-stop medley. They are known for their hit song \\"I Don't Know Why\\" as well. Their first performance out of Sri Lanka, as the resident band at the Delhi Taj for three months, was followed by successful tours in foreign countries where many Sri Lankans now reside, such as the UK, Singapore, U.S., New Zealand, Australia and Canada. They are the highed paid band in Sri Lanka recently, since they constantly perform at parties, dances and perform at many concerts. The long-standing female vocalist of the group, Corrine Almeida, and Sharon Nesaduray, better known as \\"Lulu\\", have left the group. Radhika Rajavellu is the latest addition to the band after the departure of their well known female vocalist Ginger (Judith White). The current female singer is Monique Wille (Ex-Ultimate).

Barry is a seaside resort, with attractions including several beaches and the resurrected Barry Island Pleasure Park. According to Office for National Statistics 2016 estimate data, the population of Barry was 54,673. Once a small village, Barry has absorbed its larger neighbouring villages of Cadoxton and Barry Island, and now, Sully. It grew significantly from the 1880s with the development of Barry Docks, which in 1913 was the largest coal port in the world. The place was possibly named after Saint Baruc. History =Early history= The area now occupied by Barry has seen human activity in many periods of history. Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age microlith flint tools have been found at Friars Point on Barry Island and near Wenvoe and Neolithic or New Stone Age polished stone axe-heads were discovered in St. Andrews Major. A cinerary urn (pottery urn buried with cremation ashes) was found on Barry Island during excavations of Bronze Age barrows and two more were found in a barrow at Cold Knap Point. A large defended enclosure or Iron Age promontory hillfort was located at the Bulwarks at Porthkerry and there was evidence of the existence of an early Iron Age farmstead during construction of Barry College off Colcot Road. Nell's Point In Roman times farmsteads existed on the site of Barry Castle and Biglis and there were verbal reports of discovery of a cemetery including lead coffins with scallop-shell decoration. Both St. Baruc's Chapel and St. Nicholas Church have re-used Roman bricks and tiles incorporated in their building fabric and a Roman villa was discovered in Llandough. In 1980 a Roman building consisting of 22 rooms and cellars in four ranges around a central courtyard was excavated at Glan-y-m√¥r and is believed to be a third-century building associated with naval activity, maybe a supply depot. The Vikings launched raids in the area and Barry Island was known to be a raider base in 1087. Flat Holm and Steep Holm islands in the Bristol Channel have their name Holm name derived from a Scandinavian word for an island in an estuary. The excavation of the Glan-y-m√¥r site revealed the site had been reused in the 6th and 7th century and also between AD 830 and 950 as a dry stone sub-rectangular building with a turf or thatched roof. =Medieval Barry= Barry Castle Whitehouse Cottage The main feature of the area at this time was the island in the Bristol Channel, separated from the mainland by a tidal estuary. It is described in Giraldus Cambrensis or Gerald of Wales' (\\"Journey through Wales\\", 1191). He states that Barry derives its name from St. Baruc whose remains are deposited in a chapel on the island. The local noble family who owned the island and the adjoining estates took the name of de Barri from the island. Following the Norman conquest of England the area was divided into manors with the Barry area split into two large lordships, Penmark and Dinas Powys. Penmark was split into the sub-manors of Fonmon, West Penmark and Barry. Dinas Powys was split into the sub-manors of Cadoxton and ('Highlight'). The sub- manor of Barry was granted by the de Umfraville family to the de Barri family and the seat of the manor was Barry Castle, located on high ground overlooking the Bristol Channel, a site occupied in Roman times by a native homestead. The castle was a small fortified manor house, built to replace an earlier earthwork. By the late 13th century the castle had two stone buildings on the east and west sides of a courtyard. Early in the 14th century the castle was strengthened by the addition of a large hall and gatehouse on its south side, the ruins of which are all that survive today. By now Barry had grown into a village and port with its own church and watermill but in the 14th century its population was drastically reduced by the Black Death and the consequences of the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr. It took the population some 300 years to recover and once more hold the title of village, essentially a sparsely populated area with a few scattered farms and much of the land a marsh that a small river flowed through. By 1622 the pattern of fields, where enclosure was almost complete, around Barry village was pretty much as it was to remain until the growth of the modern town. According to the 1673 hearth tax list the parish contained thirteen houses. Whitehouse Cottage, the oldest existing inhabited house in modern Barry, dates from the late 1500s with the east end of the building added in around 1600. It overlooks the sea at Cold Knap. =Industrial history= Barry Waterfront in July 2007 The viaduct at Porthkerry Park was once crossed many times daily by trains transporting coal from the valleys north of Bridgend By 1871 the population of Barry was over 100, with 21 buildings, the new estate-owning Romilly family being involved in the buildup of the village but it remained a largely agricultural community. It grew when it was developed as a coal port in the 1880s. The coal trade was growing faster than the facilities at Tiger Bay in Cardiff ever could and so a group of colliery owners formed the Barry Railway Company and chose to build the docks at Barry. Work commenced in 1884 and the first dock basin was opened in 1889 to be followed by two other docks and extensive port installations. The Barry Railway brought coal down from the South Wales Valleys to the new docks whose trade grew from one million tons in the first year, to over nine million tons by 1903. The port was crowded with ships and had flourishing ship repair yards, cold stores, flour mills and an ice factory. By 1913, Barry was the largest coal exporting port in the world. Barry Docks Behind the docks rose the terraced houses of Barry which, with Cadoxton, soon formed a sizeable town. The railways which had played a major part in the development of the dock helped make Barry Island a popular resort. Barry Memorial Hall on Gladstone Road was inaugurated in November 1932, and obtained its name to honour those locals who lost their lives in World War I. During its industrial peak a number of ships sank off the Barry coast. =Barry Scrapyard= Following the rise of diesel and electric power on the UK railways, the marshalling yards at Barry Docks became the largest repository of steam engines awaiting scrapping in the UK. Dai Woodham owned the Woodham Brothers Scrap yard and he allowed rail preservation organisations to buy back the locomotives at the scrap value, allowing around 200 of the 300 locomotives to be saved for future generations, although during the years of storage many were vandalised or looted by souvenir hunters. When interviewed just before his death, Woodham was reluctant to take full credit for this and pointed out that the town of Barry with its redundant sidings was the major factor in allowing these locomotives to be saved. Modern times Barry Council Office and Library, King's Square, in the town centre Holton Road Barry is the administrative centre of the Vale of Glamorgan, and home to Barry Town United F.C.. The road from Bonvilston was originally the B4266, as only Pontypridd Road within the town still is, and the road from Highlight Park right through the Vale to Bridgend was the B4265, as beyond Cardiff International Airport it still is. Since the 1970s, parts of these roads are numbered A4226, with the result that the A4226 radiates from Weycock Cross roundabout in three directions. Although still a port, Barry is more of a manufacturing town and as a service centre for the Vale of Glamorgan. Barry Docks and the adjoining industrial area form the largest employment centre in the town. The docks, whose road links were dramatically improved with the opening of the Docks Link Road in 1981, now have direct road access with the M4 motorway. The docks can handle vessels up to 23,000 tonnes and the first-class tidal position close to the deep-water channel of the Severn Estuary, allows for scheduled sailings. With its transit sheds, warehouses and open storage, the docks are equipped to handle bulk cargoes but with the scrapping of their former electric cranes, ships‚Äô own derricks have to be used or cranes hired in by ABP as required. Two roll on/roll off berths are available and have been used by routes to Ireland and West Africa. As at January 2016, Intermodal rail freight traffic is being operated from No. 2 Dock. With a new presence on the Mole in No. 1 Dock and the provision of a concrete slipway from it, leisure rowing and dinghy sailing is available (2016). The town has a town council which is controlled by the Labour Party. Holy Trinity Presbyterian Church The majority of industrial firms are located in the dock area. The largest are the chemical producing concerns such as Cabot Carbon and Dow Corning who not long ago completed the development of the largest silicones plant in Europe. Other main employers in Barry Docks are Jewson Builders' Merchants, Western Welding and Engineering, Bumnelly, and Associated British Ports Holdings who, since 1982 have run the docks as successors to the British Transport Docks Board. To the west of Barry is Porthkerry Park. This is a large area of open space, with woodlands, streams, and access to a pebbly beach. In the park is the former Barry Railway Company viaduct with 13 arched spans standing 110 ft high. Following the closure of the Vale of Glamorgan line to passengers between Barry and Bridgend in 1964, it was reopened on 10 June 2005 and for most of its 19 miles, provides a scenic view and link to Llantwit Major and beyond to Bridgend. Barry Island Barry Island The Barry Island peninsula was an island until the 1880s when it was linked to the mainland as the town of Barry expanded. This was partly due to the opening of Barry Dock by the Barry Railway Company. Established by David Davies, the docks now link up the gap which used to form Barry Island. There is a railway station to access the island at Barry Docks, there is also a heritage railway station which houses refurbished steam passenger trains. The railway is open to the public and holds events involving a large steam engine replica of Thomas the Tank Engine. Barry Island is now known for its beach and Barry Island Pleasure Park. From 1966, the island was home to a Butlins Holiday camp, which was closed in 1987 and taken over by Majestic Holidays who renamed it Barry Island Resort. Between Butlins' closure and Majestic's reopening the camp was used as for filming scenes in the \\"Shangri-La\\" holiday camp from the Doctor Who serial Delta and the Bannermen. The camp closed in 1996 after Majestic had a disagreement with the local council, who refused an entertainments licence unless work was carried out to improve the now 30-year-old site. It was redeveloped for housing between 1997‚Äì2003 with the remaining two camp buildings and outdoor pool demolished in early 2005. Watchtower Bay The preserved Vale of Glamorgan Railway runs on Barry Island. The BBC sitcom Gavin & Stacey was filmed in many areas of Barry and Barry Island. Long-running medical drama Casualty which is filmed in Cardiff, regularly films scenes in and around Barry Island. Politics and administration =UK parliamentary constituency= From the 1536 Act of Union, Glamorgan was represented in parliament by one member, elected by the freeholders in the county. In 1885, the constituency was split into three with the creation of East Glamorganshire, Mid Glamorganshire and South Glamorganshire. The Representation of the People Act 1918 created the Llandaff and Barry constituency. Sir William Cope (Conservative) won the 1918 general election. Labour regained the seat at the 1929 general election when Charles Ellis Lloyd was returned but two years later lost the seat to the Conservatives' Patrick Munro. Barry Police Station in the Jenner district After Munro's death in 1942 Cyril Lakin won the by-election for the Conservatives. Arwyn Lynn Ungoed-Thomas (Labour) won the seat at the 1945 general election. The Llandaff and Barry constituency was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. and replaced by the Barry parliamentary constituency. This seat was first contested in the 1950 United Kingdom general election when Dorothy Rees (Labour) was elected. She lost the seat to Sir Herbert Raymond Gower (Conservative) at the 1951 general election. He held the seat until its abolition in 1983. It was replaced by the Vale of Glamorgan constituency which Sir Herbert Raymond Gower (Conservative) won at the 1983 general election. He remained as MP until his death in 1989. At the subsequent by-election the seat was won by John Smith (Labour). At the 1992 general election Walter Sweeney (Conservative) won it by only 19 votes. That made it the most marginal seat in Britain. John Smith won it back at the 1997 general election. In the 2010 General election there was a 6.1% swing from labour to conservative. This has now handed the seat to Alun Cairns a (Conservative) MP. =Welsh Assembly= Barry Dock offices Barry is part of the Vale of Glamorgan Assembly constituency and part of the South Wales Central Assembly region. Jane Hutt has been the Vale of Glamorgan Assembly member since the inception of the Welsh Assembly. =Local councils= Barry was incorporated as a municipal borough by Royal Charter in September 1939. The Borough was the successor to Barry and Cadoxton Local Board (1888‚Äì1894) and Barry Urban District Council (1894‚Äì1939). The area covered by the borough comprised Barry, Cadoxton-juxta-Barry, Merthyr Dyfan and parts of Penmark, Porthkerry and Sully. In 1974, it was abolished and its functions taken over by the Vale of Glamorgan District Council and South Glamorgan County Council. The local council, Barry Town Council, is the largest town council in Wales. It has given Olympic silver medalist David Davies freedom of the town, the first freedom granted since 1958. The mayor since May 2017 is Nic Hodges who represents Baruc Ward and is a Plaid Cymru councillor, Barry's first Plaid Cymru mayor. The town council has no overall control with Labour, Plaid Cymru and Conservative councillors. The local unitary authority, created in 1995, is the Vale of Glamorgan Council which has its administrative headquarters in Barry. There are 23 wards electing 47 councillors, including eight wards in Barry (electing 18 county councillors) which comprise Baruc (2 councillors), Buttrills (2), Cadoc (3), Castleland (2), Court (2), Gibbonsdown (2), Dyfan (2) and Illtyd (3). Districts Romilly Park Climate As with the rest of the British Isles and Wales, Barry experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters, and often high winds. It is amongst the sunnier of Welsh locations, due to its southerly and coastal position. The nearest official weather observation station is at Cardiff Airport near Rhoose, about west of the town centre.

He is best known for introducing Milky Way (1923) and Mars (1932) chocolate candy bars, and M&M;'s (1941) chocolate candy, as well as orchestrating the launch of Uncle Ben's Rice. He was the son of candy company Mars, Inc. founder Frank C. Mars and his first wife Ethel G. Mars (n√©e Kissack). Early life and career Mars was born in Wadena, Minnesota, and raised in Saskatchewan, Canada after his parents' divorce when he was just a child. He rarely saw his father. After high school he entered the University of California, Berkeley and later transferred to Yale University, where he completed a degree in industrial engineering in 1928. As an adult, Forrest Mars reunited with his father at Mars, Inc. However, the pair ran into a disagreement when Forrest wanted to expand abroad while his father did not. For a few years he worked at the new plant in Chicago and supervised the development of the Snickers and Three Musketeers bars. Frances Herdlinger, a newly hired chemist at the Chicago lab of Mars Inc remembered \\"[Forrest Mars] would turn up often with something new for us to try.\\" Mars then took a buyout from his father and moved to England where he created the Mars bar and Maltesers while estranged from his father in 1933. In Europe, Mars briefly worked for Nestl√© and the Tobler company. In 1934, he bought a British company, Chappel Bros, specialized in canned meat for dogs. Due to the lack of competition, Forrest took control of this market as he launched and marketed Chappie's canned food. After he returned to the United States, Mars started his own food business, Food Products Manufacturing, where he established the Uncle Ben's Rice line and a pet food business, Pedigree. In partnership later with Bruce Murrie, Mars developed M&M;'s, the chocolate candy covered in a crunchy shell which \\"melts in your mouth, not in your hands,\\" in 1940. They were possibly modeled after Smarties. Peanut M&M;'s were introduced in 1954 although Forrest had been allergic to peanuts his entire life. Murrie later left the business. Following the death of his father, Forrest Mars took over the family business, Mars, Inc, merging it with his own company in 1964. He was married to Audrey Ruth Meyer (b. May 25, 1910, in Chicago, d. June 15, 1989, in Washington, D.C.), and they had four children ‚Äì Forrest Jr., John, and Jacqueline. Mars retired from Mars, Inc. in 1973, turning the company over to his children. In 1980, retired and living in Henderson, Nevada, he founded Ethel M Chocolates, named after his mother. Ethel M was purchased by Mars, Inc. in 1988. Mars died at age 95 in Miami, Florida, having amassed a fortune of $4 billion. He was ranked as 30th in Forbes magazine's list of richest Americans (Forrest Jr. and John were 29th and 31st, respectively). He left the business jointly to his three children. Mars was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1984. See also *List of billionaires References  Further reading  *Brenner, Joel Glenn (1999). The Emperors of Chocolate.

is a Chinese- American actor based in Hong Kong. He is fluent in English, but not in Chinese, which is reflected in many of the characters he has portrayed. His most notable film is the 1998 film Beast Cops which won a Hong Kong Film Award with Wong in the lead role. As of 2004, he has appeared in over fifty films in twenty-one years, often in very minor roles. Early career Michael Wong was born and raised in Troy, New York, the son of restaurateur, William Wong, and an American artist of Dutch and French descent, Connie Van Yserloo. After finishing high school, he left to go to Hong Kong to try his luck in acting. His brothers, Russell Wong and Declan Wong, would also become actors in the Hong Kong film industry. There were a number of significant factors against Wong's eventual success in the Hong Kong film industry including an inability to speak Cantonese Chinese, no formal training in acting and no background in martial arts. He also lacked an entry into the tightly knit in the Hong Kong film industry. His debut was in 1985's City Hero, then in 1986 he was cast in his first major role,Legacy of Rage alongside Brandon Lee (son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee) in his only Hong Kong movie. His next significant film was Royal Warriors a.k.a. In the Line of Duty, which established his dominant image for the first part of his career as a naive but tough outsider. Final Option, released in 1994, would make Wong a major star in the Chinese film industry. Playing the role of a police officer, he established a tougher image and the character reappeared in the prequel First Option in 1996, for which he would be nominated for both an Hong Kong Film Award and a Golden Horse Award. He would reprise the role of Stone Wong in the 2002 movie New Option. Later career Wong starred in a 1996 Canadian TV production Once A Thief directed by John Woo. He made his English language movie debut in James Hong's The Vineyard in 1989. His starring role in Beast Cops, which won a 1998 Best Film prize at the Hong Kong film awards, further consolidated his position. He also starred alongside Jackie Chan in Thunderbolt (1995) and Brandon Lee's sister Shannon Lee in Enter the Eagles (1998). He also played the role of a detective in the 1998 film, Knock Off, acting alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme and Rob Schneider. In 2000, Wong made his debut as a director in Miles Apart, which he also produced and starred in. He has continued to work in the Hong Kong film industry, though more often as a supporting player rather than a leading man, in productions such as Cold War, Skiptrace and Triple Threat. In 2006, Wong re-entered the music scene by performing \\"big band\\" music accompanied by a 10 piece band with the likes of \\"Come Fly with Me\\". Personal life Wong married Hong Kong supermodel Janet Ma in 1992 and they had two older daughters, Kayla Wong and Irisa Shannon Wong, and one son, Kadin Miles Wong.

The only species is Carnotaurus sastrei. Known from a single well- preserved skeleton, it is one of the best-understood theropods from the Southern Hemisphere. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in the Chubut Province of Argentina from rocks of the La Colonia Formation. Carnotaurus is a derived member of the Abelisauridae, a group of large theropods that occupied the large predatorial niche in the southern landmasses of Gondwana during the late Cretaceous. The phylogenetic relations of Carnotaurus are uncertain; it might have been closer to either Majungasaurus or Aucasaurus. Carnotaurus was a lightly built, bipedal predator, measuring in length and weighing at least . As a theropod, Carnotaurus was highly specialized and distinctive. It had thick horns above the eyes, a feature unseen in all other carnivorous dinosaurs, and a very deep skull sitting on a muscular neck. Carnotaurus was further characterized by small, vestigial forelimbs and long, slender hindlimbs. The skeleton is preserved with extensive skin impressions, showing a mosaic of small, non-overlapping scales approximately 5 mm in diameter. The mosaic was interrupted by large bumps that lined the sides of the animal, and there are no hints of feathers. The distinctive horns and the muscular neck may have been used in fighting conspecifics. According to separate studies, rivaling individuals may have combated each other with quick head blows, by slow pushes with the upper sides of their skulls, or by ramming each other head-on, using their horns as shock absorbers. The feeding habits of Carnotaurus remain unclear: some studies suggest the animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as sauropods, while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals. Carnotaurus was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods. Description Scale diagram comparing Carnotaurus to a human Carnotaurus was a large but lightly built predator. The only known individual was about in length, making Carnotaurus one of the largest abelisaurids. While Ekrixinatosaurus and possibly Abelisaurus, highly incomplete, would have been similar or larger in size, a 2016 study found that only Pycnonemosaurus, at , was longer than Carnotaurus, which was estimated at . Its mass is estimated to have been and in separate studies that used different estimation methods. Carnotaurus was a highly specialized theropod, as seen especially in characteristics of the skull, the vertebrae and the forelimbs. The pelvis and hindlimbs, on the other hand, remained relatively conservative, resembling those of the more basal Ceratosaurus. Both the pelvis and hindlimb bones were long and slender. The left thigh bone of the individual measures 103 cm in length, but shows an average diameter of only 11 cm. =Skull= Skull cast, Dinosaur Discovery Museum, Kenosha, Wisconsin The skull, measuring in length, was proportionally shorter and deeper than in any other large carnivorous dinosaur. The snout was moderately broad, not as tapering as seen in more basal theropods like Ceratosaurus, and the jaws were curved upwards. As in other abelisaurids, the facial bones, especially the nasal bones, were sculptured with numerous small holes and spikes. In life, a wrinkled and possibly keratinous skin would have covered these bones. A prominent pair of horns protruded obliquely above the eyes. These horns, formed by the frontal bones, were thick and cone-shaped, but somewhat vertically flattened in cross-section, and measured in length. In life, they would probably have formed the bony cores of much longer keratinous horns. The proportionally small eyes were situated in the upper part of the keyhole shaped orbita (eye sockets). The upper part was slightly rotated forward, probably permitting some degree of binocular vision. The teeth were long and slender, as opposed to the usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were equipped with fifteen dentary teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points. The lower jaw was found with hyoid bones, in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily. =Vertebrae= Sixth tail vertebra of the holotype in A) side, B) front and C) top views, with arrows indicating the highly modified caudal ribs The vertebral column consisted of ten cervical (neck), twelve dorsal, six fused sacral and an unknown number of caudal (tail) vertebrae. The neck was nearly straight, rather than having the S-curve seen in other theropods, and also unusually wide, especially towards its base. The top of the neck's spinal column featured a double row of enlarged, upwardly directed bony processes called epipophyses, creating a smooth trough on the top of the neck vertebrae. These processes were the highest points of the spine, towering above the unusually low spinous processes. The epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature. A similar double row was also present in the tail, formed there by highly modified caudal ribs, in front view protruding upwards in a V-shape, their inner sides creating a smooth, flat, top surface of the front tail vertebrae. The end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook-shaped expansion that connected to the caudal rib of the preceding vertebra. =Forelimbs= Bones of the hand, as interpreted by Ruiz and colleagues (2011) The forelimbs were proportionally shorter than in any other large carnivorous dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus. The forearm was only a quarter the size of the upper arm. There were no carpalia in the hand, so that the metacarpals articulated directly with the forearm. The hand showed four basic digits, though apparently only the middle two of these ended in finger bones, while the fourth consisted of a single splint-like metacarpal that may have represented an external 'spur'. The fingers themselves were fused and immobile, and may have lacked claws. Carnotaurus differed from all other abelisaurids in having proportionally shorter and more robust forelimbs, and in having the fourth, splint-like metacarpal as the longest bone in the hand. A 2009 study suggests that the arms were vestigial in abelisaurids, because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today's emus and kiwis, which also have vestigial forelimbs. =Skin= Restoration Carnotaurus was the first theropod dinosaur discovered with a significant number of fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, the right side of the skull also was covered with large patches of skin‚Äîthis was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the right side of the skull is very different from that of the left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head. The skin was built up of a mosaic of polygonal, non-overlapping scales measuring approximately in diameter. This mosaic was divided by thin, parallel grooves. Scalation was similar across different body parts with the exception of the head, which apparently showed a different, irregular pattern of scales. There is no evidence of feathers. Uniquely for theropods, there were osteoderms (knob-like skin bones) running along the sides of the neck, back and tail in irregular rows. Each bump showed a low ridge and measured in diameter. They were set apart from each other and became larger towards the animal's top. The bumps probably represent clusters of condensed scutes, similar to those seen on the soft frill running along the body midline in hadrosaurid (\\"duck-billed\\") dinosaurs. Stephen Czerkas (1997) suggested that these structures may have protected the animal's sides while fighting members of the same species (conspecifics) and other theropods, arguing that similar structures can be found on the neck of the modern iguana where they provide limited protection in combat. Classification Restored cast of the holotype, Museu de Ci√™ncias Naturais da PUC Minas Forelimb bones Carnotaurus is one of the best-understood genera of the Abelisauridae, a family of large theropods restricted to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents. Several notable traits that evolved within this family, including shortening of the skull and arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae, were more pronounced in Carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid. Though relationships within the Abelisauridae are debated, Carnotaurus is consistently shown to be one of the most derived members of the family by cladistical analyses. Its nearest relative might have been either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus; this ambiguity is largely due to the incompleteness of the Aucasaurus skull material. A recent review suggests that Carnotaurus was not closely related to either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus, and instead proposed Ilokelesia as its sister taxon. Carnotaurus is eponymous for two subgroups of the Abelisauridae: the Carnotaurinae and the Carnotaurini. Paleontologists do not universally accept these groups. The Carnotaurinae was defined to include all derived abelisaurids with the exclusion of Abelisaurus, which is considered a basal member in most studies. However, a 2008 review suggested that Abelisaurus was a derived abelisaurid instead. Carnotaurini was proposed to name the clade formed by Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus; only those paleontologists who consider Aucasaurus as the nearest relative of Carnotaurus use this group. Below is a cladogram published by Canale and colleagues in 2009. Discovery Illustration of the known material of Carnotaurus The only skeleton (holotype MACN-CH 894) was unearthed in 1984 by an expedition led by Argentinian paleontologist Jos√© Bonaparte. This expedition also recovered the peculiar spiny sauropod Amargasaurus. It was the eighth expedition within the project named \\"Jurassic and Cretaceous Terrestrial Vertebrates of South America\\", which started in 1976 and was sponsored by the National Geographic Society. The skeleton is well-preserved and articulated (still connected together), with only the posterior two thirds of the tail, much of the lower leg, and the hind feet being destroyed by weathering. During fossilization, the skull and especially the muzzle were crushed laterally, while the premaxilla were pushed upwards onto the nasal bones. As a result, the upward curvature of the upper jaw is artificially exaggerated in the holotype. The skeleton belonged to an adult individual, as indicated by the fused sutures in the braincase. It was found lying on its right side, showing a typical death pose with the neck bent back over the torso. Unusually, it is preserved with extensive skin impressions. In view of the significance of these impressions, a second expedition was started to reinvestigate the original excavation site, leading to the recovery of several additional skin patches. Skin impressions from the tail The skeleton was collected on a farm named \\"Pocho Sastre\\" near Bajada Moreno in the Telsen Department of Chubut Province, Argentina. Because it was embedded in a large hematite concretion, a very hard kind of rock, preparation was complicated and progressed slowly. In 1985, Bonaparte published a note presenting Carnotaurus sastrei as a new genus and species and briefly describing the skull and lower jaw. The generic name Carnotaurus means \\"meat- eating bull\\", an allusion to the animal's bull-like horns. The specific name sastrei honors Angel Sastre, the owner of the ranch where the skeleton was found. A comprehensive description of the whole skeleton followed in 1990. After Abelisaurus, Carnotaurus was the second member of the family Abelisauridae that was discovered. For years, it was by far the best- understood member of its family, and also the best-understood theropod from the Southern Hemisphere. It was not until the 21st century that similar well- preserved abelisaurids were described, including Aucasaurus, Majungasaurus and Skorpiovenator, allowing scientists to re-evaluate certain aspects of the anatomy of Carnotaurus. The holotype skeleton is displayed in the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences, Bernardino Rivadavia; replicas can be seen in this and other museums around the world. Sculptors Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas manufactured a life-sized sculpture of Carnotaurus that was previously on display at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This sculpture, ordered by the museum during the mid-1980s, is probably the first life restoration of a theropod showing accurate skin. Age and paleoecology Carnotaurus in environment Originally, the rocks in which Carnotaurus was found were assigned to the upper part of the Gorro Frigio Formation, which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old (Albian or Cenomanian stage). Later, they were realized to pertain to the much younger La Colonia Formation, dating 72 to 69.9 million years ago (Late Cretaceous, Lower Maastrichtian stage). Thus, Carnotaurus was the latest South American abelisaurid known. By the Late Cretaceous, South America was already isolated from both Africa and North America. The La Colonia Formation is exposed over the southern slope of the North Patagonian Massif. Most vertebrate fossils, including Carnotaurus, come from the formation's middle section (called the middle facies association). This part likely represents the deposits of an environment of estuaries, tidal flats or coastal plains. The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods. The most common vertebrates collected include ceratodontid lungfish, turtles, crocodiles, plesiosaurs, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and mammals. Some of the snakes that have been found belong to the families Boidae and Madtsoidae, such as Alamitophis argentinus. Turtles are represented by at least five taxa, four from Chelidae (Pleurodira) and one from Meiolaniidae (Cryptodira). Among the marine reptiles is the plesiosaur Sulcusuchus erraini of the family Polycotylidae. Mammals are represented by Reigitherium bunodontum, which was considered the first record of a South American docodont, and Argentodites coloniensis, possibly of Multituberculata. In 2011, the discovery of a new enantiornithine bird from the La Colonia Formation was announced. Paleobiology =Function of the horns= Skull in multiple views, with details of the skin structures inferred, and the right frontal horn Carnotaurus is the only known carnivorous bipedal animal with a pair of horns on the frontal bone. The use of these horns is not entirely clear; several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics, in display, or in killing prey. Greg Paul (1988) proposed that the horns were butting weapons and that the small orbita would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting. Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) suggested that Carnotaurus used its horns in a way similar to rams. They calculated that the neck musculature was strong enough to absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5.7 m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia, while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck. Other studies suggest that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, the horns may have been a device for the distribution of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows. Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) propose that the horns might also have been used to injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only reported example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals. =Jaw function and diet= Restoration of the head showing the soft tissues inferred from osteological morphology of the skull Analysis of the jaw structure of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) suggests that the animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites are more important than strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to move up and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs. It could generate a bite force of around 3,341 newtons. This interpretation was questioned by Fran√ßois Therrien and colleagues (2005), who found that the biting force of Carnotaurus was twice that of the American alligator, which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod. These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the flexural strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush. Robert Bakker (1998) found that Carnotaurus mainly fed upon very large prey, especially sauropods. As he noted, several adaptations of the skull‚Äîthe short snout, the relatively small teeth and the strong back of the skull (occiput)‚Äîhad independently evolved in Allosaurus. These features suggest that the upper jaw was used like a serrated club to inflict wounds; big sauropods would have been weakened by repeated attacks. =Locomotion= Cross section through the tail of Carnotaurus, showing the enlarged caudofemoralis muscle and the V-shaped caudal ribs Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 1999) presumed that Carnotaurus was a swift runner, arguing that the thigh bone was adapted to withstand high bending moments while running. The ability of an animal's leg to withstand those forces limits its top speed. The running adaptations of Carnotaurus would have been better than those of a human, although not nearly as good as those of an ostrich. Scientists calculate that Carnotaurus had a top speed of up to per hour. In dinosaurs, the most important locomotor muscle was located in the tail. This muscle, called the caudofemoralis, attaches to the fourth trochanter, a prominent ridge on the thigh bone, and pulls the thigh bone backwards when contracted. Scott Persons and Phil Currie (2011) note that in the tail vertebrae of Carnotaurus, the caudal ribs did not protrude horizontally (\\"T-shaped\\"), but were angled against the vertical axis of the vertebrae, forming a \\"V\\". This would have provided additional space for a caudofemoralis muscle larger than in any other theropod‚Äîthe muscle mass was calculated at per leg. Therefore, Carnotaurus could have been one of the fastest large theropods. While the caudofemoralis muscle was enlarged, the epaxial muscles situated above the caudal ribs would have been proportionally smaller. These muscles, called the longissimus and spinalis muscle, were responsible for tail movement and stability. To maintain tail stability in spite of reduction of these muscles, the caudal ribs bear forward projecting processes interlocking the vertebrae with each other and with the pelvis, stiffening the tail. As a consequence, the ability to make tight turns would have been diminished, because the hip and tail had to be turned simultaneously, unlike in other theropods.

The game is a sequel to Aliens Versus Predator (1999); both games are based on the characters of the Alien and Predator media franchises as well as the Alien vs. Predator crossover series. It is set on the fictional planet LV-1201, which houses a vast series of ruins infested with Aliens that is routinely visited by a clan of Predators who hunt the creatures for sport. The game is played from a first-person perspective. In the single-player mode, players control one of three characters, each with their own abilities and individual story modes. An online multiplayer mode, which allows players to play as one of four teams in competitive modes, is no longer officially supported and requires a community developed patch to enable multiplayer. An expansion pack titled Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt was released in 2002. A \\"Gold Edition\\" of Aliens Versus Predator 2 followed, combining both the original game and the expansion pack into a single package. There was never an Aliens versus Predator 3 nor any plans for a sequel, but in 2010 Rebellion Developments made a reboot simply titled Aliens vs. Predator. Gameplay Like its predecessor, Aliens Versus Predator 2 allows the player to choose one of three characters: an Alien, Predator, or human Colonial Marine. Each character has different objectives, abilities and weapons at their disposal. The single-player campaigns present the player with a conventional series of levels that are designed around the abilities of each character. As the Colonial Marine, the player uses a number of weapons to combat Aliens and Predators. The Marine wears armor for protection, and uses an image intensifier, flashlight, and flares to improve visibility in dark areas. When playing as the Predator, the player uses a variety of weapons from the Predator films such as wrist blades, a throwing disc, and shoulder-mounted energy weapons. The Predator is more durable than the human or the Alien and can survive falls from greater heights than the human. It can use a cloaking device to become invisible and several different modes of vision to help in the detection of enemies, including infrared vision and a mode sensitive to electrical systems. Unlike in the previous game, the Predator in Aliens Versus Predator 2 recharges its energy supply using a personal item. As an Alien the player can explore most of the game's environments freely, even climbing across walls and ceilings. However, the Alien has no weapons and must use its claws, tail, and jaws to attack enemies. The player can also use a form of echolocation in dark areas and can detect pheromones to discern human or Predator enemies. The Alien can drop from any height without injury and is the fastest of the three player characters. =Multiplayer= Aliens Versus Predator 2 has several multiplayer modes which can be played through an internet or Local Area Network connection. In each game the player chooses one of four teams to play as: The Aliens, Predators, Marines, or corporate mercenaries (called \\"Iron Bears\\" in the game's storyline). Each team has unique abilities, advantages, and disadvantages. The Aliens are able to scale walls and ceilings and the Predators can become invisible, while the two human teams have a large array of heavy weapons as well as motion trackers. There are six different multiplayer \\"modes\\" played on a number of \\"maps\\". \\"Deathmatch\\" mode is a free- for-all match in which the player's goal is to accumulate the highest number of kills. \\"Team Deathmatch\\" has the same goal except that the player is teamed with other players of the same species (or faction, in the case of the Colonial Marines and the Corporate Mercenaries). In \\"Hunt\\" there are two teams, one designated as the \\"hunter\\" and the other as the \\"prey\\"; the hunters accumulate points by killing the prey, while the prey can themselves become hunters by killing members of the hunter team. \\"Survivor\\" mode designates all players as \\"defenders\\" at the start; if a player is killed they become a \\"mutant\\" and can then earn points by killing defenders. Defenders gain points by staying alive without becoming mutants. \\"Overrun\\" is a timed match between two teams that is similar to \\"Survivor\\" except that each player has a finite number of lives; at the end of the round points are awarded based on the number of surviving members on each team. \\"Evacuation\\" is another two-team match with a finite number of lives, in which one team is designated as the \\"attackers\\" and the other as \\"defenders\\". The attacking team wins by killing all of the defenders, while the defending team wins by locating the map's evacuation point and having at least one member survive within it for ten seconds. In November 2008, Sierra Entertainment shut down the master server browser for the game. Synopsis =Setting= The story of Aliens Versus Predator 2 largely takes place in the year 2231, approximately 109 years after the events of Alien and 52 years after the events of both Aliens and Alien 3. Humanity has established an outpost on the planet LV-1201, which was found after the Weyland-Yutani Corporation traced the flight telemetry of the original derelict ship featured in Alien. The planet was found to have extraterrestrial ruins of similar make and was a breeding ground for Xenomorphs. The research colony consisted of two major installations: the Primary Operations Complex (POC), designed with the same \\"shake and bake\\" architecture seen at Hadley's Hope in Aliens; and the Forward Observation Pods, a set of four (originally five) scientific research facilities suspended over a canyon by a network of trellises, with an internal design style reminiscent of the Nostromo from Alien. A garrison of corporate mercenaries known as the Iron Bears, led by the mercenary general Vassili Rykov, provides security while Dr. Arnaud Eisenberg runs the science division. At approximately 5:18 AM, on November 25, 2230, a lone Xenomorph (the player character in the game's Alien storyline) escaped from its confinement and caused significant collateral damage in a fight with an invading Predator. Referred to in-game as \\"The Incident\\", the fight resulted in the Primary Operations Complex being overrun with Xenomorphs. Since the POC was the communications link between the Forward Observation Pods and the rest of the galaxy, this leaves the survivors at the Pods stranded and unable to call for help. Six weeks later, the Colonial Marines are sent to investigate what happened. It is later established in the expansion pack Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt that LV-1201 was also once the location of a Predator hunting ground, where the Predators hunt Xenomorphs for sport. In Primal Hunt, a lone Predator survivor from a previous botched hunt unwittingly caused a Xenomorph outbreak in Pod 5 while trying to alert other members of its kind to its location. The Iron Bears were forced to destroy Pod 5, while a lone Predator ship intercepted the call. The Alien storyline, which is the earliest point in the main game, picks up about five weeks after this catastrophe occurred. =Plot= The three story lines in Aliens Versus Predator 2 intersect and impact one another, unlike the preceding game. Marine In January 2231, on board the USS Verloc, the ship is carrying a small contingent of the U.S.C.M (United States Colonial Marines) to planet LV-1201. The Primary Operations Complex (POC), one of the main Weyland-Yutani facilities on the LV-1201, is missing contact with the rest of the pods for the last 6 weeks, and the Marines are to rescue survivors and secure the facility until the larger USCM 6th Battalion arrives. Two dropships are deployed to the Primary Operations Complex, but they are separated by hurricane winds and one is damaged and forced to make an emergency landing outside the POC. Sergeant Hall and Red Team are sent to restore power, and White Team is sent to restore security control. Harrison, Shugi, and Blackwell are sent to clear the North Landing Bay and ensure that the wind shear radar is up. However, Harrison is immediately separated from the rest of his team and loses contact with them. He manages to restore power to the North Landing Bay and reactivate the landing beacon on his own, and the dropship immediately lands there. Harrison is then sent to the nearest security office to activate the POC's automated defenses. He succeeds, but accidentally wakes up the POC's alien inhabitants in the process. Red Team becomes pinned down in Yard Four. Dropship One takes off without Harrison, who is ordered to rendezvous with Hall's team; once he gets there, he is informed that Hall has been taken by the aliens. He attempts to rescue her, but by the time he finds her, she has already been impregnated with a Chestburster. She dies as Harrison finds her. The Marines attempt to reach the Pods via the tunnel network connecting them to the POC. Harrison is sent ahead to deactivate tunnel security so the Marines' APCs can proceed through. However, in an attempt to prevent espionage, the facility's Internal Security Protocol Chief had tied the network security layer into the node protocol; as a result, the collapse of the network's data layer forces the Forward Pods to reboot their entire security system and leaving them vulnerable for 15 minutes. During this time, Aliens attack the Pods and six of the Iron Bears are killed before the Marines manage to arrive at the Pods. When the Marines reach the Pods, both Eisenberg and Rykov give the strike team a false assignment in order to conceal the fate of the people who died in the POC. To facilitate this, the pair have Harrison isolated and imprisoned while he attempts to establish a communication link with the Verloc. Harrison escapes with the remote aid of a woman named Tomiko, an assemblyman's daughter. Harrison is instructed to recover a data disk containing evidence of Eisenberg's illegal activities in exchange for reuniting him with his platoon. Harrison finds several members of White Team, but they are all killed by Xenomorphs and Predators before Harrison can activate the landing beacon for an incoming dropship. Harrison manages to kill a Predator himself before reaching the dropship. Tomiko transmits the coordinates of an old entry site to the Hive, and Harrison, now in his own Exosuit, proceeds after his fellow Marines whom Rykov has stranded. Harrison's Exosuit is damaged during a fall, and he must proceed the rest of the way on foot. He locates his team in a massive chamber where the fossilized remains of an Engineer reside. A Xenomorph Queen attacks the squad, but Harrison is able to repel the Queen so that he and the rest of the Marines can escape via dropship. The Queen tries to stop them, but the dropship bombards her with missiles, killing her. As the dropship puts distance between itself and the Hive, Tomiko overloads the fusion reactors in the Pods, destroying them and killing herself to save the marines. When the Marines return to the Verloc, Major McCain recommends abandoning any further rescue or salvage attempts on LV-1201, as they depart back to Earth. Predator On the night of July 3, 2211, a Weyland-Yutani research facility on the planet Korari came under attack by at least one Predator. A young Rykov, who was a Marine at the time, was among the survivors, but suffered a major injury to his back; he was honorably discharged from the Marines and began working as a mercenary shortly thereafter. By November 2230, several predators have arrived at LV-1201; their arrival is brought to the attention of Rykov himself, who is now providing private security for the Weyland-Yutani installation there. The hunt lasts for at least a week, during which time one Predator self-destructs after losing in combat to an Alien (\\"the Incident\\") and two more are captured by the Iron Bears. Pursuing his captured clan-mates into the Forward Observation Pods, the player character eventually succumbs to electro-magnetic pulse grenades which render his equipment useless and result in his capture. Rykov places the Predator in a lab where it remains in stasis for over five weeks. It is revealed that this Predator is responsible for Rykov's injuries and his burning desire for revenge. Saved from being impregnated with a Xenomorph and inadvertently released by Corporal Harrison, the Predator powers through a horde of humans, reclaims his equipment and sets off in pursuit of General Rykov. After escaping aboard a corporate dropship, the Predator fights through the Alien infested caves and tunnels beneath the pods and eventually manages to signal his clan using human technology to broadcast the signal to them. The Predator clan promptly arrive and re-arm the Predator, who then sets off to finish Rykov. Following Rykov, now encased in an Exosuit, deep into the Xenomorph Hive, the Predator fights his way into the heart of the Hive for a climatic battle with General Rykov. Overcoming his enemy, the Predator rips through Rykov's body, and claims his spine as his trophy after 19 years of chase. The Predator reunites with his clan and departs the planet in order to pursue the U.S.S. Verloc. Alien On November 2230, a day before the Incident at the POC, Dr. Eisenberg is discussing some of the facility's problems with a co-worker. Those problems include the loss of Pod 5 weeks earlier, missing artifacts, and unauthorized research conducted by Eisenberg, while the oversight committee is getting worried about the illegal activities and the loss of the facility staff on Pod 5, as the Weyand-Yutani Corporation is worried about being able to cover-up the research on the LV-1201 any longer. Eisenberg continues research regardless of liability. Meanwhile, a shipping crate hiding a Xenomorph egg is delivered to the colony, where an accident awakens the egg and releases the Facehugger. The Facehugger leaves the ship through a series of umbilical ductworks and begins to track an irritable guard, Cisco, through the POC. When Cisco retires to his quarters for a nap, the Facehugger springs on him and infects him. In due time, a player-controlled Chestburster hatches, killing Cisco, while the Facehugger hides under Cisco's desk and soon after dies hidden. It flees through an open window and proceeds through the POC until it feeds on a group of captive cats. After feeding on the cats, the chestburster grows into a full Alien drone. When the guards find him, he goes berserk and murders them. The alien fights its way through the POC, releasing other Xenomorphs being kept as test subjects along the way. It reaches the lower levels, finally encountering a Predator that had been stalking it, probably believing it would make a suitable challenge. It fatally wounds the Predator, which activates its Self- Destruct Device, creating a large hole that facilitates the Xenomorph invasion into the POC. This invasion prompts the U.S.S. Verloc's deployment. Six weeks later, the alien infiltrates the Pods during a brief security failure caused by Corporal Harrison. As the Xenomorphs attack the Pods, they weaken the defenses and release an artificial hive in the process. Eisenberg has taken advantage of the Marines' arrival to initiate the Large Mass Specimen Extraction, a project to capture the Xenomorph Empress. As part of the plan, combat synthetics have wired explosive charges throughout the tunnels of the Hive. After leaving the Pods and armed with this information, the alien disables these explosives as it tracks the Empress. The Empress is successfully captured, but the alien pursues her captors, including Eisenberg himself. It tracks them through an archaeological site, killing numerous guards, civilians, and Iron Bears mercenaries, to a dropship landing pad. It kills two Predators and sabotages the pad's support machinery, causing the dropship to crash. Furious, Eisenberg attacks the alien directly. The alien incapacitates Eisenberg and cocoons his artificial body to celebrate their victory. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated Aliens vs. Predator 2 for its 2001 \\"Computer Action/Adventure Game of the Year\\" and \\"Online Game Play of the Year\\" awards. However, it lost in both categories to Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Similarly, the editors of Computer Games Magazine nominated Aliens Versus Predator 2 as the best action game of 2001, but ultimately gave the award to Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt Cover art An expansion pack, titled Aliens Versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt, was developed by Third Law Interactive, published by Sierra Entertainment and distributed by Fox Interactive in August 2002. It was also included in the Gold Edition of Aliens Versus Predator 2 released in May 2003, which bundled the original game and the expansion pack into a single package. Primal Hunt adds new weapons and multiplayer maps to the original game, as well as a single-player campaign which serves as a prequel to the storyline of Aliens Versus Predator 2. =Gameplay= The player is once again able to play as either a human, Predator, or Alien character, each with its own campaign and abilities. The plot lines of the three characters intersect and set up the events of the original game. =Plot= The events of Primal Hunt are set on LV-1201, the same setting as the main game, but take place in earlier time periods. The stories of the Alien and Predator characters begin five hundred years before the events of Aliens Versus Predator 2 and continue in the year 2230, approximately six weeks before the events of the main game, which is also the time period of the human character's story. Primal Hunt revisits the Forward Observation Pods of the research facility and explains the destruction of Pod 5. Marine/Mercenary Major Dunya, a female member of the Weyland-Yutani private military contractor known as the \\"Iron Bears\\", is stationed on LV-1201. She is ordered by her superior officer, General Rykov, to retrieve an artifact from a location known as the \\"Zeta Site\\" which houses part of a Xenomorph hive as well as technology from an alien race (the race of the \\"space jockey\\" found by the Nostromo crew in Alien). The player battles xenomorphs through the Zeta Site, retrieves the artifact, and returns to find that Aliens have infiltrated Pod 5. A Predator steals the artifact and the player defends the cargo area from Aliens until the pod is evacuated. Rykov then destroys the pod's supports, sending it crashing into the valley floor below. Predator In the early 18th century (in Earth time), 500 years before the incident, a Predator spacecraft encounters the planet LV-1201 for the first time and the player Predator is sent there to hunt. The player battles numerous creatures before discovering that Xenomorphs also inhabit the planet. The player tracks the Aliens to their hive and activates an artifact which has the power to repel the Aliens. The game then shifts forward eight months, by which time the Predators have established a camp around the artifact. The player Predator descends into the hive in search of the Alien queen, but the artifact is deactivated and the camp is overrun by Aliens. While repairing a stasis field around a group of Alien eggs the Predator is attacked by a facehugger and the two are caught in the field and trapped in stasis for five hundred years. The Predator awakens when Dunya deactivates the artifact, and the player tracks her to the research facility's Forward Observation Pods and breaks into Pod 5, inadvertently allowing the Aliens into the pod. The player retrieves the artifact and sends a signal to other Predators who are nine weeks away. The Predator is then killed by the Alien embryo bursting through his ribcage. Predalien The Predalien character's story also begins 500 years earlier. The player begins by controlling a facehugger, exploring the Alien hive and Predator camp in search of a host. The facehugger attacks the Predator, but both become trapped in the stasis field. The game then shifts forward five hundred years to the chestburster emerging from the Predator inside Pod 5. The creature is an Alien/Predator hybrid, called the \\"Predalien\\" in the game, and the player controls it and searches for food until it grows into an adult. The player then battles human guards in search of the artifact, but is interrupted when Rykov destroys the pod's supports. The player must then battle several android guards in armored exosuits in order to escape the pod with other Aliens before it falls into the valley below. =Reception= The expansion pack received more mixed reviews than the original AvP2, and has a score of 55 according to Metacritic. GameSpot cited it as \\"being boring\\", \\"repetitive\\", and \\"giving no sense of direction as the face-hugger\\". Echoing this, IGN concluded that the title was \\"[boring], stale, frustrating and plain, Primal Hunt tarnishes the good AvP name\\".

Features of extreme carving that distinguish it from other kinds of snowboard carving include: *The use of wider boards to accommodate extreme edge angles (the angle between board base and snow surface) produced deep in turns. Heel and toe overhang prevent narrower boards from reaching angles close to 90 degrees that are experienced in extreme carving. *High degree of extension to the whole of the body during the middle of the carved turn, when the snowboard is facing down the fall line of the slope. *Proactive compression of the body during edge transitions. This maneuver is also known as a cross-through or push-pull turn. During any carved turn on a sufficiently steep slope, the perceived g-force will build up at the end of the carve, resulting in a natural compression of the body. The proactive compression in extreme carving is different from this natural compression in that it is done by pulling the legs up in anticipation of the additional force, instead of allowing the legs to get pushed up as a reaction to the additional force. The snowboarder pushes the board away at the apex of the turn, and the g-force is also distributed along the whole arc of the turn, reducing the pressure on the leg at the turn exit, thus allowing the exit of the turn and the preparation of the next turn with legs flexing again (the pull sequence). *Large, progressive rotation of the torso in the turning direction, such that the rider's shoulders and chest are perpendicular to the toe edge during toe-side turns, and facing towards the nose of the board during heel-side turns. This is in contrast with contemporary carving methodology that indicates that one's torso should stay at an angle midway between the angles of the two bindings, and also with the old school technique where the torso faces the nose of the board at all times. * Minimum use of arms and non-necessary movements: the goal is to create a precise and perfect turn with a style that shows control and mastery of all the parameters at stake. History Belonging to the Alpine snowboard type, it has its roots from an evolution of the Euro Carve, or Vitelli turn, also called V-turn, that was pioneered by early snowboarders in the late '80s in the west Alps (Jesse Fernandes, Jean Nerva, Serge Vitelli and other pro slalom riders). The laid carving technique was slowly improved by two Swiss snowboarders, Jacques Rilliet and Patrice Fivat away from the trends in Zinal, Valais by using the rotation turn technique used in the Swiss Snowboard school, and the term Extremecarving was used by them to describe the fact that the laid technique pushes the body to the maximum possible contact with the snow. They created in 2001 a website that explained the technique and it led to a growing international community of riders using this riding technique, among others for riding alpine snowboards.

Early life Born in Calgary, Alberta and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Whitaker was educated at the University of Toronto Schools and later at the Royal Military College of Canada, student # 2357 in Kingston, Ontario. He graduated in 1933. He was a quarterback for the Hamilton Tigers of the Ontario Rugby Football Union. He joined the Canadian Army and accepted a commission, as a second lieutenant with The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) in 1937. Military career During the Second World War, Whitaker was awarded the Distinguished Service Order at the rank of captain for his achievement in the Battle of Dieppe in August 1942. He was the only one of the 100 officers who landed on the beach to fight his way into town and escape unwounded. As a lieutenant colonel, Whitaker commanded the 1st Battalion, The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry‚Äì Canadian Army Active from February 17, 1944 until July 17, 1944 and from September 15, 1944 until March 29, 1945, throughout most of the fighting in northwest Europe. On 16 October 1944, during the Battle of the Schedlt Whitaker took the village of Woensdrecht, which presented particular problems for the Canadians in their advance by the banks of the river Schedlt.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 34 He won a second Distinguished Service Order in February 1945 for leadership in the Battle of Goch-Calcar Road during Operation Veritable . At the end of the war, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier. Whitaker left the army in 1951, but returned as Honorary Colonel of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry from 1972 to 1992. Business career After his military service, he was a commercial manager of radio station CHML. In 1962, he was named vice-president of O'Keefe Brewing Co. and soon became the president. He was also the president of Major Market Advertising and a financial consultant with Nesbitt Burns. Sports career Whitaker's sports career was equally illustrious, beginning with captaincy of the Royal Military College of Canada ice hockey and Canadian football teams. He led the Hamilton Tigers in 1938. He was named to the Canadian Forces Sports Honour Roll and was a national senior squash champion. He chaired the Canadian Equestrian Team for 20 years, and under his guidance the team won two Olympics, 15 Pan-American Games and two World Championship gold medals. He was also chef-de-mission for the 1980 Canadian Olympic Team in Moscow, which the Canadians eventually boycotted, along with the Americans due to the Soviets invading Afghanistan. He was a founder and member of the Olympic Trust of Canada. In 1990, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. Denis was one of the founding members of the Hamilton Hunt Club, started in 1958 in Caledonia, Ontario. He was a Master of Foxhounds and rode with the club from 1958-1973.

Brent Bozell III in 1995. Through publications on its website including staff reviews, research reports, and web-based newsletters, the Council proclaims television programs or other entertainment products to be beneficial or harmful to the development of children and works to encourage broadcasters and content producers adhere to the council's advice. Council activities include attempts to hold advertisers accountable for the content of the programs they sponsor, encouraging the development of what the council considers to be responsible, family-friendly entertainment, encouraging broadcasters to stop and/or limit television content the council says to be harmful to children, as well as pressuring cable operators to unbundle cable channels so consumers can pick and pay for only the channels they want to watch. The council launches several media campaigns a year against the producers and advertisers of television programs they perceive to be indecent. A typical campaign involves press releases declaring a particular program harmful (often with a list of \\"unacceptable\\" character behavior or situations), the organized mass mailing of form letters and emails to advertising sponsors of unapproved programs, organized mass filing of complaints via the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website complaint form, and direct threats of long, potentially costly FCC license challenges to local network affiliates planning to broadcast what the council considers harmful network programming. In 2004 the FCC revealed the Parents Television Council as the primary source of most content complaints received. Throughout its existence, the Parents Television Council has been accused of promoting censorship. History Steve Allen, former host of The Tonight Show, was PTC's Honorary Chairman and a member of its Advisory Board. In 1989, the Media Research Center (MRC) began monitoring the entertainment industry for alleged liberal bias through its Entertainment Division and newsletter TV, etc. MRC founder and president L. Brent Bozell III later felt that decency was declining on most prime-time television programming. The PTC began operations in 1995 following private planning meetings with Charlton Heston, Michael Medved, and others in the entertainment industry, who would eventually make up the Advisory Board of the PTC. After the release of its first annual Family Guide to Prime-Time Television following the 1995-1996 television season, the PTC hoped to hold the entertainment industry accountable for the indecency that it perceived to be prominent on prime-time television. By 1996, the organization had the support of several members of the U.S. Congress, including Joe Lieberman and Lamar S. Smith, and an estimated annual budget of $142,000. By 1998, with an estimated membership of 120,000, comedian and former The Tonight Show host Steve Allen joined PTC as its Honorary Chairman, and PTC released a report questioning the accuracy of the TV Parental Guidelines ratings system and campaigning for advertisers to stop sponsoring programs that the PTC claimed were offensive. Allen launched a newspaper advertisement campaign promoting the PTC, which was published in many outlets including The New York Times. The PTC was noted for criticizing such shows as Ally McBeal, Dawson's Creek, Ellen, Friends, and Spin City.\\" Its website was also introduced that year, and its annual budget had already surpassed $1 million. PTC rolled out another round of full-page newspaper advertisements in 1999; San Francisco Examiner television columnist Tim Goodman perceived Allen and the PTC of advocating complete censorship of television to allow only what PTC considered \\"Family-Safe TV\\". The PTC lost nearly $1 million in 2008 and in 2009 received $2.9 million in revenue, a 29 percent drop from the previous year. In 2009 and 2010, the PTC cut its staff by 38 percent to save money. Leadership L. Brent Bozell III, a conservative political activist, founded the Parents Television Council in 1995. PTC was founded in 1995 by longtime political activist L. Brent Bozell III. Bozell is a prominent conservative activist who has, among other things, served as Executive Director of the Conservative Victory Committee, a political action committee that has supported the election of dozens of conservative candidates over the past ten years. He was also National Finance Chairman for Pat Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign, and later president of the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Bozell was succeeded as PTC President by Timothy F. Winter. Winter served as Executive Director of the PTC for three years prior to becoming president. Prior to joining the PTC, Mr. Winter's 20-year career as a media executive included positions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and NBC. Until 2015 when his position was terminated, Dan Isett, Director of Corporate and Government Affairs of the PTC, represented the PTC on the Consumer Advisory Committee of the Federal Communications Commission. Advisory Board The PTC also has an Advisory Board consisting of politicians and entertainers working to assist the council in their goal of protecting children against profanity and violence in the media. Notable members of the advisory board include singer Pat Boone, former football player Mel Renfro, writer-producer Coleman Luck, country musician Billy Ray Cyrus, comedian and actor Tim Conway of CBS's The Carol Burnett Show, former U.S. Senator from Kansas and 2008 presidential candidate Sam Brownback, film critic Michael Medved, star of 1980s soap opera Dallas Susan Howard, and ION Television producer Gary Johnson. In addition, the PTC has established numerous local chapters for most American media markets. Notable former Advisory Board members include - both of whom are now deceased - comedian Steve Allen, original host of NBC's The Tonight Show, and C. Delores Tucker, participant in the Civil Rights Movement and activist against gangsta rap music; Allen is now given the title of National Honorary Chairman-Emeritus. Bah√ße≈üehir University associate professor Christian Christiansen questioned the backgrounds of certain PTC advisory board members as not consistent with their stance on morality. Publications =Columns and reports= The website of the PTC features reports on what the group says is harmful content on television and regular writings from its staff. Their research is done with the support of their Entertainment Tracking System, an archive of prime-time television programming that they claim is the largest in the world.\\"Saving the World's Largest Archive of Prime-Time Television\\". Parents Television Council. Retrieved April 12, 2007. Such publications include: * \\"Culture Watch\\" - Throughout 2005 and 2006, the PTC published columns under this series authored by Christopher Gildemeister, covering the influence on American culture by entertainment as well as exposing the increase in sex, violence, and profanity in cable television and the methods used by advertisers and broadcasting companies to attract young audiences. In a December 2005 column of his, Advertising Age columnist Simon Dumenco criticized the PTC, arguing that the PTC is \\"very very afraid of gay TV characters\\". Culture Watch columnist Christopher Gildemeister defended the PTC as being \\"not homophobic\\" but simply opposed to \\"sexual references or innuendo (of any variety, hetero, homo or other) aired where children might be exposed to them.\\" * \\"Parenting and the Media\\" authored by Rod Gustafson, where he offers advice on parenting children who frequent the media. *\\"TV Trends\\" - Another column by Christopher Gildemeister, published since October 2007 intending to inform parents and TV viewers in general about what he determines to be \\"harmful or questionable prime-time programming.\\" Hartford Courant television critic Roger Catlin quoted Gildemeister as criticizing ABC for having an \\"apparent fetish for transsexuals\\" in certain programs. *Former president Bozell's weekly entertainment column, which it links to within the home page In 2000, PTC's report What a Difference a Decade Makes allegedly stated that there was an increase in profanity, sex, and violence on television during the 1990s. The report also claimed that references to homosexuality increased the most during that decade - by 24-fold. In 2002, the PTC released a report claiming that there was an increase in profanity on network programming shown during the first hour of prime time. In a 2006 report titled Wolves in Sheep's Clothing, analyst Kristen Fyfe reported an increase in violent, profane, and sexual content in children's programming. Among its results, based on research during summer 2005, the PTC stated that Teen Titans was the most violent program, and claimed Cartoon Network had the most violent incidents. Richard Huff of the New York Daily News criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants, \\"Sailor Mouth\\", over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly. Following the 2005‚Äì06 television season, PTC issued a report Faith in a Box that analyzed depictions of religion in primetime television. The study stated that most positive references to religion were on reality shows such as Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, while claiming that scripted shows tended to be more negative towards it. The report also ranked Fox as the \\"most anti-religious network\\", followed by NBC, UPN, ABC, CBS, and the WB. In 2008, PTC published a report titled Happily Never After, using analysis of several primetime shows early in the 2007-2008 television season that asserted that extramarital sex was more favored on television shows during that time period. Ian O'Doherty of The Irish Independent asked regarding the PTC's marriage depiction study: \\"After all, would you rather watch people having fun or would you rather watch a realistic depiction of marriage, which ... would simply be an hour of two people sullenly chewing their food, pausing occasionally only to throw each other filthies and occasionally grumbling under their breath how the biggest regret of their life was ever setting eyes on you and that their mother was right all along?\\" PTC released a report in October 2009 stating that prime-time television shows on broadcast networks had twice as many depictions of violence against women in 2009 than in 2004. In November 2010, the PTC released a study, Habitat for Profanity: Broadcast TV's Sharp Increase in Foul Language, which claims that there was a sharp rise in the usage of profanity between 2005 and 2010‚Äîduring the 8PM to 9PM ET/PT time period commonly referred to them as the Family Viewing Hour, the PTC claimed that there were 111 instances of profanity during this hour in 2010 versus 10 in 2005; during all of prime time, 276 instances in 2010 against 11 in 2005. The study claimed that there was a 69.3% increase in prime time in general between 2005 and 2010, with the Fox network being heavily accused of bringing a 269% increase for the network during that period. The study also claimed instances in which there was profanity, but the offending word was bleeped out. =Entertainment reviews and analysis= The PTC's activities extend to evaluation, rating, and educating around broadcast TV programs according to a traffic light system across three categories of sex, violence and profanity, accumulating to an overall rating based on the ratings of these three categories. The guide has been in use since the 1995‚Äì96 season using the traffic light system. In the PTC's definition of its traffic light system, green light indicates that the program is \\"appropriate for all ages\\", a yellow light indicates that the program \\"would be unsuitable for children under the age of 14\\", and a red light indicates that the program is \\"appropriate for adult audiences only\\". Every television season since 1995‚Äì96, the council has released a list of the best and worst prime-time television programs for family viewing. The PTC's website includes the guide from the 1996-97 season at the earliest. Starting with the 2005‚Äì2006 season, their list was based on their traffic light system as well as Nielsen Media Research ratings of viewership among children ages 2‚Äì17 of certain shows. Popular shows that have frequently been praised as the most family-friendly programs on television include George Lopez, 7th Heaven, Touched by an Angel, Home Improvement, Family Matters, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Boy Meets World, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, American Idol, Dancing with the Stars, NBC Sunday Night Football, Deal or No Deal, and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Popular shows frequently named \\"Worst of the Season\\" include American Dad!, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, House, Two and a Half Men, Ally McBeal, Dawson's Creek, Grey's Anatomy, The Drew Carey Show, Family Guy, Friends, The O.C., Spin City, That '70s Show and Will and Grace. On a weekly basis, the PTC publishes reviews of what they consider to be the best and worst television programming for family viewing, authored by the various entertainment analysts at the council. Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy, compared the PTC's frequent negative reviews of the series to \\"hate mail from Hitler\\" and \\"They're literally terrible human beings. I've read their newsletter, I've visited their website, and they're just rotten to the core. For an organization that prides itself on 'Christian' values ... they spend their entire day hating people.\\" MacFarlane became a target again when the PTC protested the Academy Awards' decision to have him host the 85th ceremony. \\"So You Think You Can Rate a TV Show?\\", the title being a play on the title of Fox television series So You Think You Can Dance, is a weekly column the PTC began in July 2007 to claim that networks inaccurately rate their shows based on the TV Parental Guidelines, whether the network applied the improper age-based rating (such as TV-PG or TV-14) or failed to include the proper content descriptors (such as \\"L\\" for language or \\"V\\" for violence). =Seal of Approval= To recognize excellence in the media, the Parents Television Council awards its Seal of Approval to television shows, movies, home products, and advertisers that provide or sponsor content it deems to be \\"family-friendly\\". It is divided into two categories: Entertainment and Advertiser. Popular television shows that have been awarded include 7th Heaven, American Idol, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Everybody Loves Raymond, George Lopez, JAG, Reba, Smallville, Touched by an Angel, The West Wing, and The Wonderful World of Disney. Also receiving the Entertainment Seal of Approval are TiVo's KidZone television filtering service, The Jimmy Wilson Films Children\`s Adventure Series, the Sky Angel Christian television service, and the CleanFlicks DVD filtering product. Activism =World Wrestling Federation campaign and lawsuit= In 1999, the PTC launched a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their SmackDown! program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children had been killed by peers emulating professional wrestling moves learned from the program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true. On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed a lawsuit against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it was wrong to blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF. During the conflict the WWF created the Right to Censor (RTC) stable, a group of wrestlers that parodied the PTC by portraying them as self-righteous moral crusaders. =Broadcast indecency= In 2003, the PTC unsuccessfully campaigned for the FCC to take action against the NBC television network in response to the use of the word \\"fucking\\" by Bono, lead singer for the rock band U2, during the network's January 2003 telecast of the Golden Globe Awards. Among an audience of nearly 20 million, the FCC received only 234 complaints, 217 of which came from the PTC. In October 2003, the FCC decided not to fine NBC because Bono's obscenity was ruled as fleeting and not describing sexual or excretory functions, the FCC's standard for fining a network for indecency. After the PTC filed an Application for Review to the FCC, in March 2004 the FCC decided that the word was indecent by law but still decided not to fine NBC; however, the ruling was to serve as a warning to networks that there would be a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy towards obscene language willfully used during the daytime. However, the PTC's complaints about profanity used by presenter Nicole Richie in the December 10, 2003 broadcast of the Billboard Music Awards led the FCC to conclude that the language violated decency law. The PTC began attracting more attention after it filed around 65,000 complaints to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, in which one of performer Janet Jackson's nipple shielded breasts, was exposed for 9/16ths of a second. FCC chairman Michael Powell stated that the number of indecency complaints to the FCC had risen from 350 in the years 2000 and 2001, to 14,000 in 2002 and 240,000 in 2003. It was also found that the PTC had generated most of the indecency complaints received by the Federal Communications Commission. In July 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit voided the fine. PTC campaigns led to a great increase in FCC-issued fines and received complaints compared to those from previous years. After the halftime show, the PTC launched five more FCC complaint drives, starting March 2004 with an episode of Fox's That '70s Show titled \\"Happy Jack\\", which revolved around character Eric Forman being caught masturbating. The beginning of the 2004‚Äì2005 television season sparked four new campaigns, the first being against NBC's animated series Father of the Pride, stating that it contained a \\"barrage of sexual innuendo and profanity\\" while being promoted \\"from the creators of Shrek\\", which they felt would potentially attract children to watching the series. That campaign led to over 11,000 email complaints to the FCC. Later, shortly after CBS broadcast the word \\"fuck\\" during an airing of Big Brother 5, the PTC took action again, this time claiming that CBS ignored a warning from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that there would be zero tolerance toward unbleeped profanity. However, those complaints became moot when Viacom, then-owners of CBS, settled with the FCC for $3.5 million regarding all allegedly indecent programming broadcast in the years around 2003 and 2004, including the Big Brother 5 episode in question. In March 2006, the FCC ruled that Father of the Pride was not indecent. Following were complaints about an October 2004 episode of ABC's short-lived teen drama Life As We Know It, which the PTC felt was sexually charged. The PTC started off 2005 with their campaign against the Without a Trace episode \\"Our Sons and Daughters\\", leading to CBS being fined for indecency in March 2006; the PTC objected to the depiction of teenagers participating in an orgy in that episode. CBS argued that the episode \\"featured an important and socially relevant storyline warning parents to exercise greater supervision of their teenagers.\\" The FCC fined CBS $3.63 million in March 2006 for this episode, but after a court settlement, the network agreed to pay $300,000 in fines. At the end of January 2005, the FCC rejected a set of complaints that PTC filed between October 2001 and February 2004 for allegedly indecent programs such as NBC's Friends, the WB's Gilmore Girls, and Fox's The Simpsons. The FCC received complaints from the PTC in the summer over an unedited broadcast of the lyric \\"who the fuck are you?\\" in The Who's song \\"Who Are You\\" from the Live 8 concert broadcast July 2, 2005 on ABC stations on the East Coast. In 2006, PTC requested that the FCC deny broadcast license renewal for Salt Lake City CBS station KUTV because they felt that the broadcast of the Without a Trace episode that was ruled indecent violated community standards and that CBS failed to take action to reduce indecent content following the FCC fines. Subsequently, CBS agreed to pay the FCC $300,000 to settle the KUTV license challenge. Starting from December 2007, the organization demanded that CBS cancel its plan to rebroadcast an edited version of the Showtime drama Dexter, whose title character was a serial killer and police forensics analyst, because it felt that the program would glorify murder even with the edits. By early February 2008, the Council claimed to have collected 17,000 complaints to CBS. On January 25, 2008, the FCC proposed an estimated $1.4 million fine against ABC for a scene of female nudity in the NYPD Blue episode \\"Nude Awakening\\" aired on February 25, 2003. Because the episode aired outside the indecency \\"safe harbor\\" in the Central and Mountain Time Zones, the fine applied only to ABC stations in those zones. During the season when the episode aired, NYPD Blue was shown on ABC on Tuesdays, 10:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time Zones) and 9:00 P.M. in the Central and Mountain zones. The PTC praised the FCC's action. However, PTC president Winter condemned ABC's decision to appeal the fine in federal court. PTC has also criticized the Third Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to void the FCC's fine for the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. TV series that the PTC has targeted for FCC complaints in 2008 have included NBC's Today morning show and CBS primetime programs Big Brother 10, Survivor: Gabon, and Two and a Half Men. Profanity was the main concern for Today and Big Brother 10, the extremely brief exposure of contestant Marcus Lehman's penis for Survivor: Gabon, and a \\"lap-dance\\" scene for Two and a Half Men. The PTC's first complaint in 2009 was over sexual content in an episode of Family Guy titled \\"Family Gay\\". Later in 2009, the PTC urged affiliates of The CW Television Network to pre-empt a Gossip Girl episode to be aired November 9; the episode would reportedly contain a threesome scene. In response to Adam Lambert's performance of his song \\"For Your Entertainment\\" at the end of the 2009 American Music Awards broadcast on ABC, PTC urged viewers to complain to the FCC if living in an area where the performance was shown before 10 p.m. local time. PTC complained that the performance contained a simulation of oral sex. Lambert's performance reportedly was broadcast around 11 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time, \\"outside the FCC's usual 6am-10pm time frame prohibiting the broadcast of indecent material\\". ABC also received about 1,500 telephoned complaints. In January 2010, the PTC launched a complaint campaign after the American Dad! episode \\"Don't Look a Smith Horse in the Mouth\\" aired in January 2010. The FCC fined Fox $25,000 on June 4, stating that they failed to respond to an inquiry of 100,000 complaints about the episode. A month later, Fox slammed the decision, claiming that it was \\"unconstitutional\\". On May 20, 2010, the PTC announced that it plans to target CBS and its affiliates after the network announced that the new sitcom $#*! My Dad Says was added to the 2010-2011 fall TV lineup. The PTC cites both the show's title and its Thursday 8:30PM timeslot as reasons. The series is based on the popular Twitter account created by Justin Halpern, who also served as one of the co-producers on the show. CBS defended its decision and said that it was working with the account's creator and its content was toned down for the program before the series premiere in September. In October 2010, the PTC targeted an episode of the Fox series Glee, stating that the episode featured outfits that were scantily clad and guest-star Britney Spears going shopping in lingerie, calling it, \\"an endorsement of narcotics abuse, public masturbation, and school-sanctioned burlesque.\\" They were also criticizing it for making an episode idolizing Britney in the first place, stating: \\"Perhaps most troubling is the deification of a troubled popstar into a symbol of empowerment and self-esteem.\\" On October 20, PTC criticized GQ magazine for featuring three Glee stars posing in risque outfits; the PTC statement said that the photoshoot \\"borders on pedophilia.\\" The PTC called on the United States Department of Justice and the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress to investigate whether MTV violated child pornography laws in casting teenaged actors in Skins, a remake of the British TV series of the same name. MTV rated Skins \\"TV-MA\\", meaning the show is not suitable for audiences under 17. The Los Angeles Times responded in an editorial: \\"...looking for government remedies is ineffective and unwise; we suspect the network's editors are smart enough to skirt prosecution. The Federal Communications Commission doesn't regulate the content of cable networks, and even if it did, a crackdown on shows like \\"Skins\\" would be a bad idea, because adults should be able to watch whatever they like on cable and federal attempts to protect kids from adult programming have never been successful.\\" =Advertising= In May 2005 Carl's Jr. introduced its \\"Spicy BBQ Six Dollar Burger\\" in a television advertisement featuring celebrity Paris Hilton in a swimsuit, soaping up a Bentley Arnage while leaning on it, and then eating the burger. A similar ad with Hilton for Hardee's hamburger chain was aired in June 2005. The Parents Television Council and other media watchdog groups criticized the commercial for being shown during programs that were very likely to be watched by children. Melissa Caldwell, PTC research director, said, \\"This commercial is basically soft-core porn. The way she moves, the way she puts her finger in her mouth‚Äîit's very suggestive and very titillating.\\" The group mobilized more than one million members to contact the restaurant chain and voice their concern and claimed that \\"[i]f this television commercial were to go unchallenged it would set a new standard for acceptable television commercial content.\\" Caldwell, then- president Bozell, and then-executive director Winter appeared on various news programs such as Good Morning America, Today, The Early Show, American Morning, and The O'Reilly Factor to discuss this issue. Andy Puzder, CEO of Carl's Jr., says the group needs to \\"get a life ... This isn't Janet Jackson‚Äîthere is no nipple shield in this,\\" referring to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy. He continued, \\"There is no nudity, there is no sex act ‚Äî it's a beautiful model in a swimsuit washing a car.\\" In addition to featuring the ad on their web site, Carl's Jr. also set up another website playing a longer version of the commercial. PTC accused television commercials for Hardee's \\"biscuit holes\\" food product of suggesting double entendres. The commercial featured consumers suggesting \\"A-holes\\" and \\"B-holes\\" as nicknames for the biscuit holes. Boddie-Noell Enterprises, which owned 350 Hardee's restaurants in four states, refused to show the ads in its respective markets. Ben Mayo Boddie, chairman of Boddie-Noell, wrote a letter to the PTC condemning the ads as well. =In-flight entertainment= In September 2007, the PTC launched a campaign to get airlines in America to reduce the number of \\"PG-13\\" and \\"R\\"-rated films shown as in-flight entertainment. Consequently, Heath Shuler, Democratic representative of North Carolina, introduced the Family Friendly Flights Act of 2007 bill to require airlines to set aside \\"child-safe\\" viewing areas for families to sit in planes. The bill never became law. =YouTube= Twice has the PTC targeted video-hosting website YouTube in its campaigns and statements. PTC called for NBC to reconsider uploading the uncensored clip of the Saturday Night Live novelty song \\"Dick in a Box\\" on NBC's site and YouTube channel. In 2008, the PTC released a report The \\"New\\" Tube: A Content Analysis of YouTube‚Äîthe Most Popular Online Video Destination, which praised YouTube for filtering adult content but criticized the site for not filtering profanity and other explicit content from comments sections or videos. =Ethics controversy= In October 2010, The New York Times reported that former PTC vice president of development Patrick W. Salazar had accused PTC of mishandling hundreds of thousands of mailings to donors and members. Based on Internal Revenue Service filings, the American Institute of Philanthropy rated PTC \\"C+\\" on financial efficiency. Salazar also disputed the PTC's official membership figure of 1.3 million and estimated that at most 12,000 people respond to annual fundraisers. Although Salazar stated that he left the PTC in November 2009, the PTC said that it fired Salazar and that Salazar was trying to extort money from the organization. =Other= The PTC also criticized The Muppets for not meeting \\"family viewing\\" guidelines and suggested a boycott, based on the mockumentary format of the series including mentions of plastic surgery, \\"inside\\" business language being used in a crude manner, and the Muppets in a bar consuming alcoholic beverages. The PTC also criticized the U.S. version of Sex Box, due to it being a live sex show on basic cable. Viewpoints On its website, PTC states that its mission is to \\"promote and restore responsibility and decency to the entertainment industry in answer to America's demand for positive, family-oriented television programming.\\" The PTC believes that the entertainment industry‚Äînot only television but also music, movies, and video games as well‚Äîand its sponsors share responsibility with parents for children's television viewing habits. It therefore believes that television is harming children through a perceived \\"gratuitous\\" amount of sex, violence, and profanity. Its activism has influenced the removal of potentially objectionable content from certain shows, such as the fourth season of the popular CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Increased government regulation of broadcasting is another viewpoint supported by PTC. PTC considers itself nonpartisan; Originally published by The Dallas Morning News as \\"Networks rebelling against Mom, Dad.\\" others have considered the PTC to be bipartisan or socially conservative. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times called the PTC \\"the Gladys Kravitz of public advocacy\\" in a column of hers and believed the PTC supported a federal policy on broadcast decency she called \\"Big Nanny run amok\\". =V-Chip= Since the V-Chip was established in conjunction with the TV Parental Guidelines ratings system, PTC has frequently accused the guidelines of having inaccuracy and low standards. In 1997, PTC was twice as likely to rate a show with the toughest rating classification, \\"red light\\" in the PTC's case, and \\"TV-14\\" in the Guidelines. Bill Berkowitz quoted PTC president Bozell as stating, based on PTC research, that \\"the current ratings system and V-chip are failures.\\" In response to a V-Chip advertising campaign in the summer of 2006, Bozell proposed instead that cable companies either apply FCC-style broadcast television standards or offer choice in ordering channels. Television Watch considers PTC's reporting on the V-chip inaccurate and ideologically charged. =Cable choice= The PTC is an avid supporter of \\"a la carte\\" cable television services to allow families to choose only the cable television channels that are appropriate for their children, and also impose the same decency standards already in place on broadcast television on cable channels. Frequently, the Council has criticized programs on BET, Comedy Central, E!, FX, MTV, Spike, TNT, and VH1 because they claim some of the content aired on those channels is inappropriate for younger viewers. On the other side of the issue, the PTC has awarded its \\"Seal of Approval\\" to cable networks Disney Channel and Hallmark Channel for their original programs several years ago. On June 14, 2007, United States Representatives Dan Lipinski (Democratic, Illinois) and Jeff Fortenberry (Republican, Nebraska) introduced into legislation the Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007, which intends to allow families to choose and pay for only the cable television channels that they want to watch. In September 2007, the PTC launched a new website, HowCableShouldBe.com, to allow cable customers to see how much they are paying for their monthly cable bill currently. In August 2013, the PTC released a statement criticizing MTV for the airing of a performance by Miley Cyrus during its Video Music Awards and urged Congress to pass the Television Consumer Freedom Act. Popular music In April 2008, PTC released The Rap on Rap, a study covering hip-hop and R&B; music videos rotated on programs 106 & Park and Rap City, both shown on BET, and Sucker Free on MTV. PTC urged advertisers to withdraw sponsorship of those programs, whose videos PTC stated targeted children and teenagers \\"with adult content ... once every 38 seconds\\". PTC also warned radio stations about playing the Britney Spears song \\"If U Seek Amy\\" over concerns it contained an audible use of an obscenity. In response to the music video to Miley Cyrus' song \\"Who Owns My Heart\\", the PTC stated that it felt it was \\"unfortunate that she would participate in such a sexualized video like this one\\"; ironically, Miley Cyrus' father Billy Ray Cyrus sat on the PTC Advisory Board at the time. In May 2011, the PTC took issue with Rihanna's music video for her song \\"Man Down.\\" In the video Rihanna portrays a woman who resorts to killing the man who had previously raped her. They claimed the video promoted gun crime and murder, while the pop star said she wanted to be a voice to victims. After the video became the most viewed YouTube video that week, she sarcastically used Twitter to thank the PTC in helping her make the video such a success. Criticism The PTC has been frequently criticized for hypocrisy, slanted reporting and only criticizing shows that are aimed at adults. Critics of the PTC have alleged that it supports increased governmental censorship of television by lobbying the FCC for indecency enforcement for certain television shows and inaccurately reporting on the V-Chip in order to further their agenda.Parents Want Control of TV. TV Watch. March 15, 2007. Retrieved April 22, 2007. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, who is frequently criticized by the PTC, said in The Advocate In January 2005, Bah√ße≈üehir University associate professor Christian Christiansen questioned the backgrounds of certain PTC Advisory Board members (L. Brent Bozell III as 'National Finance Chairman for the 1992 \\"Buchanan for President\\" campaign' of \\"neo-fascist Pat Buchanan\\"; Susan Howard's portrayal of adulterous Donna Culver Krebbs on TV series Dallas, which series \\"was soaked in scantily-clad women, emotional cruelty, violence, alcoholism, and marital infidelity\\"; Coleman Luck as 'writer and producer' ...

But now he's discovered the location of the gunrunner who killed his family--and he's going undercover and taking on a whole crooked town in order to get his man!\\"'; and John Carvelli, 'who, in 1987, \\"took part in a fact-finding mission in Nicaragua and Honduras with the National Conservative Foundation during the Nicaraguan civil war.\\"'), as not consistent with their stance on morality. In a December 2005 column of his, Advertising Age columnist Simon Dumenco claimed that the PTC is \\"very very afraid of gay TV characters\\". Culture Watch columnist Christopher Gildemeister defended the PTC as being \\"not homophobic\\" but simply opposed to \\"sexual references or innuendo (of any variety, hetero, homo or other) aired where children might be exposed to them.\\" See also * Anti-pornography movement *Parents Music Resource Center *Think of the children *Criticism of Family Guy References  * =Citations= Category:Political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Conservative organizations in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1995 Category:Internet properties established in 1998 Category:Censorship of broadcasting in the United States Category:Censorship in Christianity Category:Entertainment rating organizations Category:Non-profit organizations based in Alexandria, Virginia Category:Non-profit organizations based in California Category:Television organizations in the United States Category:Catholic organizations established in the 20th century Category:Christianity and politics Category:Political organizations based in the United States Category:Catholic Church in the United States Category:Censorship in the United States Category:First Amendment to the United States Constitution Category:Christianity and society in the United States Category:1995 establishments in the United States ","title":"Parents Television Council"},{"id":"1251103","text":"The Rer Bare (or Rerebere, Adona) are a tribe in Ethiopia's eastern Ogaden region on the Shabele River, near Somalia, who currently speak Somali.

It means Chief or Commander and is common in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, Iran, Caucasus, Central Asia and Eastern Europe (former Yugoslav) and among their respective diaspora. Etymology The origin of beg is still disputed, though it is mostly agreed that it is a loan-word. Two principal etymologies have been proposed. The first etymology is from a Middle Iranian form of Old Iranian baga; though the meaning would fit since the Middle Persian forms of the word often mean ‚Äúlord,‚Äù used of the king or others. The second etymology is from Chinese po ‚Äúeldest (brother), (feudal) lord‚Äù. Gerhard Doerfer seriously considers the possibility that the word is genuinely Turkish. Whatever the truth may be, there is no connection with Turkish berk, Mongolian berke ‚Äústrong‚Äù or Turkish b√∂g√º, Mongolian b√∂ge ‚Äúwizard, shaman.‚Äùhttp://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/beg- pershttp://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baga-an-old-iranian-term-for-god- sometimes-designating-a-specific-god Beg was also subsequently used as a military rank in the Ottoman Empire. It was also used during the Qing dynasty in China. When the Qing dynasty ruled Xinjiang, it permitted the Turkic Begs in the Altishahr region to maintain their previous status, and they administered the area for the Qing as officials. High-ranking Begs were allowed to wear the Queue. Use as a name For the Persian use, it is common to see the name Beg added to the Persian suffix of 'zada' (male), 'zadi' (female), which means 'son of' or 'daughter of'. For Example: Mirza Begzada or Noor Begzadi. For the Turkish use, it is most common to see the spelling Beg or Bey utilized. (Sometimes, it is used along with the title \\"Mirza\\", similar to the Mughal usage).. For the Mughal dynasty use, the honorific title Mirza () was added before the given name for all the males and 'Baig' () for the males or Begum () for the females, was added as a family name. For example: Mirza Abdullah Baig or Farzana Begum. This was the historical naming convention for the descendants of the Mughal dynasty, Today, however, it is common to see descendants of the Mughals use Baig as a middle name and Mirza as the surname or vice versa. For example: Abdullah Baig Mirza or Abdullah Mirza Baig. For the Slavic or Bosniak use, it is common to see the name Beg added to the Slavic suffix of 'ovic', 'ovich', which roughly means 'descendant of'. While the title \\"Beg\\" is not in use in Bosnia anymore, track of families of \\"Beg\\" descent is kept. But a surname containing \\"-begoviƒá\\" suffix in itself is not a clear indicator of descent. For example, there is a number of \\"Begoviƒá\\" families, some are of noble descent, some not. \\"Idrizbegoviƒá\\" would be another example of a non-noble family with the suffix. Some examples of \\"beg\\" families are: ≈†ahbegoviƒá, Rizvanbegoviƒá, ≈†aƒçirbegoviƒá. On the other hand, \\"Kukavica\\" is an example of a famous \\"beg\\" family, not containing the title in itself. The book by Enver Imamoviƒá \\"Porijeklo i pripadnost stanovni≈°tva Bosne i Hercegovine\\" details the origin of a big number of families in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are various other alternative spellings used today as well, such as: Begh, Begg, Beigh, Beyg, Bayg, Bek, Bik.

Dogs commonly display possessive aggression when defending resources or themselves. Canine aggression may be influenced by a dog's age, sex, health and reproductive status. Canine aggression is one of the most serious behavior problems in animal behavioral medical science. Aggression in canines is particularly important because a dog's sharp teeth can result in serious injuries. The determinants for each type of aggression are different, but there are specific factors that are common to canine aggression. The types of aggression include dominance aggression, defensive aggression, predatory aggression and maternal aggression. Aggression in canines may be a self-defense response to a person or animal entering a dog's space, which may be ritualized aggression, not actual aggression, if the violation includes a threat. Aggressive behavior in scared dogs is typically not true aggression but rather ritualized behavior intended to avoid physical altercation by way of faking aggression rather than actual aggression, anxiety disorder, diet, gut microbiome or genetic background. Some aggression can be treated through animal behaviour therapy or avoided by proper socialization during puppyhood.  Types of aggression  = Dominance aggression = Dominance aggression is the most common type of aggression in dogs and approximately 60% of aggressive dogs exhibit dominance aggression. Dominance aggression occurs when a dog battles familiar people or other dogs for higher hierarchical position. An owner plays a significant role in dominance aggression because 40% of dominance aggression circumstances are related to non-authoritarian dog owners who spoil their dogs and provide poor levels of obedience training. The actions of an owner and the relationship between a dog and its owner influence dominance aggression in dogs. For instance, the punishments endured by the dog, the obedience training received by the dog, the quality time spent with the dog and how spoiled a dog is contribute to dominance aggressive behavior. = Defensive Aggression = Defensive aggression, also known as fear aggression or avoidance-motivated aggression, occurs when an individual approaches and interacts with a dog. The dog might first try to flee, but resorts to aggressive behavior if cornered. The dog displays aggressive behavior in an attempt to avoid a real or perceived negative consequence, such as to avoid pain. Dogs may display a multitude of behaviors leading up to an attack including fear and stress signals, defensive posturing, facial expressions, or no signals at all. Tortora in 1983 experimented with a shock therapy to retrain avoidance- motivated aggressive dogs to condition them with safety cues, a process which he called Safety Training. He wrote that this therapy, when successful, had long-term benefit for the dog and its owners. = Predatory aggression = Predatory aggression is impacted by anxious influences and it includes behaviors such as biting. Predatory aggression is usually seen as part of the prey drive sequence starting with a visual or auditory trigger followed by chase, capture and kill. Predatory aggression is impacted by anxious influences, which results in the expression of affective aggression. This type of aggression is caused by sympathetic system activation and is non-affective. Based on a study that examines the predatory aggression in German shepherd dogs, this type of aggression is rarely displayed by dogs. However, if it does occur, it is usually directed towards unfamiliar dogs. Furthermore, predatory behavior activates reward centers in the central nervous system. According to Gonzalo and colleagues, this type of behavior is rewarding and therefore difficult to change. Predatory aggression is displayed by mature and intact males and this type of aggression results in serious damage to others. It includes actions such as chasing, biting, catching and may involve death or injury. Maternal aggression is displayed by mothers that are protecting their offspring. Maternal aggression decreases as their offspring grow up and they are able to defend themselves. = Maternal aggression = Maternal aggression is displayed by mothers when they are approached and particularly when their offspring are young. This type of aggression is linked to pain such as in cases of mastitis. Oxytocin plays an important role in the early bonding between the mother and her offspring. Dogs with maternal aggressiveness are protective of their offspring and nest. The change in hormone is linked to lactation, and the mothers can change the dogs' perception and assessment . Maternal aggression may lead to bites or other attacks. Maternal aggressiveness affects the growth and socialization of puppies. Furthermore, this type of aggression may stem from unstable social environments. Maternal dogs are very protective of their puppies and their aggressive tendencies decreases as their offspring grow up and they are able to defend themselves. Causes = Gut microbiome = Lactobacillus are present in the guts of dogs that exhibit aggressive behavior. The gut microbiome is linked to numerous health problems such as diarrhea and bowel disease, which results in pain and can possibly lead to aggression. The gut microbiome affects the affective disorders such as anxiety, which contribute to canine aggression. Based on a study carried out by Kirchoff and colleagues, the composition of gut microbiome differs on the basis of aggressive and non-aggressive assessments. In this study, the researchers tested rescued dogs that possessed aggressive and non aggressive behavior. The dogs were tested in the same environment, ate the same diet, and were consistent breed type, but variation was still present in the gut microbiome. The results of this study show the difference and abundance in lineages in aggressive and non-aggressive groups, indicating that an aggressive dog displays physiological conditions in their gut, which affects the composition of the gut microbiome. It also shows that the gut microbiome is associated with aggressive behavior. Lactobacillus are present in the guts of dogs that exhibit aggressive behavior, even though strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus reduce stress and anxiety in mice. However, Fusobacterium is present in the stool sample of dogs that display non- aggressive behavior, even though it is known to evoke pro-inflammatory effects of gut microbiome. = Anxiety = Some aggression stems from generalized anxiety. The dog cannot determine the difference between a legitimate threats and false threats. Some signs of anxiety include dilated pupils, constant yawning and lip licking, ears pulled back, trembling, tail tucked and lowered body or head. An anxious dog may pace or be unable to relax even when there is no threat present. Anxiety screening was used in behavioral evaluation of children-directed aggressive behavior in dogs and according to Reisner and colleagues, 77% of animals displayed abnormalities. Aggressive behavior in dogs is often associated with fear, the separation from their owner, or noise sensitivity, all of which may result in or contribute to anxiety disorder. = Fear = In a study that examines the prevalence, comorbidity, and behavioral variation in canine anxiety, fearful dogs are aggressive to strangers and other dogs. The owners of 673 dogs noted that their dogs express fear by barking, and growling. The presence of aggression in dogs is associated with defense mechanism. Based on this study, there was an increase in bites towards strangers and familiar people. The reason for aggression towards owners is because the majority of owners who participated in this study owned a fearful dog. Ethologist Roger Abrantes explains an alternative view, that it makes no sense to say that fear causes aggression because if aggression came from fear, natural selection would have long ago eradicated supposed \\"fear aggressive\\" dogs. Fear does not cause aggression, Abrantes explains, but instead, the cornering (or other threatening actions) done to dogs, combined with inability or unwillingness to recognize and accept dogs' peace-making behaviors, is how one creates aggression in dogs that are not \\"aggressive\\". True aggressive behavior is behavior designed to eliminate competition from an opponent by injuring (or killing) that opponent. = Breed, socialization, and health status = alt= It is important to recognize that aggression is displayed more in certain breeds, which indicates the influence of genetic background on aggression in dogs. According to Roll and Unshelm, German Shepherd dogs and Bull Terriers are more likely to display violent behavior to others. Voith and Borchelt found that higher incidences of aggressive behavior were displayed in purebred dogs when compared with mixed breed dogs. Often, aggression in adult dogs is usually a result of little to no contact in early life. In other words, as a result of missed early socialization, a dog will not know how to interact with others, how to follow rules or how to adapt to new environments. Aggressive behavior is more prominent in intact males when compared with neutered males and in sterilized females than intact females. According to Hoerlein, the removal of a male's testicles has significant impact on aggressive and dominant males. Neoplasia of the central nervous system, infectious diseases, developmental and metabolic disorders may impact aggression in dogs. Many of these illnesses can cause aggressive and violent behavior, especially when located in the frontal cortex, the hypothalamus, the thalamus, the amygdaloid body, the medial mammillary, the nucleus, the habenular nuclei, the hippocampus and the caudate nucleus.  Research  Gonadectomy also known as neuter or castration is one of the most common procedures performed on dogs. It is the removal of reproductive organs. This procedure is performed at the veterinary by a professional veterinarian. = Gonadectomy = Gonadectomy is used to treat aggressive behavior of dogs. Farhoody and colleagues carried out a study to determine the impact of gonadectomy on the aggressive behavior of dogs using the Canine Behavioral Assessment Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). According to the data collected, gonadectomized dogs between the ages of 7 and 12 months were more likely to be aggressive to strangers. Furthermore, gonadectomized dogs of all ages do not display violent behavior to familiar people or strangers. The data does not show that gonadectomy prevent or treat aggressive behavior of dogs. Perez- Guisado and Munoz-Serrano argued that owner-related factors were the primary cause of aggression in dogs. Based on their studies, dogs owned by first time owners and with little training displayed aggressive behavior. Based on McMillan and colleagues‚Äô research, aggressive behavior was prominent in dogs obtained from pet stores. Guy and colleagues found that environmental factors directly contributed to aggression in dogs. For instance, a dog that lives in a home with an adolescent or has a skin disorder is more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior to familiar people and strangers. Roll and Unshelm believed that the reason for buying or adopting a dog was a significant factor that correlated with aggression. They also argued that the relationship between the owner and dog determined whether or not the dog would exhibit aggressive behavior. For instance, the owner's attitude towards training, or physical mistreatment endured by the dog at the hands of the owner resulted in aggressive behavior towards others. Many factors impact the aggressive behavior displayed by dogs. = Reactivity to stimuli = According to Arata and colleagues, reactivity to stimuli is involved in various types of aggression. The researchers used a questionnaire survey to assess approximately 5000 dogs of 17 breeds. In this study, a factor analysis was used to extract five consistent factors in 14 of the 17 breeds. Using 14 behavioral items, the researchers were able to see the consistent presence of these factors in dogs, indicating that these factors are linked to canine aggression. The collected data and the established factor system indicated that the French Bulldog, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Golden Retriever, and Labrador Retriever did not display aggressive behavior. However, the Chihuahua and Miniature Dachshund were more aggressive and more likely to chase others. Based on this study, reactivity to stimuli was linked to owner-directed aggressive behavior in 13 different breeds, child-directed aggressive behavior in eight different breeds, stranger-directed aggressive behavior in nine breeds and dog-directed aggressive behavior in five breeds. In this study, dogs that are highly reactive to stimuli were either uneasy and reacted to all movements or less engaged and overreacted to unexpected stimuli. The association between canine aggression and sociability with humans and likeliness to chase were examined. Sociability with humans was linked to child-, stranger-, and dog-directed aggressive behavior in more than seven breeds. Moreover, likeliness to chase was primarily linked to dog-directed aggressive behavior in 10 breeds and dogs that were more likely to chase smaller animals displayed aggressive behavior when interacting with other dogs. Reactivity to stimuli was proven to be an underlying temperamental factor that leads to canine aggression.  Treatment  A dog is being walked by its owner with a leash, which is used to establish and maintain control. It is an owner's responsibility to modify aggressive behavior of their dog. Treatment differs for each circumstance, and treatment plans are based heavily on the type of aggression. Based on Judith Blackshaw's study, dogs exhibited dominance aggression towards familiar people and therefore suggested obedience training as the proper treatment. According to a study conducted in 1983 by Tortora, avoidance based aggression was treated by conditioning the dog to a safety tone, this resulted in a complete elimination of the aggressive behavior for the duration of the dogs lives. It is imperative for an owner to train their dog every day for a minimum of 10 minutes. More specifically, it is recommended for males to be neutered as this ensures that inherited aggression will not be passed on. It is suggested to use synthetic progestins with castration to reduce and eliminate aggressive behavior in dogs. Predatory and intermale aggression is inherent and related to testosterone secretion and as a result restrain, castration and the use of progestins are essential in reducing aggression in dogs. Missed early socialization and an absence in obedience training result in aggression in dogs. Animal behaviour therapy (ABT) aims to reduce aggressive behaviour in dogs by applying scientific ideologies. Behaviorists aim to familiarize dogs with trigger stimuli by continuously exposing them to it. ABT ranges from relaxing a dog by giving massages to implementing consistent obedience training in the daily life. 40% of dominance aggression in dogs is a result of lenient owners who provide basic levels of obedience training to their dogs. A dog is an owner's responsibility and it is necessary for the owner to establish leadership over the dog. A leash that is also known as a control line is critical in establishing and maintaining control. Furthermore, it is important for the owner to eat before the dog as this allows the owner to regain power and authority over the dog. The food within the home must be inaccessible, giving more power to the owner. By concealing food, the dog will stop growling and display submission. Poor obedience training and leniency will not reduce aggression in dogs, but will increase damage and injury. It is the owner's role to modify aggressive behaviour of dogs by implementing various techniques.

He received his law degree from the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Nicaragua of Le√≥n in 1964, where he obtained the Gold Medal for being the best student. In 1977 Ram√≠rez became head of the \\"Group of Twelve\\", a group of prominent intellectuals, priests, businesspeople, and members of civil society who publicly stated their support for the Frente Sandinista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional (FSLN) in its struggle to topple the Presidency of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. With the triumph of the Revolution in 1979, he became part of the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction, where he presided over the National Council of Education. He was elected vice-president of Nicaragua in 1984 and was sworn in 1985. Though the FSLN lost power to the UNO coalition headed by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in 1990, Ram√≠rez continued to serve as the leader of the Sandinista block in the National Assembly until 1995, when he founded the Movimiento de Renovaci√≥n Sandinista (MRS) because of his differences with other leaders of the FSLN, such as former president Daniel Ortega, on issues of democratic reform. He has since become retrospectively critical of certain Sandinista policies that he views as having turned the country against the FSLN. He made an unsuccessful bid for president on the MRS ticket in 1996. Since then, Ram√≠rez has retired definitively from politics and his literary work has gained international recognition and his novels have been translated into several languages. He recently won the \\"Carlos Fuentes\\" prize, awarded by Mexico, in recognition for his life long work. He currently lives in Managua but travels extensively because of his many commitments as a writer. Sergio Ramirez at home in Managua. September 2001 He married his wife, Gertrudis \\"Tulita\\" Guerrero Mayorga, in 1964. He has three children: Sergio, Mar√≠a , and Dorel and eight grandchildren. =Writings= Ram√≠rez began his literary career as a short story writer. His first story, \\"The student\\", was published in 1960 in Ventana, a magazine in Le√≥n. His first book, published three years later, was just a collection of stories, but the following, published in 1970, was a full-length novel. Since then, he has alternated these genres with essays and journalism. His international breakthrough came in 1998 when he won the Alfaguara Prize with his novel Margarita, How Beautiful the Sea. In 1990, he founded La Quincena, a political journal based in Managua that would be published for ten years. He is presently a columnist for La Prensa as well as several newspapers around the world, including El Pa√≠s, La Jornada, El Nacional, El Tiempo and La Opini√≥n. He is also the Director of Car√°tula, a Central American cultural e-magazine. In January 2000, he was awarded the first \\"Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas Narrative Prize\\" from the Casa de las Am√©ricas. He has taught at the University of Maryland from 1999 to 2000 and again in 2001, and has been visiting professor at various major universities in the United States and Europe. He is also the President of , the most important literary festival in the region.

In the 1930s, he made photographs on the streets of Paris. He was a champion of humanist photography and with Henri Cartier-Bresson a pioneer of photojournalism.W. Scott Haine, Culture and Customs of France (London Greenwood, 2006), p. 289 Doisneau is renowned for his 1950 image Le baiser de l'h√¥tel de ville (The Kiss by the City Hall), a photograph of a couple kissing on a busy Parisian street. He was appointed a Chevalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honour in 1984 by then French president, Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Photographic career Doisneau was known for his modest, playful, and ironic images of amusing juxtapositions, mingling social classes, and eccentrics in contemporary Paris streets and cafes. Influenced by the work of Andr√© Kert√©sz, Eug√®ne Atget, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, in more than twenty books he presented a charming vision of human frailty and life as a series of quiet, incongruous moments. Doisneau's work gives unusual prominence and dignity to children's street culture; returning again and again to the theme of children at play in the city, unfettered by parents. His work treats their play with seriousness and respect. Early life Doisneau's father, a plumber, died in active service in World War I when Robert was about four. His mother died when he was seven. He then was raised by an unloving aunt.Sunday Times. 6 November 2005. It started with the kiss. by John Follain At thirteen he enrolled at the √âcole Estienne, a craft school from which he graduated in 1929 with diplomas in engraving and lithography. There he had his first contact with the arts, taking classes in figure drawing and still life. When he was 16 he took up amateur photography, but was reportedly so shy that he started by photographing cobble-stones before progressing to children and then adults. At the end of the 1920s Doisneau found work as a draughtsman (lettering artist) in the advertising industry at Atelier Ullmann (Ullmann Studio), a creative graphics studio that specialised in the pharmaceutical industry. Here he took an opportunity to change career by also acting as camera assistant in the studio and then becoming a staff photographer. Photography in the 1930s In 1931 he left both the studio and advertising, taking a job as an assistant with the modernist photographer Andr√© Vigneau. In 1932, he sold his first photographic story to Excelsior magazine. In 1934, he began working as an industrial advertising photographer for the Renault car factory at Boulogne- Billancourt. Working at Renault increased Doisneau's interest in working with photography and people. Five years later in 1939, he was dismissed because he was constantly late. He was forced to try freelance advertising, engraving, and postcard photography to earn his living. At that time the French postcard industry was the largest in Europe, postcards served as greetings cards as well as vacation souvenirs. In 1991 he said that the years at the Renault car factory marked \\"the beginning of his career as a photographer and the end of his youth.\\" In 1939, he was later hired by Charles Rado of the Rapho photographic agency and traveled throughout France in search of picture stories. This is where he took his first professional street photographs. War service and resistance Doisneau worked at the Rapho agency until the outbreak of World War II, whereupon he was drafted into the French army as both a soldier and photographer. He was in the army until 1940 and from then until the end of the war in 1945 used his draughtsmanship, lettering artistry, and engraving skills to forge passports and identification papers for the French Resistance. Post-war photography Doisneau (left) and Andr√© Kert√©sz in 1975 at Arles Some of Doisneau's most memorable photographs were taken after the war. He returned to freelance photography and sold photographs to Life and other international magazines. He briefly joined the Alliance Photo Agency but rejoined the Rapho agency in 1946 and remained with them throughout his working life, despite receiving an invitation from Henri Cartier-Bresson to join Magnum Photos. His photographs never ridiculed the subjects; thus he refused to photograph women whose heads had been shaved as punishment for sleeping with Germans. In 1948 he was contracted by Vogue to work as a fashion photographer. The editors believed he would bring a fresh and more casual look the magazine but Doisneau didn't enjoy photographing beautiful women in elegant surroundings; he preferred street photography. When he could escape from the studio, he photographed ever more in the streets of Paris. Le Groupe des XV was established in 1946 in Paris to promote photography as art and drawing attention to the preservation of French photographic heritage. Doisneau joined the Group in 1950 and participated alongside Rene-Jacques, Willy Ronis, and Pierre Jahan. The 1950s were Doisneau's peak, but the 1960s were his wilderness years. In the 1970s Europe began to change and editors looked for new reportage that would show the sense of a new social era. All over Europe, the old-style picture magazines were closing as television received the public's attention. Doisneau continued to work, producing children's books, advertising photography, and celebrity portraits including Alberto Giacometti, Jean Cocteau, Fernand L√©ger, Georges Braque, and Pablo Picasso. Doisneau worked with writers and poets such as Blaise Cendrars and Jacques Pr√©vert, and he credited Prevert with giving him the confidence to photograph the everyday street scenes that most people simply ignored. The photography of Doisneau has had a revival since his death in 1994. Many of his portraits and photographs of Paris from the end of World War II through the 1950s have been turned into calendars and postcards, and have become icons of French life.  Le Baiser de l'h√¥tel de ville (The Kiss)  In 1950 Doisneau created his most recognizable work for Life ‚Äì (Kiss by the H√¥tel de Ville), a photograph of a couple kissing in the busy streets of Paris, which became an internationally recognised symbol of young love in Paris. The identity of the couple remained a mystery until 1992. Jean and Denise Lavergne erroneously believed themselves to be the couple in The Kiss, and when Robert and Annette Doisneau (his older daughter and also his assistant at the time) met them for lunch in the 1980s he \\"did not want to shatter their dream\\" so he said nothing. This resulted in them taking him to court for \\"taking their picture without their knowledge\\", because under French law an individual owns the rights to their own likeness. The court action forced Doisneau to reveal that he posed the shot using Fran√ßoise Delbart and Jacques Carteaud, lovers whom he had just seen kissing, but had not photographed initially because of his natural reserve; he approached them and asked if they would repeat the kiss. He won the court case against the Lavergnes. Doisneau said in 1992, \\"I would never have dared to photograph people like that. Lovers kissing in the street, those couples are rarely legitimate.\\" The couple in Le baiser were Fran√ßoise Delbart, 20, and Jacques Carteaud, 23, both aspiring actors. In 2005 Fran√ßoise Bornet (n√©e Delbart) stated that, \\"He told us we were charming, and asked if we could kiss again for the camera. We didn't mind. We were used to kissing. We were doing it all the time then, it was delicious. Monsieur Doisneau was adorable, very low key, very relaxed.\\" They posed at the Place de la Concorde, the Rue de Rivoli and finally the H√¥tel de Ville. The photograph was published on 12 June 1950, issue of Life. The relationship between Delbart and Carteaud only lasted for nine months. Delbart continued her acting career, but Carteaud gave up acting to become a wine producer.

Rautmann, N. Schalz]. Verlag Herman Schmidt, Mainz, 1992. Personal life In 1936 Doisneau married Pierrette Chaumaison whom he had met in 1934 when she was cycling through a village where he was on holiday. They had two daughters, Annette (b. 1942) and Francine (b. 1947). From 1979 until his death, Annette worked as his assistant. His wife died in 1993 suffering from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Doisneau died six months later in 1994, having had a triple heart bypass and suffering from acute pancreatitis. Annette said \\"We won in the courts (re: The Kiss), but my father was deeply shocked. He discovered a world of lies, and it hurt him. 'The Kiss' ruined the last years of his life. Add that to my mother suffering from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and I think it's fair to say he died of sadness.\\" Doisneau was in many ways a shy and humble man, similar to his photography, still delivering his own work at the height of his fame. He chastised Francine for charging an \\"indecent\\" daily fee of ¬£2,000 for his work on a beer advertising campaign ‚Äì he wanted only the rate of an \\"artisan photographer\\". He lived in southern Paris (Gentilly, Val-de-Marne, Montrouge, and the 13th arrondissement) throughout his life. He is buried in the cemetery at Raizeux beside his wife.

Since the Renaissance, it has been considered one of Italy's finest white wines. It was the first Italian wine to be awarded Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1966; on July 9th, 1993 it was upgraded to Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG). J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 732 Oxford University Press 2006 History The earliest recorded mention of the wine appears in the archives of record of San Gimignano from 1276. Due to the difficulties in cultivating the Vernaccia grape, the wine fell out of favor in the early 20th century as the more prolific Trebbiano and Malvasia grapes were planted. By the 1960s, Vernaccia di San Gimignano experienced a resurgence as its distinctive, crisp qualities established it as a popular alternative to the blander wines produced from Trebbiano and Malvasia blends. Viticulture and winemaking The name \\"Vernaccia\\" is applied to several different Italian grapes, such as the Sardinian grape used in Vernaccia di Oristano and the Marche grape used in the sparkling red wine Vernaccia di Serrapetrona. Ampelographers have determined that the variety grown in San Gimignano is different and distinct from the other Italian Vernaccias and is probably not related. The Tuscan variety is believed to be the oldest grape variety but its origins are not clear with ampelographers disagreeing if it originally came from Eastern Europe, Greece or is indigenous to the Italian peninsula. J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 241 Mitchell Beazley 1986 In San Gimignano, the Vernaccia grapes planted in sandstone based vineyards tend to produce the best examples of Vernaccia di San Gimignano. The wine is characteristically dry with crisp acidity and a slightly bitter finish. Most consider Vernaccia di San Gimignano to be a simple, everyday white; its popularity being owed less to what is in the glass and more to it being the local wine of San Gimigniano, one of Tuscany's most touristy towns. Oz Clarke & M. Rand Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 272 Webster International Publishers Despite this reputation, modern winemaking has introduced the use of oak aging to give the wine another layer of complexity and roundness. While very different from the historic style of Vernaccia di San Gimignano, the success of these more modern and international styles has not yet been established. According to DOC regulations, Vernaccia di San Gimigniano must contain 90% Vernaccia, with up to 10% other nonaromatic approved white varieties. In order to meet \\"riserva\\" status, aging must be a minimum of twelve months, including four months in bottle.. Joseph Batianich & David Lynch Vino Italiano: The Regional Wines of Italy\\" pg 201, 433 Clarkson Potter Publishers Vernaccia in literature Vernaccia is mentioned by Dante Alighieri (Purgatorio XXIV) as leading to Pope Martin IV's gluttony. He ate Bolsena eels pickled in the wine. Consorizo Della Denominazione San Gimignano History of Vernaccia di San Gimignano Accessed: December 28th, 2007 Vernaccia was also praised by Francesco Redi in his work, \\"Baccio in Toscana\\" (1685)..

It features newly recorded versions of sketches from the first Monty Python's Flying Circus television series. Next to the television show itself, the album was the first piece of media the Pythons released. It is noted that Terry Gilliam was not included as a member of Python on the album's cast listing (in spite of his brief appearance in the sketch \\"The Visitors\\") and Graham Chapman's name is misspelled \\"Grahame\\".

One of the tracks makes specific mention to the album being in stereo, and Chapman demonstrates it by walking from one speaker to another. The effect was totally lost as the album was recorded in mono, which the Pythons did not know at the time.

G. & Naumov, N., P. (1998) Mammals of the Soviet Union Vol.II Part 1a, SIRENIA AND CARNIVORA (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), Science Publishers, Inc., USA, pp. 193, is an extinct subspecies of gray wolf that once inhabited coastal north-east Asia. Its nearest relatives were the wolves of North America rather than Asia. It was exterminated in Hokkaid≈ç during the Meiji Restoration period, when American-style agricultural reforms incorporated the use of strychnine-laced baits to kill livestock predators. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1178791 Some taxonomists believe that it survived up until 1945 on Sakhalin island. It was one of two subspecies that were once found in the Japanese archipelago, the other being the Japanese wolf. Taxonomy and origin Specimen in Hokkaido Museum The Ez≈ç wolf, or Hokkaid≈ç wolf (Canis lupus hattai Kishida, 1931) is an extinct subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus). In 1890, the skulls of Japanese wolves (Canis lupus hodophilax) were compared with those of wolves from Hokkaido in the British Museum. The specimens were noticeably different and explained to be local varieties of the same subspecies. Later, explorers to the Kuril islands of Iturup and Kunashir believed that the wolves they saw there were the Japanese subspecies. In 1889, the wolf became extinct on Hokkaido island. In 1913, Hatta Subur≈ç proposed that the wolf might be related to the Siberian wolf but had no living specimens to undertake further analysis. In 1931, Kishida Kyukishi described a skull from a wolf killed in 1881 and declared it to be a distinct subspecies. In 1935, Pocock examined one of the specimens in the British Museum that had been obtained in 1886 and named it Canis lupus rex because of its large size. Analysis of its mitochondrial DNA showed it to be identical with gray wolf specimens from Canada, Alaska and the USA, indicating that the ancestor of the Ezo wolf was genetically related to the ancestor of North American wolves. The coalescence time back to the most recent common ancestor for two Ezo wolf samples was estimated to be 3,100 (between 700‚Äì5,900) years ago, and the Ezo wolf is estimated to have diverged from North American wolves 9,300 (between 5,700‚Äì13,700) years ago. These estimates indicate that Ezo wolves colonized Japan more recently than Japanese wolves from the Asian continent during the last glacial period via a land bridge with Sakhalin Island, which existed up to 10,000 years ago. The Tsugaru Strait was 3 km wide during the last glacial period, which prevented Ezo wolves from colonizing Honshu and they likely arrived in Japan less than 14,000 years ago. A more recent study estimates their arrival in Hokkaido less than 10,000 YBP. Stable isotope analysis measures the amount of different isotopes of the same element contained within a specimen. When conducted on the bone of an extinct specimen, it informs researchers about the diet of the specimen. In 2017, radiocarbon dating and an isotopic analysis of bone collagen was conducted Ezo wolf specimens. The radiocarbon dating confirmed that the wolves spanned different time periods dating back as far as 4,000 years ago. The isotopic analysis showed that feeding habits of these wolves were similar to the modern \\"coastal\\" British Columbia wolf, with both populations dependent on both marine and terrestrial prey. :See further: Evolution of the wolf#Into America and Japan Range Japanese archipelago 20,000 years ago with Hokkaido island and Sakhalin island bridged to the mainland, thin black line indicates present-day shorelines.

Information on the animal's presence on the Kuril islands is often contradictory or erroneous. It was tentatively recorded to inhabit Kunashir, Iturup and Paramushir, while wolves reported on Shumshu were later dismissed as feral dogs. A survey undertaken in the mid 1960s could not find a wolf on any of the Kuril islands but did find many feral dogs.Heptner, V. G. & Naumov, N., P. (1998) Mammals of the Soviet Union Vol.II Part 1a, SIRENIA AND CARNIVORA (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), Science Publishers, Inc., USA, pp. 177, Description A study of Ezo wolf morphology showed that it was similar in size to the gray wolf of the Asian and North American continents. It stood 70‚Äì80 cm at the withers. in Japanese, measurements in English Soviet zoologist Vladimir Heptner wrote that the wolves (classed under the nomen dubium C. l. altaicus) of Kamchatka (where C. l. hattai's range is supposed to have encompassed) are just as large as C. l. lupus, with light gray fur with dark guard hairs running along the back.Heptner, V. G. & Naumov, N., P. (1998) Mammals of the Soviet Union Vol.II Part 1a, SIRENIA AND CARNIVORA (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), Science Publishers, Inc., USA, pp. 187-88, History =In Ainu culture= The Ainu revered the wolf as the deity Horkew Kamuy (\\"howling god\\"), in recognition of the animal's similar hunting habits. Wolves were sacrificed in \\"sending-away\\" iomante ceremonies, and some Ainu communities, such as those in Tokachi and Hidaka, held origin myths linking the birth of the Ainu to a coupling between a white wolf and a goddess. Ainu hunters would leave portions of their kills for wolves, and it was believed that hunters could share a wolf's kill if they politely cleared their throats in its presence. Because of the wolf's special status in Ainu culture, hunters were forbidden from killing wolves with poison arrows or firearms, and wasting the pelt and meat of a wolf was thought to provoke wolves into killing the hunter responsible. The Ainu did not differentiate wolves from their domestic dogs, and would strive to reproduce wolf traits in their dogs by allowing dogs in heat to roam freely in wolf-inhabited areas in order to produce hybrid offspring.Walker, B. L. (2009), The lost wolves of Japan, University of Washington Press, pp. 83, =Extinction on Hokkaido island= With the onset of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Emperor Meiji officially ended Japan's long-standing isolationism through the Charter Oath, and sought to modernize Japan's agriculture by replacing its dependence on rice farming with American-style ranching. Ohio rancher Edwin Dun was hired as a scientific adviser in 1873 for the Kaitakushi (Hokkaido Development Agency), and began promoting ranching with state-run experimental farms. As wolf predation was inhibiting the propagation of horses in southeastern Hokkaid≈ç and allegedly causing hardship to Ainu deer hunters, the Meiji government declared wolves as \\"noxious animals\\" (y≈´gai d≈çbutsu), entrusting Dun to oversee the animals' extermination. Dun began his work at the Niikappu ranch with a mass-poisoning campaign involving the use of strychnine-laced baits. This was supplemented by a bounty system established by the Kaitakushi.Brett L.

KDAL is currently owned and operated by Midwest Communications. Midwest Communications also owns KDKE, WDSM, WDUL, KTCO, and KDAL-FM in Duluth. All the Duluth stations share the same studio location at 11 East Superior Street, Suite 380, in downtown Duluth. KDAL broadcasts Minnesota Twins baseball, local news, weather, school closings, and cancellations. It is well heard throughout northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. History former logo KDAL went on the air as a 100-watt station at 1490 kHz on November 22, 1936. The KDAL call sign came from the founder's name, Dalton A. LeMasurier. LeMasurier was President and General Manager of the station for many years. On September 5, 1937, power increased to 250 watts and the station joined the CBS Radio network. KDAL switched dial positions to the current 610 kHz on October 24, 1941, increasing power to 1000 watts. The switchover was dramatically made from a plane flying over the city. In 1947, a new transmitter and tower were constructed at 63rd Avenue West and the harborfront. The facilities remain to this day. KDAL got another power increase again to 5,000 watts on August 7, 1947, as a new transmitter and tower were constructed. This enabled KDAL to serve an even wider area. The event was celebrated with a \\"Kilowatt Karnival\\" in the Duluth Armory. In the 1948-1949 season, CBS raided NBC and grabbed some of their biggest stars. Radio's highest rated program, \\"The Jack Benny Program\\", moved to CBS and KDAL in January, 1949. \\"Amos 'n' Andy\\", \\"George Burns & Gracie Allen\\", \\"Edgar Bergen & Charlie McCarthy\\" and Bing Crosby also made the switch. CBS was suddenly the number one network and KDAL finally made some headway against NBC's WEBC. KDAL made the jump to television as KDAL TV-3 in 1953. Both stations have remained with CBS up to the date of this writing in 2009. KDAL TV became KDLH in the late 1970s. KDAL featured a full service AC format during the 1980s and 1990s.

He was one of the Chicago Seven defendants charged for anti-war demonstrations and large-scale protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He had a prominent organizational role in the American anti-Vietnam War protest movement of the 1960s. In the early 1970s, Davis became a follower of Guru Maharaj Ji (Prem Rawat) and his Divine Light Mission. He began to travel as a spiritual lecturer. He also became a venture capitalist, and founded the Foundation for a New Humanity to combine these goals. Background Born in Lansing, Michigan, in 1941 to Mary and Richard Davis, he grew up in Berryville, Virginia. His father worked in nearby Washington, DC, including serving as chief of staff to Council of Economic Advisers under President Harry S. Truman. Davis graduated from Oberlin College in Ohio. In the 1960s, Davis became active in the Students for a Democratic Society. He was the National Director of their project of community organizing programs (the Economic Research and Action Project, or ERAP) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Davis became increasingly allied with anti-war groups, and helped organize protests and related events before and during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago for the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (\\"the Mobe\\"). Democratic Convention protests and subsequent trial Davis was one of the principal organizers of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam to plan anti-war protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He negotiated unsuccessfully to gain a permit with Chicago city counsel David Stahl. At a \\"police riot\\" in Grant Park, Davis was among protesters beaten by Chicago police officers, and he suffered a concussion. Unlike some other leaders, Davis was committed to nonviolence. His injury by police shook the protesters' remaining belief in pacifism. The Chicago Eight (later known as the Chicago Seven) were eight men charged with conspiracy, inciting to riot, and other charges related to the nonviolent and violent protests that took place in Chicago. The original eight protester/defendants, indicted by the grand jury on March 20, 1969, included Davis, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, John Froines, Lee Weiner, and Bobby Seale, a Black Panther leader. During the early part of the trial, Seale's case was separated from the others. The Chicago Seven defense attorneys were William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass of the Center for Constitutional Rights. The judge was Julius Hoffman. The prosecutors were Richard Schultz and Tom Foran. The trial began on 24 September 1969. On 9 October the Illinois National Guard was called in to join the Chicago police for crowd control, as demonstrations grew outside the courtroom. Divine Light Mission In the early 1970s Davis became a follower of Guru Maharaj Ji (Prem Rawat). He was a spokesperson and speaker at the widely publicized Millennium '73 event organized by Divine Light Mission in the Houston Astrodome.Kent, Stephen A. Dr. From slogans to mantras: social protest and religious conversion in the late Vietnam war era, Syracuse University Press, (2001), p. 52 He described the arrival of Guru Maharaj Ji as, Texas Monthly quoted Davis as stating: \\"This city is going to be remembered through all the ages of human civilization.\\" An Op-ed in the San Francisco Sunday Examiner speculated at the time as to whether Davis had undergone a lobotomy, and suggested, \\"If not, maybe he should try one.\\"Brown, Mick.

He played in Major League Baseball as a right- handed pitcher for the Kansas City Royals, Oakland Athletics, New York Mets, and Anaheim Angels. Appier's solid pitching during his first full season in the majors earned him several rookie accolades in . His fastball, tight slider and nasty forkball contributed to impressive pitching statistics, distinguishing himself as one of the American League's top right-handed starting pitchers throughout much of the 1990s. Appier enjoyed the most success with the Royals in the early to mid-1990s as one of the league's earned run average leaders, a Cy Young Award contender in and culminating in with a selection to the American League All-Star team. He was a starting pitcher on the World Series Champion Anaheim Angels in before retiring four seasons later. Kansas City Royals Appier had a strong rookie campaign for the Royals in 1990, going 12-8 and posting the league's fourth-best ERA (2.76), thus earning him Rookie Pitcher of the Year honors. In , he had 13 wins (tied for the team best), and pitched 3 shutouts, two of which were back to back against the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. He was the Opening Day starter in and posted a 15-8 record with the league's second-best ERA (2.46) for a team that only went 72-90. Highlights of the season included a career-high nine-game winning streak and the American League Pitcher of the Month award for July, in which he went 4-0 with a 1.55 ERA. In , Appier posted an 18-8 record with an AL leading 2.56 ERA, set a club record of 33 consecutive scoreless innings, and finished third in Cy Young Award balloting. In , he was selected for his only All-Star team, pitching 2 perfect innings for the American League. He reached a career high in strikeouts in with 207, and won his first of two Roberto Clemente Awards (the other in ). Appier suffered through his first sub-.500 season in 1997, despite posting a 3.40 ERA (7th best in AL) Despite being one of the better pitchers in baseball during this time period, his accomplishments went largely unnoticed due to playing for the Royals, a small market team that was generally not in contention during Appier's tenure. In , under the promise of the team's improvement, he signed a long-term extension. During that offseason, he suffered a fall at his home resulting in a separated clavicle. Though he recovered from that injury, in March 1998 he needed surgery for an unrelated long-term progressing shoulder ailment, the repair of a torn labrum, causing him to miss nearly the entire 1998 season. In , after losing faith in the direction of the Royals organization and eager to play with a contender, Appier requested to be traded. In the middle of the 1999 season, Appier was dealt to the Oakland A's for three pitchers, Jeff D'Amico, Brad Rigby and Blake Stein. Oakland Athletics As the Athletics made their surprising run winning the AL West title in , Appier provided a solid veteran arm in support of Oakland's developing young starters, making his 8th Opening Day start and winning 15 games for the fifth time in his career. Despite a good showing, he lost his only start in that year's ALDS when the Athletics were shut out. In Game 5, after the Yankees scored 6 runs in the first inning, Appier (for the first time in 10 years) came in to relieve in the 2nd inning, pitching four innings and allowing one run. For the series, Appier posted a 3.48 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 10.1 innings pitched. New York Mets A free agent after the season, Appier signed a contract with the New York Mets, with which he tied for the team lead in wins, going 11-10 with a 3.57 ERA and went undefeated in his final 12 appearances, going 6-0 during that span. Making a playoff push, the Mets went 6-0 in his final six starts with Appier going 4-0 with a 1.87 ERA. Anaheim Angels After the one season campaign in New York, Appier was traded to Anaheim for Mo Vaughn. During a solid season with the World Series winning Angels in , Appier went 14-12 with a 3.92 ERA. In Game Two of the ALDS, Appier went 5 innings, giving up 3 runs, and left the game leading 4-3, but received a no-decision in an Angels victory after a blown save by Francisco Rodr√≠guez. In Game One of the ALCS, Appier went 5 innings in a 2-1 loss against the Minnesota Twins. He also started Game Five, going innings and leaving with the Angels leading 3-2 in the game that sent Anaheim to the World Series, though he once again did not receive the decision. He finished the ALCS with a 3.48 ERA. Starting Game Two of the World Series, Appier did not factor into the decision after allowing 5 runs in 2+ innings, as the Angels went on to win the game 11-10. With the Angels facing elimination, Appier started Game Six, pitching four innings of shutout ball before yielding a fifth inning 2-run HR, and leaving with a man on base who eventually scored via stolen base and wild pitch off Francisco Rodriguez, leaving him with an 11.37 ERA for the Series, which the Angels won in seven games. Return to Kansas City In , Appier was plagued with a previously undiagnosed flexor tendon injury and was eventually released at the end of July. He signed with the Royals, but after five starts needed surgery. After missing most of , Appier briefly retired, but came out of retirement and re-signed with the Royals to a minor-league contract before the season, failing to make the team in Spring training and retiring on March 29. In October, Appier applied for reinstatement with Major League Baseball and signed a minor-league contract with the Seattle Mariners. During 10 games with the AAA Tacoma Rainiers, Appier was 1-2 with a 4.54 ERA. On June 3, , Appier asked for and was granted his release by the Mariners, officially retiring the next month.

The climate in the area of Comorova is warmer compared to other seaside resorts such as Mamaia, Eforie or Costine≈üti. This is because the Comorova resorts are located in the southernmost area, but also because of the reduce of Comorova forest which cooled the area.

Pullip has a jointed plastic body (1:6 scale) and a relatively oversized head (1:3 scale), with eyes that can move from side to side and eyelids that can blink. Pullip was first marketed by Jun Planning out of Japan; but the company underwent management changes in early 2009 and, since then, has operated out of South Korea under the name Groove. Since the release of the original female doll, other companion dolls have been added: male dolls Namu (ÎÇòÎ¨¥, tree)(Namu is not on the market anymore) and Taeyang (ÌÉúÏñë, sun); Taeyang's younger sister, Dal (Îã¨, moon); Dal's best friend, Byul (Î≥Ñ, star); and Pullip's younger brother, Isul (Ïù¥Ïä¨, dew). In February 2013, a new member of the Pullip family was introduced, called Yeolume (Ïó¥Îß§, berry/fruit), who is Pullip's future daughter. There is also a miniature line called Little Pullip, with 1:12 scale bodies and 1:6 scale heads. Pullip and her counterpart dolls are often customized by collectors, with the most common customizations including wig changes, eye color changes, and rebodying. Design Pullip dolls have a unique eye movement mechanism that allows their eyes to move from side to side and their eyelids to blink, all via levers on the back of the head. Pullips released after January 2008 can not only blink but also keep their eyes closed via these levers. Pullip has an articulated body and can be easily customized. Standing at 12 inches tall, Pullip's body is about 9 inches tall and is on the 1:6 scale, while her oversized head is about 3 inches tall and on the 1:3 scale. With a 1:6 scale body, Pullip is approximately the size of many popular playscale fashion dolls, such as Barbie and Jenny. Pullip can sometimes wear playscale doll clothing and shoes. However, the 1:3 scale of her relatively oversized head is approximately the same size as many larger or SD-sized ball-jointed doll heads. =Body types= Pullip's highly articulated stock body has gone through several changes over the years. Early Pullips‚Äîthe first 10 releases from July to December 2003‚Äîhad what is called the Type 1 body, which was a Marmit-style action figure body with visible screws. The first three Pullip releases (Wind/Debut, Street, and Moon) have necks that can snap easily under the weight of the oversized Pullip head, but this fragile neck problem was corrected with later releases. Another common problem with the Type 1 body is vertical splitting between the two halves of the legs. All Pullips released on the Type 1 body have rooted hair. Starting in January 2004 with the release of Pullip Venus, a new stock body was introduced. The Type 2 body had a soft torso, no visible screws, and joints that could be pulled apart. This body had more realistic proportions and, to date, is the most posable, flexible, and articulated Pullip stock body ever released. The primary disadvantage of this body is that the soft plastic torso causes chemical melt on the hard plastic limbs and pieces that remain in contact with it, including the hip joint/lower torso piece and the ball joints of the shoulders. If measures are not actively taken to prevent it, the soft torso can also cause a ring of chemical melt around the neck hole in Pullip's head. Although chemical melt is the most widely recognized problem with the Type 2 body, it is not known whether environmental conditions (heat, humidity) exacerbate the melt. Other common problems with the Type 2 body are that limbs can fall off or pull apart too easily and that the soft torso can pop out of the hip joint. Only the first three Pullips released on a Type 2 body (Venus, Savon, and Nomado) have rooted hair; all subsequent releases, starting with Arietta in March 2004, have glued-on wigs, which can be removed and changed if desired. With the dual release of Lan Ake and Lan Ai in August 2005, the next stock body, the Type 3, was introduced. Relative to the Type 2 body, the Type 3 had less articulation; a smaller, more juvenile sculpt; and hinged wrist and ankle joints. While sturdier than its predecessors, the Type 3 was the least posable stock body and remains so even today. Many Pullip collectors expressed displeasure with the Type 3 body, especially after having grown accustomed to the superior aesthetics and possibility of the Type 2. The most common problem with the Type 3 body is wrist cracking, which was prevalent with the Pullips released after January 2007, starting with Stica. Additionally, the leg and knee joints on the Type 3 body often make a creaking noise when bent. In January 2009 with the release of Neo Noir, another Pullip stock body was introduced: the Type 4, which is still in production today. This body is more posable than the Type 3 and uses peg-and-hole joints to prevent the wrist cracking that occurred with the Type 3 body. Common problems with the Type 4 body are stiff, creaky joints; knees that can bend backwards; and loose- fitting pegs at the wrist and knee, causing limbs to easily slip apart. The vertical leg split that occurred with Type 1 bodies can also sometimes occur at the knees of the Type 4 body. Releases New editions of Pullip dolls are released on a monthly basis. Additional limited-release exclusives are sold occasionally. Each doll has a unique name with distinct face makeup (called a \\"faceup\\"), hair, outfit, accessories, collector's card, doll stand, and box. (Some of the earliest Pullips did not come with a collector's card or a doll stand.) Between 2003 and 2014, there have been over 220 Pullip doll releases. The regular monthly releases of Pullip are limited in that only a certain amount are produced; this number is known only by the manufacturer. Occasionally, a limited-edition, exclusive Pullip will be made in a quantity between 300 and 2000 and will be sold in addition to the regular monthly release. In early 2006, with the release of limited-edition Fall Purezza, Jun Planning announced that it would no longer produce exclusive Pullips because their sales cannibalized the demand for the regular monthly releases. However, the company apparently changed their mind in early 2007 with the release of the first US store exclusive, Haute LA, by HauteDoll, which was later followed by multiple Japan exclusives. Some stores that have had these exclusive Pullips are Toys-R-Us Japan, who sold Vivien in November 2004; Magma Heritage, in Singapore, who sold Bianca, Oren, and Mitzi in 2004; HauteDoll, in Los Angeles and New York, who sold Haute LA and Haute NY in 2007; TBS shop, in Japan, who sold Kirakishou in September 2007 as well as a limited version of Sparrow and (new) Shinku in March 2014; and pullip.net, in South Korea. Until September 2007, the limited-release exclusive dolls came with a certificate showing their production number; however, as of 2014, certificates are included only sporadically with the exclusives/limited-edition dolls. Prior to 2006, Jun Planning released some editions that bore close resemblance to popular characters and celebrities but are not officially licensed. Fantastic Alice is similar to Disney's rendition of Alice in Wonderland. Rida bears resemblance to Nana. The \\"Happy Birthday #2\\" set includes a Native American Pullip named Sacagawea and Namu named Geronimo. In anticipation of the 5th anniversary of Pullip in 2008, five dolls were released as part of the \\"Another Alice\\" limited-edition series, including Another Alice, Another Queen, Another King (Taeyang), Another Rabbit (Dal), and Another Clock Rabbit (Dal). Only 500 of each of these dolls were produced. This series was inspired by Alice in Wonderland. Their original release date was postponed in order to include the updated eye-closing feature on Taeyang Another King, and the series ended up being released in August 2007. Collectors who ordered the complete set received a bonus flamingo figurine. =Collaborations and licensed releases= In 2006, Jun Planning began releasing licensed Pullips based on the characters from the anime/manga Rozen Maiden series. With the exception of the final Rozen Maiden Pullip, Kirakishou (which was an exclusive to TBS/Japanhttp://ishop.tbs.co.jp/tbs/special/rozen-maiden3/index.html TBS ishop), the Rozen Maiden dolls were not limited editions. Since 2007, several Pullip dolls have been released through fashion- and design-based collaborations, such as with designer H. Naoto; clothing brand SunaUna; Lolita fashion houses Angelic Pretty and Baby, The Stars Shine Bright; and doll customizers Kanihoru, Mitsubachi@BabyBee, Silver Butterfly, Sheryl Designs, and PoisonGirl. Several other Pullip dolls have been released through commercial collaborations to portray well-known fictional characters, including Hello Kitty and My Melody from Sanrio; Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu from Neon Genesis Evangelion; Grell, Sebastian, and Ciel from Black Butler; Angelique Limoges, Rayne, and Erenfried from Neo Angelique Abyss; Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Tinkerbell, and Tiger Lily from Disney's Peter Pan film; and Dumbo and Pinocchio from their eponymous Disney films. Three Pullips have been based on characters in Audrey Hepburn films, including Holly, from Breakfast at Tiffany's; Princess Ann, from the film Roman Holiday; and Sabrina, from the film Sabrina. Several Pullips released from 2011-2014 were based on Vocaloid characters.http://www.vocaloidism.com/2011/01/11/new-groove- pullip-dolls/ The majority of these collaborations have not been exclusive or limited-edition dolls, but they do have higher MSRPs than conventional releases because of licensing costs. Pullip's companions =Namu= Namu was the first male counterpart to Pullip, and his character was introduced as her boyfriend. Namu was 34 cm tall and had an oversized head (1:3 scale, like Pullip) and an articulated body. Also like Pullip, Namu's eyes can be moved from side to side and his eyelids can blink via levers on the back of the head. He can be customized similar to Pullip dolls. Clothing for Namu can be exchanged with many 1:6 action figures and dolls, including the modern Ken doll. There were seven versions of Namu released between 2004 and 2005. The first Namu, called Vispo, had rooted hair, similar to the early Pullips; however, all subsequent Namu releases had glued-on wigs. Jun Planning retired Namu in 2005 under the story that he and Pullip had \\"broken up.\\" The final Namu, released in May 2005, was \\"Happy Birthday Namu #2,\\" also called Geronimo, and came in a set together with Pullip Sacagawea. In 2006, a new male doll called Taeyang replaced Namu. =Taeyang= Taeyang was introduced in February 2006 as Pullip's new boyfriend, replacing Namu. The first Taeyang released was named MJ and was intended as a counterpart to Pullip Rida. Taeyang's body is the same as his predecessor, Namu, but his face and head sculpt are different, with a wider jaw and blunter chin. Like Pullip, Taeyang has eyes that move from side to side, and eyelids that can blink and close, via levers on the back of his head. Starting with Taeyang Hash in August 2007, Taeyang's eyelids could remain closed via these levers. Taeyang can be customized, just like Pullip can, with the ability to change his hair, eyes, faceup, and body. He stands 36 cm tall and can exchange clothes with many 1:6 action figures and dolls, including the modern Ken doll. Taeyang is released on a bi-monthly basis by Jun Planning. Since 2006, Jun Planning has released six to seven versions of Taeyang each year, with more than 50 different releases in total. Some of the Taeyang dolls bear close resemblance to popular characters and celebrities. Taeyang Edward Scissorhands is licensed from Tim Burton's eponymous character. Taeyang Shade bears close resemblance to Sherlock Holmes. Taeyang Another King was inspired by the King of Hearts from the Alice in Wonderland story. =Dal= Dal was introduced in October 2006, with the first three versions‚ÄìDrta, Fiori, and Monomono‚Äìreleased concurrently. Dal is profiled as Taeyang's 13-year-old sister, who considers Pullip to be her rival in terms of fashion and style. Just as Pullip is approximately the size of 1:6 scale fashion dolls like Barbie and Jenny, Dal is similar in size to \\"little sister\\"-type dolls such as Skipper and Licca. Dal is 26.3 cm in height and, when standing next to Pullip, comes up to her shoulder. Dal's body articulation is similar to Pullip's. Her eyes move from side to side, but they do not close. Dals can be customized, just like Pullips and Taeyangs. Jun Planning announced in the beginning of 2008 that a new Dal would be released every month. Since then, the manufacturer has occasionally skipped a few months between releases; however, to date, there have been more than 75 Dals released in total. =Byul= Byul was introduced in December 2008, with the first version named Eris. Byul shares the Dal body type but has a different face sculpt. She is profiled as Dal's 13-year-old best friend who has secretly lost her heart to Isul, Pullip's little brother. Just like Dals, Byuls cannot close their eyes, and their height is 26.3 cm. A new Byul is released approximately every two to five months. Since 2008, there have been more than 25 Byul releases. =Isul= Isul is Pullip's 15-year-old brother and was first released in February 2011. The debut Isul was named Apollo and was part of the Steampunk series of Pullip dolls. Like Pullip, Isul has eyes that can move from side to side and eyelids that can blink and close via levers on the back of the head. Isul is profiled as a high school student in San Francisco who likes to play soccer. As a prodigy, he is a fan of reading university literature. In personality, he is said to be very calm, tender and helpful. Isul is 29.5 cm tall. Isul is released approximately once per month, but the Groove sometimes skips a month or two between releases. Since 2011, there have been more than 30 Isul releases. =Yeolume= Released in February 2013, Yeolume is Pullip's future daughter and the newest addition to the Pullip line of dolls. Yeolume is 26 cm tall, and the first release, named Podo, wears a school uniform with a pink and blue bow. According to her biography on the official Pullip website, Yeolume is 10 years old and is an elementary school student. Yeolume is approximately the same size as Dal, and, like Dal and Byul, her eyes moves from side to side but cannot close. However, unlike Dal and Byul, the design of Yeloume's body is very different: she has minimal articulation points, and her body somewhat resembles a Little Pullip (though larger in size) or a Blythe doll. However, Yeolume's arms and legs do bend, and she can be posed to a certain extent. Like the other dolls in the Pullip line, Yeolume is customizable, and her body can easily be swapped for a sturdier, more flexible body (e.g., a Pure Neemo or Obitsu body). =Little Pullip= Little Pullip is a miniature version of Pullip, with a 1:12 scale body and a 1:6 scale head. Often called a \\"mini,\\" these little versions stand about 4.5 inches tall. Little Pullips lack articulated elbows or knee joints, their shoes are painted on, and their eyes do not move or blink. Despite their small size and limited articulation points, they are still somewhat customizable: they can be given new wigs, bodies, eye colors, and makeup. Several editions of Little Pullip are miniature replica of full-sized Pullip dolls with similar name, clothes, hair, and makeup, such as Principessa, Cornice, and Mir. The Little Pullips who happen to not be modeled after a full-sized doll are unique to the Little Pullip line, such as Riletto, Aloalo, and Miss Green. The only Pullip doll that was first released as a Little Pullip and later released as a larger, full-sized doll was Pullip Froggy. There have been themed releases for the Little Pullip line that are distinct and completely separate from the full-sized releases, including the Western astrological signs and the Bremen Town Musicians. Little Pullips were first introduced in January 2005 with the release of Moon, a miniature replica of the full-sized Pullip doll of the same name. Production of Little Pullips stopped in March 2007 but resumed in October 2009 under the name Little Pullip +. The primary difference between the original line and the Plus line is that the latter dolls have a ball-jointed head that can swivel and tilt to different angles, allowing for more expressiveness than the original Little Pullip head, which could only turn from side to side along a single axis. There are also Little Taeyangs, Little Dals, and Little Byuls that are part of the Little Pullip line. The Docolla line (a portmanteau of \\"doll\\" + \\"collaboration\\") was released as an extension of the Little Pullip + line, beginning in July 2011 with the release of miniature Pullip Grell from Black Butler. Related Merchandise =Pullip Costume= Pullip Costume/Fashion are clothes and accessories sold by Jun Planning for Pullip dolls. This includes complete costumes, articles of clothing, and accessories. Pullip Costume items are released sporadically. =Petit Luxury= Petit Luxury are display furniture for Pullip released by Jun Planning of Japan, starting in January 2008. This includes classic French armchairs and other pieces in resin. =Magazine= In July 2005, Jun Planning authorized \\"Pullip Magazine,\\" a book that is 88 pages long and written in Japanese. The magazine book includes the full catalog of each Pullip released up to that point, concepts, interviews with the designers, collaborations with popular clothing lines, guides on customizing Pullips, and outfit patterns of brand-name fashion designs. In August 2010 a second book, entitled \\"Pullip Complete Style\\" and again printed in Japanese, became available to purchase on its own and as part of a special box set with limited-edition Pullip Bonita. This book is 133 pages and features photographs of all the Pullip releases from 2003 to autumn 2010. Customizing Like the more expensive ball-jointed dolls, Pullips are easily customizable. Pullips released prior to March 2004 had rooted hair, but their scalp pieces can be swapped with each other. Beginning in March 2004, all dolls in the Pullip line‚Äìstarting with Pullip Arietta and Namu Trunk‚Äìwere released with removable wigs, thus allowing their hair to be changed more easily. Pullip and her companions can be given new bodies in a process called rebodying. Popular rebodying options include 1:6 scale bodies made by companies such as Obitsu, Volks, and Pure Neemo. Some collectors prefer to rebody with 1:6 scale action figure bodies or with playline doll bodies, such from Barbie or Liv dolls. All dolls in the Pullip line have heads and eye mechanisms that can be taken apart with a screwdriver. Customization changes range from minor, such as new wigs or eye colors, to major, including new faceups and fully custom dolls with completely new designs. More intensive customization can include resculpting the face or body, piercings and body jewelry (which can be done either with glue on the surface of the doll or with a small drill to make a permanent hole), and painted or carved tattoos. Controversy The Pullip release originally scheduled for July 2005 was called Beressa, a \\"lady spy,\\" who came with a black uniform and cap with gold braids and red details, including a red arm band and a pistol. Although no swastikas were visible on the doll or in photographs, the resemblance of the uniform and gun design bore a close resemblance to German SS officer uniforms. Jun Planning announced the cancellation of Beressa out of respect for the 60th anniversary of the Holocaust. Lan Ake, the Pullip that was created to replace Beressa, was delayed by a month; consequently, Jun Planning ended up not releasing a Pullip during July 2005 and instead released Lan Ake and Lan Ai together in August 2005.

Biography =Early life= Initially a lukewarm member of the Polish Reformed Church, under the influence of Jesuits and his first wife he converted from Calvinism to Catholicism. Potocki was married to Zofia Kalinowska and Anna Mohy≈Ça. After careful studies at home and abroad (mostly in France and in the Netherlands) he began his great military career by fighting the rebels with his father and uncles on the side of King Sigismund III at the Battle of Guz√≥w. He then took part in an expedition to Wallachia and in the siege of Smolensk in 1611, during the Polish-Russian war. He also fought in Cecora (1620) and Chocim (1621). He took part in the war with Sweden (1626‚Äì1629) temporarily replacing Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski who suffered a major defeat at G√≥rzna in 1629. He fought the rebellious Cossacks in the years 1637‚Äì1638. =Military career= Anonymous, 17th-century portrait of Potocki He was the podkomorzy (Chamberlain) of Podolia from 1621, castellan of Kamieniec Podolski from 1628, and voivod of the Bratslav Voivodeship from 1631 and the Podolia voivodeship from 1636. Potocki became Field Crown Hetman in 1652 and Great Crown Hetman in 1654. He was voivod of Kiev Voivodship from 1655 and voivod of Krak√≥w Voivodship from 1658. Potocki was also Starost of Halych, Radom, Krasnystaw, Ropczyce, Medyka, Bar, Grodziec, Kolomyia, Mostyska, Drahim√≥w, Letychiv and Dolina.http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\\\\P\\\\O\\\\PotockiStanisK5awRewera.htm He was the Elector of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV representing the Bratslav province in 1632. He was also the Elector of King John II Casimir in 1648 from the province of Podolia. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, it is believed that Potocki saved the king's life near the town of Zbor√≥w. In 1652 he was appointed the Field Hetman of the Commonwealth and two years later he commanded the Polish army against the Russians and Cossacks. In 1655 he fought and won the Battle of Ochmat√≥w. In the same year he was nominated the voivode of Kiev. After the invasion of the Swedish army during the Deluge he was permanently commanding the army in the East, however not engaging against the Swedes. After the defeat of the Russian-Cossack army under Gr√≥dek Jagiello≈Ñski Potocki was forced to surrender to King Charles X Gustav.http://teatrnn.pl/leksykon/taxonomy/term/9082 He later joined the confederation at Tyszowce. In the 1656‚Äì1660 campaigns Potocki was not the supreme commander of the entire forces of the Crown, however he did have control over his division which took part in the battles. He was one of the Hetmans that participated in the Battle of Warsaw in 1656. In 1657 he fought victoriously with George II R√°k√≥czi, and took part in the pinning of his troops near Czarny Ostr√≥w. In 1660, acting jointly with Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, Potocki was victorious over the Russian army led by Vasyl Sheriemietiev, forcing him to surrender at Cudn√≥w. The last time he fought was against the Lubomirski rebels, suffering a defeat at Czƒôstochowa in 1665. During his entire military career, he participated in 46 battles. =Death= Stanis≈Çaw \\"Rewera\\" Potocki died on 27 February 1667 and was buried in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Podhajce. The nickname \\"Rewera\\" was given to Stanis≈Çaw Potocki because of his frequent use of Latin words re vera (meaning 'in fact').

After Mexico threatened to invade Texas, Polk amassed federal troops around Corpus Christi. When Texas became a state, federal troops moved into an area in which the new international boundary was disputed. Mexican troops moved into the same area, and both forces clashed.

Beginning with the Vietnam War, however, Congress has given other various forms of authorization to do so. Some debate continues as to their appropriateness as well as the tendency of the executive branch to engage in the origination of such a push, its marketing, and even propagandizing or related activities to generate such support. In light of the speculation concerning the Gulf of Tonkin Incident and the possible abuse of the authorization that followed, Congress in 1973 passed the War Powers Resolution, which requires the President to obtain either a declaration of war or a resolution authorizing the use of force from Congress within 60 days of initiating hostilities with a full disclosure of facts in the process. Its constitutionality has never been settled, and some Presidents have criticized it as an unconstitutional encroachment upon the President. In 2007, University of Virginia Professor Larry J. Sabato proposed, in his book A More Perfect Constitution, a constitutional amendment that would settle the issue by spelling out the exact powers of each branch in the Constitution itself. One counterargument is that the Constitution is a \\"living document\\" that has survived for over 200 years because not everything is \\"spelled out.\\" In the area of the War Powers Clause, the flexibility provided by the requirement for a congressional statute for a declaration of war and constitutional interpretation could be sufficient. The President could defend the country himself but not use the military offensively without Congress. That would not require a constitutional amendment or a statute like the War Powers Resolution since it has been used since 1787. Some legal scholars maintain that offensive, non-police military actions, while a quorum can still be convened (see Continuity of Government), taken without a formal congressional declaration of war is unconstitutional since no amendment has changed the original intent to make the War Powers Resolution legally binding. However, the US Supreme Court has never ruled directly on the matter and no counterresolutions has come to a vote. In the absence of a determination by the Supreme Court, the principle of separation of powers produces a stalemate on the issue.  Constitutional convention debate  Pierce Butler of South Carolina was the only delegate to the Philadelphia Convention who suggested giving the executive the power to take offensive military action. He suggested that even if the President should be able to do so, he, in practice, would have the character not to do so without mass support. Elbridge Gerry, a delegate from Massachusetts, summed up the majority viewpoint saying he \\"never expected to hear in a republic a motion to empower the Executive alone to declare war.\\" George Mason, Thomas Jefferson, and other contemporaries voiced similar sentiments.Max Rerrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (rev. ed. 1937) at 318-219  Supreme Court cases  *Woods v.

Purvanchal is an important geographic subregion of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar that is within the larger Bhojpuri region. It comprises the eastern end of Uttar Pradesh and parts of western Bihar. Purvanchal includes historically five Mahajanapadas, namely Anga, Kashi, Magadha, Malla, and Vajji. Later Anga was annexed by the Magadha king, Bimbisara and Malla (Gorakhpur) was annexed by Magadha after the death of Gautama Buddha. Etymology The name Purvanchal is derived from two Hindi words, Purv (east) and Anchal (region) which means 'the eastern part of a region more specifically historical region of Hindustan in northern Indian Subcontinent or 'East zone' in contrast to the western regions like Punjab and Rajasthan or northern region like Uttarakhand.  Modern definition  Purvanchal consists primarily of the western Bhojpuri region, and bordered by the Baghelkhand region in the south,the Nepal region in the north and the eastern Awadhi region in the west. There is also a demand for separate state of Purvanchal by the people and Gorakhpur or Varanasi as its capital.

The rich quality of its soil and the high earthworm density in the soil as opposed to adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh makes the region favourable for agriculture. Most of the countryside is given to intensive agriculture. Bhojpuri is the predominant language in the rural and semi-urban areas, in addition to Bhojpuri influenced Hindi, in urban areas. Like Bihar state to the east, a large population, slow economic growth, agricultural mechanisation, and the closure of sugar mills have led to increased unemployment, social and political discontent, and some unrest in the region. Culture The ancient excavated Buddha image inside the Parinirvana Stupa, Kushinagar Purvanchal is one of the most ancient regions of India and enjoys a rich heritage and culture, particularly because of its association with cities like Varanasi and Gorakhpur. A major religious hub in India, it is one of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism and Jainism, and played an important role in the development of Buddhism.

Etymologically the word means \\"dwelling together (syn) in the same house (oikos).\\" Subsequently, any act of civic union between polities of any size was described by the word synoikismos. The closest analogy today is the incorporation of a city; in fact, \\"incorporation\\" is often used to translate synoikismos, in addition to the Latinized synoecism. Synoecism is opposed to Greek dioecism (Œ¥ŒπŒøŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉŒº√≥œÇ, dioikismos), the creation of independent communities within the territory of a polis. Synoecism is the result of a few major factors, mainly an increase in population density of adjacent settlements, with an incorporation proposed for economic, political or ideological advantages, such as the synoecism of the communities of Attica into Athens, or by imposition of a ruling power, such as the synoecism of Messenia into the newly built city of Messene.  Dioecism  A dioecism is essentially the inverse of a synoecism, the releasing of cities, towns or villages from their association with a polis. This process might manifest itself in several ways, such as the settling of new but independent communities within former territory of Constantinople on land abandoned due to a contraction of population, or the contraction of Thessaloniki out of its former neighborhoods outside the city walls due to the occupation of the countryside by the Turks. A conqueror might break up a polis for various reasons. As part of the settlement of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC, the Amphictyonic League was commissioned to destroy 21 or 22 cities of Phocis, many of which had already been burned. They chose the method of dioecism, returning the poleis to their constituent k≈çmai, or villages. The city fortifications were then dismantled. This relatively mild destruction was reversed by Athens and Thebes several years later. They were sympathetic to Phocis but their hands had been legally tied. The cities were re-synoecized. The larger states assisted Phocis to rebuild the fortifications. General concept Although there were differences between synoecism in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, the same general concept is deduced from the history of both civilizations. Before political union, the future (combined) population of the polity constituted smaller settlements that were not obligated to each other, or at least not by the contract that was later to institute their political union. A settlement or group of settlements might be constituents of another polity from which they would be annexed or transferred. In ancient Greece In ancient Greece, society was divided into the demos (Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøŒπ, Œ∫·ø∂ŒºŒ±Œπ; \\"country people\\" or \\"country villages\\") and the \\"asty\\" (·ºÑœÉœÑœÖ) or \\"polis\\" (œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ). The polis was the situs of the princely nobility, gentry, and aristocracy and the sacerdotal and martial families. The distinction between the \\"demos\\" and the \\"polis\\" was politically very important in these ancient states. There was much antagonism between the two bodies of the country and city. Where commerce and trade came to dominate culture and ideology, they encouraged men to live together in larger towns and develop democracies. In the city states of classical Greece, synoecism occurred when the \\"demos\\" combined with and subordinated, usually by force, the \\"politiea\\" in one polity. In the poleis, the synoikistes was the person who according to tradition executed the synoecism, either by charisma or outright conquest; he was subsequently worshiped as a demi-god. The most famous synoikistes was the mythic and legendary Theseus, who liberated Attica from Cretan hegemony and restored the independence of Greece under the leadership of Athens. =In Greek democracies= In ancient Athens, the villages of Attica combined with the polis of Athens; consequently the \\"demos\\" and \\"polis\\" became identical in Athens and the former word assumed preference to denote the whole polity. Popular government was first established in the wealthy and populous Greek cities in Ionia. From this history the word and concept of \\"democracy\\" is derived. This synoecism was one of the primary causes of the Kyklos in ancient Hellas. Synoecism also occurred in the history of Mantineia. In the fifth century, after its synoecism, it became a democracy; in the fourth century, it was again divided (\\"dioikismos\\") and an oligarchy formed. Later, more political upheaval caused another synoecism, thus instituting another democracy. This further occurred in the other Arcadian towns of Tegea and Heraia. =In Greek oligarchies= Ancient Greek states not democratically governed used the word \\"polis\\" in their public documents to signify sovereign power. The Doric states of Crete and Sparta preserved the polis separate from the demos. As late as the second century AD, Cretan towns continued to denote themselves with \\"polis\\". Sparta, however, deviating from this use of the word, denominated itself \\"damos\\" (Œ¥·æ∂ŒºoœÇ) in ancient laws, because it never thought of itself as a body opposed to the Perioeci. M√ºller states: \\"In oligarchical states, as in Elis, the people in later times remained almost constantly in the country; and it frequently happened that grandfathers and grandchildren had never seen the town: there were also country courts of justice, and other regulations intended to make up for the advantages of a city life. Where the courts of justice were at a distance, and there was no inducement to mechanical industry and internal commerce (see the term banausos), the ancient habits of life continued much longer in existence.\\"  In ancient Rome  In ancient Rome, some of the kinds of settlement that were incorporated by synoecism into greater municipal polities were the prefecture (praefectura), a non-autonomous village administered by a prefect; the oppidum, a fortified, autonomous town; the castellum, a small fortified place under or previously under martial jurisdiction; the forum, a marketplace; the conciliabulum, a meeting place; the vicus, a small, private settlement without government; the canabae, a settlement of dependents in the vicinity of a military base; the pagus, a rural village; the gens, a tribal canton; the saltus, a settlement of coloni (farmers) on a large estate, part of which they leased from the conductor (manager); and the colonia, a settlement of colonists from Rome.  As an archaeological site  \\"Synoecism\\" also denominates an ancient Cretan archaeological site on the western fringes of Troullos. Artifacts discovered at the site include a terracotta bull figurine, a bronze statuette, and Late Minoan I pottery.

He is the son of writer Kurt Vonnegut. He is the brother of Edith Vonnegut and Nanette Vonnegut. He described himself in the preface to his 1975 book as \\"a hippie, son of a counterculture hero, BA in religion, (with a) genetic disposition to schizophrenia.\\" Mark Vonnegut (whom his parents named after Mark Twain.) graduated from Swarthmore College in 1969. He briefly worked at Duthie Books and was also briefly chief of a 20-man detachment of special state police that provided the security for Boston State Hospital. During the Vietnam War, he filed an application with the draft board to be considered a conscientious objector, which was denied. After taking the psychological examination, he was given a psychiatric 4-F classification and avoided conscription into the U.S. military. During his undergraduate years, he set out to become a Unitarian minister. He eventually abandoned that goal. He is the author of The Eden Express (1975), which describes his trip to British Columbia to set up a commune with his friends and his personal experiences with schizophrenia, which at that time he attributed to stress, diet and, in part, drug use. During this period, he lived mainly at the commune at Powell Lake, located 18 kilometres by boat from the nearest road or electricity. The book is widely cited as useful for those coping with schizophrenia. He married in 1975. He had a son, Eli James Vonnegut (b. 1980). On February 14, 1971, he was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia and committed to Hollywood Hospital in Vancouver. Standard psychotherapy did not help him, and most of his doctors said his case was hopeless. Vonnegut first attributed his recovery to orthomolecular megavitamin therapy and then wrote The Eden Express. In this book, he states that \\"approximately a third - improve without any treatment. Whatever shrink happens to be standing around when such remissions occur is usually willing to assume credit\\". From the book, one can see that he was trying to decide if it is the therapy or the ever-changing medications that are the most effective for treatment. Vonnegut does not presently attribute his recovery to vitamins. In reality, such situations take years of trial and error treatment to figure out what actually is effective treatment since the diagnostic tools are based on statistics (a group of symptoms and how long they last and what is the age of the patient), making them inherently weak on predictability. This is made worse given the short duration of any treatment because of the prohibitive costs of long term productive treatment. He subsequently studied medicine at Harvard Medical School and later came to the conclusion that he actually had bipolar disorder. Dr. Vonnegut, despite odds against him, graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1979. After graduation, Dr. Vonnegut completed a pediatric Internship and Residency at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Vonnegut published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine, December 27, 2007, and has published several short pieces on pediatrics and other topics in The Boston Globe and The Patriot Ledger. He has served on the National Institute for Health Consensus Conference on ADHD since November 1999. Dr. Vonnegut wrote The Eden Express which was first published in 1975 and re-published in 2002. His new book, Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So, was published on October 5, 2010. He has practiced pediatrics for over 30 years, opening his own practice, M.V. Pediatrics, in 2001. He is currently a pediatrician in Quincy, Massachusetts. Vonnegut published his second book, Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So, in 2010.

In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (plaisir and jouissance) of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to Baumgarten in the 18th century, followed by Kant. Music critics listen to symphony orchestra concerts and write a review which assesses the conductor and orchestra's interpretation of the pieces they played. The critic uses a range of aesthetic evaluation tools to write their review. They may assess the tone of the orchestra, the tempos that the conductor chose for the symphony movements, the taste and judgement showed by the conductor in their creative choices, and even the selection of pieces which formed the concert program. Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by Peter Kivy, Jerrold Levinson, Roger Scruton, and Stephen Davies. However, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between Eduard Hanslick, a music critic and musicologist, and composer Richard Wagner regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener. Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental tone poems, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music. Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images. Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions, intellect, and psychology; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The Ancient Greek philosopher Plato suggests in The Republic that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII). There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include lyricism, harmony, hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, resonance, playfulness, and color (see also musical development).  18th century  In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in William Hogarth's treatise The Analysis of Beauty. He considered dance beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers. However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance. Immanuel Kant, whose Critique of Judgment is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial. Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose. To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.  19th century  In the 19th century, the era of romanticism in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot. Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 E. T. A. Hoffmann argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition. Five years later, Arthur Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality. He felt that because music neither represents the phenomenal world, nor makes statements about it, it bypasses both the pictorial and the verbal. He believed that music was much closer to the true nature of all things than any other art form. This idea would explain why, when the appropriate music is set to any scene, action or event is played, it seems to reveal its innermost meaning, appearing to be the most accurate and distinct commentary of it. Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer's linking of music and metaphysics. The mainstream consensus endorsed music's capacity to represent particular emotions and situations. In 1832, composer Robert Schumann stated that his piano work Papillons was \\"intended as a musical representation\\" of the final scene of a novel by Jean Paul, Flegeljahre. The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the formalism of Eduard Hanslick, setting off the \\"War of the Romantics.\\" This fight divided the aesthetics into two competing groups: On one side are formalists (e.g., Hanslick), who emphasize that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side are the anti-formalists, such as Richard Wagner, who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends.  20th century  A group of modernist writers in the early 20th century (including the poet Ezra Pound) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn't represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself. In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick's ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music. (Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included Albert Schweitzer, who argued against the alleged 'purity' of music in a classic work on Bach. Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music. Among 20th-century composers, Igor Stravinsky is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy. When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing \\"is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything. He can say nothing whatever about meanings\\" (Stravinsky 1962, p. 115). Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience. The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' music, now understood to align with the distinction between art music and popular music, respectively. Theodor Adorno suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more 'difficult' and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life. False needs are cultivated in people by the culture industries. These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people's 'true' needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness. Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary). Beginning with Peter Kivy's work in the 1970s, analytic philosophy has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music. Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty. Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music. He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of authentic performance of music (1995). 21st century In the 21st century, philosophers such as Nick Zangwill have extended the study of aesthetics in music as studied in the 20th century by scholars such as Jerrold Levinson and Peter Kivy. In his 2014 book on the aesthetics of music titled Music and Aesthetic Reality: Formalism and the Limits of Description, Zangwill introduces his realist position by stating, \\"By 'realism' about musical experience, I mean a view that foregrounds the aesthetic properties of music and our experience of these properties: Musical experience is an awareness of an array of sounds and out the sound structure and its aesthetic properties. This is the content of musical experience.\\"Nick Zangwill. Music and Aesthetic Reality: Formalism and the Limits of Description. Page 20. 2014. Contemporary music in the 20th and 21st centuries has had both supporters and detractors. Theodor Adorno in the 20th century was a critic of much popular music. Others in the 21st century, such as Eugene W. Holland, have constructively proposed jazz improvisation as a socio-economic model, and Edward W. Sarath has constructively proposed jazz as a useful paradigm for understanding education and society. =Constructive reception= Eugene W. Holland has proposed jazz improvisation as a model for social and economic relations in general. Similarly, Edward W. Sarath has constructively proposed jazz improvisation as a model for change in music, education, and society. = Criticism = Simon Frith (2004, p. 17-9) argues that, \\"'bad music' is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics.\\" He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include \\"Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can't sing, players who can't play, producers who can't produce,\\" and \\"Tracks involving genre confusion. The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style.\\" Another type of \\"bad music\\" is \\"rock critical lists,\\" such as \\"Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty\\" and \\"Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song.\\" Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: kitsch), and stupid. He argues that \\"The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as 'bad' is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds. And 'bad' is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters\\" (p. 28). Frith's analysis of popular music is based in sociology. Theodor Adorno was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music. A Marxist, Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music. His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II. As a result, Adorno often uses \\"jazz\\" as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from Louis Armstrong to Bing Crosby. He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p. 126). Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music. He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996). At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007). In 2007 musicologist and journalist Craig Schuftan published The Culture Club, a book drawing links between modernism art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries. His story involves drawing lines between art, or high culture, and pop, or low culture. A more scholarly study of the same topic, Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde, was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.

Under this venerated title, the image is the Patroness of Colombia, the Venezuelan state of Zulia, and the town of Caraz in Peru. The image is painted on a cotton support, is kept in the Bas√≠lica of Our Lady of the Rosary in Chiquinquir√°, Colombia, where religious devotees celebrate her date of Pontifical coronation every July 9. On 9 January 1910, Pope Pius X authorised the Canonical Coronation of the image, which was not carried out until 9 July 1919 due to the political turmoil prevalent at the time. On 3 July 1986, Pope John Paul II visited the sanctuary and prayed for peace in Colombia at the feet of the Virgin Mary's image. The title given to the Virgin is from the city of Chiquinquir√°, where the first of the Virgin's miraculous manifestations occurred, and where the original image from the sixteenth century is kept. A later image of the Virgin of Chiquinquir√°, painted on wood, can be found at the Bas√≠lica of Maracaibo, in Maracaibo, Venezuela, where it is also called La Chinita. Every November 18 the city celebrates the traditional Feast of La Chinita with Masses and processions in honor of the Virgin. Colombia Painting of Our Lady of the Rosary Pursuant to a commission received from Antonio de Santana, who had received in 1560 an encomienda of the Indians of Suta, a Spanish painter named Alonso de Narv√°ez painted a portrait of the Virgin of the Rosary on a homespun piece of cotton woven by the Indians. Painting in tempera, he used mineral and organic pigments taken from the soil and from herb and flower juices of the region.Magdalena Vences Vidal, La Virgen de Chiquinquir√°, Colombia, 2008, Museo de la Bas√≠lica de Guadalupe, coll=Estudios en torno de arte vol. 2, pp.36f. In 1562 the portrait was placed in a chapel with a roof that leaked, and in time the humidity, air, and sun had so damaged the painting that it was impossible to recognize the subject. In 1577 the damaged painting was moved to Chiquinquir√° and left abandoned in a room that had formerly been a family oratory. Eight years later, Maria Ramos, a pious woman from Seville in Spain, cleaned and refurbished the modest chapel and placed in it the faded canvas that had once borne Mary's image. Tradition has it that a miraculous restoration of the painting occurred on Friday, 26 December 1586 which gradually closed the scratches and holes in the cloth, overlaying them with color and light. The image stood out again, having recovered its colors and brightness. The Virgin of the Rosary in the center of the painting is approximately three feet high. She looks towards her left as if to call attention to the nearly naked Child in her arms. The image has a calm countenance with a delicate smile. Both her face and the Child's are pale. The Child has a little brightly colored bird tied to his thumb and a rosary hangs from his left hand. Our Lady is supported by a crescent moon in a position suggesting the woman of the Apocalypse.\\"And a great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars\\", Apocalypse, chapter 12:1 A white veil covers her hair and her rose-colored robe is covered by a sky blue cape. With the little finger of her left hand she holds a rosary which hangs in front of her, and in her right hand she has a scepter. On her right stands the figure of St. Anthony of Padua, and on her left that of the Apostle St. Andrew. These were the patron saints respectively of Antonio de Santana, the Spanish colonist who had commissioned the painting, and the Dominican friar, Andres Jadaque, who had arranged for de Narv√°ez to paint it. The figures appear blurred when looked at closely, but seem clearer when viewed at a distance. The painting has markedly deteriorated through various causes which were assessed by Cecilia Alvarez White in course of a technical examination of the painting in 1986. These include the lack of any prepared ground to size the cotton support, the method of painting, and the nature of the pigments used which tend to degrade through exposure to light and humidity. Alvarez White concluded that the single greatest cause of pictorial degradation occurred over the 50 years preceding her examination, when the painting was exposed to more or less continuous intense electric light.Alvarez White, Cecilia, Chiquinquir√° arte y milagro, Bogot√°, Presidencia de la Republica/Museo de Arte Sacro, 1986, quoted and summarized in Vences Vidal, Magdalena, La Virgen de Chiquinquir√°, Colombia, Museo de la Bas√≠lica de Guadalupe, coll=Estudios en torno al arte vol. 2, at pp.63, 147f. In addition, for three hundred years the image of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir√° was exposed to the faithful without any protection, permitting thousands to touch the flimsy cloth. Since 1897 a thick glass has protected the painting from inclement weather and from excesses of pilgrim fervor. Venezuela The painting of the Virgin Mary in the Basilica at Maracaibo, Venezuela =The Story of the Prodigy= One day in November, 1709 (or 1749 according to other versions of the story), a woman washing her clothes by the shore of Lake Maracaibo saw a small wooden tablet floating towards her. She picked it up thinking it might be of some use and took it home with her, along with the clothes. The following morning, while preparing coffee, she heard knocks as if somebody was calling her. She went to see what had happened and was astonished to see the tablet shining, with the image of Our Lady of Chiquinquir√° now upon it. In a variant of the tradition, the woman first saw no more than the outline of the Virgin on the tablet, and for this reason hung it on a wall of her house; later, on Monday, 18 November, she heard knocking and strange noises coming from inside her house, and upon investigation found the tablet dazzlingly bright, illuminated by lights which shone like a rainbow. Surprised and filled with a strong emotion, she ran out of her house, shouting ‚ÄúMilagro! Milagro!‚Äù ‚Äì hence the name \\"El Milagro\\" (which means \\"miracle\\" in Spanish) given to the avenue where this woman's house stood. Later on, many people arrived to witness the prodigy.online article,Virgen de la Chiquinquir√°, o Virgen de la Chinita, Patrona del Zulia: Origenes de su Devoci√≥n, Tradiciones e Historia, dated 30 September 2009, accessed 29 November 2013 From that day on, the inhabitants of the state of Zulia in Venezuela, where Maracaibo is situated, found their Queen in what they call the ‚ÄúChinita‚Äù. As it has been expressed by many people, ‚ÄúShe is the way that leads to Jesus‚Äù. To this day, the tablet, still bearing the image on it, can be seen in the Basilica of Maracaibo. Legend has it that the government decided that the wood with the image belonged in the capital city, Caracas. So they ordered it moved. As the soldiers following the order carried the image away from Maracaibo it got heavier and heavier until finally no one could lift it. They returned it to the Basilica of Maracaibo where it has remained since. =The Wooden Tablet, the Crown and the Square= interior view of the Basilica in Maracaibo The tablet depicting the image of the Virgin Mary was first taken to a small sanctuary built to honor San Juan de Dios and later, under the rule of the governor Francisco de la Roche Ferrer, a bigger chapel was erected to venerate the newly found image of the Virgin of Chiquinquir√°. The tablet remained there until the final stage of the Basilica was completed in 1858. The tablet is relatively small. The dimensions are: 26 centimeters wide by 25 centimeters long and 3 millimeters deep. The Virgin Mary holds the baby Jesus in her left arm. To her left is the Apostle Saint Andrew holding an open book, and to her right Saint Anthony holding a lily (a symbol of chastity) in his right hand. The tablet was restored and preserved, and embellished with 18-carat gold engraving to magnify its beauty. The crown suspended above the tablet weighs 10 kilograms and it was made of 18-carat gold, donated by the public. Its inner arch measures 27 centimeters by 44 centimeters and a number of precious stones were embedded. It is one of the most highly prized relics in all of Zulia. By the time the crown was made it cost around 250 thousand bol√≠vars. Monument of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir√°, Paseo Ciencias, Maracaibo In the year 2004, the local government inaugurated the ‚ÄúSquare of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir√°‚Äù, an open sanctuary reminiscent of the old times. The great monument of the Virgin of Chiquinquir√° is located exactly where the washer woman's house once was. The total area of the square is 30 thousand square meters whose epicenter is a 15-meter-high allegorical statue of the Virgin Mary. There are also three mirror-like fountains as well as a smaller square devoted to Saint Sebastian, the patron saint of Maracaibo. =Annual Celebration= The people of Maracaibo celebrate the Chinita's fair in November with an all-night party. One of the main city avenues, Bella Vista, is closed for several blocks and the city puts lights all along the avenue. The lights stay up for months, until after Christmas. There are stages set up, sponsored by the government and businesses around the city. There are firework shows and street vendors, and hundreds of thousands of people line the streets and celebrate all night. The Chinita's fair officially begins on October 27 when the Virgin is taken down from the altar in which she rests. She tours throughout Zulia State and returns to the Basilica to start all the religious festivities. Around October 2, Bella Vista Avenue sees itself lit up by Christmas decorations, and the local government promotes a series of public concerts with national and international artists to begin the ‚Äúreal‚Äù fair. Crowds of people flock together at the different stages or platforms devised to house such concerts. Other cultural activities are held during the fair. Expo-Zulia is a temporary marketplace where the Zulians show numerous products that characterize the state. Many merchants, stores, companies and artisans offer their products at reasonably low prices. Bullfights are popular, with a number held in the local bullring. The ‚ÄúToros coleados‚Äù finds many ‚Äúgaiteros‚Äù in front of the basilica singing their best gaitas in honor of Our Lady, keeping alive a long-standing tradition of folk music. The celebrations mark the first salvo of a long Christmas season within Venezuela. =The 17th and 18th of November= The last two days of the Chinita's fair are most special. During these days the great parties around the city are held. By the afternoon of the 17th many people enjoy the multiple concerts and gaita bands that sing in the pubs, clubs and discos. The party begins on the 17th and lasts into the early morning hours of the 18th, with the ‚ÄúGaitero Daybreak‚Äù. Many people go to the Chinita's baseball game right after this traditional party and to the ‚ÄúToros coleados‚Äù in the afternoon. Pontifical approbations * Pope Pius VII declared her Patroness of Colombia in 1829, with a proper liturgical feast. * Pope Pius X granted the image a Canonical coronation on 9 January 1910. * Pope Benedict XV carried over the decree on 9 July 1919 due to preparations and political climate in the country. * Pope Pius XI raised her sanctuary to a minor basilica in 1927. The feast day of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquira, Patroness of Colombia is July 9, her actual day of coronation. Veneration In March 2008, the Colombian daily El Tiempo reported that a crisis that could have ended in an open conflict between Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela was averted by Colombian President Alvaro Uribe confiding the situation to the intercession of Mary under the three different titles by which she is the countries‚Äô patroness. The crisis started on March 1, when Uribe ordered a military raid into Ecuador's territory, against a rebel camp used by Marxist guerrillas to launch terrorist strikes. In response, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa cut all diplomatic relationships with Colombia. Venezuela's Hugo Ch√°vez, Correa's political ally, ordered a massive military surge to the Colombian border as well. Quoting Fr. Julio Sol√≥rzano, Chaplain of Colombia's Presidential Palace, El Tiempo revealed that on March 5, with tensions increasing, President Uribe called for a Rosary to pray for the end of tensions. The Rosary, prayed at the Presidential Palace's chapel, was dedicated, upon Uribe's request, to Our Lady of Chiquinquira, Our Lady of Coromoto, and Our Lady of Mercy, respectively the patronesses of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. Uribe invited all officials at the Presidential palace to the Rosary, as well as the minister of Defense and the Interior. ‚ÄúFor believers ‚Äì El Tiempo wrote ‚Äì the prayer was more than effective, since only two days later the presidents of the three countries shook hands, during the Group of Rio summit.‚Äù On April 7, at the Dominican Republic summit, the three presidents vented their differences, but agreed to stand down after Colombia apologized for the raid.

It is located in the southwestern portion of the Mystery Lake Local Government District. Pisew Falls park entrance. Located approximately 700 km north of Winnipeg, Manitoba, 500 m from Highway 6, Pisew Falls is near Kwasitchewan Falls, Manitoba's highest waterfall which has a naturally occurring year-round flow. The name, \\"Pisew\\", is translated from the local Cree language meaning \\"lynx\\". It was so named because the sound of the hissing water bears a resemblance to the sound of this wild northern feline.Story of the lynx at Pisew Falls. Its creation is due to the intensive geological activity in the area hundreds of thousands of years ago, when violent tectonic effects caused the creation of first a fault, and then an upheaval of the southern side of the fault-line. This has left a rift in the landscape with a waterfall riotously cascading over and through it.  Micro- climate  Because of the continuous flow of water over the falls, the localized area has developed its own microclimate. A wide variety of mosses, lichens, and fungi can be found in the immediate area around the base of the falls. There are also a variety of ferns whose origins date back to before the last Ice Age. The dominant winter feature downstream and to the right of the falls is the ice that builds up on top of a small island there. This island only rises a few feet above the downstream water level in summer, but by late February, the ice accumulates to approximately 3‚Äì5 metres thick from the months of freezing spray. At the periphery of this barrier between liquid water and frozen surroundings lies a thin ridge of plant growth that continues to survive throughout the harshest of the -45 degree Celsius days in this frigid northern wilderness. Normally the process of photosynthesis ceases in the surrounding area. It is common to see one or more of the local otters using the large ice buildup as a \\"slide\\", providing the otters and lucky spectators with hours of amusement. Officers of Manitoba Conservation ask that visitors keep the area clean and stay well away from the areas below the falls, which are clearly marked as \\"Environmentally Sensitive\\". As long as everyone co-operates in this respect, this remarkable piece of geography will be here for many generations to come.  Camping and hiking  Camping is not permitted at the falls themselves. There are no shower facilities, no electrical services, and the only toilet facilities are of the outhouse variety. There is a picnic area, and another place for a stopping if travelling further north or south. There are two hiking trails with rugged campsites leading from the Picnic and Falls areas. The trails are very rugged, and only recommended for experienced backpackers to attempt. The trail to Kwasitchewan Falls is 22 km (about 13 miles) return.  Canoe and kayak  The campsites are accessible by water and a short portage via the Grass River and Phillips Lake. (map of the Kwasitchewan Falls Trail) Motorized boats over 14 ft (4 m) are generally not recommended because of the lack of boat launching facilities.  Caution  There are several warnings about wildlife including bears. There are a number of black bears who reside in this area, as well as wolves, and cougars which have been spotted as far north as Thompson, Manitoba. Due to the relatively high humidity present year-round, it is possible to slip on fresh wet greenery in the summer, and slick ice in the winter. It may be dangerous to stray too far off the clearly marked path. There has been one fatality at the falls in recent years,http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/manitobas-biggest-plunge-pisew- falls-52257372.html and a Memorial Trail-Marker is there to mark it. The ledges are steep, the fall is long, and the current below is swift. Caution is advised at all times.

Among his works are the first anti-lynching play on Broadway, The Tree (1932); the first anti-Nazi play on Broadway, Birthright (1933); the first movie that dealt with the problem of medication abuse, Bigger Than Life, written in 1955, released in 1956; the first film that dealt with the ethical and moral decisions in kidnapping cases, Ransom!; the first film that introduced the American public to the importance of training airmen for the defense of the United States in a war many recognized as coming, I Wanted Wings (Spring, 1941); and Diamonds Are Forever, begun 1970, the first film that discussed the use of laser-like satellite mounted weapons for global warfare.\\" His papers now reside at his alma mater, the University of Iowa. Biography =Early career= Maibaum was born to a Jewish familyJewish Telegraph: \\"THE GREATEST EVER JEWISH FILMS Oy Oy Seven! Retrieved October 6, 2019. in New York City, and attended New York University. In 1930 he came to The University of Iowa's Speech and Dramatic Arts Department, where he studied under E.C. Mabie. He was graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931, and in 1932 he received a master's degree, all the while writing plays and acting. =Broadway= He was twenty-two and still at the University of Iowa when his anti-lynching play, The Tree, became a 1932 Broadway production under the direction of the young Robert Rossen, later known for Body and Soul (1947) and a life destroyed by the Hollywood blacklist. Back in New York after graduation, Maibaum spent 1933 as an actor in the Shakespearean Repertory Theater on Broadway. He appeared in fifteen different roles in many productions. As a young playwright in the early 1930s in New York City, Maibaum was involved with the challenging politics of the Depression. In 1933, the year in which Hitler ascended to his dictatorial powers in Germany, Maibaum attacked Nazism in his play, Birthright, also directed by Rossen.Brian Neve (1992) \\"Film & Politics in America: A social tradition\\" p. 13. This was the first of several anti-Nazi plays to appear that year. Maibaum then wrote Sweet Mystery of Life (1935) a stage comedy which eventually became the film Gold Diggers of 1937 (1936). His rapid rise as a playwright soon earned him a contract as a writer for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, then the most powerful and prestigious studio in Hollywood. While moving to LA and under contract to MGM, he wrote another play, See My Lawyer which was produced in New York by George Abbott and which starred Milton Berle. This was Maibaum's most successful play, running for 224 episodes from 1939 to 1940. =MGM= Maibaum's first credit was The Old School Tie (1936) at MGM. He did They Gave Him a Gun (1937) which he worked on with Cyril Hume. They worked on Live, Love and Learn (1937) and The Bad Man of Brimstone (1937) and Stablemates (1938) for Wallace Beery. =Columbia= At Columbia he wrote The Lady and the Mob (1938), Coast Guard (1939), The Amazing Mr. Williams (1939). Back at MGM he did The Ghost Comes Home (1940) and 20 Mule Team (1940) for Beery. He was one of many writers on Alfred Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent (1940). Maibaum went to Paramount where he worked on I Wanted Wings (1941), a huge hit. He did some uncredited work on Hold Back the Dawn (1941). At 20th Century Fox he wrote Ten Gentlemen from West Point (1942). =World War Two= Maibaum joined the U.S. Army in 1942 and, like many other Hollywood writers and directors, was commissioned as a captain in the Signal Corps, During his four and one-half years in the army, he produced war morale films, assembled and disseminated combat film footage (presumably while stationed overseas) and supervised a documentary history of World War II, whose title, length, whereabouts, and, indeed, purpose, are currently unknown. He eventually achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. He contributed to the story for the Olsesen-Johnson film See My Lawyer (1945). =Paramount= With this experience under his belt, Maibaum returned to Hollywood for a contract at Paramount as a producer and screenwriter. He wrote and produced his first picture, O.S.S. (1946), which starred Alan Ladd in a fictional story of the newly formed Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. This was the beginning of his fruitful association with Alan Ladd. Maibaum was producer on the John Farrow-directed The Big Clock (1948). He produced The Sainted Sisters (1948) with Veronica Lake, and Bride of Vengeance (1949) for director Mitchell Leisen. He wrote and produced The Great Gatsby (1949) also with Alan Ladd and co-written with Yale-educated Cyril Hume. Maibaum ended up sacking John Farrow as director after a dispute over casting Maibaum wrote and produced Song of Surrender (1949) for Leisen. He produced Dear Wife (1949), then did two more with Leisen: No Man of Her Own (1950) and Captain Carey, U.S.A. (1950) with Ladd. =Warwick Films= In the 1950s, American producers Irving Allen and Albert R. Broccoli were making action films in the UK under their Warwick Films banner. When Broccoli signed Ladd on for a three-picture deal for Warwick, Ladd insisted on Maibaum co-writing the screenplays. Maibaum moved his family to England in order to do this. The first Warwick Film, The Red Beret (1953) was a bit hit. It was followed by Hell Below Zero (1954). He also began writing for the new medium of television, including short teleplays for The Kate Smith Evening Hour, and the critically acclaimed Emmy nominated \\"Fearful Decision\\" starring Ralph Bellamy and Sam Levene which he also co- wrote with Cyril Hume for The United States Steel Hour. Maibaum returned to The University of Iowa in 1954 for one semester to teach and supervise the \\"Footsteps of Freedom\\" project, a teleplay writing course. For Warwick, he worked on the war story, The Cockleshell Heroes (1955) which starred Jose Ferrer. Maibaum returned to Hollywood in 1955. He and Hume adapted \\"Fearful Decision\\" for the big screen in Ransom! (1956) with Glenn Ford. He co-wrote \\"Bigger Than Life,\\" (1956) with Hume along with its star and producer, the British actor James Mason. Maibaum did another for Warwick, Zarak (1956), directed by Terence Young and starring Victor Mature. He and Young collaborated on the script for Warwick's No Time to Die (1958) with Mature and he did some uncredited work on Warwick's The Man Inside (1959). He wrote some episodes of Wagon Train (1958) and provided the story for Warwick's The Bandit of Zhobe (1959) and Killers of Kilimanjaro (1959). =MGM TV= Maibaum became executive producer at M.G.M.-TV in 1958, for whom he wrote and produced the TV series The Thin Man (1957‚Äì59). He also produced a pilot for a TV series Maisie (1960), based on the film series, and worked on the script for The Day They Robbed the Bank of England (1960). His strong ties to the Writer's Guild and the writing profession led him to resign in 1960 during a writer's strike. Maibaum wrote and produced a war film for 20th Century Fox starring Audie Murphy, Battle on the Beach (1961). He then was invited by Albert Broccoli to write the first James Bond movie. And thus his future career was sealed. =James Bond= Maibaum was brought on to write the first Bond movie, Dr. No (1962), sharing credit with Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather. He wrote the episode \\"The Medal\\" for Combat! (1963), then wrote From Russia with Love (1963), sharing credit with Harwood. Maibaum worked on Goldfinger (1964), on which Paul Dehn also did work. He was one of several writers on Thunderball (1965). You Only Live Twice (1967) was the first Bond film on which Maibaum was not credited as a writer, the producers using Roald Dahl. Albert Broccoli wanted to produce a non-Bond movie, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), and Maibaum did some work on the script. Maibaum received sole script credit for On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), starring George Lazenby. He did an early draft of Diamonds Are Forever (1971), then the producers wanted an American writer and hired Tom Mankiewicz to rework it. Mankiewicz was the sole screenwriter on Live and Let Die (1973), Roger Moore's first Bond movie. Instead, Maibaum wrote and produced a TV movie, Jarrett (1973), starring Glenn Ford. Maibaum was brought back to the Bond movies to work on Mankiewicz's draft of The Man with the Golden Gun (1974). He was one of the many writers who worked on The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), sharing credit with Christopher Wood. Maibaum was not used on Moonraker (1979), the producers preferring Wood. Instead, Maibaum worked on a Bond spoof, S.H.E: Security Hazards Expert (1980). =Michael Wilson= Maibaum was brought back to work on the Bonds in association with Michael G. Wilson, Broccoli's step-son. Their first movie together was For Your Eyes Only (1981). It was followed by Octopussy (1983), on which George MacDonald Fraser also did a draft; A View to a Kill (1985), Moore's last Bond; The Living Daylights (1987), the first Bond from Timothy Dalton, whom Maibaum considered the best actor of the four Bonds; and Licence to Kill (1989). Maibaum once told an interviewer that writing for Bond is \\"a case of Walter Mitty. I'm law-abiding and non-violent. My great kick comes from feeling that I'm a pro, that I know my job, and that I have enough experience that I can write a solid screenplay.\\" On writing the Bonds Maibaum said \\"The real trick of it is to find the villain's caper. Once you've got that, you're off to the races and the rest is fun.\\" Maibaum is credited with adding the essential ingredient of humor to the James Bond stories, an element lacking in the original Fleming novels. Death Maibaum continued working on Bond films until the end of his life. He died on January 4, 1991 at the age of 81, survived by his wife, Sylvia (who died in 2006), two sons, Matthew and Paul, and a granddaughter, Shanna Claire.

The French Army of the Rhine under Fran√ßois Bazaine retreated into the Metz fortress after its defeat by the Germans at the Battle of Gravelotte on 18 August 1870. The fortress was promptly surrounded by German forces under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia. The French Army of Ch√¢lons was sent to relieve the Army of the Rhine but was itself encircled and annihilated by the German armies at the Battle of Sedan on 1‚Äì2 September. Unable to capture the fortress by bombardment or storm, the besieging Germans resorted to starving the French to submission. Attempted French breakouts ended in defeat at the battles of Noisseville on 31 August‚Äì1 September and Bellevue on 7 October. French food supplies ran out on 20 October and Bazaine surrendered the fortress and the entire Army of the Rhine, some 193,000 men, into German hands on 27 October. The annihilation of the French Army of the Rhine freed Prince Friedrich Karl's armies for operations against French forces in the Loire river valley for the rest of the war. Metz was annexed into the German Empire after the signing of the Treaty of Frankfurt on 10 May 1871. Background After being held at the Battle of Gravelotte, Marshal Bazaine retreated into the defenses of Metz. There he was besieged by over 150,000 Prussian troops of the First and Second Armies on 19 August.Michael Howard, The Franco Prussian War Prelude Napoleon III and Marshal Patrice de MacMahon formed the new French Army of Ch√¢lons, to march on to Metz to rescue Bazaine. Napoleon III personally led the army with Marshal MacMahon in attendance. The Army of Ch√¢lons marched north-east towards the Belgian border to avoid the Prussians before striking south to link up with Bazaine. The Prussians, under the command of Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, took advantage of this maneuver to catch the French in an encirclement. He left the Prussian First and Second Armies besieging Metz, except three corps detached to form the Army of the Meuse under the Crown Prince of Saxony. With this army and the Prussian Third Army, Moltke marched northward and caught up with the French at Beaumont on 30 August. After a sharp fight in which they lost 5,000 men and 40 cannons, the French withdrew toward Sedan. Having reformed in the town, the Army of Ch√¢lons was immediately isolated by the converging Prussian armies. Napoleon III ordered the army to break out of the encirclement immediately. With MacMahon wounded on the previous day, General Auguste Ducrot took command of the French troops in the field. The Army of Ch√¢lons was trapped and destroyed at the Battle of Sedan. Siege Defence of Metz by the French Army. Painting by Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville. The French calculated they had enough food for 70,000 civilians for three and a half months and five months worth of provisions for a regular garrison. Because the entire Army of the Rhine was stuck in the fortress, there were only enough provisions for 41 days and oats for 25 days. The Germans brought up 50 heavy siege guns from Germany to bombard Metz, but the fortress was too heavily stocked with artillery and well-built for it to be taken with the means available to the Germans. Unable to silence the fortress guns sufficiently to conduct siege operations, the besiegers opted to starve out the trapped French army. By September, about 25% of the 197,326-strong German siege force still lacked proper accommodations and the sick list in military hospitals grew to 40,000 men. The Germans supplemented their meat rations with tinned food. The French situation was much worse, with riots breaking out among the starving army and city. The French attempted to break the siege first at Noisseville on 31 August‚Äì1 September and again at Bellevue on 7 October but were repulsed each time. Each side lost about 5,000 men killed and wounded in total in these two breakout attempts. On 20 October, the food provisions of the fortress ran out and the French Army of the Rhine subsisted afterward on the flesh of 20,000 horses, which were consumed at a rate of 1,000 per day. Bazaine was forced to surrender his entire army on 27 October because of starvation.Article on F. Bazaine in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The Prussians offered the honors of war to the defeated French army, but, contrary to usual practice, Bazaine refused the honor. On 29 October, Prussian flags were raised on Metz's outworks and the French Army of the Rhine marched out silently, and in good order. They were taken prisoner by a Prussian Corps at each gate, put into bivouacs and supplied with food. The Germans allowed the French officers to keep their swords and remain in Metz, which was largely unharmed by the siege. The Germans immediately sent a train of food and live cattle to the city they had just conquered. The French prisoners were sent by way of Saarbr√ºcken and Trier to prisoners of war camps, guarded by Landwehr battalions. Bazaine was sent as a captive to Kassel. The German 26th Brigade was stationed as the Metz garrison, with General von Kummer as commandant. Dead horses, unburied corpses and burnt or putrefying refuse greeted the German conquerors on their entry, a testament to the suffering the French had endured. Aftermath The Surrender of the French Army at Metz, Conrad Freyberg (1876) Prince Friedrich Karl and the Prussian Second Army were now free to move against the French force in the Loire River area. The siege is commemorated by the \\"Siegesmarsch von Metz\\" which uses parts of the \\"Die Wacht am Rhein\\". One notable figure present on the Prussian side was the prominent philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who served as a medical attendant. Nietzsche contracted both diphtheria and dysentery during the siege, worsening his already poor state of health.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/ =Casualties= The French lost 167,000 enlisted men and 6,000 officers taken to POW camps on 27 October, as well as 20,000 sick who temporarily stayed behind in Metz. Material losses were enormous and amounted to 622 field guns, 2,876 fortress guns, 72 mitrailleuses, 137,000 chassepots, 123,000 other small arms, vast stores of ammunition and 56 Imperial Eagles, all captured by the Germans. The Germans lost 5,500 enlisted men and 240 officers killed and wounded, as well as large numbers of sick.

Bella Vista is located 33 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of The Hills Shire. History Bella Vista homestead, Bella Vista Farm Park, Norwest, NSW In 1799 Joseph Foveaux was granted which, in addition to other purchases, he sold to John Macarthur in 1801. John Macarthur enlarged this through additional purchases until it comprised around . John and Elizabeth Macarthur farmed sheep on this property in addition to their properties at Camden and Parramatta. For much of the time that the Macarthur's owned this farm John was overseas and it fell to Elizabeth to manage the various Macarthur properties and flocks. During this time reference is made by her to \\"my Seven Hills Farm\\". Although claims are made by some that the Seven Hills Farm was used exclusively by the Macarthurs for the breeding of their merino flocks, this is clearly not the case as the documentary evidence of the Macarthur papers shows that their Merino rams were paddocked at Elizabeth Farm at Parramatta. The Seven Hills farm was isolated and stock there were always in danger from theft and aboriginal attack. Two of Macarthur's stockmen were killed on the farm by natives in 1805. In fact the sheep at the Macarthur's Seven Hills farm had their genesis in the 600 sheep which were purchased from Foveaux at the same time as the property. What can justifiably be claimed about the site is that it was one of the first major Australian sheep breeding farms and that the results later achieved at Camden with fine merino sheep only followed Elizabeth's efforts at Seven Hills. Part of this land was later acquired by the Pearce family and became known as Bella Vista. All the buildings on the site today date from this period of its history with no extant buildings from the Macarthur period. In the 1890s, Edward Henry Pearce (1839‚Äì1912) of Bella Vista was declared the \\"largest and most successful orange grower in the colony.\\" Bella Vista was sold by the Pearce family in 1950. Until the mid-1990s, the area was primarily used for small-scale agriculture. Since then, significant changes have become apparent as it incorporates a residential area and a busy business district. However, the homestead and old farm buildings have been preserved and this portion of the former Pearce family property is now owned by The Hills Shire Council. The Friends of Bella Vista Farm Park has been formed and they are working actively to achieve the continued restoration of all buildings on this unique site.  Heritage listings  Bella Vista has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Elizabeth Macarthur Drive: Bella Vista (homestead) *Seven Hills Road: Pearce Family Cemetery Demographics According to the , there were 7,837 residents in Bella Vista. 51.2% of residents were born in Australia.

The biggest commercial area is the Norwest Business Park on Norwest Boulevard to the east. Norwest Business Park incorporates retail, commercial, industrial and hotel developments. The industrial areas in West Bella Vista are still heavily under development, with many new warehouses appearing recently. =Health services= Bella Vista has numerous established medical centres and dental surgeries, including Norwest Private Hospital on Norbrik Drive, and Hospital for Specialist Surgery located on Solent Circuit. =Shopping centres= Circa Retail is a shopping centre located near Old Windsor Road, featuring a Woolworths supermarket as the anchor tenant with 25 specialty stores. =Corporate hub= In 2006, Woolworths Limited, a public Australian retail company, joined all of its sub-management offices into a $200 million complex in Norwest Business Park in Bella Vista. The move meant Bella Vista was listed in Fortune's Global 500 list as one of the suburbs (Bella Vista is a suburb of Sydney) where Global 500 companies have their headquarters, ranked above Singapore, Miami and Baltimore and alongside Bangkok and Boston. Other large scale corporations with their headquarters in the Norwest Business Park include Homeart, ResMed and AAMI Insurance and the Reserve Bank of Australia. File:Norwest Lake.jpgNorwest Lake File:BellaVistaNSWnorwest.jpgNorwest, Bella Vista File:Driving westbound on Norwest Boulevard.jpgNorwest Boulevard Transport A major factor in the recent growth of Bella Vista has been its prime location near the end of the Sydney M2 motorway. The motorway (opened in 1997) means that in very good traffic conditions it takes just over half an hour to get from Bella Vista to the CBD. This also puts Bella Vista close to two major north-south transport routes through Sydney, the Cumberland Highway and the Westlink M7. Until the completion of the Sydney Metro buses were the only form of public transport available to Bella Vista residents. The suburb is serviced by private bus companies Hillsbus and Busways. Relatively frequent buses connect Bella Vista with the nearby hubs of Parramatta (bus numbers 662, 663, 664 and 665), Castle Hill (bus numbers 730, 660 and 662), Blacktown (bus numbers 730) and Seven Hills (bus numbers 714 and 715). There are also peak services available directly to North Sydney (602X) and the CBD (bus numbers 607X, 613X, and 614X). Many routes use the North-West T-way. Two railway stations now service the area. Bella Vista railway station is located on the corner of Lexington Drive and Old Windsor Road, whilst Norwest railway station is located in the suburb of Norwest near Hillsong Church across the road from the Norwest Market town Shopping centre. The $7.2 billion North West Rail Link is now the main public transport line linking residents of north-western Sydney with Epping, Chatswood, North Sydney and Sydney CBD. It has also improved access to Castle Hill Norwest Business Park and Rouse Hill.

The film brought Almod√≥var to widespread international attention: it was nominated for the 1988 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and won five Goya Awards including Best Film and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Maura. It was released on 11 November 1988. The actual Spanish title refers to an ', which is not actually well translated as \\"nervous breakdown\\" ('). ' are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. Historically, this condition has been associated with hysteria and more recently in the scientific literature with post-traumatic stress and panic attacks.Schechter DS, Marshall RD, Salman E, Goetz D, Davies SO, Liebowitz MR (2000). Ataque de nervios and childhood trauma history: An association? Journal of Traumatic Stress, 13:3, 529‚Äì534. Plot The film plot takes its starting point from the French play The Human Voice (La Voix humaine, 1930) by Jean Cocteau where a desperate woman tries to avoid being dumped by her lover through a series of phone calls. In the film, TV actress Pepa Marcos is depressed and taking sleeping pills because her boyfriend Iv√°n has just left her. Both she and Iv√°n work as voice- over actors who dub foreign films, notably Johnny Guitar with Joan Crawford and Sterling Hayden. The voice he uses to sweet-talk her (and many other women) is the same one he uses in his work. He is about to leave on a trip and has asked Pepa to pack his things in a suitcase that he will pick up later. Pepa returns home later to find her answering machine filled with frantic messages from her friend, Candela. In anger, she rips out the phone and throws it through the window onto the balcony. Candela arrives, still overwhelmed, but before she can explain her situation, Carlos, Iv√°n's son with previous lover Luc√≠a, arrives with his snobbish fianc√©e, Marisa. It turns out they are apartment-hunting, and by coincidence have chosen Pepa's penthouse to look at. Carlos and Pepa figure out each other's relationship to Iv√°n; Pepa wants to know where Iv√°n is because she has to tell him something, but Carlos doesn't know where his father is. Candela unsuccessfully attempts to kill herself by jumping off the balcony. Meanwhile, Marisa has become bored and decides to drink some gazpacho she finds in the fridge, not realizing that it has been spiked with sleeping pills. Candela finally gets to explain her situation: a while ago she had a love affair with an Arab who later came to visit her, bringing some friends with him. It turns out that they are a Shiite terrorist cell and Candela was unknowingly harboring them in her home. When the terrorists left, Candela fled to Pepa's place for help. Candela fears that the police think she is involved and will come for her. Pepa sets out to see a lawyer Carlos has recommended to help Candela, and ends up catching the same cab with the same Mambo-loving driver. However, Paulina, the lawyer she visits, is acting strangely. Pepa sees that Paulina has tickets to Stockholm. Iv√°n calls the office at one point, and Paulina seems to know Pepa, and is very rude to her. Meanwhile, Candela reveals to Carlos that the Shiites plan to hijack a flight to Stockholm that evening and divert it to Beirut, where the Shiite terrorists have a friend who was captured by the authorities. After Carlos fixes the broken phone, he quickly calls the police, but hangs up before (he believes) they can trace the call, then surprisingly kisses Candela. Pepa returns and Luc√≠a calls, announcing she is coming over to confront her about Iv√°n. Carlos reveals that Luc√≠a has been in a mental hospital since Iv√°n left her and has only now been released. Pepa, now sick of Iv√°n and no longer wanting to see him, heads back down with Iv√°n's suitcase; she throws it out, just barely missing Iv√°n, who has arrived with Paulina on their way to the airport. He leaves Pepa a message. Pepa returns to her apartment and hears the song from the opening, Lola Beltr√°n's \\"Soy Infeliz\\", which Carlos is playing. Enraged, Pepa yanks off the record and throws it out of the window, and it ends up hitting Paulina. Pepa then hears Iv√°n's message and once again rips out the phone and throws the answering machine back out of the window; it lands on Paulina's car. Back in the apartment, Luc√≠a arrives, along with the phone repairman and the police, who have traced Carlos' earlier call. Candela starts to panic, but Carlos comes up with an idea: to serve everyone the spiked gazpacho. The policemen and repairman are knocked out, Carlos and Candela make out on the sofa and also fall asleep, and Luc√≠a grabs the policemen's guns and aims them at Pepa, who figures out that Paulina is the other woman Iv√°n is going to Stockholm with, and that their flight is the one that the terrorists are planning to hijack. Luc√≠a reveals that she is still insane and only faked sanity when she heard Iv√°n's voice dubbed on a foreign film. She throws the gazpacho into Pepa's face and rushes to the airport to kill Iv√°n; she sees a motorcyclist and forces him to act as her driver. Pepa chases her and is joined by her neighbour Ana, who happens to be the motorcyclist's stood-up girlfriend. They quickly hail a cab (driven by the Mambo taxi driver again) and a mad chase ensues to the airport, with Luc√≠a firing the gun at them. Luc√≠a arrives at the airport, sees that Iv√°n and Paulina are about to pass security, and aims her gun at them. Pepa arrives just in time and thwarts the murder attempt by rolling a luggage cart at Luc√≠a. Iv√°n runs over to Pepa, who is now mentally and physically exhausted after two days of trying to chase down her lover. Iv√°n offers to finally speak with her about whatever she has been trying to speak to him about, and for a moment, it seems he might even leave Paulina to take her back. But Pepa refuses, saying, \\"There was still time last night, this morning, even today at noon. But now it's too late\\". Having saved his life, she leaves the airport, and Iv√°n, for good. Pepa returns to her home, which is a mess with a burnt bedroom, broken windows, a telephone ripped from the wall, spilled gazpacho on the floor, her menagerie of chickens and geese running around loose, and several unconscious visitors all overdosed on sleeping pills. Pepa sits on her balcony where Marisa has just woken up. The two women chat, sharing a moment of tranquility at the end of a hectic 48 hours, and Pepa finally reveals what her big news for Iv√°n was: she's pregnant.

Sager, Victorian Studies, Vol. 23, No. 2 (Winter, 1980), pp. 211-236 Early life Born at Bath, Somerset on 10 January 1824, he was the eldest of five sons of Samuel Peace Pratt by his wife Susanna Martha Hodgson (d. 1875). After education at Haileybury College (1844‚Äì6), he matriculated at London University in 1844. In 1847 he joined the East India Company's service at Calcutta. He became under-secretary to the government of Bengal, and inspector of public instruction there. While in India Pratt in 1851 helped to found the Vernacular Literature Society which published Bengali translations of English literature, and acted as secretary till 1856. He also started a school of industrial art. In 1857 Pratt was at home on leave and at contributed to The Economist on Indian matters. He finally left India in 1861.

He was born in Stamford, Connecticut; his father was actor and dramatist Steele MacKaye. After studying forestry at Harvard University (B.A., 1900; M.A. School of Forestry, 1905), Benton later taught there for several years. He joined a number of Federal bureaus and agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the U.S. Department of Labor; he was also a member of the Technical Alliance where he participated in the Energy Survey of North America.Anderson, p. 136 MacKaye helped pioneer the idea of land preservation for recreation and conservation purposes, and was a strong advocate of balancing human needs and those of nature; he coined the term \\"Geotechnics\\" to describe this philosophy. In addition to writing the first argument against urban sprawl, MacKaye also authored two books, The New Exploration: A Philosophy of Regional Planning and Expedition Nine: A Return to a Region. Thirteen of his essays were published in the collection From Geography to Geotechnics. A co-founder of The Wilderness Society, he is best known as the originator of the Appalachian Trail (AT), an idea he presented in his 1921 article titled An Appalachian Trail: A Project in Regional Planning. The Benton MacKaye Trail, some portions of which coincide with the Appalachian Trail, is named after him. Early life Emile Benton MacKaye was born in Stamford, Connecticut on March 6, 1879 to actor and dramatist (James) Steele MacKaye and his wife Mary.Anderson, p. 10 He was the sixth of seven children (and last son) born to the couple. His siblings were Arthur Loring MacKaye (1863‚Äì1939), Harold (Hal) Steele (1866‚Äì1928), William Payson (1868‚Äì1889), James (Jamie) Medbery (1872‚Äì1935), Percy (1875‚Äì1956), and Hazel (1880‚Äì1944). Benton's name was derived from his paternal grandmother, Emily Benton Steele. The family often suffered from financial troubles due to the patriarch's numerous failed business ventures; although the Stamford home where Benton was born and where the family had lived since 1875 was a comfortable one, in late 1879 the family began a restless series of moves due to lack of funds. They lived in farms and houses in Brattleboro, Vermont; Norton, Massachusetts; Mount Vernon, New York; and Ridgefield, Connecticut, before moving to New York City in 1885.Anderson, p. 13 In order to escape the bustle of city-life, the family took to visiting Shirley Center, Massachusetts, a quiet village 30 miles from Boston that Benton would continue to visit until his death. In 1888, his brother William purchased an estate in Shirley that the family would come to call \\"The Cottage\\". Eight-year-old Benton was immediately enamored with the beauty and freedom of the country, proclaiming he enjoyed it far more than urban existence. Shortly after William died of a sudden respiratory disease in 1889, the family moved to Washington, D.C. An indifferent student, MacKaye once described school as \\"a place that boys like to run away from\\".Anderson, p. 18 Drawn to the study of the natural world, he often pursued knowledge on his own; he spent much time in the Smithsonian, making sketches of the abundant collections and volunteering to help scientists in their labs.Ness He befriended assistant curator James Benedict, and attended lectures given by such luminaries as Civil War hero John Wesley Powell and arctic explorer Robert Peary.Anderson, pp. 20-21 His early immersion in nature helped him cope with tragedy that eventually struck the MacKaye family; the frequently absent Steele died in early 1894, when Benton was fourteen.Anderson, p. 26 While attending high school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he began charting the landscape around Shirley Center, documenting vegetation, landforms, rivers, and roads in numbered notebooks. Lewis Mumford, a close friend of MacKaye and his future biographer, wrote that \\"This direct, first-hand education through the senses and feelings, with its deliberate observation of nature in every guise‚Äîincluding the human animal‚Äîhas nourished MacKaye all his life.\\" Harvard and forestry After dropping out of school in order to prepare for college entrance exams on his own, in 1896 MacKaye followed his brothers‚ÄîJames, an engineer and philosopher, and Percy, a dramatist and poet‚Äîto Harvard University, where he studied geology. It took him two years to overcome deficiencies in subjects such as German, algebra and physics.Anderson, p. 28 When he graduated in June 1905, MacKaye was still unsure what career he should embark upon. During this time, he read Thomas Henry Huxley's 1877 work Physiography: An Introduction to the Study of Nature --a gift from his brother James, and a work that would prove influential in MacKaye's future regional planning.Cevasco, p. 271 In October 1903, he enrolled in Harvard's newly established forestry school; he was the school's first student to graduate, in 1905. For the next five years, he alternated between teaching at Harvard's newly created forestry school near Petersham, Massachusetts, and working as a Forest Assistant with the Forest Service.Sutter (2002), p. 144 MacKaye made some important contributions during the early years of national forestry. While working as a Forest Examiner in the early teens, he performed groundbreaking research on the impacts of forest cover on runoff in New Hampshire's White Mountains. This was during a time in which an intense debate regarding the connection between deforestation and irregular stream flow was occurring, and MacKaye's scientific evidence that forest cover controlled stream flow helped in the creation of the White Mountain National Forest.Sutter (2002), p. 144-145 Progressive politics In 1913, while still living in Washington, Mackaye helped form a social activist group called the Hell Raisers. Composed of government workers, congressional staffers, and journalists, the informal group aimed to raise public awareness about social and political issues. He married the suffragist Jessie Belle Hardy Stubbs in 1915. Appalachian Trail MacKaye's article An Appalachian Trail: A Project in Regional Planning, which called for the construction of the Appalachian Trail, was published in the October 1921 issue of Journal of the American Institute of Architects. The article was partly inspired by the Green Mountain Club which had helped usher in Vermont's Long Trail.Dalbey, p. 163 The article triggered sixteen years of effort, organized through hundreds of local trail associations and community groups, to blaze and build a 2,140-mile trail along the crests of the Appalachian Mountains. Pinhoti Trail \\"The Pinhoti Trail is considered the realization of forester Benton MacKaye's original 1921 vision of a trail extending the length of the Appalachian Mountain chain, connecting several existing trails, and sprinkled with permanent camps and constructed to \\"stimulate every line of outdoor non- industrial endeavor,\\" including recreation, recuperation, agriculture and study. He hoped to spark a \\"back to the land\\" movement to relieve the ills of urban industrial life.\\" https://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Pinhoti_Trail From the Pinhoti Trail Alliance. The PTA Facebook account has the most history and current trail conditions online. Legacy In his 2002 book Long Trails of the Southeast, writer and avid hiker Johnny Molloy wrote that the Benton MacKaye Trail \\"is what I imagine the Appalachian Trail was like many decades ago--a lesser tamed path, steep in places, rough in spots, and still evolving\\".Molloy, p. 54 On June 17, 2011 he was inducted into the Appalachian Trail Hall of Fame at the Appalachian Trail Museum as a charter member.

Attributive (before nouns) When a noun is modified using an adjective, the associative particle de is inserted between the adjective and the noun. For example, gƒÅo x√¨ng de h√°i zi \\"happy child\\". is sometimes omitted to reduce repetitiveness (e.g., two or more instances of within a sentence); it is also omitted in some established adjective-noun pairs to improve sentence flow (e.g., the TV show in China). It is also more typical to omit when a single-syllable adjective is used than for a multi-syllable adjective (e.g., compare () with ). In general, there are no strict rules regarding when can be omitted; however, some adjectives and adjective-noun pairs are more often seen without the associative particle than others. Some examples: * ÔºàÔºâ‚Äî \\"bad person\\" * ‚Äî \\"strange person\\" * ÔºàÔºâ‚Äî \\"cute panda\\" Predicative (after nouns) = First pattern = Unlike English, subjects and predicate adjectives in a Chinese sentence are not linked by copula but by degree adverbs, such as hƒõn \\"very,\\" h«éo \\"highly\\", zhƒìn \\"really,\\" and fƒìich√°ng \\"extraordinarily, extremely.\\" For example, the following sentences express increasing degrees of \\"beauty\\": * „ÄÇ She is beautiful. * „ÄÇ She is very beautiful. * „ÄÇ She is really beautiful. * „ÄÇ She is extraordinarily beautiful. A complementary adverb (e.g. j√≠ le) can also specify the degree of an adjective: * ÔºàÔºâ„ÄÇ She is exceedingly beautiful. NB: often functions as a dummy linking adverb and does not carry the meaning of \\"very\\". For example, is often understood and translated as \\"She is beautiful\\". Besides, in colloquial Chinese the pattern \\"\\" (s«ê le, literally \\"to death\\") or \\"\\" is sometimes used in exaggeration to highlight the extent of influence, where AA is an adjective and BB is the thing being affected. Examples include *\\"\\" ( r√® = hot) - meaning \\"It's so hot [to the extent that I cannot bear any more]\\" *\\"\\" ( √® = hungry) - meaning \\"[I feel] so hungry [to the extent that I cannot bear any more]\\" *\\"\\" - meaning \\"I feel so hot [to the extent that I cannot bear any more]\\" =Second pattern= The linking verb sh√¨ (to be) is used with adjectives in the pattern‚ÄîNoun + + Adj + ‚Äîto state or emphasize a fact or a perceived fact. For example: * „ÄÇ He is male. * ÔºàÔºâ„ÄÇ That car is new. * ÔºàÔºâ„ÄÇ That cat is black. Since is a possessive particle, and the following noun is understood here, more precise translations would be \\"He is a male one\\", \\"That car is a new one\\", and \\"That cat is a black one\\".

He taught at the University of Pittsburgh from 1963 until his retirement in 2011. Biography As an undergraduate, Belnap studied at University of Illinois where he obtained his B.A. He recalled Max Fisch assigned Whitehead readings. After military service he attended Yale University and enjoyed metaphysics. His professors included Paul Weiss, Arthur Pap, Henry Maginau, Frederic Fitch, and Rulon Wells. On a Fulbright Fellowship in 1958 he went to Louvain to study with Canon Robert Feys. Belnap domiciled in Brussels with wife and 2-year-old. Feys directed Belnap to read Wilhelm Ackermann's article on rigorous implication in the Journal of Symbolic Logic.Wilhelm Ackermann (1956) Begrundung einer strengen implikation, Journal of Symbolic Logic 21: 113 to 128 via Project Euclid Alan Ross Anderson and Belnap began to discuss relevant implication. In 1960 Anderson told Belnap to write up the work he had done on relevance logic, and this was Belnap's PhD dissertation at Yale (entitled The Formalization of Entailment). The dissertation was published through Omar Kayam Moore at Office of Naval Research, Group Psychology Branch. Belnap became an assistant professor at Yale. He recalled hiring Jon Barwise and John Wallace as research assistants. Pittsburgh University wanted Wilfrid Sellars, and according to Belnap, \\"Jerry Sneewind and I hung on his coattails.\\" Adolf Grunbaum and Nicholas Rescher were at Pitt.

With current technology, this volume is quite small and the plasma is generated as a flat plane inside a cylindrical space. Plasma is any gas whose atoms or molecules have been ionized, and is a separate phase of matter. This is most commonly achieved by heating the gas to extremely high temperatures, although other methods exist. Plasma becomes increasingly viscous at higher temperatures, to the point where other matter has trouble passing through. A plasma window's viscosity allows it to separate gas at standard atmospheric pressure from a total vacuum, and can reportedly withstand a pressure difference of up to nine atmospheres. At the same time, the plasma window will allow radiation such as lasers and electron beams to pass. This property is the key to the plasma window's usefulness ‚Äî the technology of the plasma window permits for radiation that can only be generated in a vacuum to be applied to objects in an atmosphere. Electron-beam welding is a major application of plasma windows, making EBW practical outside a hard vacuum.  History  The plasma window was invented at Brookhaven National Laboratory by Ady Hershcovitch and patented in 1995. Further inventions using this principle include the plasma valve in 1996.  Plasma valve  A related technology is the plasma valve, invented shortly after the plasma window. A plasma valve is a layer of gas in the shell of a particle accelerator. The ring of a particle accelerator contains a vacuum, and ordinarily a breach of this vacuum is disastrous. If, however, an accelerator equipped with plasma valve technology breaches, the gas layer is ionized within a nanosecond, creating a seal that prevents the accelerator's recompression. This gives technicians time to shut off the particle beam in the accelerator and slowly recompress the accelerator ring to avoid damage.  Properties  The physical properties of the plasma window vary depending on application. The initial patent cited temperatures around . The only limit to the size of the plasma window are current energy limitations as generating the window consumes around 20 kilowatts per inch (8 kW/cm) in the diameter of a round window. The plasma window emits a bright glow, with the color being dependent on the gas used.  Similarity to \\"force fields\\"  In science fiction, such as the television series Star Trek, a fictional technology known as the \\"force field\\" is often used as a device. In some cases it is used as an external \\"door\\" to hangars on spacecraft, to prevent the ship's internal atmosphere from venting into outer space. Plasma windows could theoretically serve such a purpose if enough energy were available to produce them. The StarTram proposal plans on use of a power- demanding MHD window over a multi-meter diameter launch tube periodically, but briefly at a time, to prevent excessive loss of vacuum during the moments when a mechanical shutter temporarily opens in advance of a hypervelocity spacecraft.

One of three closely related species of tropicbird (Phaethontidae), it was described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783. Superficially resembling a tern in appearance, it has almost all-white plumage with a black mask and a red bill. The sexes have similar plumage. As referenced in the common name, adults have red that are about twice their body length. Four subspecies are recognised, but there is evidence of clinal variation in body size‚Äîwith smaller birds in the north and larger in the south‚Äîand hence no grounds for subspecies. The red-tailed tropicbird eats fish‚Äîmainly flying fish and squid‚Äîafter catching them by plunge-diving into the ocean. Nesting takes place in loose colonies on oceanic islands; the nest itself is a scrape found on a cliff face, in a crevice, or on a sandy beach. A single egg is laid, then is incubated by both sexes for about six weeks. The parents make long food-foraging trips of about 150 hours during incubation, but once the chick has hatched, the parents specialize their foraging: one forages for the chick for a few hours at a time, while the other makes much longer trips to feed themselves. This bird is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though it is adversely affected by human contact. Rats and feral cats prey on eggs and young at nesting sites. The bird's tail streamers were once prized by some Hawaiian and Maori peoples. Taxonomy The British naturalist Sir Joseph Banks encountered the red-tailed tropicbird on the Pacific Ocean in March 1769 on James Cook's first voyage, noting that it was a different species to the familiar red-billed tropicbird. He gave it the name Phaeton erubescens. It was the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon who formally described the species in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux in 1781, noting it was a native of Isle de France (Mauritius). The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Buffon did not include a scientific name with his description but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Phaethon rubricauda in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek phaethon, \\"sun\\", while the species epithet comes from the Latin words ruber \\"red\\" and cauda \\"tail\\". English ornithologist John Latham wrote about the red-tailed tropicbird in 1785 in his General Synopsis of Birds, recording it as common in Mauritius and the South Pacific. He also reported a black- billed tropicbird collected from Palmerston Island that ended up in Banks' collection. Latham did not give them binomial names, however. It was left to German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin to describe the species, which he did as Phaeton phoenicuros and P. melanorhynchos respectively in the 13th edition of Systema Naturae in 1788. Latham later described this black-billed specimen as the New Holland tropicbird, giving it the name Phaethon novae- hollandiae. The British naturalist Walter Rothschild reviewed the described names and specimens in 1900 and concluded that the original use of P. erubescens was a nomen nudum. He concluded that the populations of Lord Howe, Norfolk and Kermadec Islands belonged to a distinct subspecies which he named P. rubicauda erubescens, due to their larger overall size, more robust bill and prominent reddish tinge to their plumage. He also classified P. melanorhynchus and P. novae-hollandiae as juveniles. The Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews then applied the name P. rubicauda roseotinctus to Rothschild's P. rubicauda erubescens. \\"Red-tailed tropicbird\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). Other common names include red-tailed bos'nbird or silver bos'nbird, the names derived from the semblance of the tail feathers to a boatswain's marlin spikes, and strawtail. The New Zealand MƒÅori call it amokura, and the native Hawaiians koae ula. Its closest relative is the white-tailed tropicbird (P. lepturus), the split between their ancestors taking place about four million years ago. Four subspecies are recognised by the IOC: *P. r. rubricauda Boddaert, 1783 the nominate subspecies, from the western Indian Ocean. Subsequent specimens from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands were allocated to this taxon. *P. r. westralis Mathews, 1912 from the eastern Indian Ocean. Mathews described it as separate on account of its larger wings. More extensive analysis in 1989 showed that the wing and beak size overlap between this and the nominate subspecies, leaving intensity of colour as the only distinguishing feature. *P. r. roseotinctus Mathews, 1926 from the southwestern Pacific Ocean, including populations on Kermadec, Lord Howe, Norfolk and Raine Islands. *P. r. melanorhynchos Gmelin, 1789 from the western, central and southern Pacific Ocean, including populations on the Cook Islands, Tonga, Samoa, the Marquesas and the Society Islands. The ornithologist Mike Tarburton reviewed the known subspecies in 1989 and concluded that none were valid, noting that there was a clinal change in size in the species: those from Kure Atoll in the North Pacific being the smallest; ranging to those from the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific being the largest. He also noted that the pink colouration was more intense in new plumage and faded after a few years in museum specimens. Description Closeup of head showing comma-shaped markings The red-tailed tropicbird measures on average, which includes the , and weighs around . It has a wingspan of . It has a streamlined but solid build with almost all-white plumage, often with a pink tinge. The sexes are similar in plumage. A dark brown comma-shaped stripe extends back from the lores, through and over the eyes and reaching the ear coverts. The iris is dark brown. The bill is bright red, slightly paler at the base and black around the nostrils. The legs and base of the toes are pale blue-mauve, while the webbing and rest of the toes are black. The white feathers of the head and rump have concealed dark brown bases, while those of the mantle, back, tail rectrices and tail coverts have dark brown shaft bases. The two long tail feathers are orange or red with white bases for around a tenth of their length, and can be hard to see when the bird is flying. The white wings are marked by dark chevron-shaped patches on the tertials, and the dark shafts of the primary flight feathers are visible. The pink tinge is often more pronounced in the remiges of the upper wing. Moulting takes place outside the breeding season, the streamers being replaced before the rest of the feathers. Streamers are replaced at any time, one growing while the other is shed, and old streamers may litter the area around a breeding colony. Newly-hatched chicks are covered in thin, long, grey-white down, which is paler on the head. The lores are bare. The down is greyer in older chicks. The primaries, rectrices and scapulars are evident in the third week, and chicks are mostly feathered with residual down on underparts and under the wings after six weeks, and fully feathered by 11 weeks. Juvenile birds have a glossy white forehead, chin, throat and underparts, and prominent black barring and scaling on their crown, nape, mantle, back, rump and upper wing coverts. Their bills are blackish grey with a light blue-grey base, and grey legs and feet. In Australian waters the red- tailed tropicbird could be confused with the silver gull (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) or various tern species, though it is larger and heavier-set, with a wedge-shaped tail. Its red bill and more wholly white wings distinguish it from the adult white-tailed tropicbird. Immature red-tailed tropicbirds likewise can be distinguished from immature white-tailed tropicbirds by their partly red rather than yellow bills. The red-tailed tropicbird is generally silent while flying. Aside from during courtship displays, birds may give a short greeting squawk to their mate when arriving or leaving the nest. Birds give a low growling call as a defence call, and young chatter repetitively as a begging call‚Äîmade whenever the parents are nearby. Distribution and habitat The red-tailed tropicbird ranges across the southern Indian, and western and central Pacific Oceans, from the African coast to Indonesia, the waters around the southern reaches of Japan, across to Chile, and the Hawaiian Islands, where they are more common on the northwestern islands. It frequents areas of ocean with water temperatures from and salinity under 35% in the southern hemisphere and 33.5% in the northern hemisphere. In the Pacific Ocean, the southern boundary of its range runs along the summer surface isotherm. The birds disperse widely after breeding. Evidence suggests birds in the Indian Ocean follow prevailing winds westwards, young individuals banded in Sumatra and Sugarloaf Rock, Western Australia, being recovered at Mauritius and R√©union respectively. Banding on Kure Atoll suggests birds in the North Pacific disperse in an easterly direction, following prevailing winds there. Strong winds can blow them inland on occasions, which explains some sighting records away from the coast and their preferred habitats. There are large breeding colonies on Europa, Aldabra and Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, with smaller colonies in Madagascar, where it nests on the tiny island of Nosy Ve, the Seychelles, and Mauritius. It is also found on the Australian territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean. The warm waters of the Leeuwin Current facilitate the species nesting at Cape Leeuwin in southwestern Australia, yet is only a rare visitor to New South Wales at corresponding latitudes on the Australian east coast. It also nests at Ashmore Reef and Rottnest Island off Western Australia, as well as Sugarloaf Rock at Cape Naturaliste and Busselton on the Western Australian coastline itself. In the Pacific area, it nests on the Australian offshore territories of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands, and on Queensland's coral islands (including Raine Island and Lady Elliot Island). In mid-2020 Australian scientists found a bird on Lady Elliott Island that they had banded 23 years earlier as a chick, but had not seen since, which had come back to breed on the island. In New Zealand territory it breeds on the Kermadec Islands. Elsewhere in the Pacific it breeds in Fiji, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Hawaii‚Äîwith a large colony on Kure Atoll‚Äîthe Cook Islands, Pitcairn Island, and islands off Japan and Chile. It is an occasional visitor to Palau, breeding being recorded from the Southwest Islands, and was first recorded from Guam in 1992. It is an uncommon vagrant to New Zealand proper, where it has been recorded from the northern reaches of North Island, especially Three Kings Islands. It is a very rare vagrant to North America, with records from California and Vancouver Island. Behaviour The red-tailed tropicbird is a strong flyer, and walks on land with difficulty using a shuffling gait. Courtship displays consist of flying backwards, vertical displays and circles. Phaethon rubricauda-courtship fly backwards.jpgFlying backwards courtship ritual. Kƒ´lauea Point, Hawaii =Breeding= P. r. rubricuada nesting on Nosy Ve The red-tailed tropicbird is thought to be monogamous, pairs remaining bonded over successive breeding seasons, although such information as age at first breeding and pair-formation is not known. It nests in loose colonies, on offshore islands and stacks, rocky cliffs, coral atolls and cays. It rarely nests on large bodies of land, though has done so in southern Western Australia. The nest itself is a shallow scrape, in either shaded sand or a rocky crevice, or under a shrub. Because the red-tailed tropicbird does not walk well, it lands by flying into the wind, stalling and dropping to the ground. The nest is often located within of the edge of the shrub (or other shaded area) to minimise walking distance. The tropicbird often chooses shrubs with fewer stems for accessibility. Nesting and sheltering chick under its wing Egg ‚Äì Mus√©um de Toulouse Young chick with down Young bird on Nosy Ve, Madagascar The species is territorial to a degree, aggressively defending the nest site and pecking radius around it, commencing around three months before breeding. Birds are more aggressive at crowded colonies, where numbers are large or suitable nest sites less common. They adopt a defence posture, which consists of raising the humeri up and bringing the wrists together, drawing the neck into the body and shaking the head sideways, fluffing up the head feathers and squawking. Bill-jabbing and fights can break out, the two combatants locking bills and wrestling for up to 90 minutes. Mate choice is likely to be based partially on the length of the tail streamers, a bird having longer tail streamers being more attractive as a mate. This tropicbird also probably mates assortatively for tail streamer length, meaning mates likely have streamers of about equal length. In the leadup to breeding, males initiate an aerial courtship display of flying in large circles, alternating between gliding, short periods of rapid wing- beating, and low flight within a few metres of the water, while making sharp cackling calls. Initially flying in small groups, birds then pair off to repeat the display in pairs before bonding. Once pairs have established a nest, they do not perform the display. The timing of breeding depends on location; in some places, birds breed in a defined breeding season, whereas in others, there is none. South of the equator, the latter is likely to be true. On islands near the equator, laying usually occurs from June to November, the majority of chicks fledging around January to February. On Christmas Island, breeding takes place at different times on different parts of the island due to prevailing weather conditions. Some birds may remain at the breeding site year-round. On sub-tropical Lady Elliott Island off Queensland, they nest in winter, which scientists think may be timed to avoid the common breeding times of most migratory species of seabird, such as the noisy Wedge-tailed Shearwater (mutton bird). Not much is yet known about their habits though. The female red-tailed tropicbird lays one egg, which both parents incubate for 42 to 46 days. The male generally takes the first turn on the egg after it is laid. Ranging from long (averaging between , depending on location) and wide, the oval eggs are pale tan with brown and red-black markings that are more prominent on the larger end. Born helpless and unable to move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are initially blind, opening their eyes after 2‚Äì3 days. Until they are a week old, they open their beak only upon touch, so the parents have to stroke the base of the bill to initiate feeding. Feeding takes place once or twice a day, generally around midday. They are constantly brooded by the parents until they are a week old, after which time they are sheltered under the parents‚Äô wings. They also rise up and gape at any nearby bird for food. Both parents feed the young, by shoving its beak into the chick's gullet and then regurgitating food. Initially covered with grey or white down, they grow their first feathers‚Äîscapulars‚Äîat 16‚Äì20 days. Their feet and beaks grow rapidly, outpacing the rest of their bodies. Chicks remain in the nest for 67 to 91 days until they fledge. =Feeding= The red-tailed tropicbird is mostly a , diving anywhere from an above-water height of , to a depth of about , although this may change seasonally. When diving, it remains briefly submerged‚Äîone study on Christmas Island came up with an average time of 26.6 seconds‚Äîgenerally swallowing its prey before surfacing. The red-tailed tropicbird sometimes catches flying fish in the air. During incubation, foraging trips are relatively long, with an average excursion taking about 153 hours. These trips are to very productive areas. After the chicks hatch, on the other hand, the parents adopt a strategy where one takes long trips (these averaging about 57 hours) for self feeding, and the other takes short trips (about three hours long) to feed the chicks. The bimodality of the length of foraging trips is likely to be because of the fact that it is the optimal balance of self-feeding and provisioning for chicks. On Christmas Island, birds generally forage far out to sea in the early morning and closer to shore in the afternoon. Squid and flying fish make up a large portion of this bird's diet, along with some crustaceans, depending on location. Fieldwork in the Mozambique Channel revealed the diet of birds there to be mostly fish by mass but equal numbers of fish and squid caught. Fish recorded include the mirrorwing flyingfish (Hirundichthys speculiger) and spotfin flyingfish (Cheilopogon furcatus) and several other unidentified species of the flying fish family Exocoetidae, the pompano dolphinfish (Coryphaena equiselis) and common dolphinfish (C. hippurus), needleflish including the houndfish (Tylosurus crocodilus), and unidentified members of Hemiramphidae, Scombridae, and Carangidae. The purpleback flying squid (Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis) was by far the most common cephalopod eaten, followed by the common blanket octopus (Tremoctopus violaceus). A field study in Hawaii found flying fish dominated the prey species, the tropical two-wing flyingfish (Exocoetus volitans) and members of the genus Cypselurus prominent, followed by squid of the family Ommastrephidae including the purpleback flying squid and the glass squid (Hyaloteuthis pelagica), and carangid fish including the shortfin scad (Decapterus macrosoma). The red-tailed tropicbird has also been recorded eating porcupinefish (Diodontidae), although adults have been troubled when the victim fish inflates resulting in it being urgently regurgitated. A strong flyer with large mouth and bill, the red-tailed tropicbird can carry relatively large prey for its size, parent birds commonly bearing dolphin fish that weighed 120 g‚Äî16% of their own weight‚Äîto their chicks. =Temperature regulation= When incubating during the day in a shaded nest, this bird has an average temperature of , compared to its average temperature when incubating at night of . The difference is likely due to activity levels, as the air temperature during these times does not differ significantly with a bird in the nest. After flying, the average body temperature is . The temperature of the feet is always lower than that of the body temperature during flight, but always higher than the air temperature. Thus, the feet are likely used to dissipate heat during flight. Relationship with humans The red-tailed tropicbird's tail streamers were highly prized by the Maori. The NgƒÅpuhi tribe of the Northland Region would look for and collect them off dead or stray birds blown ashore after easterly gales, trading them for greenstone with tribes from the south. English naturalist Andrew Bloxam reported that the feathers were valued in Hawaii, where the locals would pull them off the birds as they nested. Status Being swarmed by yellow crazy ants, Johnston Atoll The red-tailed tropicbird is classified as a least-concern species according to the IUCN on account of its large range of up to . The population in the eastern Pacific has been estimated to be as high as 80,000 birds with a minimum of 41,000 birds. Around 9,000 birds breed on Europa Island, and 9,000‚Äì12,000 breed on the Hawaiian islands. Human presence generally affects the species adversely, by the destruction of habitat or introduction of pests. Within Australia, it is classified as near threatened, due to unexpected declines in some populations, the impact of humans, and the yellow crazy ant overrunning Christmas Island. It is listed as vulnerable in New South Wales. Predators recorded in Western Australia include large raptors such as the white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) and the eastern osprey (Pandion cristatus); while silver gulls, and crows and ravens (Corvus spp.) raid nests for eggs and young. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds (P. aethereus) have been implicated in egg loss of nests in Hawaii. Feral dogs and cats prey on nesting birds on Christmas Island, while feral cats are a severe problem on Norfolk Island. Rats have been a serious problem on Kure Atoll, causing heavy losses. Yellow crazy ants were discovered on Johnston Atoll in the north Pacific Ocean in 2010, hordes of which overrun nesting areas and can blind victims with their spray. Also on Johnston Atoll, the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS) was burning stockpiled chemical weapons until 2000. It was studied over eight years to see if there were effects from potential contaminants. There appeared to be no impact on survival during the study period, although young birds from downwind of the plant were less likely to return there than those upwind of the plant‚Äîpossibly due to the more intact vegetation at the latter site. Scientists studying the bird on Lady Elliot Island off the Queensland coast in 2020 say that the lack of knowledge about its habits and populations means that they don't know how much environmental changes are affecting its populations. Their study includes taking DNA samples, banding new chicks and fitting birds with satellite trackers, in a bit to find out more about their movements.

This is in contrast to: *precision seeding, where seed is placed at a precise spacing and depth; *hydroseeding, where a slurry of seed, mulch and water is sprayed over prepared ground in a uniform layer. Broadcast seeding is of particular use in establishing dense plant spacing, as for cover crops and lawns. In comparison to traditional drill planting, broadcast seeding will require 10‚Äì20% more seed. It's simpler, faster, and easier than traditional row sowing. Broadcast seeding works best for plants that do not require singular spacing or that are more easily thinned later. After broadcasting, seed is often lightly buried with some type of raking action, often done using vertical tillage tools. Utilizing these tools increases the success rate of germination by increasing seed-to-soil contact. Seeds sown in this manner are distributed unevenly, which may result in overcrowding. This method may not ensure that all seeds are sown at the correct depth. Incorrect depth, if too deep, would result in germination that would not allow the young plant to break the surface of the soil and prevent sprouting. If they are not sown evenly then there would be a lack of various nutrients from sunlight, oxygen etc in many crops or plants. In addition, it is worth noting that not all seeds are good candidates for broadcast seeding. Often, only smaller seeds will sprout and continue to grow successfully when planted by way of broadcasting. In general, the larger the seed, the deeper it can be planted.

In February 1988 he bought his own second hand board, and the month after he participated in the Nordic Championship held at Rauland. H√•konsen won in the junior class, and quickly became part of the team of the Norwegian importer for snowboard manufacturer Burton Snowboards, Elling Balhald. After winning a number of Norwegian competitions in the 1988-1989 season, H√•konsen was invited to meet Craig Kelly at Juvass (Galdh√∏piggen Summer Ski Centre). At the time, Kelly was the world's leading and best known snowboarder. H√•konsen has on several occasions said that he regarded Kelly as his mentor.The Haakonsen Faktor (Movie) In turn, Kelly saw the boy's potential and put him in touch with his sponsor, Burton Snowboards. At the age of 15, H√•konsen travelled to the USA by himself and negotiated his first professional contracts with Burton and Oakley. H√•konsen completed the final year of lower secondary school and then took the decision, due to the contracts, not to apply to upper secondary school. H√•konsen made his international debut in February 1990 with a fifth-place finish in halfpipe at the World Cup in St. Moritz. One month later he began to be noticed a lot more following a fifth-place finish in halfpipe at the US Open as part of a strong field. H√•konsen also came fifth in the halfpipe and moguls in the same year at the world championships in Breckenridge. This was the last year that the moguls were included as an event in snowboarding competitions. During his first seasons, H√•konsen took part in both the freestyle and alpine branches of snowboarding. Despite the strong wishes of his sponsors that he participate in all forms of competition, H√•konsen opted to focus solely on halfpipe and freeriding during the course of the 1990-1991 season. Part of the reason that he had previously stopped competing in alpine skiing was that he was tired of the strict competitive regime, feeling there was too little play or action. He found the alpine discipline of snowboarding to have similar traits. In protest at the pressure to compete in all forms of competition, he began taking part in alpine events using a freestyle board. The last competition at which he participated in the alpine disciplines was the European championship in 1991. He took fourth place in the parallel slalom on the same board he used to win the halfpipe competition. In the years that followed, H√•konsen dominated freestyle snowboarding. In the 1991-1992 season, he won 14 international competitions - including a number of world cup meetings - in a row. It has been claimed that he was the first snowboarder during this period to achieve a \\"rock-'n'-roll hero\\"-status.First descent (Movie) The 1994 season was the last one in which H√•konsen participated in the world cup with overall victory as a goal - he felt there was too little time for freeriding and too much focus on competitions. After H√•konsen had featured in a number of different snowboarding films, Volcom produced a biographical film in 1996 about H√•konsen entitled Subjekt Haakonsen. This was followed up with The Haakonsen faktor in 1999. In 2005, he featured in the documentary First Descent, in which he was the first person to ever snowboard down peak 7601 in Alaska. When halfpipe was introduced as an Olympic event during the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, H√•konsen boycotted the qualifiers. H√•konsen, as well as many other snowboarders, were unhappy with the IOC, particularly because they had chosen the International Ski Federation (FIS) to organise qualification instead of the snowboarders' own federation, the ISF. H√•konsen considered this to be a theft of the sport.http://whitelines.com/features/comment/terje-haakonsen-why- i-still-hate-the- olympics.html#qdFEkmQqlTOeCilm.97http://snowboardmag.com/stories/the-olympic- issue-terje-haakonsen-interview  Life after the competitive career  Although H√•konsen never formally retired, it became increasingly rare to see him at competitions towards the end of the 1990s. Unhappy with the traditional competition format, he created his own competition, The Arctic Challenge, in 2000. The basic idea behind the competition was that it should be on the snowboarders' own terms. In 2002, The Arctic Challenge, along with other independent events, launched the Ticket to Ride World Snowboard tour. This tour, which is now known as the World Snowboard tour, is now the biggest, most prestigious international snowboard tour in the world. H√•konsen is still a professional snowboarder. He spends most of his time recording films and working for sponsors, but periodically appears in competitions. In 2012 he won the Mt. Baker Banked Slalom for the seventh time. In the same year he came fifth in the quarterpipe and won \\"highest air\\" at the snowboarding world championships in Oslo. In March 2015 he won the Sudden Rush Banked Slalom in Laax, Switzerland. In recent years in Norway, H√•konsen has become a spokesman for organic food and healthy dieting through interviews, TV appearances, and newspaper articles.http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/Dropp- drittmat-pa-idrettsarrangementer-7545341.html He also opposed Oslo's bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, and in September 2014 he participated in a live debate on the NRK 1 TV channel on the issue.http://tv.nrk.no/serie/debatten/NNFA51090414/04-09-2014  Philanthropy  H√•konsen's activities go beyond his own discipline and elite sport. Together with the philanthropist Jan Chr. Sundt, he has founded the Funkisstiftelsen foundation and Greener Events. The Funkisstiftelsen foundation is intended to initiate and inspire activities on snow for those with physical disabilities. Greener Events has established itself as a leader in facilitating and providing advice on environmental awareness for all types of sporting and cultural events.

Jones (born August 21, 1982) is a former American college and professional football player. Jones was a consensus All-American running back for Virginia Tech in 2003 and selected in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft. Jones played professionally for six seasons (2004‚Äì10) for the Detroit Lions and Chicago Bears in the National Football League (NFL). Early years = High School = Jones was born in Chester, Pennsylvania. With his natural ability and his father's training regimen, he became a highly conditioned athlete at a very young age. Jones was a multi-sport athlete in high school (1997-2001) and competed at the varsity level as a freshman at Cardinal O'Hara High School in Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Track and field Jones was a star track and field athlete, excelling in the 60 meters (6.79 sec), 100 meters (10.59 sec), long jump (6.92 m) and triple jump (14.57 m).  Football  O'Hara Head football coach, George Stratts reluctantly started Jones as a freshman. Jones had immediate success on the field and was a four-year starter, breaking many school records.

Other notable recipients of the award include: Adrian Peterson, Jimmy Clausen, and Terrelle Pryor.  College choice reveal  In 2000, Jones was the No.1 overall recruit in the nation. Courted by many colleges, Kevin narrowed his choices to Penn State and Virginia Tech. To the surprise of many, Jones chose to become a Hokie, making his decision the day after a home visit from Virginia Tech Head Coach, Frank Beamer. Jones said of his decision, \\"If you're a blue-chipper from Pennsylvania, you go to Penn State. But I've always been a little contrary. On the day of my press conference, I still hadn't decided between Virginia Tech and PSU. As I sat down in front of everybody, I had both jerseys with me. I pulled the Penn State jersey out of a bag and said, \\"I will ... not be attending Penn State.\\" Then I ripped off my sweater and had a Mike Vick jersey on underneath. The entire room was flabbergasted.\\"http://insider.espn.go.com/ncaa/recruiting/insider/news/story?id=6062100 Jones' college reveal was so highly anticipated that it was covered nationally, and televised by several local news stations. Since then, the use of props (hats, shirts, gear, music etc.) by recruits to announce their college choice has become a staple of the recruiting experience. The phenomenon can be credited to Jones, who was the first to ever do so with his reveal in 2000. College career Jones played for Virginia Tech and Hall of Fame coach Frank Beamer, from 2000 to 2003.

The post of jiedushi has been translated as \\"military commissioner\\", \\"legate\\", or \\"regional commander\\". Originally introduced in 711 to counter external threats, the jiedushi were posts authorized with the supervision of a defense command often encompassing several prefectures, the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes and promote and appoint subordinates. Powerful jiedushi eventually became fanzhen rulers (de facto warlords) and overrode the power of the central government. An early example of this was An Lushan, who was appointed jiedushi of three regions, which he used to start the An Lushan Rebellion that abruptly ended the golden age of the Tang dynasty. Even after the difficult suppression of that rebellion, some jiedushi such as the Three Fanzhen of Hebei were allowed to retain their powers due to the weakened state of the court. The jiedushi were one the primary factors which contributed to the political division of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, a period marked by continuous infighting among rival kingdoms, dynasties, and regional regimes established by jiedushi. History =710s= Hexi Jiedushi was created in 711 and headquartered in Liang Prefecture. It was lost to the Tibetan Empire in 766.

She was born in Mission Viejo, California, and has snowboarded since she was 13 years old. She now resides in Mammoth Lakes, California. Career As a child, she took part in gymnastics and skateboarding. When she was a teenager, she branched out into several other more dangerous sports and became involved in motocross, surfing, mountain- and snow-based sports. This variety of sports experience gave her an edge in the X Games competitions. At the Winter X Games in 1999 Dakides won a silver medal in slopestyle and a gold in big air, in 2000 she won two gold medals, one in slopestyle with a combined score of 88.50 after three runs, the other in big air with a combined score of 78.00. In 2001, she won another big air gold medal with a score of 89.00, and she was seventh in slopestyle. At the 2001 Sims World Championships she was first in slopestyle and fifth in big air At the 2002 X Games she won her third slopestyle gold medal. She also received EXPN's Snowboarder of the Year award. In May 2003 Dakides participated in the Gumball 3000 rally race. She continues to race in motocross, shifter carts in addition to racing in the Baja 1000 competition. Media She has appeared as a cover model for various sports magazines and has appeared in various video games. In 2001, she was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and was named \\"The Coolest Sports Woman in 2001\\". Dakides was featured on Spike TV's special edition of MXC on April 22, 2004 which was taped at the Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Florida and was dubbed MXC Almost Live. At the end of the episode, Dakides successfully ran the Log Drop after being challenged by Tony Hawk. During her appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2004, Dakides attempted to perform a stunt outside the Ed Sullivan Theater but fell 15 feet from a ramp while not wearing a helmet. She was taken to hospital and required stitches on the back of her head. She recovered and returned to the show for an interview a few days later. Dakides is a spokesperson for the Surfrider Foundation, a non-profit environmental organization.

The New York Times. nytimes.com. Retrieved 2018-05-12. Print version, May 10, 2018, p. A25. When Olmi was three years old, his family moved to Milan, where he attended a scientific high school and took acting classes at the Academy of Dramatic Arts. He became interested in filmmaking while he was working at the Milanese electrical company Edisonvolta, where he began by producing 16mm documentaries about power plants. In 1963 he married Loredana Detto, who had played Antonietta Masetti in his film Il Posto (1961). Another early film was I fidanzati (1963). Perhaps his best known film is The Tree of Wooden Clogs (L'Albero degli zoccoli), which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. The film drew heavily on Olmi's grandmother's stories about peasant life in agricultural regions of Italy. In 1983 his film Walking, Walking was screened out of competition at Cannes. In 1988, his La leggenda del santo bevitore (The Legend of the Holy Drinker), based on the novella by Joseph Roth and starring Rutger Hauer, won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival as well as a David di Donatello award. His The Profession of Arms (Il mestiere delle armi) also won a David di Donatello award. In 2008 he received the Honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Olmi died on 7 May 2018 in Asiago, after a long battle with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Directing techniques Olmi's films have been described as \\"humanistic and reflective, portraying everyday people in particular landscapes and locations, while at the same time being charged with social comment and poetic flashes.\\" His films fit into the artistic mold of Italian neorealism, though Olmi argued, in an interview found on the Criterion Edition DVD of his 1961 film, Il Posto, that this was the artistic tradition he was responding against because he used non- actors in authentic locations whereas neorealism, he claimed, used professional actors. However, many neorealist directors also used non- professional actors for secondary and sometimes even primary roles. His films, like most of those considered to be products of the neorealist movement, are shot in long, slow takes, and generally contain some sort of social commentary, though rarely do the neorealists wear their political opinions on their sleeves.

Kelly is known as the 'Godfather of Freeriding'; Terje H√•konsen called Kelly the best snowboarder of all time. Over his 15-year professional career, he won 4 world championships and 3 U.S. championships; he won the Mt. Baker Banked Slalom snowboarding competition in 1988, 1991, and 1993. Education He attended the University of Washington where he was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity and studied Chemical Engineering. Life and snowboarding career Craig grew up in Mount Vernon, WA, a mid-sized town centrally located for equidistant travel to ski areas such as Mount Baker, Stevens Pass and Snoqualmie. Craig spent a lot of time at the Pac West ski area (Hyak, WA) in 1985‚Äì86. He used to come up on Mondays when the ski area was closed and would set up gates with some of the workers and run them using a snowmobile to get back and forth. He also won the first snowboard contest held at Hyak, in the 85‚Äì86 season. It was done in conjunction with another founder of the sport, Bob Barci. Craig Kelly Starred in a Wrigleys Gum commercial in 1988/1989 where he was featured doing a 540. Craig appeared in Warren Millers movies in several consecutive years. In 2003 Warren Miller dedicated a segment in his film titled \\"JOURNEY\\" to Craig. Craig had starring roles in Siberia, p-tex lies and duct tape which were both Gregory Stump films. Craig Kelly was the first snowboarder to appear in an Imax movie. He shocked the snowboard industry by walking away from multimillion-dollar deals at the height of the snowboard craze to pursue his passion for \\"freeriding,\\" at the time an unheard of strategy for a pro snowboarder. It was in the mountains where Craig felt the happiest. He was part owner and on the board of directors of Island Lake Catskiing near Fernie B.C. where he spent a lot of time freeriding and filming. The distinctive fluid manner in which he rode was recognized and acclaimed in the snowboarding community. He was called a \\"style master\\" by TransWorld Snowboard Magazine editor Jon Foster. Kelly also appeared in an enormous number of video and photo shoots. He was known for looking straight at the camera, even in the midst of a difficult aerial maneuver. Craig was a Sims Snowboards team rider for a few years early in his career, but spent most of his life riding for Burton Snowboards owned by Jake Burton Carpenter. The Craig Kelly World Snowboard Camp was created to help kids improve their snowboarding skills. From 1988 to 1992 it was located in Whistler Blackcomb. Craig was responsible for the design and development of the following Burton signature models: The Mystery Air, The Craig Kelly Air, The CK Slopestyle, The Cascade, and The Omen. Jake Burton is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúWhen I started listening to Craig that was when my company became successful and really took off.‚Äù He added, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ when the rest of the industry listened to Craig, that was when the sport really took off.‚Äù In the last few years of his life, Craig embarked on a 14-month journey starting up in Alaska and going down to Chile with his partner (girlfriend) Savina and two friends for adventure, surfing and living. He returned from his journey with his new baby Olivia, as a \\"souvenir\\" he said, from his trip. Craig Kelly was studying to become a Certified Canadian Mountain Guide. Craig died on 20 January 2003 near Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada in an avalanche which trapped 8 people and killed 6 others. Craig Kelly memorial In 2012 the owner of Baldface lodge, Jeff Pensiero, asked Keith Berens of Live Metal Studio to design the memorial sculpture. The memorial is a 10-ft welded steel cross, with coloured glass set within and a prayer wheel made from local yew wood beneath. It was unveiled on 20 January 2013. The cross overlooks Baldface Lodge near Nelson, British Columbia. It was sponsored by Baldface Lodge and Burton Snowboards.

Bruised leaves present a fragrance reminiscent of skunk. Description Symplocarpus foetidus leaves out in mid- spring after the flowers have bloomed. Eastern skunk cabbage has leaves which are large, long and broad. It flowers early in the spring when only the flowers are visible above the mud. The stems remain buried below the surface of the soil with the leaves emerging later. The flowers are produced on a long spadix contained within a spathe, tall and mottled purple in colour. The rhizome is often thick. Distribution The eastern skunk cabbage is native to eastern North America, from Nova Scotia and southern Quebec west to Minnesota, and south to North Carolina and Tennessee. It is protected as endangered in Tennessee.USDA PLANTS Database: S. foetidus Ecology Breaking or tearing a leaf produces a pungent but harmless odor, the source of the plant's common name; it is also foul smelling when it blooms. The plant is not poisonous to the touch. The foul odor attracts its pollinators: scavenging flies, stoneflies, and bees. The odor in the leaves may also serve to discourage large animals from disturbing or damaging this plant, which grows in soft wetland soils. Eastern skunk cabbage is notable for its ability to generate temperatures of up to above air temperature by cyanide resistant cellular respiration in order to melt its way through frozen ground, placing it among a small group of thermogenic plants. Even though it flowers while there is still snow and ice on the ground, it is successfully pollinated by early insects that also emerge at this time. Some studies suggest that beyond allowing the plant to grow in icy soil, the heat it produces may help to spread its odor in the air. Carrion-feeding insects that are attracted by the scent may be doubly encouraged to enter the spathe because it is warmer than the surrounding air, fueling pollination. Eastern skunk cabbage has contractile roots which contract after growing into the earth. This pulls the stem of the plant deeper into the mud, so that the plant in effect grows downward, not upward. Each year, the plant grows deeper into the earth, so that older plants are practically impossible to dig up. They reproduce by hard, pea-sized seeds which fall in the mud and are carried away by animals or by floods. Some blowflies, such as Calliphora vomitoria are known pollinators of skunk cabbage. Uses In the 19th century the U.S. Pharmacopoeia listed eastern skunk cabbage as the drug \\"dracontium\\". It was used in the treatment of respiratory diseases, nervous disorders, rheumatism, and dropsy. In North America and Europe, skunk cabbage is occasionally cultivated in water gardens.Flora of North America: S. foetidus Skunk cabbage was used extensively as a medicinal plant, seasoning, and magical talisman by various tribes of Native Americans.Dr. Moerman's Native American Ethnobotanical Database: S. foetidus The thoroughly dried young leaves are quite good reconstituted in soups or stews. The thoroughly dried rootstocks can be made into a pleasant cocoa-like flour. Toxicity Skunk cabbage often contains calcium oxalate crystals, and therefore the plant is considered to have medium toxicity to humans. The toxicity may be removed through careful preparation.Symplocarpus foetidus. Gallery File:ÏïâÏùÄÎ∂ÄÏ±Ñ.jpgEastern skunk cabbage melting a hole through the snow.

This is in contrast to broadcast seeding, where seed is scattered over an area. Although precise hand placement would qualify, precision seeding usually refers to a mechanical process. A wide range of hand-push and powered precision seeders are available for small- to large-scale jobs. Using a variety of actions, they all open the soil, place the seed, then cover it, to create rows. The depth and spacing vary depending on the type of crop and the desired plant density. In commercial production, precision seeding is an alternative to placing larger quantities of seed in a row, by dribbling seed or setting several seeds in each position. Depending on the device, precision seeders may place only one, or a very few seeds per position. This is an advantage, in that it saves seed and it avoids crowding, or the need for thinning, allowing plants the space to grow efficiently. On the downside, by placing fewer seeds, a very high germination rate is required to make full use of the seeded area.

It is similar in its general approach to Joseph Goguen's OBJ3 implementation of equational logic, but based on rewriting logic rather than order-sorted equational logic, and with a heavy emphasis on powerful metaprogramming based on reflection. Maude is free software, and tutorials are available online.  Elementary example  Maude modules (rewrite theories) consist of a term-language plus sets of equations and rewrite-rules. Terms in a rewrite theory are constructed using operators (functions taking 0 or more arguments of some sort, which return a term of a specific sort). Operators taking 0 arguments are considered constants, and one constructs their term- language by these simple constructs. =Example 1= fmod NAT is sort Nat . op 0 : -> Nat [ctor] . op s : Nat -> Nat [ctor] . endfm This rewrite theory specifies all the natural numbers. The sort saying is introduced, that there exists a sort called Nat (short for natural numbers), and below is the specification of how these terms are constructed. The operator s in Example 1 is the successor function representing the next natural number in the sequence of natural numbers i.e. s(N) := N + 1. s(0) is meant to represent the natural number 1 and so on. 0 is a constant, it takes no input parameter(s) but returns a Nat. =Example 2= fmod NAT is sort Nat . op 0 : -> Nat [ctor] . op s : Nat -> Nat [ctor] . op _+_ : Nat Nat -> Nat . vars N M : Nat . eq 0 + N = N . eq s(N) + M = s (N + M) . endfm In Example 2 the + sign is introduced, meant to represent addition of natural numbers. Its definition is almost identical to the previous one, with input and output sorts, but there is a difference: its operator has underscores on each side. Maude lets the user specify whether or not operators are infix, postfix or prefix (default), this is done using underscores as place fillers for the input terms. So the + operator takes its input on each side making it an infix operator. Unlike our previous operator s which takes its input terms after the operator (prefix). The three stars are Maude's rest-of-line-comments and lets the parser know that it can ignore the rest of the line (not part of the program), with parenthesis meaning section comments: *** rest of line is ignored by Maude *** ( section is ignored by Maude ) The extended Nat module also holds two variables and two sets of equations. vars N M : Nat . eq 0 + N = N . eq s(N) + M = s (N + M) . When Maude \\"executes\\", it rewrites terms according to our specifications. And this is done with the statement reduce in : . or the shorter form red . For this last statement to be used it is important that nothing is ambiguous. A small example from our rewrite theory representing the natural numbers: reduce in NAT : s(0) + s(0) . rewrites: 2 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second) result Nat: s(s(0)) Using the two equations in the rewrite theory NAT Maude was able to reduce our term into the desired term, the representation of the number two i.e. the second successor of 0. At that point no other application of the two equations were possible, so Maude halts. Maude rewrites terms according to the equations whenever there is a match between the closed terms that one tries to rewrite (or reduce) and the left hand side of an equation in our equation-set. A match in this context is a substitution of the variables in the left hand side of an equation which leaves it identical to the term that one tries to rewrite/reduce. To illustrate it further one can look at the left hand side of the equations as Maude executes, reducing/rewriting the term. eq s(N) + M = s (N + M) . can be applied to the term: s(0) + s(0) since the substitution: N => 0 M => s(0) s(N) + M N => 0, M => s(0)  s(0) + s(0) makes them identical, and therefore it can be reduced/rewritten using this equation. After this equation has been applied to the term, one is left with the term: s (0 + s(0)) If one takes a close look at that term, they will see that it has a fitting substitution with matches the first equation, at least parts of the term matches the first equation: eq 0 + N = N . substitution: N => s(0) s (0 + N) N => s(0)  s (0 + s(0)) 0 + s(0) - matches first equation and is rewritten The second substitution and rewrite step rewrites an inner-term (the whole term does not match any of the equations but the inner term does). Then one ends up with our resulting term s(s(0)), and it can seem like a lot of hassle to add 1 + 1, but hopefully you will soon see the strength of this approach. Another thing worth mentioning is that reduction/rewriting up to this point has taken something very important for granted, which is: * Reduction/Rewriting terminates * Reduction/Rewriting is confluent (applying the equations in any order will eventually lead to the same resulting term) This cannot be taken for granted, and for a rewrite theory to be sane, one has to ensure that equational application is confluent and terminating. To prove that term-rewriting terminates is not possible in every instance, which we know from studying the halting problem. To be able to prove that term-rewriting (with regards to the equations) terminates, one can usually create some mapping between terms and the natural numbers, and show that application of the equations reduces the associated value of the term. Induction then proves that it is a halting process since the event of finding smaller natural numbers is a halting process. Naturally equation sets that can cause a term-rewrite to contain cycles will not be terminating. To prove confluence is another important aspect since a rewrite theory lacking this ability will be rather flawed. To prove that the equation set is confluent one has to prove that any application of the equations to any belonging term will lead to the same resulting term (termination is a prerequisite). Details for how to prove termination or confluence will not be given here, it just had to be mentioned, since this is where equations and rewrite-rules differ, which is the next topic of this short overview. Rewrite rules Up to this point rewriting and reduction have been more or less the same thing, our first rewrite theory had no rewrite rules, still we rewrote terms, so it is time to illustrate what rewrite rules are, and how they differ from the equations we have seen so far (they do not differ much from equations naturally since we talk about the two concepts almost interchangeably). The module presented so far NAT which represented the natural numbers and addition on its elements, is considered a functional module/rewrite theory, since it contains no rewrite rules. Such modules are often encapsuled with a fmod and endfm (instead of mod endm) to illustrate this fact. A functional module and its set of equations must be confluent and terminating since they build up the part of a rewrite theory that always should compute the same result, this will be clear once the rewrite rules come into play. =Example 3= mod PERSON is including NAT . *** our previous module sort Person . sort State . op married : -> State [ctor] . op divorced : -> State [ctor] . op single : -> State [ctor] . op engaged : -> State [ctor] . op dead : -> State [ctor] . op person : State Nat -> Person [ctor] . var N : Nat . var S : State . rl [birthday] : person (S, N) => person (S, N + s(0)) . rl [get-engaged] : person (single, N) => person (engaged, N) . rl [get-married] : person (engaged, N) => person (married, N) . rl [get-divorced] : person (married, N) => person (divorced, N) . rl [las-vegas] : person (S, N) => person (married, N) . rl [die] : person (S, N) => person (dead, N) . endm This module introduces two new sorts, and a set of rewrite rules. We also include our previous module, to illustrate how equations and rewrite rules differ. The rewrite rules is thought of as a set of legal state changes, so while equations hold the same meaning on both sides of the equality sign, rewrite rules do not (rewrite rules use a => token instead of an equality sign). You are still the same person after you're married (this is open for debate), but something has changed, your marital status at least. So this is illustrated by a rewrite rule, not an equation. Rewrite rules do not have to be confluent and terminating so it does matter a great deal what rules are chosen to rewrite the term. The rules are applied at \\"random\\" by the Maude system, meaning that you can not be sure that one rule is applied before another rule and so on. If an equation can be applied to the term, it will always be applied before any rewrite rule. A small example is in order: =Example 4= rewrite [3] in PERSON : person (single, 0) . rewrites: 4 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second) result Person: person (married, s(0)) Here we tell the Maude system to rewrite our input term according to the rewrite theory, and we tell it to stop after 3 rewrite steps (remember that rewrite rules do not have to be terminating or confluent so an upper bound is not a bad idea), we just want see what sort of state we end up in after randomly choosing 3 matching rules. And as you can see the state this person ends up in might look a bit strange. (When you're married at the age of one you kind of stick out a bit in kindergarten I guess). It also says 4 rewrite steps, although we specifically stated an upper limit of 3 rewrite steps, this is because rewrite steps that are the result of applying equations does not count (they do not change the term, at least if the equations are sane). In this example one of the equations of the NAT module has been used to reduce the term 0 + s(0) to s(0), which accounts for the 4'th rewrite step. To make this rewrite theory a bit less morbid, we can alter some of our rewrite rules a bit, and make them conditional rewrite rules, which basically means they have to fulfill some criteria to be applied to the term (other than just matching the left hand side of the rewrite rule). crl [las-vegas] : person (S, N) => person (married, N) if (S =/= married) /\\\\ (S =/= dead) . crl [die] : person (S, N) => person (dead, N) if (S =/= dead) . It seems reasonable that you cannot die once you're dead, and you cannot marry as long as you are married. The leaning toothpicks (/\\\\\\\\) are supposed to resemble a logical AND which means that both criteria have to be fulfilled to be able to apply the rule (apart from term matching). Equations can also be made conditional in a similar manner. =Why rewriting logic?= Maude sets out to solve a different set of problems than ordinary imperative languages like C, Java or Perl. It is a formal reasoning tool, which can help us verify that things are \\"as they should\\", and show us why they are not if this is the case. In other words, Maude lets us define formally what we mean by some concept in a very abstract manner (not concerning ourselves with how the structure is internally represented and so on), but we can describe what is thought to be the equal concerning our theory (equations) and what state changes it can go through (rewrite rules). This is extremely useful to validate security protocols and critical code. The Maude system has proved flaws in cryptography protocols by just specifying what the system can do (in a manner similar to the PERSON rewrite theory), and by looking for unwanted situations (states or terms that should not be possible to reach) the protocol can be shown to contain bugs, not programming bugs but situations happen that are hard to predict just by walking down the \\"happy path\\" as most developers do. We can use Maude's built-in search to look for unwanted states, or it can be used to show that no such states can be reached. A small example from our PERSON module once again. search [1] in PERSON : person (single, 1) =>1 person (married, 2) . No solution. Here the Natural numbers have a more familiar look (the basic Maude modules prelude.maude has been loaded, that can be done with the command \\"in prelude\\", or 1 can be replaced by s(0) and 2 by s(s(0)) if you don't want to load the default Maude-modules), naturally Maude has built-in support for ordinary structures like integers and floats and so on. The natural numbers are still members of the built-in sort Nat. We state that we want to search for a transition using one rewrite rule (=>1), which rewrites the first term into the other. The result of the investigation is not shocking but still, sometimes proving the obvious is all we can do. If we let Maude use more than one step we should see a different result: search [1] in PERSON : person (single, 1) =>+ person (married, 2) . Solution 1 (state 7) states: 8 rewrites: 14 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second) To see what led us in that direction we can use the built in command show path which lets us know what rule applications led us to the resulting term. The token (=>+) means one or more rule application. show path 7 . state 0, Person: person (single, 1) =rl person(S, N) => person(S, N + 1) [label 'birthday .] => state 1, Person: person (single, 2) =crl person(S, N) => person(married, N) if S =/= married = true /\\\\ S =/= dead = true [label las-vegas .] => state 7, Person: person (married, 2) As we can see the rule application \\"birthday\\" followed by \\"las-vegas\\" got us where we wanted. Since all rewrite theories or modules with many possible rule applications will generate a huge tree of possible states to search for with the search command, this approach is not always the solution. We also have the ability to control what rule applications should be attempted at each step using meta-programming, due to the reflective property or rewriting logic.

History  Though it was online as early as December 1997, the site was formally unveiled June 24, 1998, as part of an 18-month agreement between Microsoft, Compaq, and Aerial Images of Raleigh, North Carolina. It was created as a demonstration system to advertise the scalability of Microsoft's Windows NT Server and SQL Server, and used images from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Sovinformsputnik (the Russian Federal Space Agency). TerraServer was the brainchild of the Turing Award-winning researcher on database systems, Jim Gray. Before his death, Gray continued this work, developing Microsoft Virtual Earth and began a similar project that would become the Worldwide Telescope. In January 2000, Microsoft and Aerial Images, now TerraServer.com, Inc., split their operations, creating two parallel TerraServer websites. The dualism caused confusion among web surfers until the Microsoft name change in 2010. TerraServer.com, Inc., which owns the trademark TERRASERVER, filed a lawsuit\\"Microsoft Satellite Map Project Sued Over Name\\". PC World.

A drug tourist may cross a national border to obtain a drug that is not sold in one's home country, or to obtain an illegal drug that is more available in the visited destination. A drug tourist may also cross a sub-national border (from one province/county/state to another) in order to purchase alcohol or tobacco more easily, or at a lower price due to tax laws or other regulations. Empirical studies show that drug tourism is heterogeneous and might involve either the pursuit of mere pleasure and escapism or a quest for profound and meaningful experiences through the consumption of drugs. Drug tourism has many legal implications, and persons engaging in it sometimes risk prosecution for drug smuggling or other drug- related charges in their home jurisdictions or in the jurisdictions they are visiting, especially if they bring their purchases home rather than using them abroad. The act of traveling for the purpose of buying or using drugs is itself a criminal offense in some jurisdictions.  By country/region  = Asia/Middle East = Malana, India is famous for its production of Indian hashish or so called Malana Cream, attracting foreign tourists. Indian pharmacies also sell many generic drugs at prices far lower than in the US. = Africa = In some places of north Morocco like Chaouen Cannabis is planted for Hashish production. There is a big attraction for some European and American consumers because of its low price. https://www.elmundo.es/f5/comparte/2017/12/19/5a367837268e3e28458b4622.html  title=Hashish Christmas: this is the cannabis tourism from Madrid to Rif = Europe = A sign of a cannabis coffee shop in Amsterdam In Europe, the Netherlands, and especially the Dutch capital, Amsterdam, is a popular destination for drug tourists, due to the liberal attitude of the Dutch toward cannabis use and possession. Drug tourism thrives because legislation controlling the sale, possession, and use of drugs varies dramatically from one jurisdiction to another.

Americans between the ages of 18 and 21 may cross the border into Canada or Mexico to purchase alcohol. Conversely, many Canadians travel to the United States to purchase alcohol at lower prices due to high taxes levied on alcohol in Canada. Americans living in dry counties also frequently cross county or state lines to purchase alcohol. Due to the fact that cannabis is now legal in Canada, Americans may cross the border to purchase it legally. Many Americans cross state lines to purchase cigarettes, crossing from a jurisdiction with very high cigarette taxes to a jurisdiction (such as another state or an Indian nation) with lower cigarette taxes. This occurs particularly in the Northeastern United States, where states levy among the highest tobacco taxes in the nation. Canada - As of October 2018, Cannabis consumption and possession in limited amounts is legal in Canada. United States Since the legalization of Cannabis in Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington state and Washington D.C, many drug tourists from states and countries where cannabis is illegal travel to these states to purchase cannabis and cannabis products. Mexico The sale and possession of psilocin and psilocybin are prohibited under the federal health law of 1984. However, this prohibition is mostly unenforced against indigenous users of psilocybin mushrooms. As a result, the towns of Huautla de Jim√©nez and San Jos√© del Pac√≠fico (both in the southern state of Oaxaca) have gained notoriety for their association with magic mushrooms, and constitute a safe haven even for non-indigenous users. = South America = In South America, some tourists are attracted to Amazon basin villages to try a local religious sacrament called ayahuasca, which is a mixture of psychedelic plants that is used in traditional ceremonies. Similarly, tourists in Peru try hallucinogenic cactus called San Pedro which originally has been used by local tribes. Colombia Colombia‚Äôs reputation as the cocaine capital of the world has attracted tourists, to the dismay of locals. In Medell√≠n, a small industry has grown around sites related to Pablo Escobar.

A. is a Swiss manufacturer of motion picture cameras based in Yverdon located in Canton of Vaud. The most notable products of which are in the 16 mm and Super 16 mm formats. Originally Bol, the company was founded by Charles Haccius and Jacques Bogopolsky (a.k.a. Bolsey or Bolsky) in 1925. Bolex is derived from Bogopolsky‚Ä≤s name. In 1923 he presented the Cin√©graphe Bol at the Geneva fair, a reversible apparatus for taking, printing, and projecting pictures on 35-mm. film. He later designed a camera for Alpa of Ballaigues in the late 1930s. Paillard-Bolex cameras were much used by adventurers, artists (new-American cinema groups), as well as nature films, documentaries, and are still favoured by many animators. Over the years, notable Bolex users and owners include:Andy Warhol, Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg, Jonas Mekas, Jean-Luc Godard, Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, James Dean, David Lynch, Marilyn Monroe, Edmund Hillary, and Mahatma Gandhihttps://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/andy-warhol-films-1387729 While some later models are electrically powered, the majority of those manufactured since the 1930s use a spring-wound clockwork power system. The 16 mm spring- wound Bolex is a popular introductory camera in film schools. History = Early history = In 1927, Jacques Bogopolsky imagined a camera for the 16 mm format (Bolex Auto-Cine A,B,C), and created the Bolex society with the help of Charles Haccius, a businessman from Geneva. Charles Haccius invested 250,000 Swiss francs in the company. The society did not produce any cameras. However, the Auto Cin√© A and B were produced by Longines in Saint-Imier and the projector by Stoppani in Bern. As of 1929, the company Longines no longer wished to produce the cameras. Bolex was bought by Paillard & Cie for 350,000 Swiss francs and Jacques Bogopolsky was hired as consulting engineer for five years. Soon Paillard realized that the cameras and projectors were not in fact the exceptional products promised by their partners and after two years Jacque Bogopolsky was no longer welcome in Sainte-Croix. The traditional version of the story tended to present the situation rather simply: Bolex is the name of a brand produced by the Paillard company, a brand represented mainly by a camera that was invented by Jacques Boolsky. In fact, the alleged inventor of the Bolex did not invent anything about the camera, which as early as 1935 would become known under this name. With the patents sold by Boolsky proving unusable and the machines defective, Paillard had to start from scratch to invent a Bolex which had only kept the name of Boolsky's \\"invention\\". The Bolex as we know it is the invention of the engineers at Paillard. In 1932, Marc Renaud, a young engineer, inspired by the products of Paillard and assisted by Professor Julliard, began development of the Paillard H16 camera. In 1935, the H-16 camera was put on the market, the 9.5mm version followed in 1936 and the Double-8mm version in 1938. The H-16 was highly successful. Paillard-Bolex introduced the L-8 for the market of pocket 8mm film cameras. With the postwar boom in home movie making, Paillard-Bolex continued to develop its 8mm and 16mm ranges with the H-16 increasingly adopted by professional film makers. The company also made a successful range of high-end movie projectors for all amateur film making gauges. In 1952, during the golden era of 3D film, Bolex offered the Bolex Stereo: a 3D stereo kit for their H-16 camera and model G projectors. Several technical changes were made to the H cameras in 1954, above all an entirely different claw drive together with a laterally inverted film gate and a 170 degrees opening angle shutter. In 1956, the first H-16 reflex viewfinder model was brought out. In reaction to the upcoming use of heavier varifocal or zoom lenses and the bigger synchronous electric motors attached to the body Paillard gave it a big rectangular base with three tapped bushings replacing the original single-tap ‚Äúbutton‚Äù base in 1963 and soon afterward a protruding 1-to-1 shaft for the ESM motor. A saddle for a 400-ft. film magazine finally allowed the H-16 to be used like professional synch-sound cameras. In 1965, Kodak introduced the Super 8mm format. Paillard Bolex was slow to introduce a Super 8 camera although they quickly modified the 18-5 Auto 8mm projector for Super 8 as the 18-5 L. At about this time (1966) the Bolex 16 Pro Camera was introduced to compete with the Arriflex 16 BL camera, as a technically advanced professional camera more suited for television use than the H-16. Nevertheless, the H-16 Standard camera was made until the last days of 1969. The H-16 and H-8 standard models afford the rackover critical focusing feature that had been first introduced with the Bell & Howell Standard camera in 1912. = Company restructuring = Effective January 1, 1970 Paillard sold the Bolex division to Eumig of Vienna. In 1971, Eumig rationalised the Super 8 range and Super 8 equipment production in Switzerland was discontinued. The Bolex product brand was retained while being manufactured in Eumig or Chinon factories. The H-16 cameras were still made in Switzerland. = Recent development = In 1981, Eumig went into liquidation and Bolex was bought by Ren√© Ueter who set up Bolex International in 1982. Bolex International no longer serially manufactures its cameras, but does repair 16mm and Super 16 cameras for customers on special order.  Motto and slogan  Perfection through Precision. Since 1814, Bolex has lived by this proud slogan. \\"Bolex cameras, projectors, and accessories are all proud products of the same superlative Swiss precision craftsmanship.\\"http://www.bolexcollector.com/ephemera/ads50_bro011.html \\"Around the world, Bolex has earned an unequalled reputation as the maker of professional-quality equipment for the amateur movie-maker.\\"  Legacy  A Bolex H16 REX-5 spring-wound clockwork 16 mm camera Many notorious directors began their careers shooting on Paillard-Bolex Cameras, including David Lynch, Jonas Mekas, Peter Jackson,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVePr_gzUYw Terry Gilliam, Will Vinton, Maya Deren, and Spike Lee.

A 400-ft magazine (on the Rex 5 ‚Äì or converted Rex 3 or 4) can be attached to the top of the camera. From the beginning, it offered automatic film threading, a clutch for disengaging the drive spring in order to crank the film by hand forward and backwards unlimited, and a cut-off turret disc that is not wider than the camera body in center position. Stepless speed control was available between 8 and 64 frames per second. Early cameras have a 190 degrees opening angle shutter. A few years after their introduction the H cameras could be equipped with an accurate single-frame counter. That accessory was incorporated into all H camera models since 1946. As with a still reflex camera, the Bolex RX has a viewfinder, which allows the filmmaker to view what he or she is filming. This specific viewfinder is made up of a double prism that deflects 20 percent of the light going through the lens into the viewfinder. The Paillard-Bolex H-16 usually has a turret for three C-mount lenses. Often, the camera was provided with a 16mm Switar or Yvar, a 25mm Switar or Yvar and the third lens was often a 75mm Yvar or 50mm Switar. Only lenses with the designation \\"RX\\" in 50 mm or less can be used on the RX models. RX corrected lenses were also manufactured by Schneider, Berthiot, Ang√©nieux, and Rodenstock. The single lens port H-16 was made in conjunction with the first underwater housing. A second, later marine housing was made for the electric drive models. Some people had their H-16 camera converted to Super 16. This format is highly suited to telecine conversion, as Super 16 is close to the 16:9 electronic image format. Some conversions were more successful than others. Bolex (latterly) did offer a factory Super 16mm camera. This has the appropriate markings in the viewfinder and the film gate is machined and polished to professional standards. Bolex did have a foray into purely professional cameras with the Bolex Pro 16. Again, they decided against a registration pin for mechanical simplicity, to keep the camera as quiet as possible for sync-sound filming. This camera was only offered with 400 ft magazine capacity.

Documentaries  There are two documentaries about the history of the Bolex camera. Beyond The Bolex, a biographical film about Bolex founder Jacques Bogopolsky (later anglicized to Bolsey), is directed by his great-grand daughter Alyssa Bolsey, and features an in-depth look at the original notes, schematics, prototypes of Bolex A and B cameras A second product that is currently in production, is being undertaken by Swiss director Alexandre Favre. Bolex was used exclusively to film Teeny Little Super Guy for Sesame Street in 1982.  Digital Bolex D16  In 2012, Cinemeridian, Inc. licensed the named Bolex from Bolex International to create a digital Super 16mm cinema camera called the Digital Bolex D16. Digital Bolex announced their collaboration with Bolex via the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform on March 12, 2012 at the SXSW Film Festival where they had a trade show booth.

Before the arrival of PƒÅkehƒÅ (Europeans) in New Zealand, MƒÅori society was based largely around tribal units, and chiefs (') provided political leadership. With the British settlers of the 19th century came a new British- style government. From the outset, MƒÅori sought representation within this government, seeing it as a vital way to promote their people's rights and improve living standards. Modern MƒÅori politics can be seen as a subset of New Zealand politics in general, but has a number of distinguishing features, including advocacy for indigenous rights and MƒÅori sovereignty. Many MƒÅori politicians are members of major, historically European-dominated political parties, but several MƒÅori parties have been formed. Pre-colonial MƒÅori governance Before the arrival of PƒÅkehƒÅ (European settlers) in New Zealand, MƒÅori society was based largely around communal units. A common misconception is that pre-colonial MƒÅori governance was structured into the \\"rigid and static structural models\\" (p. 19)Ballara, A. (1998). Iwi: The dynamics of MƒÅori tribal organisation from c.1769 to c.1945. Wellington, New Zealand: Victoria University Press. proposed by early ethnologists, such as Elsdon Best (1934): Twentieth century research \\"modified this model of tribal organisation, emphasising the role of the hap≈´ ... as the largest effective corporate group which defended a territory or worked together in peaceful enterprises\\" (p. 19). Therefore, it is now understood that hap≈´ were responsible for administering resources, land, and important community buildings, and were also responsible for warfare (particularly maintaining the waka). The iwi typically functioned more as a federation than as an administrative structure. Political leadership or governance in MƒÅori society has traditionally come from two different groups of people ‚Äì the Ariki and the Rangatira. The Ariki are \\"persons of the highest rank and seniority\\" (p. 58). Ariki did not operate in simple hierarchical orgranisations; despite what later \\"government officers were inclined to believe\\", Ariki have never been \\"the apex of a structured hierarchy of institutionalised tribal authority\\" (p. 264). Many positions overlap with Ariki holding multiple roles, including \\"head of an iwi, the rangatira of a hapu and the kaumatua of a whanau\\" (p. 197).Mead, S. M. (1997). Landmarks, bridges and visions: Essays. Wellington, New Zealand: Victoria University Press. The Rangatira are the hereditary MƒÅori leaders of hap≈´, often described by Europeans as chieftains. They are typified by their \\"humility, leadership, diplomacy, generosity, integrity and honesty\\" (p. 4).Hook, G. R. (2008). Cultural relativism and academic freedom within the universities of New Zealand. MAI Review, 1. Retrieved from Entry of MƒÅori to colonial politics MƒÅori wood carving, ceremonial war canoe, Waitangi The Treaty of Waitangi, signed between various MƒÅori iwi and the British Crown, had the practical effect of transferring sovereignty to the United Kingdom. It is debated as to whether this was the intent of the MƒÅori, and whether this was what the treaty actually said. MƒÅori were granted all the rights of British subjects. As settlement increased, the colonists became increasingly vocal in their call for self-government. Eventually, in 1852, the British government passed the New Zealand Constitution Act, establishing an elected New Zealand Parliament. Responsible government, where this Parliament had the authority to appoint Cabinet, was achieved a few years later. At first, MƒÅori had little interest in the new Parliament, seeing it as a PƒÅkehƒÅ institution with no real relevance to them. Later, however, there was an increasing desire by MƒÅori to participate in Parliament ‚Äì the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s, coupled with ongoing land seizures, convinced many MƒÅori that the \\"settler Parliament\\" now had a major impact on them, and that their voices needed to be heard in it. In theory, there was never any law barring MƒÅori from election to Parliament, nor barring them from voting. In practice, however, other laws made it virtually impossible. The major stumbling block was the property qualification, which required voters to own a certain amount of land. While MƒÅori owned a large portion of New Zealand, most of this was held in common, not under individual title. As such, few individual MƒÅori met the property requirement personally ‚Äì even if they were part-owners of vast amounts of land, they did not have any land which they owned exclusively, and so did not qualify to vote. In 1867, however, Parliament passed the Maori Representation Act, which created four special electorates for MƒÅori. These seats did not have a property qualification. The creation of the seats was controversial, being opposed by those PƒÅkehƒÅ who saw MƒÅori as uncivilised. It was also opposed by a small group which felt that by creating separate MƒÅori electorates, MƒÅori would be sidelined, as PƒÅkehƒÅ politicians would not have to consult MƒÅori opinion as they would if MƒÅori voted in general electorates. There was also debate about the number of seats ‚Äì if MƒÅori had been given a number of seats equivalent to their population, they would have had around fifteen seats, not four. One of the more radical MPs in Parliament, James FitzGerald, actually called for MƒÅori to be given a third of the seats in Parliament, but this was widely seen as excessive. In the end, the seats were approved based mainly on a desire to improve relations with MƒÅori and reduce military conflict. The first MƒÅori MPs took their seats in 1868. It was intended that these seats would eventually be abolished as MƒÅori abandoned traditional land ownership traditions. In the end, however, the seats were retained, and still exist today. There have, over the years, been a number of attempts to abolish them, with a number of different reasons being given ‚Äì some said that reserving seats was unfair, while others said that keeping MƒÅori electorates separate meant that MƒÅori were marginalised and ignored by mainstream politicians. Many MƒÅori politicians defended the electorates, saying that they were necessary to ensure MƒÅori representation in Parliament. Other MƒÅori leaders, however, said that the seats were not required ‚Äì there have been MƒÅori politicians who have gained election in non-MƒÅori seats. MƒÅori in mainstream parties Maui Pomare, a member of the conservative Reform Party ƒÄpirana Ngata, perhaps the most prominent MƒÅori politician When MƒÅori MPs were first elected to Parliament, there were no formal political parties in New Zealand. After the Liberal Party was founded, however, it gained the support of a number of prominent MƒÅori figures. The most prominent MƒÅori to serve as a Liberal MP was ƒÄpirana Ngata, who rose high within the Liberal Party's hierarchy. Ngata is said by many to be the most prominent MƒÅori MP ever, and he is featured on New Zealand's fifty-dollar bill. The Liberal Party did not have an exclusive control of the MƒÅori electorates, however ‚Äì Maui Pomare, another prominent MƒÅori politician, was a member of the conservative and rural Reform Party, as were Taurekareka Henare and Taite Te Tomo. The Young MƒÅori Party supported political action, but it was not a formal party. In the 1930s, new movements began to arise in MƒÅori politics. In particular, the Ratana church expanded its political participation, standing candidates for Parliament. In the 1935 election, Ratana won two of the four MƒÅori electorates. The Ratana MPs did not remain independent for long, however ‚Äì they quickly merged into the Labour Party, which they saw as best addressing MƒÅori needs. By 1943, the Labour/Ratana alliance had won all four MƒÅori electorates, establishing a pattern of dominance that many people thought was unbreakable. Among the most prominent MƒÅori MPs in the Labour Party were Eruera Tirikatene, who was succeeded by his daughter, Whetu Tirikatene- Sullivan ‚Äì both represented Southern Maori in Parliament for several decades. James Carroll, member of the Liberal Party Despite Labour's dominance of the MƒÅori vote, the National Party, Labour's main opponent, occasionally elected MƒÅori MPs in general electorates. Ben Couch (Wairarapa) and Rex Austin (Awarua), were elected in 1975, the second and third MƒÅori elected to a general seat (after Sir James Carroll in 1893). Winston Peters, elected to Tauranga in 1984 (he had previously stood for Northern Maori) is half MƒÅori. In the 1996 election, a major shift in MƒÅori politics occurred when Labour lost all the MƒÅori seats (of which there were now five) to the New Zealand First party. New Zealand First, while not a MƒÅori party, has a strong MƒÅori wing, and its leader, Winston Peters (originally of the National Party), is half MƒÅori. New Zealand First's clean sweep of the MƒÅori seats surprised many observers, who had believed that Labour's grip was too strong to be broken. In the 1999 election, Labour won all the MƒÅori electorates back again, but the traditional MƒÅori allegiance to Labour has been re-evaluated ‚Äì Labour cannot, most observers say, simply take MƒÅori support for granted. Since the advent of the MMP electoral system, MƒÅori representation in Parliament has increased ‚Äì MƒÅori are able to be elected as list MPs, bypassing the problem of securing an electorate. This has been particularly noticeable in parties which have traditionally contained few MƒÅori ‚Äì MPs such as Georgina te Heuheu in the National Party and Donna Awatere Huata in the ACT party are not likely to have entered Parliament without MMP, given the difficulty that their parties would face contesting the MƒÅori electorates. At present, there are twenty nine MƒÅori MPs in Parliament, with Labour taking all six MƒÅori electorate seats after the 2017 election, which also saw the loss of all MƒÅori Party seats. MƒÅori make up around 24% of Parliament, with 8 Maori MPs in the National Party, 13 in the Labour Party (including the MƒÅori electorate seats), 6 in New Zealand First, 1 in the Green Party, and 1 in Act. The introduction of MMP brought further calls for the abolition of the MƒÅori electorates, which many deemed unnecessary in the new system. Despite the existence of the special electorates, MƒÅori voter turnout has been consistently less than that of non- MƒÅori. MƒÅori parties Throughout the history of MƒÅori participation in mainstream parties, there have been those who argue that MƒÅori cannot truly be represented unless they have a separate group. In recent years, with the resurgence of MƒÅori culture, these calls have increased. In 1979, a Labour MP, Matiu Rata, quit the party to form his own group, saying that MƒÅori could not succeed if they were simply a component of a larger group. Later, Tuariki Delamere would say much the same thing, claiming that \\"you cannot be accountable to MƒÅori if your first allegiance is to a political vehicle that is owned and controlled by PƒÅkehƒÅ.\\" Tariana Turia broke from the Labour Party to co-found the new MƒÅori Party, which won four of the seven MƒÅori seats in the 2005 election which were held by the Labour party, and a fifth MƒÅori seat in the 2008 election. The MƒÅori Party entered a confidence and supply agreement with the Fifth National Government in 2008 and two of its MPs became Ministers outside Cabinet in that Government. This government was dissolved after the 2017 Election, in which the MƒÅori Party lost all their seats in parliament and all MƒÅori Electorate seats were captured by the mainstream Labour Party. Below are some of the parties which have been based around MƒÅori voters, or which are sometimes seen as such. =Mana Motuhake= Mana Motuhake, roughly translated as \\"self-government\\", was founded in 1979 as an independent MƒÅori party by Labour MP Matiu Rata. Rata resigned from Parliament to contest a by-election under Mana Motuhake's banner, but was not re-elected. The party tried for some time to win the MƒÅori seats, but was never elected to Parliament. In 1991, Mana Motuhake joined the Alliance, a broad left-wing coalition. Under the Alliance, several Mana Motuhake members, including Sandra Lee-Vercoe and Willie Jackson, were elected to Parliament. When the Alliance split, Mana Motuhake remained with the hardline faction, which failed to retain any seats in Parliament. Mana Motuhake has since left the Alliance. =Mana MƒÅori Movement= The Mana MƒÅori Movement was founded by Eva Rickard, a former candidate of Mana Motuhake. Rickard objected to the decision by Mana Motuhake to join the Alliance, believing that a completely independent MƒÅori party was required. Mana MƒÅori contested the MƒÅori seats, but never won a place in Parliament. In the most recent election, it worked in coalition with Te Tawharau and Piri Wiri Tua. =Mana Wahine= Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata, founded by former Alliance (Mana Motuhake) MP Alamein Kopu, stated its goal as promoting and protecting the interests of MƒÅori women. Many of its opponents, however, claimed that the party was born out of Kopu's \\"opportunism\\", and denied that it had any real ideological commitment. Kopu was not re-elected. =Mauri Pacific= Mauri Pacific, founded by five former New Zealand First MPs, denied that it was a MƒÅori party, saying instead that it was merely \\"multiculturalist\\". It did, however, have policies that were strongly favourable towards MƒÅori, and three of its five MPs (including its leader) were of MƒÅori descent. This contributed to a widespread perception of it as a MƒÅori party. The similarity of \\"Mauri\\" and \\"MƒÅori\\" likely strengthened this view, although the words are unrelated. None of the party's MPs were re- elected, and it has since dissolved. =Te Tawharau= Te Tawharau is a small MƒÅori party which briefly held a seat in Parliament when Tuariki Delamere, a former New Zealand First MP, joined it. Delamere believed that an independent MƒÅori voice was essential, saying that New Zealand First had tried and failed to balance MƒÅori interests with other concerns. Delamere was not re-elected. =Piri Wiri Tua= The Piri Wiri Tua Movement is a small party based around the teachings of the Ratana church. =MƒÅori Party= The MƒÅori Party is a MƒÅori political organisation. It was founded by Tariana Turia, a Labour MP who quit her party over the foreshore and seabed controversy, which Turia claims is seeing MƒÅori deprived of their rights. She shared the party leadership with Pita Sharples, a MƒÅori academic. The MƒÅori Party hoped to win all seven MƒÅori seats in the next election, in 2005, although eventually won only four. Polls leading up to the election widely expected this ‚Äì particularly for Labour MPs Nanaia Mahuta and Parekura Horomia to hold their seats. The party gained another seat in the 2008 election, although their share of the party vote remained low, with many MƒÅori voters splitting their vote between a MƒÅori Party MP and the Labour Party. After the 2008 election, the MƒÅori Party agreed to support a minority National government on matters of confidence and supply, gaining ministerial posts for its co-leaders and commitments regarding the MƒÅori seats and the foreshore and seabed legislation.National-Maori Party agreement announced, press release by John Key, 19 November 2008. In 2011, the MƒÅori Party won three out of the seven MƒÅori electorates - both co-leaders winning their electorates (Pita Sharples - TƒÅmaki Makaurau, and Tariana Turia - Te Tai HauƒÅuru) and future MƒÅori Party co-leader, Te Ururoa Flavell, winning the Waiariki electorate. In 2014, the MƒÅori Party won one of seven MƒÅori electorates with Te Ururoa Flavell winning the Waiariki seat again. This enabled Flavell's fellow co-leader Marama Fox to enter Parliament as a List MP due to the MƒÅori Party reaching national vote threshold requirements. The MƒÅori Party was ousted from Parliament in the 2017 General Election, with Tamati Coffey (Labour Party) winning the Waiariki seat with 50.8% of the vote. =Mana Movement = Hone Harawira is a MƒÅori activist and leader of the Mana Movement The Mana Movement is a New Zealand political party led by Hone Harawira which was formed in April 2011 following Hone Harawira's resignation from the MƒÅori Party. Hone Harawira won the by-election in Te Tai Tokerau of 25 June 2011 for the Mana Party, and went on to retain this seat during the 2011 general election. The party lost its one-seat during the 2014 election. The decision to work with the Internet Party is largely blamed for the loss because of the concerns people had with Internet Party's founder, and financier, Kim Dotcom.New Zealand's Ruling National Party Is Re-elected, The New York Times, 20 September 2014  Other sites of MƒÅori political participation  MƒÅori politics extends beyond participation within general elections. This includes government-recognised tribal organisations which have proliferated through the resolution of Treaty of Waitangi breaches and increased enthusiasm by MƒÅori to receive and manage these returned assets. MƒÅori also participate politically within iwi r≈´nanga, which are the governing councils or administrative groups for MƒÅori hap≈´ or iwi. Often, these tribal organisations work directly with local government. For example, the Independent MƒÅori Statutory Board who informs the Auckland City Council, as well as ensuring the Council's compliance with statutory provisions under the Treaty of Waitangi.

It was later reprinted in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fourteenth volume of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in April 1970. The story centres on the character Anodos (\\"pathless\\", or \\"ascent\\" in Greek) and takes its inspiration from German Romanticism, particularly Novalis. The story concerns a young man who is pulled into a dreamlike world and there hunts for his ideal of female beauty, embodied by the \\"Marble Lady\\". Anodos lives through many adventures and temptations while in the other world, until he is finally ready to give up his ideals. The edition published in 1905 was illustrated by Pre-Raphaelite painter Arthur Hughes. C.S. Lewis wrote, concerning his first reading of Phantastes at age sixteen, \\"That night my imagination was, in a certain sense, baptized; the rest of me[,] not unnaturally, took longer. I had not the faintest notion what I had let myself in for by buying Phantastes.\\"Lewis, C.S.. Surprised by Joy. The Inspirational Writings of C.S. Lewis. New York: Inspirational Press, 1994. 100. Plot The tale starts the day after Anodos' twenty-first birthday. He discovers an ancient fairy lady in the desk that he inherited as a birthright from his late father. After the fairy shows him Fairy Land in a vision, Anodos awakes the next day to find that his room is transforming into a forest, which he soon finds to be Fairy Land itself. Anodos then encounters a woman and her daughter in a cottage who warn him about the evil Ash Tree and the Alder Tree. He is told that the spirits of trees can leave their tree-hosts and wander throughout Fairy Land. He then explores the world of the fairies, which live in flowers. He then has a nightmarish encounter with the spirit of the Ash Tree, escapes, and finds rest in the warmth and love of the Beech Tree's spirit. After this, he finds a marble statue by Pygmalion. After he sings to it, the statue flees from him. He pursues the Marble Lady, but finds instead the Maid of the Alder Tree in disguise. The Maid deceives Anodos into letting his guard down so the Ash can attack. He narrowly escapes doom, being saved by the knight Sir Percivale. Anodos then meets a woman and her daughter who believe in fairy tales and the magic of Fairy Land, despite the disbelief of the woman's husband. Anodos also finds his shadow, an evil presence that follows and torments Anodos throughout the rest of the story. Anodos finds a large palace with many rooms, including a bedroom labelled as his own. In the palace library, he reads the story of Cosmo of Prague. Cosmo is a believer in fantasy who sacrifices his life to free the soul of his lover from an enchanted mirror. Anodos spends much time in the palace. He comes upon corridors filled with still statues. Anodos explores the halls and realises that the statues dance in the halls, and return quickly to their pedestals when he enters. He dreams of the marble lady, that she alone has an empty pedestal among the statues. He later finds this pedestal and sings to it. The marble lady materialises on the pedestal, but flees him. Anodos follows, going into a strange subterranean world with gnome-like Kobolds that mock him. Anodos escapes this place and finds himself on the beach of a stormy sea. A boat takes him to an \\"island\\" with a cottage with four doors which is inhabited by an ancient lady. Anodos enters each door in turn, each containing a different world. In the first he becomes a child again, remembering the death of his brother. In the next door he finds the marble lady and Sir Percivale in love. Here Anodos makes a last outburst of his love for the marble lady. The next door recounts the death of a loved one of Anodos, and he finds his family mausoleum. Finally, Anodos travels through the last door (\\"the door of the timeless\\") but is saved by the ancient lady without remembering anything. The ancient lady says that because she saved him, he must leave via an isthmus before the island sinks underwater. Next Anodos finds himself with two brothers who are forging armour and swords in order to fight three marauding giants living in a fortified stronghold. Anodos joins them in their fight, but they are ambushed by the giants unprepared. The brothers die in the fight, but Anodos lives, killing the giants and becoming a hero of the kingdom. He journeys to tell a woman whom one of the brothers loved of the brothers' death, but along the way is captured by a manifestation of his shadow and imprisoned. Anodos escapes by the song of a woman whom he had met before in Fairy Land, and he is not troubled by his shadow again. Anodos again encounters Sir Percivale, becoming his squire. They come upon a cult of worshipers doing an unknown evil to a select few. Anodos decides to try to stop the ritual. He destroys the worshippers' idol, exposing a dark opening out of which a monster rushes to attack him. He kills the monster but is killed in the struggle as well. He floats as a spirit for a time before awakening alive on Earth, retaining the memory of his experiences in Fairy Land. His family informs him that he had only been gone 21 days, despite his seemingly long journey.

It centers on the legend of Saint Patrick defeating the King of the Snakes in Ireland. The novel also centers on the troubled romance between the main character and a local peasant girl. The Snake's Pass was Bram Stoker's second imperial fiction novel, and was first published in the United Kingdom in 1890. The novel is a precursor to Stoker's Dracula but was his only novel written in his native land of Ireland. Publication A year before the release of The Snake's Pass, Stoker published chapter three \\"The Gombeen Man\\" as a short story in The People.  Historical background  On 8 November 1847, Abraham (Bram) Stoker was born in Dublin, Ireland. His father worked as a civil servant and his mother was a charity worker and writer. During Stoker's childhood he spend many days in bed due to different illnesses. While Stoker was bedridden, his mother would tell him horror stories which may have influenced his novels and writings. In 1864 Stoker began school at the Trinity College, Dublin. During his time at the university, he worked part-time as a freelance journalist and drama critic.Bram Stoker-Information, Dr. Elizabeth Miller http://bramstoker.org/info.html A few years later, in 1878, Stoker met Henry Irving and they became friends. Two years later Stoker accepted a job to work as Irving's personal assistant in London. Stoker's first book, The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland, was written in Dublin and published in 1879. His first fictional book, Under the Sunset, was published in 1881. Stoker wrote many other novels and short stories; however, the author is best known for Dracula. Stoker died of exhaustion at the age of 64 after writing a total of eighteen books.Bio-http://www.biography.com/people/bram- stoker-9495731#awesm=~oEjeMfGOdv3HEY thumbnail  Plot summary  The novel's main protagonist, Arthur Severn, is traveling to the country of Clare to visit friends. Arthur has the desire to improve his Irish knowledge, thus he makes a detour to West Ireland. While riding along with the driver, Andy, a severe storm begins and Andy suggests the two men stop traveling for the night and stay in the small town of Carnacliff. Andy takes them to a local bar where a man named Jerry Scanlan tells the legendary story of Shleenanaher. The story begins with Saint Patrick who drove all the snakes out of Ireland, however, The King of Snakes would remain in the lake residing in Shleenanaher, and he would only leave if he did not have his crown, thus he hid his crown in the mountains of the hills. The King then tells Saint Patrick that he will come in another form so that he will be able to watch his crown closely. The impending fog, otherwise known as bog, that occasionally sweeps over the town, is said to be the form the King has decided to come back in to watch his crown. After Jerry finishes his story, an old, drunk man by the name of Mr. Moynahan speaks up about the hidden treasure that is also somewhere in the hills. In his story, Arthur learns that Moynahan's father was present in the altercation of the Frenchmen hiding the treasure. The townspeople in the bar begin to tell Arthur of the evil villain of the town, Black Murdock. They describe him as being helpful when one is in need of money, but will curse them for the rest of their lives if they are not able to pay him back. As the story is coming to a close, Murdock comes into the bar and asks for Phelim Joyce. Murdock announces to the bar that he has decided to keep Joyce's land because Joyce was in repaying money he had loaned Joyce for his son's schooling. Joyce rushes into the bar begging Murdock to let him pay. Joyce tells Murdock he has the money, but was delayed because he fell into a hole on his way to the bar and injured his arm. Murdock refuses and tells Joyce that he will now own his land and Joyce will now own the land Murdock used to own. After Murdock has left, Arthur and the driver Andy take Joyce home. It is very dark when they reach Joyce's house and Arthur can hear the sweet sound of his daughters voice helping out of the carriage. Arthur is never able to see the face that belongs to the sweet voice but Andy tell him her name is Norah. Arthur decides that he would like to stay in the town for a few days and see this shifting bog in the morning. The next morning, the innkeeper asks Arthur if will share a car up to the mountain with another man who is working there. The man turns out to be an old classmate of Arthur's, Dick Sutherland. Arthur, Dick and Andy travel up to the hill to see the beautiful view and the bog. Dick explains that he was hired by Murdock as a scientist and geologist to help Murdock with some investigations on his land. As the novel progresses, Dick, Arthur and Andy advance in their work along the Knocknacar Hills when Arthur comes across what he describes as the most beautiful peasant girl he has ever seen. The two continue to meet in the same spot however Arthur never learns her name. He describes her being \\"a beautiful peasant girl had great gifts-a heart of gold, a sweet, pure nature, and a rare intelligence.\\" One day when Arthur goes to their meeting place, she never shows. Everyday Arthur goes to their meeting spot but does not find his unknown girl. At dinner one evening, Dick tells Arthur of his love for Norah Joyce but fears her father will despise him because he is working on Murdock's land. Arthur also tells Dick of his love for this unknown girl that he has not been able to find. The next day, Andy finds Arthur waiting for his peasant girl and inquiries Arthur's thoughts on what he desires in his future wife. When Arthur begins to describe her, he realizes he is describing his unknown girl. Andy tells Arthur that Norah would be the perfect fit for him but Arthur cannot act upon this because Dick has feelings for her. They later learn she has gone to live in a convent. The next day, Arthur decides to go to Murdock to try and buy his land from him so that he can, in turn, give is to Dick to help him with Norah and Joyce. Murdock agrees but only after he has finished his investigations which he states will take him about a month. Arthur is very excited to tell Dick that he bought Murdock's land but as they are talking, Dick tells Arthur that the bog is becoming more dangerous in Murdock's area because if the bog shifts again there is a deep reservoir right where his house is located. Arthur asks is he has told Murdock about this problem and Dick says yes, last night. Arthur decides to not tell Dick of his purchase. After Arthur has his documents in order to purchase the land, he climbs the hill to see its beauty. He unexpectedly finds his unknown woman. Both are very joyful and relieved to finally see each other again and Arthur finally learns her name: Norah Joyce. He proclaims his love for her and wants her to be his wife but she tells Arthur that she needs time to think. On his way home, Arthur is struck with the thought of his dear friend Dick and he questions if Dick has also made a proposal to her. The next day, Norah tells Arthur that she cannot marry him because she must stay with her father but she does admit to being in love with Arthur. Arthur finally meets with Dick and Dick inquiries him about his unknown love. Arthur admits that it is Norah and Dick is very upset. Dick also questions him about buying Murdock's land because Dick does not have as much money as Arthur, was Arthur trying to place Dick in a false position in Norah's eyes? Arthur explains his plan in buying Murdock's land, he even allows Dick to read the deed from his lawyer and Dick forgives him. Arthur goes to Joyce to ask for his daughters hand in marriage and Joyce tells Arthur that she must have time to think. Joyce tells Arthur that they can be married when the treasure of Knocknacar is found. Arthur believes that Norah is actually the treasure and that her father will never let her go. After Norah speaks to her father alone, Joyce decides to give Norah to Arthur. In the meantime, Dick has discovered that there is iron in the bog and this could be why Murdock wants to know what's in the bog so badly. After Murdock learns of Arthur and Norah's engagement, Murdock asks for Norah's hand and when she refuses Murdock becomes very angry and makes rude comments about the social class difference between Arthur and Norah. There is an altercation and Murdock fires Dick. After Murdock leaves, Arthur and Norah decide that she should have two years of schooling in Paris before they are married. Arthur decides to buy the land from Joyce so that he will own all of Knocknacar and the hillside and cliffs. Joyce agrees and Arthur names Dick the sole protector of the land until he returns from London where he will be setting up Norah's schooling. After Arthur returns to London, he finishes his finances with the buying of the land. When Arthur returns to Ireland, he learns that Murdock has taken in Old Moynahan and has kept him very drunk, trying to learn of the location of the treasure. Moynahan takes Murdock to the spot where the Frenchman was last seen with the gun carriage by his father. They are now on Joyce's land and very close to the bog. Murdock gives Moynahan more whiskey and leads him to walk straight into the bog to his death. Murdock leaves and Dick saves Moynahan without Murdock seeing and goes to get help from Joyce and Norah. Murdock is already at Joyce's house explaining how he is unable to find Moynahan and that he is worried he mistakenly walked into the bog. Murdock leaves and Dick explains what has really happened. The three of them safely bring Moynahan back to Joyce's and help him to bed but when he awakes the next morning he remembers nothing of the night before. Joyce lies to Murdock and tells him they found Moynahan asleep on the hillside. Dick goes back to the place Murdock marked the night before and strategically moves the stones he used to mark the treasure spot a few yards away, closer to the bog. Dick then marks the spot with his own marking so Murdock will never know. Dick is very worried that Murdock will try to murder Moynahan again and then come after Norah. In the next couple days leading up to Norah's departure, the rain has become increasingly worse which in turn makes the bog worse. Arthur wakes from a terrible nightmare sense something bad is happening in the storm. Andy takes him and Dick to Knocknacar and they find the bog rising faster and faster. They attempt to warn Murdock but he is not in his home, thus they go to warn Joyce and Norah who are also missing. They learn that Moynahan came to Norah and said there had been an accident and that Joyce was at Murdock's home. Norah assumed it was some type of trap and pries Moynahan for the truth. Moynahan confesses that her father is not at Murdock's, thus Norah decides to go look for her father. Dick and Arthur decide to split up to try to find Joyce and Norah. Arthur searches along the line of the bog while desperately calling out his love's name. As the lightning strikes and lights up the sky, Arthur sees two figures struggling by the edge of the rocks. One figure he discovers is Norah because of her red petticoat. As he gets closer he sees Murdock is holding Norah and strikes her runs off. Norah is unconscious as Murdock flees to his house. As Arthur attends to Norah, he feels the ground begin to quiver and give way as his feet begin to sink and he realizes the bog is shifting and has him in its clutches. Norah awakens and tries to help Arthur by throwing her coat to him and safely pulling him out of the bog, They are joined by Dick and Joyce while they watch Murdock stand atop his home and sink into the bog. The bog then swoops all the rubbish into the nearby sea. Arthur and Norah are reunited with her father and Dick and safely make it back to Joyce's home where they each retell their story of what happened to them during the storm. After they finish breakfast and warm themselves, the four decide to go out to the hill and examine the damage of the storm. They go to the spot where Moynahan's father had last seen the Frenchman and where Dick had made his own marking. Off behind a rock Joyce finds a wooden chest. Because Joyce technically owns the land until the next day, the chest belongs to him. Joyce replies that the money was given to Ireland, thus it should still belong to Ireland. As they continue to walk along, Dick comes across a cavern where he discovers limestone on the rocks. The group takes a lantern into the cave and discovers strange inscriptions on the walls. Norah walks to the back of the cave where she finds The Lost Crown of Gold. Dick exclaims that there is a scientific basis for the legend. Before the stream cut its way through the limestone, and made the cavern, the waters were forced upwards to the lake at the top of the hill and so kept it supplied. The lake then fell away so once the group found the water of the lake they found the crown. The novel then begins the two years when Norah has gone to school in Paris. On the land, Dick used the limestone to create possibilities in the way of building waterworks systems and a new house was built. After the two years of Norah's schooling has come to a close, she and Arthur are married and leave for their honeymoon in Italy where there is \\"not a cloud in the sky.\\"  Genre and style  Stoker is best known as using a Gothic style of writing throughout his novels. The Snake's Pass is classified as a romantic thriller in a barren western Ireland setting. Stoker also creates the theme of suspense through his character narrations. Severn draws out his narration of the plot to his advantage to create the suspense. While The Snake's Pass is a fictional book, Stoker uses nonfictional themes and ideas, such as the explanation of the bog, to create a more realistic novel.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/566975/Bram-Stoker  Characters  Arthur Severn: The main protagonist of the novel. Arthur is brought up in a quiet house by a clergyman and his wife in the west of England. Arthur has little companionship because his mother and father were lost at sea in a terrible bog. His very wealthy aunt takes Arthur into custody and reveals to him that his parents left him a great sum of money. Arthur decides to use that money to travel. Arthur's character is very quiet and Stoker describes him as feeling like an outsider even in his own family. Andy: This quirky Irishman is Arthur's driver throughout the novel but soon turns into his witty companion. Andy is seen as the dimwitted, comic relief throughout the novel. His character asks Arthur many questions in the novel that Arthur does not want to answer, for he is afraid of his own answer. Andy is the character that finally helps Arthur meet the love of his life, Norah. Black Murdock: The villain of Carnacliff who will graciously help people when they are in need of money but will hound them for the rest of their life until he has all their money. The people of Carnacliff say that Murdock does not abide by the law either. The Hill has Murdock in its clutches because he is such a greedy man he wants to find the gold of The King of Snakes. Murdock's nickname of the town is the \\"Gombeen man,\\" which can be described as a shady, business man. Richard \\"Dick\\" Sutherland: Dick is hired by Murdock to do scientific work on the hills and research the shifting bog however, he is not allowed to speak of the work he is doing according to his employer. Dick and Arthur went to school together in England. Stoker describes him as a burly man. Phelim Joyce: Joyce owns the other half of the hills that Murdock resides on. Because of an issue with money, Joyce is forced to trade his land with Murdock's so that Murdock can use the new land for research. Joyce has recently lost his wife and his son has moved away to go to school thus he relies now on the help of his daughter, Norah. Norah Joyce: Norah is Joyce's daughter who has come back to help her father on his land. She is described as being slender, with dark skin, hair and eyes. In addition to being the most beautiful girl, she also has a wonderful singing voice. Her voice is the reason Arthur finds her the first day on the hills. Both Dick and Arthur are in love with the peasant girl however Arthur is the character whom she has feelings for.  Themes  =Weather = The novel begins with a dark storm causing the main character to stop his travels. Throughout the novel, impending weather casts a pall over the happiness of the two lovers. In addition, whenever the weather becomes bad, danger is evident through the cloud coverage over the town. Shifting Bog: Throughout the novel, the shifting bog is a prevalent and dangerous theme. The townspeople of Carnaclif describe it as a \\"carpet of death.\\" The bog is known to swallow up anything and anyone in its path. While in the bar, the townspeople tell Arthur about others who have not faired so lucky when the bog has appeared. Many people have gone missing because of it. The reader learns in the beginning of the novel that Arthur's parents have died from a bog while they were out on sea. The bog is also the main reason why Arthur decides to stay in Carnacliff until the next morning, During Dick's investigations of the bog, he learns that it is indeed, very dangerous. Dick continually warns Murdock of the bog however ultimately Murdock does not listen and the bog swallows him and his home. Arthur is almost taken by the bog as well, however, Norah is able to save him. =Social Class = A more subtle theme of The Snake's Pass is the issue of social class. Stoker reveals Arthur to be of a much higher class than the rest of the characters in the novel. Arthur is described as having money bestowed upon him from his parents death. The town of Carnacliff is more on the peasant side, much different than what Arthur is used to in England. When Arthur happens upon Norah on the hills, he describes her as being a plainly dressed peasant girl, but all still very beautiful. When Andy is discussing with Arthur his ideal wife, Arthur describes her as having dark skinned. Andy explains that he is looking for someone that is Black Irish. After Norah and Arthur has expressed their love to each other, she raises the idea that they are not of the same social class and she will be unable to maintain conversation with Arthur's companions once have married. Even the evil Murdock harasses Norah for being a lower social class. They decide it is best for her to attend school in Paris for two years so that she will be well versed in all the best subjects the school has to offer. At the end of the novel, before they are to be married, Norah asks Arthur if he is pleased with what he sees. Dick and Arthur are also of different social classes even though they attended the same school. Dick accuses Arthur of trying to make him out in a false position when buying Murdock's land so that he will seem less compared to Arthur in Joyce and Norah's eyes. =Science = The main theme of the novel centers around the legend of Saint Patrick and the King of Snakes. However, a major issue surrounding the legend is the frightening bog. Dick explains that because the bog is a form of precipitation, there must be a scientific explanation for it. He later discovers that the rain and limestone contribute to the bog. Dick's findings conclude that technology can produce progress. Because Cranacliff is a rural town in Ireland, there scientific research is very minimal. At this time of the century, the Irish could non-longer make a living from the land, thus they were needing to find different sources of income. This time period was known for the engineering industry of the north of Ireland contributing to the economy of the area. In the conclusion of the novel, Stoker touches on the idea that human emotions of love cannot be controlled by science and the characters cannot control the weather with science.  Critical reception  In Nicholas Daly's book Modernism, Romance and the Fin de Si√®cle: Popular Fiction and British Culture he discusses the theme of imperial space for the 19th-century adventure novel. He poses the question of \\"what would happen if the imperial novel characters never left across many miles of space but rather a less exotic space?\\". This can be seen in The Snake's Pass as a more domesticated, colonial setting. Daly believes that the novel fails as a fantasy of imperial control. The author also refers to the production and reception of the theme of romance in Stoker's novel. Because Stoker wrote the novel while he was based in London, the question of spatial metaphor is raised. Daly believes that Stoker \\"fails to capture the nature of the dimensions in which the novel originated and functioned\\".Modernism, Romance and the Fin de Si√®cle: Popular Fiction and British Culture, Nicholas Daly  References  External links * Book synopsis for The Snake's Pass (1890) at Valancourt Books * Bram Stoker Online Full text and PDF versions of \\"The Gombeen man\\" Category:1890 British novels Category:1890 fantasy novels Category:1890 science fiction novels Category:Novels by Bram Stoker Category:Novels set in County Clare Category:Harper & Brothers books Category:Cultural depictions of Saint Patrick ","title":"The Snake's Pass"},{"id":"1251487","text":"Silene chalcedonica (commonly called Lychnis chalcedonica), the Maltese-cross, flower of Bristol, Jerusalem cross, or nonesuch, is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae, native to central and eastern Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and northwestern China. It is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Taxonomy The Maltese-cross was first formally named as Lychnis chalcedonica by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. For purposes of taxonomic stability, the genus name Lychnis was formally rejected in 1994 and the name Silene was conserved. The plant is now known as Silene chalcedonica, a name published by Ernst Hans Ludwig Krause in 1901. The specific epithet chalcedonica refers to the ancient town of Chalcedon in what is now Turkey. Numerous common names are attached to this plant, including: Description It is a perennial, herbaceous plant growing tall with unbranched stems. The simple, broadly lanceolate leaves are produced in opposite pairs. Each leaf ranges between long and across. The bright red flowers are produced in clusters of 10-50 together. Each flower in diameter with a deeply five-lobed corolla, each lobe being further split into two smaller lobes. This forms a general shape similar to that of the Maltese cross to which it owes one of its common names. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous seeds. Cultivation and uses In cultivation It is a popular ornamental plant in gardens. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Numerous cultivars have been selected, varying in flower colour from bright red to orange-red, pink or white. It grows best in partial to full sun and in any good well-drained soil, if provided with a constant moisture supply. The flowering period is extended if faded flowers are removed. It is short-lived in poorly drained soil. Double-flowered cultivars are propagated by division. It was voted the county flower of Bristol in 2002, following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife. Its colour is reflected in the livery and crest of the city's university. As an introduced species The species has naturalised in some parts of North America. It can be found along roadsides and other disturbed areas, as well as open woodlands, in the northern United States and Canada. Thomas Jefferson sowed this plant at Monticello in 1807.

He is the first and remains the only, British mountaineer to claim all 14 Himalayan eight-thousanders (mountains above in height), which he did on 30 May 2005. 14 Eight-thousanders =British record= Hinkes is the first British mountaineer to claim to have summited all 14 mountains in the world with elevations greater than 8,000 meters, known as the eight- thousanders, when he summited Kangchenjunga on 30 May 2005, aged 50 years and 34 days.BMC Chief Executive, Dave Turnbull said: \\"Alan's ascent of all 14 of the worlds 8,000 metre peaks is an outstanding achievement and a milestone in British mountaineering history. No other British mountaineer has yet claimed this. It was first achieved by Reinhold Messner in 1986 (all without oxygen), and two decades later, Hinkes was only the 13th person to have claimed the feat, days after U.S. climber Ed Viesturs became the 12th person on 22 May 2005. It is an uncommon feat, as the ratio of deaths to summits on several eight-thousanders is at one-in-five (Annapurna, K2, Nanga Parbat, Kangchenjunga). This should not be interpreted as meaning that a \\"death-rate\\" is circa 20%, as the statistic ignores the number of attempts (and also partial attempts, and/or route stocking activity etc.). However, given that climbing the eight-thousanders requires multiple failed attempts (Hinkes took two attempts on average), and the most failures are usually on the most dangerous mountains, the risk of death in attempting all 14 eight-thousanders is material. Hinkes took 26 attempts to climb the 14 eight-thousanders (not counting his ascent of Shishapangma Central (West) in 1990), giving a first attempt success rate of circa 54%. Hinkes spent 21 years on his \\"Challenge 8000\\", starting with his ascent of Shishapangma in September 1987, and ending with his ascent of Kangchenjunga in May 2005. Hinkes is recorded as summiting Mount Everest on 19 May 1996. =Observations= He regards K2 as the hardest eight-thousander mountain (\\"an easy place to die\\"), which he climbed on his third attempt (he abandoned his first attempt, when closing in on the summit, to rescue a stricken Swedish climber). He ranks Kanchenjunga as the second hardest eight-thousander mountain, which he also climbed on his third attempt. As an eight-thousander climber, Hinkes has encountered death on his own expeditions, and on neighbouring expeditions. Several of his climbing partners subsequently died on mountains. A particular death that Hinkes notes was fellow U.K. climbing partner, Alison Hargreaves, who died on K2 in 1995, weeks after Hinkes had summited K2. Hinkes had to be air rescued from Nanga Parbat in July 1997 when flour from a burnt chapati got up his nose, making him sneeze so violently that he prolapsed a disc. He had to wait 10 days in agony before being rescued and brought to Islamabad for treatment. He has been referred to as the \\"chapati man\\" (even by himself) from this incident. Hinkes has climbed eight-thousanders in many styles: expeditions (Cho Oyu, Manaslu, Nanga Parbat), two-man alpine (Makalu, Dhaulagiri) and alone (Gasherbrum I, Gasherbrum II), and permutations in between. He has climbed new lines (Shishapangma, Kangchenjunga, Annapurna), he has climbed as guide (Broad Peak), as camera man (Everest), and set speed records (Annapurna). He has climbed several on first attempt, others on third (Nanga Parbat) and fourth attempt (Makalu). He has climbed with well-known mountaineers, including several expeditions with Doug Scott and Chris Bonington. He describes himself as risk-averse (\\"I climb to live, not to die\\", \\"The summit is optional, getting down is mandatory\\"), who places value on understanding, and being in the right position, to capitalise on breaks in weather. His later climbs were mostly two-man climbs with experienced sherpas (Pasang Gelu), where Hinkes could stay in control of events and react quickly. He was not averse to leveraging the resources of bigger expeditions alongside. Unusually for a 20‚Äìyear high-altitude Himalayan eight-thousander, he has never lost any fingers or toes (or \\"other bits\\" as he describes it), to frostbite. Over the years, Hinkes has had public fall-outs with other chasers of the 14 eight- thousanders. Australian climber Andrew Lock (who completed all 14 in 2009), was critical of Hinkes on their successful 1998 ascent of Nanga Parbat.Lock doesn‚Äôt have much to say about Hinkes now, other than to say the Briton‚Äôs claim to have climbed the full complement of 8000ers has been widely disputed. Spanish climber I√±aki Ochoa de Olza, (who died on Annapurna of pulmonary edema, after completing 12 eight thousanders without oxygen), alleges that Hinkes had left him to bleed to death in order to summit K2, which Hinkes countered was factually untrueHinkes revealed that the Spaniard was not \\"bleeding to death\\", but had a broken arm, had a team around him, and that the incident happened much lower at 21,000 ft, and that Hinkes was acclimatising and not summiting. (Hinkes abandoned his first K2 climb, despite nearing the summit, to successfully rescue a stricken Swedish climber). Cho Oyu dispute Cho Oyu: Showing the route from camp III at 7,500m, which crosses the \\"yellow bands\\", to get to the final flat summit plateau. Carlos Pauner: The Spanish mountaineer recording his 5th official eight-thousander, on the plateau of Cho Oyu, at the \\"prayer flags\\" with \\"view of everest\\" (the Elizabeth Hawley criteria), but circa 15 mins away from the \\"technical\\" summit. His 30 April 1990 ascent of Cho Oyu, which he completed alone in low visibility, is disputed by some observers. Cho Oyu has a broadly flat summit plateau with no cairn (the traditional prayer flags on Cho Oyu's summit plateau do not mark the \\"technical\\" summit). Many who climb Cho Oyu stop at a set of prayer flags with views of Everest and believe they‚Äôve reached the top, unaware they still have to walk for 15 minutes across the summit plateau until they can see the Gokyo Lakes in Nepal. The summit is a small unmarked \\"hump\\" (or \\"bump\\")Miss Hawley uses the ‚Äúdid you see Everest‚Äù as her standard question, I have mentioned this to her as well. I have summitted Cho Oyu 4 times and will be heading for my fifth this coming season. Each time I have watched the Koreans and Japanese go only to where they can see Everest, not the summit, because they know this is what will be asked. (which many Cho Oyu YouTube summit videos miss). While the height differential of this hump is small, Ralf Dujmovits, 3-time Cho Oyu summiter, notes that for a strong climber to get to the \\"hump\\" area can take another 30 minutes. The source of the dispute was that Himalayan chronicler Elizabeth Hawley, whose Himalayan Database is used by online databases like AdventureStats, \\"unrecognised\\" his Cho Oyu ascent in Spring 2005 (15 years after summiting). Hawley based her decision on an interview with Hinkes, and on other team members. Hawley agrees Hinkes reached the summit plateau (as does Eberhard Jurgalski's list), but questions how Hinkes could have been on the ‚Äútechnical‚Äù summit for certain, if he could not see it. Elizabeth Hawley: The influential Himalayan chronicler decided, years after Hinkes' climb, not to accept his view; she remains the only publicly verifiable source of dispute on Hinkes' climb. She died in 2018. Hinkes logged the expedition's 30 April 1990 Cho Oyu ascent in the 1991 American Alpine Journal (AAJ), as well as the expedition's ascent of Shishapangma 12 days later on 12 May 1990, but he notes they climbed Shishapangma's central (west) summit (the true summit is circa two hours further on).Cho Oyu and Shisha Pangma Central (West) Summit. Our expedition was composed of leader Beno√Æt Chamoux, Fr√©d√©ric Valet, Yves Detry, Pierre Royer, French, Mauro Rossi, Italian, Josef Rokoncaj, Czechoslovakian and me, British. All seven climbers were together on the summit of Cho Oyu on 30 April and twelve days later, on 12 May, were all on the top of the central (not the highest) summit of Shisha Pangma. [To have reached the main summit via the connecting ridge would have required another two hours. ‚Äî Editor AAJ.] Alan Hinkes, Alpine Climbing Group Hawley's biography notes French expedition leader Beno√Æt Chamoux: unhappy with this, as she did not credit Chamoux with Shishapangma either (Hawley had compelled the famous Himalayan mountaineer Ed Viesturs to re-climb Shishapangma for the same reason, which he did). Hinkes would not climb with Beno√Æt Chamoux, or any of the French team members, again. Josef Rakoncaj: Czech Himalayan mountaineer photographed Hinkes' on the summit plateau of Cho Oyu in 1990 and claims the ascent Hawley does not use the public accounts of the non-French team members. Czech team member Josef Rakoncaj, photographed Hinkes on the summit plateau of Cho Oyu (Hinkes with his usual photo of his daughter held out), and states Hinkes summited in his book \\"Na hrotech zemƒõkoule\\" (co-authored with Milo≈° Jasansk√Ω, 1993). Italian team member Mauro Rossi lists the 1990 ascent of Cho Oyu in his public resume. Climbers with several Cho Oyu ascents, have disputed Hawley's main Cho Oyu summit criteria, \\"Did you see Everest?\\" (which is obviously unhelpful in Hinkes' case given the poor visibility), and the incorrect behaviours it is creating. Hawley's Himalayan Database records 3,681 ascents of Cho Oyu of which 18 are \\"unrecognised\\" since 1960, despite the difficulty of finding Cho Oyu's \\"technical\\" summit, and that older expeditions considered the summit plateau as sufficient. Chamoux's 1990 Cho Oyu expedition comprise seven of these \\"unrecognised\\" ascents (including Alan Hinkes), while a German commercial trekking expedition, led by G√ºnther H√§rter, who summited Cho Oyu just 19 days after Chamoux in 1990 (and also in very low visibility, as recorded by the Germans), comprise another six. The dispute is noted in many Hinkes interviews. He highlights the lack of any evidence, or publicly verifiable sources, for the allegation,‚ÄòIf they can find someone who was actually on the summit waiting for me, and I never turned up, fair enough. If not, what right do they have to say I wasn‚Äôt there? Who even disputed it to begin with? I‚Äôve never heard anyone explicitly come out and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one who doesn‚Äôt believe you.‚Äù and he is supported by the Alpine Journal,Hinkes climbs Kanchenjunga: 1st Briton to climb all 8,000m peaks. As the Alpine Journal was going to print, Alan Hinkes became the first Briton to climb all 14 of the world‚Äôs mountains over 8,000m with his timely ascent of Kanchenjunga on 30 May 2005. Congratulations, Alan and the British Mountaineering Council (BMC). Hinkes says he spent \\"at least an hour and a half\\" criss-crossing the flat summit plateau, alone, until he \\"was sure there was no more uphill\\".When he got there in 1990 the visibility was poor. The European climbers he was with had turned back, but Hinkes deemed conditions ‚Äúnot as bad as I have experienced on many winter hills in the Scottish Highlands‚Äù and pushed on alone. Finding nothing to indicate a summit, Hinkes writes, ‚ÄúI spent at least an hour and a half covering every inch of ground on the summit plateau until, in the end, I was absolutely certain that I could not get any higher. There was no more uphill.‚Äù Hawley's \\"Seasonal Stories\\" suggest an aversion to Hinkes,But on the topic of Alan Hinkes, she became critical. She was convinced he was opportunistic, that he timed his climbs so that other teams on the mountain had already set up the fixed ropes. He would then show up with a Sherpa and off he would go. And Chamoux - she saw him as a tragic figure. and her biography lists Alan Hinkes as a climber: she did not like.But there were others she decidedly did not like, and these she sent Heather to interview. British climber Alan Hinkes was one of them. As Heather explained \\"There is only a certain amount of arrogance any one can tolerate, because she's seen it all. AdventureStats.com record 8,000m ascents not independently verified. Their website (\\"Verifications and Disputes\\") states that unless given written proof otherwise, \\"No proof other than the explorer's word is required\\", implying they give credit to Hawley's unverified allegations. It contrasts, for example, with Hawley, AdventureStats, and Eberhard Jurgalski's, acceptance of Denis Urubko's acclaimed 2009 ascent of Cho Oyu's Southeast face (and his 14th official eight-thousander), who reached the Cho Oyu summit plateau in the dark and in a snowstorm, per his summit photo from his AAJ log. (ascent number 2785 on Hawley's Himalayan Database). The paragraph in Elizabeth Hawley's 2005 Seasonal Stories remains the only publicly verifiable source of the dispute over Hinkes' Cho Oyu ascent. No climbing journal disputes Hinkes' ascent, and some publicly support it. However, Hawley retains a well-earned stature as a Himalayan chronicler, and her Himalayan Database is the source for most online Himalayan ascent databases (e.g. AdventureStats). Hawley passed away in 2018. Personal In January 2006, after Kangchenjunga, Hinkes was awarded an OBE in the 2006 New Year Honours List for his achievements in mountaineering. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the University of Sunderland in 1999, and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of York in 2007. He was awarded Yorkshire Man of the Year in 2005, and was made an honorary citizen of his hometown Northallerton in the same year. Hinkes is an avid photographer and released a photographic essay book in October 2013 called 8000 Metres Climbing the World's Highest Mountains. He is the subject of an October 2017 documentary by filmmaker, Terry Abraham, Alan Hinkes: The First Briton To Climb The World's Highest Mountains. Hinkes has frequently appeared on British television over the years, particularly regarding Himalayan events/stories, including BBC News, Sky News, Newsnight etc. Hinkes started life as a geography and PE teacher, which he abandoned to concentrate on climbing. He never married but has a daughter, Fiona, whose picture (with her son, Jay), Hinkes displays in most summit photographs.

Most commonly the change is shown over time, generally at a greatly changed scale (either much faster than real time or much slower). An example would be the animation produced after the 2004 tsunami showing how the waves spread across the Indian Ocean. Animation of the 2004 Indonesian tsunami History The concept of animated maps began in the 1930s, but did not become more developed by cartographers until the 1950s (Slocum et al. 2005). In 1959, Norman Thrower published Animated Cartography, discussing the use of animated maps in adding a new dimension that was difficult to express in static maps: time. These early maps were created by drawing \\"snap-shots\\" of static maps, putting a series of maps together to form a scene and creating animation through photography tricks (Thrower 1959). Such early maps rarely had an associated scale, legends or oriented themselves to lines of longitude or latitude (Campbell and Egbert 1990). With the development of computers in the 1960s and 1970s, animation programs were developed allowing the growth of animation in mapping. Waldo Tobler created one of the first animations, using a 3-D computer generated map to portray population growth over a specified time in Detroit (Tobler 1970). Hal Moellering created another animated map in 1976 representing a spatiotemporal pattern in traffic accidents (Slocum et al. 2005). Further development in animated map was stalled until the 1990s due to a lack of animation in academics, financial restrictions on research, and lack of distribution means (Campbell and Egbert 1990). In the 1990s, however, the invention of faster, more efficient computers, compact discs and the Internet solved such problems. Visual variables With the growth of animated mapping came the development of guidelines for creating animated maps. Visual variables such as spacing, lightness and shape used for static maps apply. However, in 1991, David DiBiase and colleagues developed visual variables unique to animated maps: duration, rate of change and order. Duration is the unit of time a frame or scene is displayed, affecting the smoothness of the animation. The shorter a frame is displayed, the smoother the animation will appear (Slocum et al. 2005). Smoothness of animation is also a function of the rate of change (Slocum et al. 2005). Order refers to the time sequence in which animation is played out, usually presented in chronological sequence (Slocum et al. 2005). Alan MacEachren extended these visual variables in 1995 to include display date (time at which change is initiated), frequency (number of times identifiable forms are displayed) and synchronization (correspondence of 2 or more time series) (Slocum et al. 2005).  Types  Animated maps can emphasize the existence of an occurrence at a location, emphasize an attribute of an occurrence or representing change in the position or attributes of an occurrence (DiBiase 1992). For instance, a flashing symbol may be used to draw the map-reader‚Äôs attention to a particular occurrence at one location or multiple location across the map. Maps on the weather channel use animation to emphasize current and predicted paths of hurricanes. The use of the Internet has allowed animated maps to become interactive. The user can witness representations of changes over time, while manipulating the direction of view, the pace or the parameters of the map displayed (MacEachren 1998). Animation on maps can be mainly divided into two types: temporal or not. =Temporal map animation= Temporal map animation shows the ongoing gradual changes over time. Temporal maps can also be termed as animated timeline maps and can be a useful reference to examine the changes ongoing on each step and analyze the progression occurring gradually as time passes. There are many purposes which temporal animation might serve to depict: displaying and analyzing geographic patterns, meteorological events, climate, natural disasters, and other multivariate data. Importance of legend in temporal maps As in the case of static maps, it would be useful if temporal maps could also be provided with proper legend. Legends for temporal maps should not only tell the time but also let user travel over the time. Various manipulations such as traveling to a certain point in time, selecting focus level etc. should be allowed to enhance user friendliness. Using legend in temporal map will answer important questions related to the entity‚Äôs existence (if?), the entity‚Äôs location (when?), time intervals (how long?), temporal texture (how often), speed at which change takes place (how fast?), and the order of change (what order?) (MacEachren, 1995). Depending upon their construction, animated legends may distract the viewer from the animated map. Care must be taken to integrate the legend in an unobtrusive fashion. =Non- temporal map animation= Non-temporal map animation shows changes against some other variables other than time. The variable might be place, position, generalization level etc. Non ‚Äìtemporal animation also serves when there is a need to show both the data set and the transformation that has been applied on it for its display. Non- temporal animation can be of many types according to the purpose they serve: ; Fly through animation : This type of animation gives the viewer the feeling of flying through the landscape. ; Cartographic zoom animation : This type of animation shows maps at different focus level and viewer can change the scale of the map as desired. ; Classification animation : Different methods of data classification are depicted in this animation. ; Generalization animation : This type of animation uses single classification method with multiple classes of data. Time is an important aspect in both animations. Real time is depicted in temporal animation and presentation time (time to show the animation) is associated with non-temporal animation. = Animated mapping of history = Animation of 'The History of the World:Every Year' by Ollie Bye. Animated mapping has grown to also encompass the construction of animated maps for the purpose of depicting historical events in a cartographic environment. Such animations are constructed within an animation/art program on the creator's computer, then animated to show the land ownership/occupation of specific groups over time. Such is commonly done on the video platform YouTube and has given rise to a subgenre commonly referred to as mapping. See also  (GIS)   Ollie Bye References * Campbell, C.S. and Egbert, E.L. 1990.

Annaba is close to the small Seybouse River, and it is in the Annaba Province. With a population of about 464,740 (2019) and 1,000,000 for the metropole, Annaba is the 3rd largest city in Algeria. It is the leading industrial center in Algeria. Annaba is a coastal city that underwent significant growth during the 20th Century. Annaba has a metropolitan area with a higher population density than the other metropolitan areas of the Algerian coastline, such as Oran and Algiers. Much of eastern and southern Algeria uses the services, equipment, and infrastructure of Annaba. Economically, it is the centre for various economic activities, such as industry, transportation, finance, and tourism. Names Present-day Annaba grew up on the site of Aphrodisium, the seaport of the Roman city . (The modern city has since expanded south over Hippo's ruins as well.) Its former names B√¥ne and Bona derived from \\"Ubbo\\", a local form of the name Hippo. Its informal name \\"Land of the Jujubes\\" (, Balad al- UnnƒÅb) derives from that abundance of that fruit in the region. History Bona, Algeria, 1899 Ancient city of Hippo Regius, today Annaba = Ancient = The area of Annaba has yielded evidence of very early human occupation at Ain el Hanech, near Sa√Øda (circa 200,000 BC), including artifacts that show remarkable toolmaking craftsmanship. According to some sources, prehistoric Algeria was the site of the most advanced development of flake-tool techniques in the Middle Early Stone Age (Middle Paleolithic). The Phoenicians settled in Annaba during the 14th century BC. Hippo Regius was a center of early Western Christianity, and it was the site of many Christian synods, one of which was a key site for the dissemination of the books of the New Testament. Augustine of Hippo was bishop here from 396 AD until his death in 430 AD. The city was destroyed in the 5th century by the Vandals. Vandals ruled the city for roughly a century until 534. Gelimer, the King of the Vandals and Alans from 530 to 534 AD, faced with the starvation of his followers and their children, and realizing he had no chance of regaining his kingdom of North Africa, surrendered to Flavius Belisarius, a general of the Byzantine Empire under Justinian I, at B√¥ne. Byzantines then ruled Hippona (Hippo's renamed name after 395) before the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 699 AD. Later, Abbasids, Aghlabids, and Fatimids ruled Bona before the rise of the Zirids. It was relocated to its present place after flooding and Banu Hilal the ravages that occurred in 1033 during Hammadid rule. It was attacked by a Pisan fleet in 1034 and was conquered by Kingdom of Sicily in 1153. The Almohads took it in 1160. During the 11th century, the Banu Hilal, an Arab tribe living between the Nile and the Red Sea, settled in Tunisia, Tripolitania (western Libya) and Constantinois (eastern Algeria) which was the portion known as Annaba. After the demise of the Almohads, the rule of the Hafsids began in Annaba in 1250. Hafsid rule was interrupted by brief occupations of the Marinids and Castile (in 1360) and ended with that of the Zayyanids. Rule by the Ottoman Empire began in 1533, and that lasted until French occupation in 1832, excepting rule by the Spanish Empire between 1535 and 1540. The Barbary pirates also lived in Annaba from the 16th through 19th centuries. = Modern = During the rule of France (empire and republics), this city was called B√¥ne. It was one of the main French settlements, and it still has a sizeable minority of the \\"Pied- Noir\\". One notable pied-noir from B√¥ne was General Alphonse Juin, a Marshal of France and then the Central European NATO Commander. Construction was undertaken at B√¥ne during 1856‚Äì69 to build an sheltered port to handle the iron ore from the Mokta el Hadid. A short railroad line was built from the iron ore mine at Ain Mokra to the docks of B√¥ne. This railroad was opened in 1864, the first one to be built in Algeria. Full-scale production or iron ore began in 1865. Also in 1865, Emperor Napoleon III visited Algeria, including going to the mine and the city of B√¥ne. In 1865, the mine produced 22,000 tons of iron ore, which increased to 255,000 tons in 1869. The ore was extracted from underground galleries, and then shipped from B√¥ne to the French iron and steel works. Before the mine was opened, B√¥ne had just 10,000 inhabitants. By 1924, there were 41,000 people, and the port was being used to export phosphates, lead ore, and zinc ore, too. During World War II in 1943, B√¥ne (Annaba) was an important goal of the U.S. Army and British Army in Operation Torch, advancing eastward from Morocco, Oran, and Algiers across North Africa. B√¥ne was a crucial highway and sea location for the invasion of Tunisia, and thence the driving of the Axis Powers (Germany and Italy) out of Africa in May 1943. B√¥ne remained in Allied hands until the end of the war in 1945, and then it remained a part of French Algeria until the independence of Algeria in 1962. Demography The city of Annaba had a population of 257,359 in 2008 (General Census of the population and habitat). In 1988, the population of the urban district of Annaba had increased to 359,657 (with El Bouni comprising 111,956 inhabitants). The cities of If El Hadjar, and Sidi Amar are also included. Currently there are approximately 500,000 people in \\"greater Annaba\\".Today annaba has a population of 464.740 and 1.000.000 in greater Annaba. Urban areas The metropolitan area includes the cities of El Bouni, El Hadjar and Sidi Amar, which now form a circle around the city of Annaba. The city has grown dramatically since a major factory was opened at El Hadjar ( to the South) and provides employment for the entire region. The downtown district of Annaba is on the sea-front, and includes the promenade called the Concours de la Revolution ( previously called Le Cours Bertagna) which is a lively area, brimming with arcades and all kinds of covered restaurants, terraced cafes and kiosks. Annaba also has an international airport. Climate Annaba has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K√∂ppen climate classification) with long, hot, dry summers, especially from mid-July to mid-August, and mild, wet winters. Snow is rare but not unknown. Rain is abundant by North African standards and can be torrential. Education One of Annaba's most notable educational institutions is the University of Annaba. As of 2004, there are over 40,000 students enrolled. There is a branch campus of the French international school Lyc√©e international Alexandre-Dumas. Economy Annaba Sheraton Tower. As of 1911, Annaba was producing iron, zinc, cork, livestock, and cereal. The city is an important hub of the world steel industry with the steel complex of El Hadjar, eight kilometres south of the city. It is the largest in Africa. Phosphate and metal industries now include the Seybousa complex and the metallurgical complex of Allelik. The private industrial sector is also very important in Annaba and geared especially to the agri-food, metal processing, wood products and construction. These industrial areas occupy nearly 400 hectares between Bouchet Bridge, Meboudja, Berrahal and Kherraza. Business areas are also to be found in the suburbs of the city, such as Sidi Salem, El Eulma and Wadi El-Aneb. Transportation Annaba was described as the \\"chief seaport of Algeria after Oran and Algiers,\\" by Baedeker's in 1911. Annaba is served by Rabah Bitat Airport, an international airport whose IATA airport code is AAE. Annaba also has rail links to the Algerian cities of Constantine and Algiers, and it is at the end of Algeria's east‚Äìwest highway. It is the second industrial centre in Algeria after the capital Algiers. Tourism Eddoug National Park Annaba is an important centre for tourism, and is one of the major tourist attractions in the western Mediterranean. It is a coastal city with mountains, hills, foothills, and plains surrounding it. Due to this, and aside from maritime and seaside tourism, Annaba has a key potential for mountain tourism. The mountains around Sera√Ødi which rise to 1,080m, make them a major tourist attraction. Other tourist attractions are West Bay, Djenane el Bey (La Grande Plage), Ras el Hamra\\" and \\"Ain Achir\\" beach. Annaba also has various key religious sites, including the Saint Augustin Basilica. Annaba in its early history, was the site of an important and influential Diocese, prior to its destruction by the Vandals, and the era of Islamisation. Annaba is located on the Tunisian border, and is a visa-free area, hence tourists are also able to make side trips to Tunisia and to El Kala National Park. Annaba is also known for its verdant Main Street (more often known as the Concours de la Revolution), which is a bustling promenade also well known for its night-life. The Annaba area is generally reputed for having scenic beaches, hotels and a bustling nightlife. The War Cemetery at B√¥ne lies from Annaba on the road towards Constantine. It is an important memorial to the British Empire's soldiers and airmen who fought in the region during the World War II, with 868 Commonwealth burials there. There are also 14 other graves, mostly of merchant seamen. It was designed by J. Hubert Worthington. After the war, most of the American dead were repatriated for burial in the United States, but this was not traditional in the British Empire.

In zoology, a folivore is a herbivore that specializes in eating leaves. Mature leaves contain a high proportion of hard-to-digest cellulose, less energy than other types of foods, and often toxic compounds.Jones, S., Martin, R., & Pilbeam, D. (1994) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press For this reason, folivorous animals tend to have long digestive tracts and slow metabolisms. Many enlist the help of symbiotic bacteria to release the nutrients in their diet. Additionally, as has been observed in folivorous primates, they exhibit a strong preference for immature leaves, which tend to be easier to masticate, tend to be higher in energy and protein, and lower in fibre and poisons than more mature fibrous leaves.  Evolution  Herbivory has evolved several times among different groups of animals. The first vertebrates were small fish that consumed protists and invertebrates. After these fish, the next group of vertebrates to evolve were piscivores, then insectivores, carnivores and finally herbivores. Since a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials (structural modifications to the teeth, jaws, and digestive tract) and only a small proportion of extant tetrapods are obligate herbivores, it could be that early tetrapods made the transition to fully fledged herbivory by way of omnivory. Folivory and flight A hoatzin It has been observed that folivory is extremely rare among flying vertebrates.Do the Power Requirements of Flapping Flight Constrain Folivory in Flying Animals? R. Dudley, G. J. Vermeij Functional Ecology, Vol. 6, No. 1 (1992), pp. 101-104 Morton (1978) attributed this to the fact that leaves are heavy, slow to digest, and contain little energy relative to other foods. The hoatzin is an example of a flighted, folivorous bird. Some bats are partially folivorous; their method of deriving nourishment from leaves, according to Lowry (1989), is to chew up the leaves, swallowing the sap and spitting out the remainder.Folivory in Bats: An Adaptation Derived from Frugivory by T. H. Kunz and K. A. Ingalls; Functional Ecology, Vol. 8, No. 5 (Oct., 1994), pp. 665-668 Arboreal folivores A brown-throated three-toed sloth Arboreal mammalian folivores, such as sloths, koalas, and some species of monkeys and lemurs, tend to be large and climb cautiously.Cautious climbing and folivory: a model of hominoid differentation E. E. Sarmiento1 in Human Evolution Volume 10, Number 4, August, 1995 Similarities in body shape and head- and tooth-structure between early hominoids and various families of arboreal folivores have been advanced as evidence that early hominoids were also folivorous. Primates Standard ecological theory predicts relatively large group sizes for folivorous primates, as large groups offer better collective defense against predators and they face little competition for food among each other. It has been observed that these animals nevertheless frequently live in small groups. Explanations offered for this apparent paradox include social factors such as increased incidence of infanticide in large groups.Competition and group size in Thomas's langurs (Presbytis thomasi): the folivore paradox revisited R. Steenbeek and Carel P. van Schaik: Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology Volume 49, Numbers 2-3 / January, 2001; Print ; Online A howler monkey Folivorous primates are relatively rare in the New World, the primary exception being howler monkeys. One explanation that has been offered is that fruiting and leafing occur simultaneously among New World plants. However a 2001 study found no evidence for simultaneous fruiting and leafing at most sites, apparently disproving this hypothesis.

It was the first prime-time spin- off from a daytime soap (As the World Turns, the number one daytime soap opera at the time). Created by Irna Phillips and William J. Bell, it premiered on May 5, 1965 and aired Wednesdays and Fridays over the summer; the multiple- episode-per-week format was inspired by ABC's hit show Peyton Place. The final episode aired on September 10 of the same year. Our Private World starred Eileen Fulton as Lisa Miller Hughes, the same heroine she had played on As the World Turns, as well as Nicolas Coster. A total of 38 half-hour episodes were produced. Also in the cast were film star Geraldine Fitzgerald and stage actress Julienne Marie. The storyline started on As the World Turns, with Lisa boarding a train to Chicago and the announcer (Dan McCullough) encouraging the audience to watch the spin-off. Upon arriving, Lisa took a job in the admitting room of the local hospital and met her wealthy future husband John Eldredge (Coster, who decades later would also play Lisa's seventh husband, Eduardo Grimaldi). A few months after the demise of the series, Fulton returned to As the World Turns. Nearly three decades later, As the World Turns writers resurrected remnants of Lisa's Our Private World storyline, when a previously-unmentioned son whom Lisa had while in Chicago (presumably during the period between the end of Our Private World and Fulton's return to As the World Turns in early 1966) resurfaced and made contact with her. From May 1965 until September 1965, the series was aired on CBS on Wednesdays at 9:30pm. It also aired on Fridays at 9:00pm.

Strom is probably best known for his more mainstream collaborations with other artists, as his solo work is fairly experimental. Notable collaborations and remixes have been done for and with Nastassja Kinski, Julee Cruise, Chuck D (of Public Enemy), and others.

Youth Brown is an alumnus of Jesuit High School in Portland Oregon where he played soccer under the guidance of Dave Nicholas, varsity coach for the Crusaders. Brown played college soccer at the University of Portland from 1995 to 1998, scoring a total of 33 goals in his four years there, and being awarded for the MAC Award as a senior.Portland Pilots Career History Professional On February 2, 1999, Brown was selected fifth overall in the 1999 MLS College Draft by the Kansas City Wizards. He immediately earned a spot in the Wizards rotation as a rookie, playing in 28 games and starting 19, while scoring four goals and making three assists. He saw reduced playing time in 2000 after the Wizards' acquisition of Miklos Molnar, appearing in 22 games but only registering one assist; he did, however, make four appearances, two of them starts, assisting Kansas City in winning their first MLS Cup. Brown regained his starting spot in 2001, and would fluctuate between being a starter and a valuable substitute for Kansas City for the next three years. However, during the 2003 season, the Wizards traded Brown along with Dar√≠o Fabbro to the New England Revolution in exchange for Wolde Harris and Jorge Vazquez.Revolution Acquire Chris Brown and Dario Fabbro in Trade With Kansas City In his first start there, Brown's explosive scoring yielded him a hat- trick. However, he was traded again during the 2003 off-season to the San Jose Earthquakes the then reigning MLS champions, making it difficult for Brown to displace veteran team members and capture a starting position.Revolution Trades Chris Brown to San Jose In San Jose, he finished the season with two goals and one assist in eleven appearances. When the MLS announced two expansion teams, Brown was recruited by John Ellinger inaugural coach of Real Salt Lake to come and play for him there where he has remained a versatile and consistent starter. He was waived at the end of 2007 and signed for USL-1 side Portland Timbers in January, 2008. In January 2009, Brown announced his retirement from playing professional soccer.OregonLive.

The chain is mostly known for its \\"Butterburgers\\" and frozen custard, but also offers cheese curds, chicken, fish, and salads. Culver's opened its first restaurant in 1984 in Sauk City, Wisconsin, and is currently headquartered in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. , the chain had 771 restaurants in 25 states, mostly in the Midwest, with an additional 26 under construction. History Sauk City restaurateurs and spouses George and Ruth Culver started their fast food careers as the owners of an A&W; on Phillips Boulevard (U.S. Highway 12) in 1961. In 1968, they purchased a resort-styled restaurant at Devil's Lake called The Farm Kitchen. Their son, Craig Culver, worked for a local McDonald's right out of college in 1973. After selling their restaurants and quitting their jobs, George, Ruth, Craig and his wife Lea opened the first Culver's Frozen Custard and ButterBurgers on July 18, 1984. Craig led the company from its inception until 2015.Rick Romell. \\"Craig Culver to retire as CEO of restaurant chain\\". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, February 10, 2015. In October 2017, Culver's corporation sold a minority share to Roark Capital Group, a private equity firm based in Atlanta. The Culver family retains majority ownership.Judy Newman. \\"Atlanta investment firm scoops up Culver's stock\\". Wisconsin State Journal, October 14, 2017.Melanie Lawder. \\"Family-owned Culver's sells minority stake to Atlanta private equity firm\\". Milwaukee Business Journal, October 16, 2017. =Wisconsin= A Culver's counter in Milwaukee In 1988, the Culver family were approached about franchising a restaurant in nearby Richland Center. The family agreed, granting the franchisee a loose licensing agreement, charging no fees or royalties. Because the franchisee had invested very little of his own money, it was a simple matter for him to walk away a year later when he decided he no longer wanted to be in the restaurant business. As a result of this experience, the Culver family established a set of standard franchising procedures that form the basis for those currently used by Culver Franchising System, Inc. Three years later, they tried again in Baraboo and business quickly doubled. Soon after, the increased recognition that the second store earned this small-town chain prompted expansion into the Middleton, Madison and Milwaukee areas. =Midwest= Culver's in Baraboo, Wisconsin In 1993, Culver's was still a small, local chain, with only 14 restaurants across southern Wisconsin. Culver's first restaurants outside Wisconsin opened in Buffalo, Minnesota, in September 1995, Roscoe, Illinois, in December 1995, and Dubuque, Iowa, in November 1997. In February 1998, the company opened the first Culver's outside the Midwest in Texas. =Beyond the Midwest= Number of Culver's per state, as of December 2019 A Culver's in Cedar City, Utah The current franchising strategy is one of contiguous expansion at a pace of about 40 new stores per year. The chain expanded into Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 2005, followed by an opening in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in July 2006. Culver's shifted its attention to developing markets beyond the Midwest. The Metro-98 prototype, developed in 2006 and first constructed in Fort Dodge, Iowa, was much more compact than the traditional 120-seater commonly built through much of Culver's expansion. While the Metro-98 has less seating to offer guests, it also reduced the amount of land needed for construction by around 20%. In 2008, Culver's expanded to the Phoenix metropolitan area. As of July 2017, Arizona had 26 locations. A location set to open in Bullhead City may signal a future expansion into Las Vegas. At the end of 2011, 445 Culver's restaurants were open in 19 states. Culver's also opened in South Carolina in 2012; Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee in 2014; and North Carolina in 2015. On June 28, 2018, Culver's had announced that a location will be opening up in Alabama. In 2011, Culver's expanded into Utah, when Kristin and Tom Davis of Wisconsin relocated to Utah and opened a 100-seat Culver's franchise in Midvale. The couple signed a development agreement for four locations in the southern half of Salt Lake County. =Venture into casual dining= Culver's Blue Spoon Cafe opened its first store in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, in 2000 as a soup-sandwich-salad restaurant as Blue Spoon Creamery Cafe. The name Blue Spoon comes from the color of the spoons used at the Culver's fast food restaurants. A second store in Middleton, Wisconsin, was open for two years but closed in August 2010. The Prairie du Sac location closed in May 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic. In 2013, according to a survey by Franchise Business Review, \\"Culver Franchising System was rated No. 1 in franchisee satisfaction among restaurant franchises.\\" Sponsorships Culver's sponsors sports teams including the St. Cloud Rox, Wisconsin Badgers, Milwaukee Admirals, Iowa Hawkeyes, Minnesota Wild, Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings, and Chicago Cubs. Culver's also sponsors the WIAC baseball championship. Official mascot The official Culver's mascot is an anthropomorphic custard cone named Scoopie, who is featured in various advertisements, community events, and fundraisers. Along the way, 3 new characters were added, being Fudge the dog, Curdis the Curd, and Goldie the Curd.

The name club is a contraction of \\"closed and unbounded\\".  Formal definition  Formally, if \\\\kappa is a limit ordinal, then a set C\\\\subseteq\\\\kappa is closed in \\\\kappa if and only if for every \\\\alpha<\\\\kappa, if \\\\sup(C\\\\cap \\\\alpha)=\\\\alpha e0, then \\\\alpha\\\\in C. Thus, if the limit of some sequence from C is less than \\\\kappa, then the limit is also in C. If \\\\kappa is a limit ordinal and C\\\\subseteq\\\\kappa then C is unbounded in \\\\kappa if for any \\\\alpha<\\\\kappa, there is some \\\\beta\\\\in C such that \\\\alpha<\\\\beta. If a set is both closed and unbounded, then it is a club set. Closed proper classes are also of interest (every proper class of ordinals is unbounded in the class of all ordinals). For example, the set of all countable limit ordinals is a club set with respect to the first uncountable ordinal; but it is not a club set with respect to any higher limit ordinal, since it is neither closed nor unbounded. The set of all limit ordinals \\\\alpha<\\\\kappa is closed unbounded in \\\\kappa . In fact a club set is nothing else but the range of a normal function (i.e. increasing and continuous). More generally, if X is a nonempty set and \\\\lambda is a cardinal, then C\\\\subseteq[X]^\\\\lambda is club if every union of a subset of C is in C and every subset of X of cardinality less than \\\\lambda is contained in some element of C (see stationary set).  The closed unbounded filter  Let \\\\kappa \\\\, be a limit ordinal of uncountable cofinality \\\\lambda \\\\,. For some \\\\alpha < \\\\lambda \\\\,, let \\\\langle C_\\\\xi : \\\\xi < \\\\alpha\\\\rangle \\\\, be a sequence of closed unbounded subsets of \\\\kappa \\\\,. Then \\\\bigcap_{\\\\xi < \\\\alpha} C_\\\\xi \\\\, is also closed unbounded. To see this, one can note that an intersection of closed sets is always closed, so we just need to show that this intersection is unbounded. So fix any \\\\beta_0 < \\\\kappa \\\\,, and for each n<œâ choose from each C_\\\\xi \\\\, an element \\\\beta_{n+1}^\\\\xi > \\\\beta_{n} \\\\,, which is possible because each is unbounded. Since this is a collection of fewer than \\\\lambda \\\\, ordinals, all less than \\\\kappa \\\\,, their least upper bound must also be less than \\\\kappa \\\\,, so we can call it \\\\beta_{n+1} \\\\,. This process generates a countable sequence \\\\beta_0,\\\\beta_1,\\\\beta_2,\\\\dots \\\\,. The limit of this sequence must in fact also be the limit of the sequence \\\\beta_0^\\\\xi,\\\\beta_1^\\\\xi,\\\\beta_2^\\\\xi,\\\\dots \\\\,, and since each C_\\\\xi \\\\, is closed and \\\\lambda \\\\, is uncountable, this limit must be in each C_\\\\xi \\\\,, and therefore this limit is an element of the intersection that is above \\\\beta_0 \\\\,, which shows that the intersection is unbounded. QED. From this, it can be seen that if \\\\kappa \\\\, is a regular cardinal, then \\\\\\\\{S \\\\subset \\\\kappa : \\\\exists C \\\\subset S \\\\text{ such that } C \\\\text{ is closed unbounded in } \\\\kappa\\\\\\\\} \\\\, is a non-principal \\\\kappa \\\\,-complete filter on \\\\kappa \\\\,. If \\\\kappa \\\\, is a regular cardinal then club sets are also closed under diagonal intersection. In fact, if \\\\kappa \\\\, is regular and \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\, is any filter on \\\\kappa \\\\,, closed under diagonal intersection, containing all sets of the form \\\\\\\\{\\\\xi < \\\\kappa : \\\\xi \\\\geq \\\\alpha\\\\\\\\} \\\\, for \\\\alpha < \\\\kappa \\\\,, then \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\, must include all club sets.
