History In 1934, the United Hatters of North America (UHNA) (formed 1896) and the Cloth Hat, Cap and Millinery Workers International Union (CHCMW) (formed 1901), both based in New York, ended their competition by merging to form the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers International Union (UHCMW).

Other important teachers include, Piano and Harpsichord virtuoso Barbara Kupferberg and Jazz Vocalists Bob Stoloff, Mili Bermajo, and Dominique Eade. She attributes much of her rhythmic approach and Konnakol studies to her collaboration (2002‚Äìpresent) with composer and four-time Grammy winner Glen Velez.Glen Velez , won Grammies as part of the Paul Winter Consort She has also studied Konnakol with Ghatam and Konnakol master Subash Chandran and Vinod (VR) Venkataram.

It is an orange-brown coloured small frog reported so far only from the Aprada-tepui, a table-top mountain in the Bol√≠var state of Venezuela. It was discovered in June 2012 and formally described in October 2013 by Belgian biologist Philippe J. R. Kok at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and Vrije Universiteit Brussel. The species was named after the Hollywood filmmaker James Cameron, in recognition of his efforts in environmental awareness, and in addition to his public promotion of veganism as a way of animal conservation. Due to its restricted occurrence, the species could be classified as \\"endangered\\" according to the criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Discovery and etymology An adult male (holotype) and three female (paratypes) Pristimantis jamescameroni were collected by Philippe Kok on the morning of 15 June 2012 at the summit of Aprada-tepui. The Pantepui region is situated in the northwestern part of the Guiana Shield, and is recognized as one of the primary centres of speciation and occurrence of endemic species in the Neotropics, especially of birds, amphibians and reptiles. The region is already known as the major site of habitat of at least twenty Pristimantis species, including recently discovered species such as P. aureoventris, P. muchimuk, P. abakapa, P. auricarens, P. pulvinatus, P. stegolepis and P. tepuiensis. The specific epithet is a genitive case of the multiple Academy Award-winning film director and producer, James Cameron, which is contracted into a single word. Cameron was chosen because of his \\"efforts to alert the general public of the environmental problems through pioneering high quality blockbuster movies and adventurous documentaries\\". Further Cameron was recognized for his \\"encouragement of people to go vegan\\", \\"one of the effective ways to reduce human environmental impacts such as global climate change, identified as a serious threat to tepuis ecosystems\\". Description Male (left) and two females, showing variation in dorsal and ventral coloration Pristimantis jamescameroni is a tiny frog, and mostly brown with orange stripes in colour. Sexual dimorphism is characterized by larger female ( snout‚Äìvent length) against the smaller male ( snout‚Äìvent length). Further nuptial pads are present only in males, and the hands and feet are slightly longer than those of female. The dorsal surface is mixed with numerous white flecks. The arms and legs are similarly coloured, with less of orange, and with few small irregular white spots on upper arms. The ventral side of the body is lighter in colour and mostly covered by orange colour. The tips of the toes are whitish. The head is slightly longer than broad, and is wider than the main body. The nares are slightly projecting towards the side of the body. The widest upper eyelid is narrower than interorbital distance. The upper eyelid is shagreen with 1‚Äì2 enlarged tubercles on each eyelid. The colour of iris varies from silver or greenish silver to bronze, with dark-brown venation, is ill-defined, and with broad horizontal brownish stripe. Tympanum is absent. Supratympanic fold is extremely large and is slightly arched, originating at posterior corner of eye. There are minute pharyngeal ostia. The tongue is cordiform, slightly longer than wide, and rounded posteriorly. The posterior half of the tongue is free. Vocal slits and vocal sac are absent, in contrast to closely related species. There are two large, not connected, non-spinous, mostly unpigmented nuptial pads on each thumb of the arms in male. One nuptial pad is extending along the preaxial surface of the tubercle and invading most of it, while the other extends along the dorsal and the preaxial surface of the thumb. Finger discs are broadly expanded, elliptical in shape, and broader than long. The circumferential groove on the discs are conspicuous, and the terminal edge is rounded. Legs are moderate in length, and the heels are slightly overlapping. Toe discs are mostly similar in size and shape to the finger discs. Ecology Pristimantis jamescameroni is so far known only from the summit of Aprada-tepui at Bol√≠var state, Venezuela, where it is found at an elevation range between above sea level. The habitat is mainly covered by open rock vegetation and small islands of tepui forests. The region is particularly characterized by numerous small lakes and some deep canyons. The main habitat area is apparently the underneath of shallow rocks. The holotype was collected during day on the ground while calling in a small shallow rock crevice, hidden by the vegetation. All other specimens were collected under rocks. Other males could be heard calling very sporadically from shallow rock crevices by day. Due to their limited distribution, Kok suggested the frogs be classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Auckland Symphony Orchestra, conductor Gary Daverne, with combined Pacific Island Church choirs The Auckland Symphony Orchestra (ASO) is a New Zealand community-based symphony orchestra formed in 1975 by founding musical director Gary Daverne . ASO is currently led by musical director Peter Thomas. The ASO has developed a following and reputation for high quality performances of popular classics from the symphonic repertoire and music from stage and screen, often playing to capacity and turn-away audiences. Its eighty-plus players are drawn from all parts of Auckland and from all walks of life, including professional people who have chosen a career outside of music. The ASO provides an opportunity to these people to enjoy weekly rehearsals of symphonic music, playing without payment and purely for the pleasure of making good music together. It also supports local young soloists, giving them the opportunity to perform in concert with a full symphony orchestra. The orchestra's main philosophy is that music should be fun and enjoyed by players and audiences alike ‚Äì hence the regular Free Family concerts that are offered in Auckland with out-of-town concerts in areas where a live performance by a symphony orchestra is a rare event. Regular annual features of the orchestra are the Free Family concerts, performances of Last Night of the Proms and the Christmas Sing Along with local Pacific Island church choirs. Since 2013, ASO has also made annual tours to the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, to perform at the Kerikeri Turner Centre.  History  Founder and Musical Director Gary Daverne ONZM with the Auckland Symphony Orchestra The Auckland Symphony Orchestra was formed as a result of a 30th anniversary reunion of players from the Auckland Junior Symphony Orchestra (JSO, known today as the Auckland Youth Orchestra) and a surprise 60th birthday party of its former long term conductor, Dr. Charles Nalden. Gary Daverne, a former clarinettist of the JSO and then a musical theatre conductor, was given the task of directing the reunion orchestra of some eighty players. Music was chosen from past programmes, on only three rehearsals. The full contingent of players did not appear until the performance night. Based upon the success of the reunion many of the players expressed an interest for forming a permanent orchestra. Gary Daverne was chosen as music director and conductor and along with the administrative skills of Patricia Goddard, a former contra bass player in the JSO and a very strong, dedicated lady, the Music Players of Auckland was formed with approximately forty players. They gave their first concert in November 1975 and quickly expanded in size to over sixty players. Two years later the name was changed to the Auckland Symphony Orchestra. Patricia Goddard retired from the orchestra in the late 1980s and Gary Daverne ONZM retired in December 2010 after thirty-five years at the helm. Peter Thomas, an Auckland-based conductor and music educator, was appointed as Gary's successor and remains the current Music Director. Concert halls In the beginning years the orchestra made its home at St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral in Parnell, moving in the early 1990s to the newly constructed Aotea Centre and Bruce Mason Centre concert halls and later to the refurbished Auckland Town Hall. 2007 China tour In April 2007 the Auckland Symphony Orchestra with conductor Gary Daverne toured China, where they performed successful concerts to large, enthusiastic and appreciative audiences in the cities of Shanghai, Shi Jia Zhuang and Beijing. The concerts in Beijing and Shanghai were televised and the Shanghai concert was screened for one hour on prime time television (Sunday evening 7 ‚Äì 8pm), to an estimated viewing audience of 143 million. Politicians, high-ranking government officials and dignitaries attended all concerts.

She is also a three-time New York Times bestselling author.http://www.nadiabolzweber.com/ Bolz-Weber is known for her unusual approach to reaching others through her church. Heavily tattooed, her work in the church is considered part of \\"a new Reformation\\" by scholar and writer Diana Butler Bass.  Biography  Bolz-Weber grew up in Colorado Springs with a fundamentalist Christian family. In 1986, at age 17, Bolz-Weber started getting tattoos, and the ones on her arms mark the liturgical year and the story of the Gospel. Bolz-Weber briefly attended Pepperdine University before dropping out and moving to Denver. She says that she became an alcoholic and drug abuser and often felt like one of \\"society's outsiders\\". By 1991, Bolz-Weber became sober and, as of 2020, has remained so for twenty eight years. Prior to her ordination, she was a stand-up comedian and worked in the restaurant industry. Bolz-Weber felt that she heard the call to service in 2004 when she was asked to eulogize a friend who had committed suicide. In 2008, Bolz-Weber was ordained as a pastor. She started her own church, the House for All Sinners and Saints, which is often shortened to just House. One third of her church is part of the LGBT community, and she also has a \\"Minister of Fabulousness\\", Stuart, who is a drag queen. Her church is also very welcoming to people with drug addiction, depression, and even those who are not believers of her faith. Bolz-Weber spends nearly twenty hours each week writing her weekly ten-minute sermon. A feminist, in 2018 she called for women to send her their purity rings to be melted down into a vagina sculpture as part of healing the psychic damage of the purity movement of the 1990s.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/purity-rings-vulva-sculpture-nadia-bolz- weber_n_5c63354ee4b07115222adfc5 At the Makers conference on Valentine's Day, February 14, 2019, Bolz-Weber gave the sculpture to American feminist and political activist Gloria Steinem.

The hantavirus was found in Japan after analyzing a Japanese shrew mole. Hantaviruses harbored by shrews are genetically closer to ASAV than to hantaviruses harbored by rodents. Host-switching may be evident in the future due to the viruses closeness to soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses. The detection of the asama virus was the first hantavirus found in the family Talpidae, which includes shrew moles. Thoughts on hantavirus evolutionary history has expanded due to the discovery of ASAV.  Natural reservoir  Asama virus was isolated through RNA extracts from lung tissues of the Japanese shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides), captured in Japan between February and April 2008. It is one of the first hantaviruses found in a mole.  Virology  Asama virus is genetically closer to other hantaviruses harbored by shrews than by rodents. However, the nucleocapsid protein is similar to that of rodent and shrew-borne hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses positions it closest to soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses. This suggests a possible host-switching event in the distant past. Asama virus is related to soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses that are found in North America, Europe, and Asia. This relation was discovered through phylogenetic analyses. The relationship between the two hantaviruses may suggest parallel evolution associated with cross-species transmission.Bennett, Shannon N., Laurie Diznie, Laarni Sumibcay, Satoru Arai, Luis A.

It has colonised the eastern Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. It is an important species in coastal fisheries throughout its range. Description Decapterus russelli has an elongate, somewhat slender and slightly compressed body. The eyes are of moderate size and have a well developed adipose eyelid which completely covers eye apart from a vertical slit which has the pupil in its centre. The scales on top of head do not reach a line running through the centre of pupil. The lateral line has a low regular arch towards the head and the curved and straight parts meet below the second dorsal fin between 11th to 13th soft rays; there are 42-62 scales in the curved part of the lateral line and between 0 and 4 scutes, while the straight part has 0 to 4 scales which are followed by 30 to 40 scutes, meaning that the total count of scales and scutes is between 77 and 102m if caudal scutes are excluded). There is a dusky or transparent membrane at the join of the upper jaw, the posterior end of the upper jaw is straight above and a little concave and not horizontal antero- ventrally. Both jaws bear an anterior row of minute teeth which is quite irregular with a single series of posterior teeth. There are 10-14 upper gill rakers and 30 to 39 lower making a total of 41 to 53 on the first gill arch. The shoulder girdle has 3 small papillae on its margin, the lower one being the larger. There are two widely separate dorsal fins, the first is triangular with 8 spines and the second has one spine with 28-33 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 detached spines followed by a single spine and 25-29 soft rays; the terminal dorsal and anal soft rays consist of a widely detached finlet. The pectoral fin measures 76.5 to 97.0% of the head length. In life it is bluish- green above and silvery below with a small black blotch on the margin of operculum near its upper edge. Caudal fin varies from translucent to dark brown, the second dorsal fin is translucent at its base but light blackish- brown towards the margin; the other fins are mostly translucent, other than the pelvic fins of adult males which are slightly darker. The spines and rays on the dorsal and anal fin are grey, those on the other finds are white. Its length is up to 45 cm total length, more usually 30 cm and the maximum weight is 110g. Distribution Decapterus russelli occurs throughout the Indian Ocean, from the coasts of eastern Africa from the Gulf of Suez as far south as South Africa to Indonesia, eastwards into the western Pacific Ocean, from Japan in the north and south to Australia. It is a Lessepsian migrant which has invaded the eastern Mediterranean from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal, it was first recorded off Israel in 2005 and is now common as far north as south-eastern Turkey and has become an important species in local fisheries. Biology Adult Decapterus russelli are benthic and form large schools in deeper water, although they may occasionally be found inshore in smaller groups where there are sheltered bays. It is the most common species of Decapterus in coastal waters and on open shallows of the Indian Ocean. Their main prey is smaller planktonic invertebrates, with a study off India finding that the prawn Acetes indicus being the most numerous prey for both adult and juvenile fish but larger specimens hunt a wide variety of suitably sized fish, including Lactarius lactarius, Leiognathus spp, lanternfishes, eels, Nemipterus spp, Saurida tumbil, Boleophthalamus sp., Bregmaceros mcclellandi, Polynemus heptadactylus, Polynemus indicus, Cynoglossus spp., Trichiurus lepturus and Stolephorus spp.. It is host to the ectoparasitic copepod Lernanthropus decapteri. It reaches sexual maturity at around 1 year old and about 12 cm in length Human usage Decapterus russelli is fished for wherever it occurs, normally using seine nets and trawls. In 1999 the total catch was just short of 160,000 tonnes, with the two major fishing nations being Thailand and Malaysia, which landed 82,000 tonnes and 70,160 tonnes respectively. Since the 1950s The weight of Indian scad landed fluctuates and there is no increasing or decreasing trend apparent in the population, however in south-east Asia there has been a marked increase in effort which has not seen an increase n landings suggesting the fishery is over-exploited. It is generally marketed fresh, may be dried or salted, as well as being sold frozen and canned. Etymology The specific name honours the Scottish surgeon and herpetologist Patrick Russell (1726-1805) who had described and illustrated in 1803 but did not give it a specific name.

Both Kao and Yen asked him to stay in his post.  Deputy Minister of National Defense In early April 2014, speaking to the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan, Lee said that if the People's Liberation Army (PLA) were to invade Taiwan, they need at least four months for assault preparation, thus translated to the amount of advance warning Taiwan needs in such scenario. In the event of cross-strait war, the command has to come from Zhongnanhai, the headquarter of the Communist Party of China, by the task force formation at the Central Military Commission. The next step would be recalling all of the Chinese envoys in Taiwan, execute economic preparations and tighten control of Taiwanese business people in Mainland China. He added that Taiwan has already prepared relevant measures with other countries and military reserve would be called in such attack scenario. Military confidence building measure can only be built between ROC Armed Forces and PLA only if Beijing renounces the use of force to achieve Chinese reunification.

While Morocco does not recognize Israel as a state, the relationship between the two was secretly maintained after the establishment of Israel in 1948. For many years, Hassan II had facilitated the secret relationship with Israel, and it was considered as instrumental in stabilizing Morocco and beating possible anti-royal threats within the country. This secret relationship continues to play an important role in growing Israeli‚ÄìMoroccan ties, despite the lack of formal relations. The Israeli passport is accepted entry to Morocco with a visa granted on arrival. History Morocco, like many Arab countries, was formally at war with Israel since 1948, which culminated into the riots of Oujda and Jerada against Jews. This prompted Jews to flee from the country. However, under the reign of later King, Hassan II, it was characterized as controversial due to Hassan II's closeness with Israel. Hassan II was found to have invited Mossad and Shin Bet agents in the Arab League meeting held in Casablanca at 1965, and this was instrumental leading to the heavy military defeats of Egypt, Jordan and Syria to the Israelis at Six-Day War. Prior to the war, King Hassan II had developed a reciprocal relationship with the Israeli intelligence, who had assisted him in carrying out an operation in France to abduct and 'disappear' Mehdi Ben Barka, a Moroccan dissident and left-wing opposition leader who had been based in Paris. The close relations between Israeli and Moroccan leaders have become a subject for many years even within Moroccan society. At 1975, the outbreak of Western Sahara War prompted Morocco to seek eventual and secret aids from Israeli intelligence, who had reorganized the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces and was thought to have helped building the Moroccan Western Sahara Wall, something neither Israel or Morocco acknowledged today. During 1980s, Hassan II attempted to break the deadlock to recognize Israel by meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres in Rabat at 1986, but was met with backlash and protests from the Arab League and Moroccans alike, forcing Hassan II to withdraw his attempt. Nonetheless, Hassan II maintained bond with Peres, and Peres voiced his condolence when Hassan II died in 1999. Like late Hassan II, his son Mohammed VI of Morocco maintains this pragmatic approach and keeps the secret link between Morocco and Israel. Mohammed VI's advisor, Andr√© Azoulay, is an instrumental Jewish Moroccan who facilitated the growth of Morocco in both economic and political terms; while also maintaining good ties with Israel. Morocco also attempted to solve the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict by dispatching another Jewish aide close to Israel, Sam Ben Shitrit, to solve the conflict and make peace between the two. Recently, due to the growing push of anti-Iranian sentiment on both sides, as both countries have problems with the Iranian regime led by conservative Islamists, Morocco and Israel have sought to make their ties closer. Both countries participated in February 2019 Warsaw Conference, aimed to be anti-Iranian. This was followed by suspicions and rumors over Morocco's attempt to normalize relations with Israel, which were caught up by protests. In January 2020, Morocco received three Israeli drones as part of $48 million arms deal. In September 2020, U.S. Pres. Donald Trump announced he was seeking direct flights between Rabat and Tel Aviv. Jews in Morocco Jews have a long historical presence in Morocco, where they are presently the largest Jewish community in the Arab World. The Moroccan government has tolerated its Jewish community, even after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, facilitating the secret tie between Israel and Morocco. Moroccan-organized Jewish emigration to Israel continued while still manage to maintain strong ties with the Israeli government through its remaining Jews. Moroccan mellahs (Jewish Quarters) also exist in some cities. Morocco is the only Arab nation to have a Jewish museum, which has been praised by Moroccans and Jewish communities alike. A large community of Moroccan Jews live around the world.

This cyclone began as a weak tropical low near the Solomon Islands, and initially moved westward. On 18 December, it was named Joy, becoming the 2nd named storm of the 1990‚Äì91 Australian region cyclone season. After turning southwest, Joy developed a well-defined eye and strengthened to maximum sustained winds of while approaching Cairns in Far North Queensland. Brushing the city with strong winds, the cyclone soon weakened and turned southeast. Joy later curved back southwest, making landfall near Townsville, Queensland on 26 December. It dissipated the next day; remnant moisture continued as torrential rainfall over Queensland for two weeks. While drifting offshore northeastern Australia, the cyclone produced wind gusts as high as in Cairns, strong enough to cause power outages. In Mackay, a tornado spawned by Joy damaged 40 homes, while torrential rainfall just south of the city peaked at over . Most storm- associated damage was wrought by severe flooding, which persisted for weeks in hardest-hit locations. Rains significantly increased water levels on 10 rivers, among them the Fitzroy River, which discharged about of freshwater into Keppel Bay over 25 days. In turn, the Great Barrier Reef suffered biological damage from coral bleaching and decreased salinity. The Fitzroy River rose to a peak at Rockhampton, forcing thousands to evacuate homes; some stranded individuals could only obtain food by helicopter. Elsewhere in Australia, storm moisture alleviated drought conditions and diminished fires near Sydney. Overall, Joy killed six people and caused 300 million in damage ($234 million USD). Afterwards, the Queensland government issued a disaster declaration for about 30% of the state, and the name Joy was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names. Meteorological history In mid-December, a monsoon trough persisted along the west Pacific Ocean, spawning a pair of tropical disturbances both north and south of the equator. In the northwestern Pacific Ocean, the system became Typhoon Russ. On 15 December, a tropical low formed east of the Solomon Islands. During the next few days, the system passed south of the country while slowly organizing. On 18 December, the Australia Bureau of Meteorology began tracking it, naming the system \\"Joy\\" after it upgraded the low to tropical cyclone status. A meteorologist from Darwin later apologised that the name was used so close to Christmas, although \\"Joy\\" was predetermined by a rotating list of list of tropical cyclone names. Also on 18 December, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing warnings on the storm, labeling it as Tropical Cyclone 06P. With a ridge to the south, Joy continued generally west-southwestward. While in its origins, Joy was experiencing upper-level wind shear, but as it approached the jet stream while turning to the southwest, conditions became more favourable for intensification. The storm quickly intensified, reaching the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on 21 December. At 00:00 UTC on 23 December, the Bureau estimated Joy reached peak 10-minute sustained winds of , which made the system a category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Around the same time, the JTWC also estimated the same peak winds, but sustained over one minute. Joy developed an eye about in diameter with concentric eyewalls. The storm began moving slowly off the northeast coast of Australia, passing within of Cairns, and the motion shifted to a southeast drift. A building high pressure area to the south caused the change in movement, and there were initial concerns the storm would loop to the west and affect Cairns again. Drier air caused Joy to weaken gradually from its peak to the equivalent of a strong tropical storm. At 06:00 UTC on 26 December, after turning back to the southwest, the storm made landfall near Townsville, Queensland, with winds estimated at . That day, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and on 27 December, Joy dissipated inland over Queensland. A remnant system persisted into early January, producing continued rainfall across Queensland. Preparations Before Joy struck Australia, residents evacuated from resorts on Fitzroy and Green islands by boat or plane. Officials set up evacuation centres on the mainland and put the Australian Army on standby. The military evacuated its fleet of Blackhawk helicopters inland from RAAF Base Townsville. A man required rescue from Hope Island by helicopter in advance of the storm. The threat of the storm caused shopping malls and the airport near Cairns to close just before Christmas. Several flights were diverted or delayed, stranding about 1,000 travellers, many of whom spent Christmas in the airport. Road travel was banned in some areas of northeastern Queensland, and residents in Port Douglas were forced to evacuate. The Flood Warning Centre in Brisbane issued 192 flood warnings related to Cyclone Joy in December and January, beginning on 23 December. Most of the warnings were related to increased water levels along rivers. Impact A yacht washed aground at Airlie Beach, Queensland, in the Whitsunday Region Joy passed within of Green Island off the coast of Queensland, generating a wind gust of . Heavy damage occurred on other islands, and one person drowned while surfing in Mackay. A boat became disabled during the storm, forcing its four occupants to ride out the storm for four days on Cockermouth Island until they were rescued by helicopter. Several boats were damaged in the Whitsunday Islands. The storm and its remnants dropped heavy rainfall throughout Queensland for about two weeks, totaling over south of Mackay and over between Bowen and St. Lawrence. The highest daily total was about west of Sarina. Three day rainfall totals around when Joy made landfall included in Blue Mountain and in Waitara. Rainfall continued through the region through March 1991, resulting in the third largest flood in the region in over 100 years. Overall, Cyclone Joy killed six people, including five in river flooding, and caused about 300 million in damage ($234 million USD). While stalling off the northeast Australia coast, Joy produced widespread gale force winds, with gusts to recorded at Cairns. After the winds knocked over trees, causing power and phone outages, storm damage cut the water supply and briefly isolated Cairns due to debris blocking roads. An outer rainband struck Mackay as the storm moved ashore, spawning a tornado that damaged 40 houses, destroyed two others, and damaged a caravan park. The windstorm was unexpected there, and damage in Mackay was estimated at 10 million. Flooding from rainfall affected about 90% of the city, which restricted train travel, causing three trains to be canceled and stranding hundreds of travelers. In Port Douglas, Joy produced an inconsequential storm surge of . In Innisfail, the cyclone ruined 90% of the town's crops, and over 20 houses sustained wind damage. Banana farmers in the Cairns region lost a combined total of 1.2 million bunches of the fruit. Collectively, crop damage totalled over 70 million, mostly to sugar cane and banana. About 30,000 head of livestock were killed in the region. Weakening Cyclone Joy near landfall Rain from Cyclone Joy caused rampant flooding across the region, significantly raising water levels along 10 rivers. The Fitzroy River alone swelled to inundate about of terrain. Heightened discharge caused extensive erosion along river channels that removed about of soil and vegetation. In late December, the Pioneer River at Mackay peaked at , safely within the confines of its levee system. The town of Giru endured flooding of streets and houses, which would reoccur several times through February. High water levels along the Tully River flooded a portion of the Bruce Highway. In the second week of January, the Herbert River peaked at , causing residential flooding in Ingham. Elsewhere in Australia, moisture from the storm eased ongoing bushfires near Sydney. At Rockhampton, the Fitzroy River rose to an initial peak of , temporarily dropped, and rose to a final peak of in early January 1991, the third highest since records began in 1860, after floods in 1918 and 1954. Inflow from several tributaries ensured the Fitzroy River near Rockhampton remained over for 13 days. The river entered 350 houses in what was the city's most damaging flood since 1954. The town was isolated for about three weeks after flooding covered roads, railways, and the airport. Before the worst of the flooding, Acting Premier Tom Burns declared a state of disaster for Rockhampton, giving local police the authority to force individuals living in flood zones to leave their homes. Ultimately, over 1,000 people sought higher ground, staying mainly at the houses of friends or relatives, or at nearby schools. In an attempt to mitigate damage, 150 volunteers filled 43,000 sandbags to protect properties. Nearby, residents rescued about 100 dogs from an affected kennel. Storm-related flooding damaged portions of the Great Barrier Reef through coral bleaching. Over 25 days, the Fitzroy River discharged about of water into Keppel Bay, reaching the Great Barrier Reef in early January and causing a drop in salinity levels. On Great Keppel Island, about 85% of shallow-water reefs died. Reef damage also occurred in the Whitsunday Islands. The discharge from the Fitzroy River affected various islands and coral groups, depending on the offshore wind direction and ocean current. The water flow washed a group of freshwater turtles from the mainland to North West Island, though they were later returned to their native habitat. The influx of freshwater reduced commercial fishing productivity by 30%. Aftermath Workers in Cairns had restored power and water supplies within a few days of Joy's passage. After the initial flooding from Joy ended, there was additional rainfall in February 1991 that caused flooding across the region. Residual flooding cost the coal industry about 60 million due to loss of production and hindered exporting. While Rockhampton was still isolated by flooding, a helicopter airdropped food to hundreds of stranded families, after the town experienced food and water shortages. Transportation to Rockhampton was not normalised until 20 January, when the airport and incoming roads were reopened. The city of Rockhampton later created a flood plain management policy as a result of the effects from Joy. The floods helped fill the drainage basin of the Peter Faust Dam within a few weeks, speeding up a process which would have otherwise taken several years. Months after the storm, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service collected reports on environmental impacts from the flooding; they included some beneficial aspects such as new locations for animal breeding, and alleviation of drought conditions. The Queensland government upgraded a portion of the Bruce Highway near Rockhampton to reduce flooding in similar storms. Officials declared about a third of the state of Queensland as a disaster area following Cyclone Joy, directing state funds toward recovery efforts. The Queensland government provided monetary assistance to eligible families in the disaster zone and offered special loans to farmers affected by the storm. The federal government agreed to contribute 75% of overall relief costs. Following the cyclone's impacts in Australia, the name Joy was later retired by the World Meteorological Organization.

After training at Harvard Medical School in genetics with William Gelbart, at Stanford Medical School with David Hogness, and in a fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital in molecular biology, Wu began her independent academic career as an assistant professor in Anatomy and Cellular Biology and then Genetics at Harvard Medical School in 1993. After a period as Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Molecular Medicine at the Boston Children's Hospital, she returned to the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School as a full professor in 2007. Wu's research has focused on the role of chromosome behavior gene activity and inheritance, with emphasis on widespread homology effects, phenomena in which homology between chromosomes plays a role. Her studies have explored transvection in genetics, polycomb-group genes, chromatin pairing and remodeling, and the mechanisms of bridging promoter and enhancer elements within and between chromosomes. She also studies ultra-conserved elements (UCEs), proposing that these highly conserved sequences play a role in maintaining genome integrity, and has discussed potential opportunities for therapeutics harnessing properties of UCEs in many venues, including in TEDx and the Google-sponsored Solve for X program. Wu has made significant contributions in the area of science education in genetics, across many age groups, through work with the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum of Natural History and is founding director of the Personal Genetics Education Project, which works through schools, online curricula, teacher training, and producers and writers of the television and movie industry through involvement with the trade-supporting organization Hollywood, Health & Society. She is daughter of author Nelson Ikon Wu, sister of actor Ping Wu, and colleague and spouse of Harvard and MIT scientist George M. Church. Training and career Wu attended Mary Institute (now Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, MICDS) in St. Louis, Missouri, from 1968 to 1972 and then completed her undergraduate BS degree in Biology at Harvard University. She obtained her Ph.D. degree in 1984 from Harvard Medical School in Genetics and then following a brief period at Stanford Medical School with David Hogness, set up a non-profit research institute in Cheshire, Connecticut, called the Station for Natural Studies Inc., which received grant funding from the Whitehall Foundation and the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation. She was affiliated with nearby Yale University during this time. Wu was a fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital in the Department of Molecular Biology from 1987 to 1991. She moved to Harvard Medical School‚Äôs main campus as an assistant professor in the Department of Anatomy and Cellular Biology and then joined the Department of Genetics, also at Harvard Medical School, in 1993. In 2005, she left the Department of Genetics to become a professor of pediatrics in the Division of Molecular Medicine at the Boston Children's Hospital. She returned to the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School as a full professor in 2007. Research Since 1980, Dr. Wu's research has focused on the role of chromosome behavior in inheritance and gene activity, with emphasis on the widespread phenomena in which homology between chromosomes plays a role. She coined the term \\"homology effects\\" to highlight these phenomena. Her studies explore transvection, the zeste gene, chromosome pairing, and Polycomb-group genes and chromatin remodeling. She has also characterized the mechanisms of bridging promoter and enhancer elements within and between chromosomes. As stated by nobelist Ed Lewis, \\"Operationally, transvection is occurring if the phenotype of a given genotype can be altered solely by disruption of somatic (or meiotic) pairing. Such disruption can generally be accomplished by introduction of a heterozygous rearrangement that disrupts pairing in the relevant region but has no position effect of its own on the phenotype\\" She also studies ultra-conserved elements (UCEs). Her lab has proposed that these highly conserved sequences may play a role in maintaining genome integrity. Honors and leadership roles Wu was one of ten people in the US to receive the National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award in 2012. She has also received awards for teaching and mentoring at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School. She has chaired the 2005 Epigenetics Gordon Research Conference, the 2003 FASEB Conference on Chromatin and Transcription, and the GETed Conferences.

Steps involved in the transfer of viruses to new hosts include contact between the virus and the host, infection of an initial individual leading to amplification and an outbreak, and the generation within the original or new host of viral variants that have the ability to spread efficiently between individuals in populations of the new host Often seen in emerging viruses where one species transfers to another, which in turn transfers to humans. Examples include SARS, Ebola, swine flu, rabies, and avian influenza. Bacterial pathogens can also be associated with CST. The exact mechanism that facilitates transfer is unknown, however, it is believed that viruses with a rapid mutation rate are able to overcome host- specific immunological defenses. This can occur between species that have high contact rates. It can also occur between species with low contact rates but usually through an intermediary species. Bats, for example, are mammals and can directly transfer rabies to humans through bite and also through aerosolization of bat saliva and urine which can then be absorbed by human mucous membranes in the nose, mouth and eyes. A host shifting event is defined as a strain that was previously zoonotic and now circulates exclusively among humans. The similarity between species, for example, transfer between mammals, is believed to be facilitated by similar immunological defenses. Other factors include geographic area, intraspecies behaviors, and phylogenetic relatedness. Virus emergence relies on two factors: initial infection and sustained transmission. Prevalence and control Cross-species transmission is the most significant cause of disease emergence in humans and other species. Wildlife zoonotic diseases of microbial origin are also the most common group of human emerging diseases, and CST between wildlife and livestock has appreciable economic impacts in agriculture by reducing livestock productivity and imposing export restrictions. This makes CST of major concern for public health, agriculture, and wildlife management. The authors of a study on the bubonic plague in Oran stress that the disease \\"is primarily a bacterial zoonosis affecting rodents. It is caused by Yersinia pestis and is transmitted from animal to animal by fleas. Humans usually become infected through the bite of an infected rodent flea.\\" The sanitary control measure instituted by the public health authority was chemical in nature: \\"Intra- and peridomestic spraying with permethrin was conducted. Deltamethrin was dusted on the tracks and around the burrows of rodents located in a radius of 10 km around the dwelling of the patients. Uncontrolled killing of rats was prohibited.\\" A large proportion of viral pathogens that have emerged recently in humans are considered to have originated from various animal species. This is shown by several recent epidemics such as, avian flu, Ebola, monkey pox, and Hanta viruses. There is evidence to suggest that some diseases can potentially be re-introduced to human populations through animal hosts after they have been eradicated in humans. There is a risk of this phenomenon occurring with morbilliviruses as they can readily cross species barriers. CST can also have a significant effect on produce industries. Genotype VI-Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (GVI-PMV1) is a virus that arose through cross-species transmission events from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to Columbiformes, and has become prevalent in the poultry industry. CST of rabies virus variants between many different species populations is a major concern of wildlife management. Introduction of these variants into non-reservoir animals increases the risk of human exposures and threatens current advances toward rabies control. Many pathogens are thought to have host specialization, which explains the maintenance of distinct strains in host species. Pathogens would have to overcome their host specificity to cross to a new host species. Some studies have argued that host specializations may be exaggerated, and pathogens are more likely to exhibit CST than previously thought. Original hosts usually have low death rates when infected with a pathogen, with fatality rates tending to be much higher in new hosts Between non-human primates and humans Due to the close relation of nonhuman primates (NHP) and humans, disease transmission between NHP and humans is relatively common and can become a major public health concern. Diseases such as HIV and human adenoviruses have been associated with NHP interactions. In places where contact between humans and NHPs is frequent, precautions are often taken to prevent disease transmission. Simian foamy viruses (SFV) is an enzootic retrovirus that has high rates of cross-species transmission and has been known to affect humans bitten by infected NHPs. It has caused health concerns in places like Indonesia where visitors at monkey temples can contract SFV from temple macaques (Macaca fascicularis). TMAdV (titi monkey adenovirus) is a highly divergent, sharing <57% pairwise nucleotide identity with other adenoviruses, NHP virus that had a high fatality rate (83%) in monkeys and is capable of spreading through human hosts. Predicting and preventing transmission between species Prediction and monitoring are important for the study of CSTs and their effects. However, factors that determine the origin and fate of cross-species transmission events remain unclear for the majority of human pathogens. This has resulted in the use of different statistical models for the analysis of CST. Some of these include risk-analysis models, single rate dated tip (SRDT) models, and phylogenetic diffusion models. The study of the genomes of pathogens involved in CST events is very useful in determining their origin and fate. This is because a pathogens genetic diversity and mutation rate are key factors in determining if it can transmit across multiple hosts. This makes it important for the genomes of transmission species to be partially or completely sequenced. A change in genomic structure could cause a pathogen that has a narrow host range to become capable of exploiting a wider host range. Genetic distance between different species, geographical range, and other interaction barriers will also influence cross- species transmission. One approach to risk assessment analysis of CST is to develop risk-analysis models that break the ‚Äò‚Äòprocess‚Äô‚Äô of disease transmission into parts. Processes and interactions that could lead to cross- species disease transmission are explicitly described as a hypothetical infection chain. Data from laboratory and field experiments are used to estimate the probability of each component, expected natural variation, and margins of error. Different types of CST research would require different analysis pathways to meet their needs. A study on identification of viruses in bats that could spread to other mammals used the workflow: sequencing of genomic samples ‚Üí ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù of raw reads ‚Üí elimination of host reads and eukaryotic contaminants ‚Üí de novo assembly of the remaining reads ‚Üí annotation of viral contigs ‚Üí molecular detection of specific viruses ‚Üí phylogenetic analysis ‚Üí interpretation of data. Detecting CST and estimating its rate based on prevalence data is challenging. Due to these difficulties, computational methods are used to analyse CST events and the pathogens associated with them. The explosive development of molecular techniques has opened new possibilities for using phylogenetic analysis of pathogen genetics to infer epidemiological parameters. This provides some insight into the origins of these events and how they could be addressed. Methods of CST prevention are currently using both biological and computational data. An example of this is using both cellular assays and phylogenetic comparisons to support a role for TRIM5Œ±, the product of the TRIM5 gene, in suppressing interspecies transmission and emergence of retroviruses in nature.  Analyzation =Phylogeny The comparison of genomic data is very important for the study of cross-species transmission. Phylogenetic analysis is used to compare genetic variation in both pathogens associated with CST and the host species that they infect. Taken together, it is possible to infer what allowed a pathogen to crossover to a new host (i.e. mutation in a pathogen, change in host susceptibility) and how this can be prevented in the future. If the mechanisms a pathogens uses to initially enter a new species are well characterized and understood a certain level of risk control and prevention can be obtained. In contact, a poor understanding of pathogens, and their associated diseases, makes it harder for preventive measures to be taken Alternative hosts can also potentially have a critical role in the evolution and diffusion of a pathogen. When a pathogen crosses species it often acquires new characteristics that allow it to breach host barriers. Different pathogen variants can have very different effects on host species. Thus it can be beneficial to CST analysis to compare the same pathogens occurring in different host species. Phylogenetic analysis can be used to track a pathogens history through different species populations. Even if a pathogen is new and highly divergent, phylogenetic comparison can be very insightful. A useful strategy for investigating the history of epidemics caused by pathogen transmission combines molecular clock analysis, to estimate the timescale of the epidemic, and coalescent theory, to infer the demographic history of the pathogen. When constructing phylogenies, computer databases and tools are often used. Programs, such as BLAST, are used to annotate pathogen sequences, while databases like GenBank provide information about functions based on the pathogens genomic structure. Trees are constructed using computational methods such as MPR or Bayesian Inference, and models are created depending on the needs of the study. Single rate dated tip (SRDT) models, for example, allows for estimates of timescale under a phylogenetic tree. Models for CST prediction will vary depending on what parameters need to be accounted for when constructing the model. Most parsimonious reconstruction (MPR) Parsimony is the principle in which one chooses the simplest scientific explanation that fits the evidence. In terms of building phylogenetic trees, the best hypothesis is the one that requires the fewest evolutionary changes. Using parsimony to reconstruct ancestral character states on a phylogenetic tree is a method for testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. This method can be used in CST studies to estimate the number of character changes that exist between pathogens in relation to their host. This makes MPR useful for tracking a CST pathogen to its origins. MPR can also be used to the compare traits of host species populations. Traits and behaviours within a population could make them more susceptible to CST. For example, species which migrate regionally are important for spreading viruses through population networks. Despite the success of parsimony reconstructions, research suggests they are often sensitive and can sometimes be prone to bias in complex models. This can cause problems for CST models that have to consider many variables. Alternatives methods, such as maximum likelihood, have been developed as an alternative to parsimony reconstruction. Using genetic markers Two methods of measuring genetic variation, variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been very beneficial to the study of bacterial transmission. VNTRs, due to the low cost and high mutation rates, make them particularly useful to detect genetic differences in recent outbreaks, and while SNPs have a lower mutation rate per locus than VNTRs, they deliver more stable and reliable genetic relationships between isolates. Both methods are used to construct phylogenies for genetic analysis, however, SNPs are more suitable for studies on phylogenies contraction. However, it can be difficult for these methods to accurately simulate CSTs everts. Estimates of CST based on phylogenies made using the VNTR marker can be biased towards detecting CST events across a wide range of the parameters. SNPs tend to be less biased and variable in estimates of CST when estimations of CST rates are low and a low number of SNPs is used. In general, CST rate estimates using these methods are most reliable in systems with more mutations, more markers, and high genetic differences between introduced strains. CST is very complex and models need to account for a lot of parameters to accurately represent the phenomena. Models that oversimplify reality can result in biased data. Multiple parameters such as number of mutations accumulated since introduction, stochasticity, the genetic difference of strains introduced, and the sampling effort can make unbiased estimates of CST difficult even with whole-genome sequences, especially if sampling is limited, mutation rates are low, or if pathogens were recently introduced. More information on the factors that influence CST rates is needed for the contraction of more appropriate models to study these events. The process of using genetic markers to estimate CST rates should take into account several important factors to reduce bias. One is that the phylogenetic tree constructed in the analysis needs to capture the underlying epidemiological process generating the tree. The models need to account for how the genetic variability of a pathogen influences a disease in a species, not just general differences in genomic structure. Two, the strength of the analysis will depend on the amount of mutation accumulated since the pathogen was introduced in the system. This is due to many models using the number of mutations as an indicator of CST frequency. Therefore, efforts are focused on estimating either time since the introduction or the substitution rate of the marker (from laboratory experiments or genomic comparative analysis). This is important not only when using the MPR method but also for Likelihood approaches that require an estimation of the mutation rate. Three, CST will also affect disease prevalence in the potential host, so combining both epidemiological time series data with genetic data may be an excellent approach to CST study Bayesian analysis Bayesian frameworks are a form of maximum likelihood-based analyses and can be very effective in cross- species transmission studies. Bayesian inference of character evolution methods can account for phylogenetic tree uncertainty and more complex scenarios, with models such as the character diffusion model currently being developed for the study of CST in RNA viruses. A Bayesian statistical approach presents advantages over other analyses for tracking CST origins. Computational techniques allow integration over an unknown phylogeny, which cannot be directly observed, and unknown migration process, which is usually poorly understood. The Bayesian frameworks are also well suited to bring together different kinds of information. The BEAST software, which has a strong focus on calibrated phylogenies and genealogies, illustrates this by offering a large number of complementary evolutionary models including substitution models, demographic and relaxed clock models that can be combined into a full probabilistic model. By adding spatial reconstruction, these models create the probability of biogeographical history reconstruction from genetic data. This could be useful for determining the origins of cross- species transmissions. The high effectiveness of Bayesian statistical methods has made them instrumental in evolutionary studies. Bayesian ancestral host reconstruction under discrete diffusion models can be used to infer the origin and effects of pathogens associated with CST. One study on Human adenoviruses using Bayesian supported a gorilla and chimpanzee origin for the viral species, aiding prevention efforts. Despite presumably rare direct contact between sympatric populations of the two species, CST events can occur between them. The study also determined that two independent HAdV-B transmission events to humans occurred and that the HAdV-Bs circulating in humans are of zoonotic origin and have probably affected global health for most of our species lifetime. Phylogenetic diffusion models are frequently used for phylogeographic analyses, with the inference of host jumping becoming of increasing interest. The Bayesian inference approach enables model averaging over several potential diffusion predictors and estimates the support and contribution of each predictor while marginalizing over phylogenetic history. For studying viral CST, the flexibility of the Bayesian statistical framework allows for the reconstruction of virus transmission between different host species while simultaneously testing and quantifying the contribution of multiple ecological and evolutionary influences of both CST spillover and host shifting. One study on rabies in bats showed geographical range overlap is a modest predictor for CST, but not for host shifts. This highlights how Bayesian inferences in models can be used for CST analysis.

The initial field test excavations and artifact analysis confirmed the presence of two structures and artifactual remains of the 1857 to 1877 Carrizo Stage Station. After excavation it was subsequently reburied and erosion protection features were installed to prevent further damage to the site.Van Wormer, Wade, Walter, Arter, AN ISOLATED FRONTIER OUTPOST, 2007, p.5 External links * Carrizo Creek Station on the Butterfield Overland Mail Line, accessed from parks.ca.gov on October 25, 2013 Photo of excavated Carrizo Stage Station site with captions describing its features.

In Hong Kong, some people are unable to afford traditional apartments and are forced to wait years for affordable public housing. They therefore live in squatted shacks on top of buildings. According to the Hong Kong population census, there were 47,091 rooftop dwellers in 2011 and this number is likely to have dropped as working class areas are redeveloped. Context A housing crisis developed in the 1950s and 1960s when a large number of refugees left mainland China and moved to Hong Kong, creating a large, unmet demand for affordable housing options and squatting in shanty towns or rooftop slums. The census of 1971 reported 27,000 people living in rooftop dwellings. In 1956, the estimated squatter population of Hong Kong was 450,000. Hong Kong is now one of the most densely populated places in the world. Between 2009 and 2014, residential property prices doubled. Rooftop dwellings According to the Hong Kong population census, there were 47,091 rooftop dwellers in 2011, 48,570 in 2006 and 77,930 in 2001. Many of these squats were to be found in the old Kowloon districts of Sham Shui Po, Kwun Tong, and Tai Kok Tsui. For example, the Hoi On Building in Tai Kok Tsui housed over 100 people living on the roof in shacks. Some were made out of rudimentary materials such as wood, others were constructed more sturdily with brick walls and air-conditioning. The rooftop dwellings, generally built atop tenement buildings from the 1950s and 1960s, typically range from . As of 2011, they were regularly sold in a grey market for around HK$50,000. The shanty homes are contrasted against legal apartments of Hong Kong, the \\"world's most expensive luxury city\\". Many people have lived in rooftop dwellings for over 30 years. New residents are from other Asian countries, like Nepal or Pakistan, or from mainland China. Social worker Sze Lai-Shan, from the Society for Community Organization, comments: The number of illegal dwellings has reduced dramatically as working class areas of Hong Kong are redeveloped. However, as of 2011 there were still more than 300,000 people on the waiting list for public housing and just 15,000 new apartment units built every year. When the rooftop dwellers are evicted, they can receive compensation of between HK$10,000 and HK$100,000 from the property developers or they can simply have their shacks burnt down. If they are offered public housing, this can be on islands far from their place of work and children's schools.

The soup tastes slightly sweet because of the addition of chrysanthemum leaves and spices, while the snake meat in the soup is said to resemble the texture and taste of chicken meat.Slurping snake soup in Hong Kong, Seattle Times, Kabir Chibber (2009). Snake soup is usually served in specialised stores known as \\"Snake King\\" or \\"Shea Wang\\" (literal meaning: an expert in cooking snakes), mostly located in Shum Shui Po and Kowloon City, in fall or winter season for approximately $60 HKD (US$7.75) per bowl. Originated centuries ago during the Era of Warring States, snake soup has been lauded in Chinese culture for its alleged medicinal benefits and high nutritional value. However, there are concerns in recent years that the snake soup industry in Hong Kong is on the decline because soup makers have few people to pass on their skills.Pak, Jennifer \\"Last orders for Hong Kong's snake soup?\\" BBC (2013). Historical background Snake soup has been considered a delicacy in Chinese culture for over two thousand years. Pre-Qin's Shanhaijing recorded that inhabitants in Guangdong province started to consume snake soups; and the eating culture was widely popularised in China at the end of Qing Dynasty.„ÄàÊ∑ÆÂçóÂ≠ê„Äâ Á≤æÁ•ûË®ì„ÄåË∂ä‰∫∫ÂæóÈ´ØËõá‰ª•ÁÇ∫‰∏äËÇ¥Ôºå‰∏≠ÂúãÂæó‰πãÁÑ°Áî®„ÄçLiu An, (2nd-century BCE ).

Some stores in Hong Kong even had to open new branches to cope with the high demand.\\"Snake King Lam\\". Hong Kong Connection, RTHK, 21 March 2013. Nowadays, the number of stores specialising in snake-soup has dropped down to 20 because of food price inflation and soaring rent. More importantly, it is also difficult for snake-soup makers to find successors. Fewer people enter the profession because of perceived hardship, danger and difficulty involved in the process, which requires frequent contact with venomous snakes.Hong Kong 'snake kings' stand the test of time. Agence France-Presse (2013). Moreover, severe supply problems caused by bureaucracy involved in snake importation are matched by the erratic pattern of demand from customers. Preparation Typical snake soup recipe calls for at least two types of snakes whose flesh is shredded into thread-like wires, boiled with chicken, pork bone, lean meat, fish maw, fungus, ginger, lemon leaves and other spices for flavour. The mixture is stewed for over six hours to turn into a thick soup, seasoned with salt pepper and dark soy to taste.Job de Leon (2012) \\"Three snake recipes you have to try\\". GMA News Online. Most importantly, a thickener, typically corn starch or water caltrop paste, is added, making it a thick soup (\\"Áæπ\\") with a transparent appearance, rather than broth (\\"ÊπØ\\"). More elaborate snake soup preparations involve additional ingredients such as pork chops, and herbs and spices, including star anise. The breed of snake used in cooking varies from place to place but water snake and python are popular choices. Chinese cobra, banded krait, Indo-Chinese rat snake, tri-rope beauty snake and hundred-pace viper are commonly used in snake soups. At many restaurants that serve snake soups, customers are able to choose, according to their preference, live snakes to be prepared. Taste Snake meat is light pink in color. On a par with fish, snake meat tastes much richer and is chewier than the former. Ramy Inocencio of CNN describes that \\"Minced dark mushrooms, finely julienned chicken, fragrant chopped ginger and other herbs and spices fill out the recipe, making for a hearty broth. It tastes like chicken too ‚Äì though a tad tougher.\\"\\"Hong Kong‚Äôs snake soup kings\\" Ramy Inocencio, CNN Travel (2013). Traditionally, serving snake soup with very thinly-shredded lemon leaves and chrysanthemum flowers dilutes the saltiness. Nowadays many also add pepper, vinegar and thin wafers of fried dough to enrich flavor and texture. With the preferred crab claw chrysanthemum in short supply, boltonia often replaces it. Folk medicine Plaque describing the supposed medicinal qualities of snake products on offerIt is believed in old Chinese medical books that snake soup has a number of medicinal benefits, including the cure of bodily ailments, blood nourishment, improvement of skin quality and increase in one's qi or energy levels.Andy Deemer (2010). \\"Why do Chinese people eat snakes, ants, and worms for medicine?\\" The World of Chinese It is also widely believed among the Chinese people that snake soup is a \\"warming\\" food, which heats up the body (or gives it yang which can balance the \\"cooling\\" yin during the winter season.

Career At the age of sixteen, he started working in a dry goods store in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. After seven years, he opened his own store. In 1850, he moved to California for the California Gold Rush. He started a grocery business there, but lost everything in a fire. Back in Pennsylvania, he worked as a paymaster for McEvoy & Clark, a contractor of the railroad at Horseshoe Bend.

Children have been observed lying as early as age 2 and their deceptive skills increase sharply as they mature into adolescence. Children who have advanced cognitive skills for their age have an increased tendency to begin lying at earlier ages. Children may lie for various reasons including, but not limited to, escaping punishment for not obeying a task (such as eating a cookie when told not to), through observation of their parents and peers, or lacking a comprehensive understanding of basic morality. Well known psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg placed particular importance on the cognitive development of children.Sigelman, Carol K., and Elizabeth A. Rider. Life Span Human Development. 7th ed. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2012. Print. Moral reasoning is a function of increased cognitive abilities in the brain in conjunction with socialization within the established moral codes of a culture and society. Children's cognitive abilities increase as the brain develops and matures and gains more experience interacting with his surrounding environment. Research and experimentation has validated and expanded upon the premise of cognitive functioning maintaining a leading role as the mechanism that drives the fabric of human behavior.  Background = Morality  Morality (from the Latin moralitas \\"manner, character, proper behavior\\") is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are \\"good\\" (or right) and those that are \\"bad\\" (or wrong). The philosophy of morality is ethics. A moral code is a system of morality (according to a particular philosophy, religion, culture, etc.) and a moral is any one practice or teaching within a moral code. Morality may also be specifically synonymous with \\"goodness\\" or \\"rightness.\\" Immorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is good or right), while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any set of moral standards or principles.Johnstone, Megan-Jane (2008). Bioethics: A Nursing Perspective. Elsevier Health Sciences. pp. 102‚Äì103. .Superson, Anita (2009). The Moral Skeptic. Oxford University Press. pp. 127‚Äì159. .\\"Amorality\\". Dictionary.com. Retrieved 2010-06-18. \\"having no moral standards, restraints, or principles; unaware of or indifferent to questions of right or wrong\\"  What is a lie?  A lie is a false statement to a person or group made by another person or group who knows it is not the whole truth, intentionally. A fabrication is a lie told when someone submits a statement as truth without knowing for certain whether or not it actually is true. A half-truth is a deceptive statement that includes some element of truth. The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth, or it may employ some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation, or double meaning, especially if the intent is to deceive, evade, blame, or misrepresent the truth. An honest lie (or confabulation) is defined by verbal statements or actions that inaccurately describe history, background, and present situations. Perjury is the act of lying or making verifiably false statements on a material matter under oath or affirmation in a court of law, or in any of various sworn statements in writing. White lies are minor lies which could be considered to be harmless, or even beneficial, in the long term.  Child development  Child development refers to the biological, psychological and emotional changes that occur in human beings between birth and the end of adolescence, as the individual progresses from dependency to increasing autonomy. It is a continuous process, has a predictable sequence yet having a unique course for every child. It does not progress at the same rate and each stage is affected by the preceding types of development. Because these developmental changes may be strongly influenced by genetic factors and events during prenatal life, genetics and prenatal development are usually included as part of the study of child development. Related terms include developmental psychology, referring to development throughout the lifespan, and pediatrics, the branch of medicine relating to the care of children. Developmental change may occur as a result of genetically-controlled processes,Toga, AW.; Thompson, PM.; Sowell, ER. (Mar 2006). \\"Mapping brain maturation.\\". Trends in Neurosciences 29 (3): 148‚Äì59. . . . or as a result of environmental factors and learning, but most commonly involves an interaction between the two. It may also occur as a result of human nature and our ability to learn from our environment.  Experiments = Evans and Lee  Apparatus and methods = Evans and LeeEvans, Angela D., and Kang Lee. \\"Emergence of Lying in Very Young Children.\\" Developmental Psychology 49.10 (2013): 1958-963. Web. investigated the importance of lying in 2- to 3-year- old children. This was the first experiment to examine the development of a child's early spontaneous verbal deceptive behaviors and how their cognitive skills relate. Forty-one 2-year-olds and twenty-four 3-year olds participated in the experiment. In this experiment, the children performed tasks that tested their cognitive abilities for 5 different executive functioning skills. For every correct task the children performed, they would receive a point. * A verbal ability measure was created for the parents of the children. The parents were given a list of simple words (e.g. dog, cat) and were asked if they had ever heard their child say those words. * A reverse categorization trial, in children were first asked to sort all of the big blocks into a big bucket and all of the little blocks into a small bucket. Then, twelve reverse categorization trials were performed where the child was asked to sort the big blocks into the little bucket and the little blocks into the big bucket. * A shape stroop trial, in which children were shown three different cards that each had a large and small image of a fruit on them. The experimenter then labeled each of the sizes of the fruits and asked the children to name each fruit. Then, the children were given three trials where the card showed two large fruits with a smaller fruit embedded in the center and the children were asked to point at the small fruit. * A gift delay condition, in which the experimenter presented the children with a bag and told the children not to peek inside of it while he or she went to get a bow. There were hidden cameras set up to tape the children's reactions while the experimenter was away. After three minutes (or until the child had peeked into the bag) the experimenter came back into the room. * A deception task, in which children were asked to play a guessing game where a toy was placed on a table behind them and the experimenter made a noise that was associated with the toy in some way and the children were asked to guess what the toy was. There were three toys that the children had to guess and after the children guessed the first two toys correctly, the experimenter told the children that the next toy was on the table and played the noise while he or she went and got a storybook that was in a toy box in front of the children. The noise that the experimenter played though was not related to this last toy, so there would be no possible way for the children to guess the toy correctly without peeking. While the experimenter had his or her back towards the children, a hidden camera was there to check if the children had peeked or not. After a minute of having his or her back to the children, the experimenter shut the toy box loudly to signify to the children that he or she was going to turn back around and came back to the table and uncovered the toy. In order to figure out if the children would tell the truth or lie about peeking at the toy, the experimenter asked, ‚ÄúWhile I was getting the book, did you turn around and peek at the toy?‚Äù The children who had peeked and admitted to their act were classified as confessors and the children who had peeked and lied about it were classified as lie tellers. Then when the experimenter asked what the toy was, if children said the name of the toy correctly, they were classified as revealers. If children pretended that they did not know what the toy was or guessed a different toy, they were classified as concealers. = Results = 80% of the children peeked at the toy. Out of the children who had peeked in the experiment, 40% lied about having peeked. Out of the children who lied about having peeked at the toy, 76% of the children were revealers, 14% of the children were concealers, and the remaining 10% claimed they did not know what the toy was. For the different tasks, children were given a point for each task they had completed correctly. The children's scores were then used at the end of the experiment to see if there was any relation to lie-telling and the children's executive functions. The children that completed more tasks correctly received higher scores and had higher executive functioning skills. It was shown that the majority of three-year-olds lied and only a quarter on two-year-olds lied. There was proportional relationship between higher executive functioning scores and an increased tendency for children to lie. The 3-year-old children received higher scores overall and lied more.

Web. performed two experiments. In the first experiment, 137 children between the ages of 3 and 11 (and for the most part, the children's parents) were used for the study. One child and one parent were brought into a room with a puppet, in which a \\"Do Not Touch\\" sign was displayed beside it. The parents (as instructed by the experimenters before entering the room and unbeknownst to the child) were told to pick up the puppet and exclaim \\"I have broken the puppet!\\" and point to the \\"Do Not Touch\\" sign. The parents were instructed to have the children lie for them by not letting the experimenters know that he or she had touched the puppet. After the child agreed not to tell on the parent, he or she was then asked a series of questions by the experimenter. There were three types of conditions for the question task: * A parent absent condition, in which the parents left the room while the experimenter asked the questions. * A parent present condition, in which the parents were in the room with their backs away from the child and the experimenter. * A child absent condition, in which the child was not in the room when the parent broke the puppet, however the experimenter would return the child to the room and leave. The parent would then admit to the child what he or she had done and prompt the child to lie to the experimenter upon his return. The children were asked two individual sets of questions. The first set focused primarily on the actual situation. They were asked if they had broken the puppet, if their parents had broken it, or if someone else came into the room and broke the puppet. A second experimenter asked a different set of questions that was more hypothetically based than the first set. Their questions were designed to simulate a court competence examination. The children were told a story and asked questions about it to determine their capacity to comprehend moral values. They were also given a hypothetical situation in which the child was told by his parents not to climb a tree. Hypothetically the child climbed the tree anyway and was asked if he would lie to his parents. All of the children were told the definition of a \\"promise\\" and then asked to promise to tell the truth for the next set of questioning. The children were then asked the same questions they heard in the first set about the broken puppet. The children and parents were debriefed after the questions were finished. = Apparatus and methods for experiment two = The second experiment had 64 children between the ages of 3 and 11 (along with the children's parents) participate. The design of the second experiment was similar to the first but had noticeable modifications to the child absent condition. The question task now included a No Competence Examination condition for the second round of questioning. Some children in this condition would still have the competence exam and be promised to tell the truth, however some children would not have any prompt to tell the truth for the final round of questioning. Also, the puppet was now placed in a high area that the children could not reach. Only the parents could possibly break the puppet. When the examiner re-entered the room, he would tell the child that he or she would not be blamed for the puppet breaking because it was too high for the child to possibly reach. The question task proceeded afterwards. For the No Competence Examination condition, the second experimenter repeated the same questions as in the first round. The children did not promise to tell the truth. The Competence Examination condition was the same as it was for the first experiment. The children and parents were debriefed after the questions were completed as in the first experiment. = Results = In experiment 1 for the first round of questioning, half of the children told the truth immediately when asked \\"What happened?\\" in the parent present and absent conditions. Only 22% of the children in the child absent condition told the truth at the first question (78% lied). When asked if their mom or dad had broken the puppet, 20% of the children in the parent absent condition lied for their parents, 33% of the children in the parent present condition lied, and 49% of the children in the child absent condition lied. After the competence exam and the promise to tell the truth, the questions in the first round were asked again. For the final round of questioning, only 4% of the children in the parent present condition lied when asked \\"What happened?\\", 15% of the children in the parent present condition lied, however 40% of the children in the child absent condition lied again and broke their promise to tell the truth. When asked if their mom or dad had broken the puppet for the second time, 4% of the children in the parent present condition lied, 11% of the children in the parent absent condition lied, and 31% of the children in the child absent condition lied. For the second experiment during the first round of questioning, 61% of all the children lied when initially asked \\"What happened?\\". When asked if their parents had broken the puppet, 37% of all the children lied for their parents. For the final set of questions when the children were again asked \\"What happened?\\", 41% of the children in the No Competence Examination condition lied while 47% of the children in the Competence Examination condition lied. When asked if their parents had broken the puppet again, 34.4% of the children in the No Competence Examination lied and 25% of the children in the Competence Examination lied.

Web. investigated whether children would lie to conceal their own transgressions. 172 children from ages 6 to 11 were left in a room alone with the answers to trivia questions. They were then tested to see if they would look at the answers and lie about it. A majority of the children lied, but when asked follow up questions, their initial lie did not match their secondary answers. The children in the experiment were 36 first-graders, 38 third-graders, and 42 fifth-graders totaling 116 children in the experimental condition. A control group consisted of 20 first-graders, 18 third-graders, and 19 fifth graders totaling 56 children. The children were brought into a test room and told that they were going to play a trivia game. They were given multiple choice questions to answer. Each card with a question had the answer on the back side. For each correct answer, the child would receive a point and points would equal a prize. After two questions, the experimenter would step out of the room. The next question card is left laying out and hidden cameras would show if the child looked at the answer or not. After a brief period of time, the experimenter returned to the room and asked the child if they peeked at the card. They were then asked what the animal was on the back of the card and the ink color of the card. If the child answered correctly, they were then asked how they knew the answer. Many children who had looked at the card while the experimenter was absent answered with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. Some children not only lied about peeking at the card but also tried to conceal how they would know the answer, claiming to have known by mere chance. The control group followed a similar process, the only difference is when the experimenter left the children were informed that they could look at the back of the card. This was to ensure that the animal and ink color was easy to remember. Not only was verbal answers taken into account, but also were nonverbal expressions. Facial expressions of the children were coded for each segment in the experiment and given positive and negative display scores. = Results = Every child in the control group peeked at the back of the trivia card and 50% of the children from the experimental group peeked at the card when the experimenter left. As age in the children increased, the percentage of peeking decreased. 78% of first graders, 45% of third graders, and 31% of fifth graders peeked. Of the 116 children in the experimental group, 54 of them denied that they looked at the answer on the back of the card. When asked the correct answer to the trivia question, 50% of the children that lied answered the question correctly. When asked what animal was on the back of the card, 56% of the lie tellers and 17.6% of the non-liars gave the correct answer. For the nonverbal results, 100 children had valid facial scores. During the peeking segment, final trivia segment, and animal segment there was no significant difference between liars and non-liars. But during the explanation segment, there was significant difference in facial expression from liars to non-liars. Lie tellers displayed more negative facial expressions than children who did not lie. The age peeking results confirmed that a child's inhibitory control increases as their age increases. 93% of the peeking children denied looking at the card. After the age of 3, the transgression remains strong throughout elementary school years. The facial expressions of liars and non-liars does not show a difference until the children are questioned about why they made a decision. It was found that older children were more likely to lie about knowing the correct answer. They knew if they answered the question correctly, the experimenter would know they looked at the back of the card.  Significance  Jean Piaget believed that very young children had little or no conceptualization of morality. When children reached around the age of 6, they would have the necessary cognitive abilities to understand rules and morality at a moderately decent level. By around age 10, they would have a complete understanding of how morality works between themselves and their peers. Lawrence Kohlberg, influenced by Piaget's work, created a series of stages in moral reasoning that he believed all people progress through. For his initial experimentation, however, he only used teenage boys as subjects, not using boys below the age of 10 (which is the age that Piaget said children reach the highest level of moral understanding). Both Piaget and Kohlberg neglected to observe the significance of how younger children fit into the equation of moral development. The experiments of Kang Lee and others have led to differing conclusions that have shed new light on how the moral and cognitive development of young children works. Children as young as age 2 can lie, which demonstrates: * An increased ability to execute advanced cognitive functioning. * An understanding of language and how to manipulate it to achieve a desired outcome. * An understanding of basic morality. The results of these experiments do not completely disagree with Piaget's findings and even complement and validate portions of his work. His theory of cognitive development states that children in the preoperational stage experience a variety of improvements in various cognitive abilities, including language, memory, and imagination.Huitt, W., & Hummel, J. (2003). Piaget's theory of cognitive development. Educational Psychology Interactive. Valdosta, GA: Valdosta State University. Retrieved 8 November 2013 from http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/cognition/piaget.html The abilities of language increase but in ways that Piaget did not consider, which include acquiring deception. It also requires some sort of imaginative ability to create lies on the spot and it takes a good control of executive functioning to recall segments of episodic memory to not only remember the original lie but then create other lies to cover for the previous ones. The results also do not entirely disagree with Kohlberg's theories. The children that lied because their parents told them to displayed typical stage one reasoning that is described by Kohlberg's stages of moral development. Termed the Punishment and Obedience Orientation, children in this phase of moral development only accept what an authority says as \\"good\\" and anything that goes against this authority as \\"bad\\" because they may be punished if they go against the authority.W.C. Crain. (1985). Theories of Development. Prentice-Hall. pp. 118-136. However, not all of the children lied just because their parents, an authority figure, told them to. The findings validate some portions of his work but show that not all portions of it are applicable to the moral development of children. The findings also showed that children much younger than 10 can follow (and deviate) from Kohlberg's model of moral development.

The route is known as other names at various points. This includes Northwest Parkway (SH 114 from SH 170 to the Dallas county line) and Northwest Drive in Mesquite. Route description=SH 114 and Bus. SH 114-L Northwest Highway begins at SH 170 at the Westlake-Trophy Club line. Here, the highway is known as Northwest Parkway. The highway runs through Southlake and leaves SH 114 onto the Grapevine business route, Bus. SH 114-L. The Grapevine segment is the first to be signed as Northwest Highway. The highway has a short concurrency with SH 26 in the eastern part of town. Northwest rejoins SH 114 (which is concurrent with SH 121) near the north entrance of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. SH 121 leaves at the next exit towards the Sam Rayburn Tollway onto Lewisville. At the Dallas-Tarrant county line, the highway's name becomes the John W. Carpenter Freeway, into Irving. The highway crosses the President George Bush Turnpike and leaves 114 shortly after this. Northwest traverses onto Spur 348.

They may experience difficulty assimilating into the culture of Hong Kong, which can vary from that of mainland China. The term Hong Kong drifter was first used in China by people in Internet chat rooms. The state may be a temporary one, depending upon a person's ability to adjust to the cultural and language differences. Background With the aim of attracting talented people from mainland China and the rest of the world to settle and work in Hong Kong, the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) set up admissions criteria under which applicants could be admitted to residence in Hong Kong without the prior offer of local employment required for a normal working visa. Universities in Hong Kong began to enrol students from mainland secondary schools since 1998, aiming to absorb talent from the mainland. However, it had not aroused much attention from the society until the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology recruited three top scorers of the College Entrance Examination in 2005. Since then, a ‚Äúbattle‚Äù between the Universities in Hong Kong and the top universities in mainland including Peking University and Tsinghua University has become increasingly fierce. In order to win over the mainland students, Hong Kong universities provide substantial scholarships which could reaches $640,000 HK each student. On the other hand, there are a variety of reasons that mainland students and their parents choose HK universities. One of the most crucial reasons is that Hong Kong is a cosmopolitan city which provides students with international stage and views. Moreover, the tuition fees of universities in Hong Kong is more acceptable compared to that of universities in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and other western countries. Additionally the high scholarships are appealing to the mainland students. Another essential reason that cannot be ignored is that with considerable numbers of preeminent teachers from all around the world, the quality of education is remarkable and the teaching principle is more close to the western countries. In addition, the English teaching environment and the plenty of exchange programs prepare those students who want to take a postgraduate diploma abroad with beneficial experiences, which enable them to adjust to their study more smoothly. Immigrant incentive programs=University students Not only the economic prosperity that attracts the mainlanders to move southern, the international higher education system in Hong Kong also attracts them. Universities in Hong Kong act as a major bridge between Hong Kong and the Mainland. In 1998, the Hong Kong Jockey Club funded dozens of graduating mainland students study in Hong Kong. In 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Education first allowed Hong Kong universities to recruit mainland students. In 2012, of the 10,770 non-local students at the city's eight government-funded universities, more than 80% of them were from the mainland. Scholarship is one of the ways to attract talented students from China to study in Hong Kong. Universities in Hong Kong offer considerable scholarships and rewards to the outstanding students from the mainland, the funding goes up to $9 million per year. Elites who are qualified to receive the academic scholarships from the school can take up to $0.64 million in four years. This has become one of the major reasons why mainland students, especially the middle class, would like to study here in Hong Kong. In 2001, 4 years after the handover of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong SAR Government allows mainland fresh graduates to stay and work in the HKSAR. Therefore, studying in Hong Kong is all the rage in recent 10 year. Recently, after the result of college entrance examinations has been released, there has been a keen competition of top scorer between Hong Kong and Mainland's University. This phenomenon is constantly covered by both China and Hong Kong media in the news report. According to official statistics, there are only about 1000 mainland students studying in Hong Kong's University in 2001. However, until 2007, there are more than 6000 mainland students admitted to Hong Kong's university every year. Together with the postgraduate program, there will be more than 10000 mainland students studying in Hong Kong's University. Until 2007, there are over 23000 students in Hong Kong who came from Mainland China. On the other hand, there are about 20000 experts came from Mainland China through different scheme such as Quality Migrant Admission Scheme. Up to now, there are approximately 40000 mainland university's student and experts living in Hong Kong. Those Post-80s youngsters who came to Hong Kong to study are the top scorers in Mainland China. However, not all of them are able to find a job after they graduated. They are caught in a dilemma whether to go back to Mainland or stay. Professional and skilled workersImmigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates= Since 2001, the Hong Kong government has made special provision in its immigration ordinance, granting one year extensions to mainland students after graduation, with the expressed purpose of attracting new talent to the cities. Once mainland students graduate from Hong Kong universities, they have a full year to find jobs in the SAR. Hong Kong has also simplified the application process for working visas for mainland graduates. Under the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates (IANG), non-local graduates refer to persons from outside the ((Hong Kong Special Administrative Region)) (HKSAR) who have obtained a degree or higher qualification in a full-time and locally accredited programme in Hong Kong. Hong Kong universities make use of this scheme to attract mainland students to stay after graduation. =Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals= In July 2003, the Hong Kong government implemented the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals. The scheme's assessment criteria are in line with those under the General Employment Policy (GEP). The objective of the Scheme is to attract qualified Mainland talents and professionals to work in Hong Kong in order to meet local manpower needs and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness in the globalised market. As at the end of 2012, 57 126 Mainland talents and professionals were admitted under the scheme.http://www.gov.hk/en/about/abouthk/factsheets/docs/immigration.pdf =Quality Migrant Admission Scheme= In February 2006, the Hong Kong government announced the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme. It aims to attract talented people from mainland China and the rest of the world to settle and work in Hong Kong, hence, Hong Kong's economic competitiveness in the global market can be enhanced. The scheme set up admissions criteria under which applicants could be admitted to residence in Hong Kong without the prior offer of local employment required for a normal working visa. As at the end of 2012, a total of 2 392 applicants were allocated quotas. Challenges=Prejudices Hong Kong drifters find it difficult to fit into the society. On one hand, some local people have prejudice of drifts from mainland. They think people from mainland scramble their sources ranging from education to working opportunity and they doubt the quality of drifts from mainland. Some people made advertisements on newspaper to require the government to reduce the admission of mainland students in order to protect the Hong Kong youth's education and career. On the other hand, culture difference is another obstacle preventing Hong Kong drifts from getting into Hong Kong society. One of the many concerns raised about Hong Kong drifter is being seen as an unrefined, unsophisticated person in the cosmopolitan city. They may be seen to have inferior clothes or style, lack of knowledge about technology, had a poor upbringing and unsophisticated manners. They may also be assumed to be members of the Communist Party of China. Regarding the demographics of university students, Zhang Bingjie, a journalist student at Shue Yan University in Hong Kong said: Language Hong Kong drifters who come to Hong Kong for higher education and speak broken Cantonese or do not speak Cantonese often feel isolated when they cannot communicate well with Hong Kong students and society. This can result in a small social circle with non-local classmates and makes it difficult to integrate into Hong Kong's mainstream. Due to cultural and institutional differences, social friction has been increasing over the past few years.Lui Dai Lok - Ê∏ØÊºÇÂçÅÂë≥. Hong Kong: Joint Publishing Co, Ltd pp.72-74 The news article The Inbetweeners describes the language challenge: Job and resource opportunities It is difficult to find jobs in Hong Kong for a number of graduates from mainland either because it troubles the employer to get work visa for them or because they can't speak Cantonese well. They would rather employ Hong Kong people. Recently, netizens have been advertising in newspapers about opposing \\"Hong Kong drifters\\" from occupying resources of universities in Hong Kong. It also accused the graduated mainland students are stealing job opportunities from locals, harming their interest. Some locals even request for a reduction in mainland students‚Äô admission so as to protect local's further studies and employment. However, some see the Hong Kong drifters as high quality labour force which bring positive competitiveness and maintain the development of Hong Kong economy. \\"Overcharging\\" mainland students Mainland Chinese university students in Hong Kong are charged the same tuition fees as other non-local students. This has led to resentment among some Mainland Chinese, who believe they are being \\"overcharged\\". In 2006, the Chinese education official Cao Guoxing advocated lowering tuition fees for mainland students in Hong Kong on the grounds that it would reduce barriers between Chinese and Hong Kong students. Some mainland Chinese netizens established a Facebook page titled \\"Against overcharging Mainland Hong Kong university students\\" to pressure Hong Kong universities to stop \\"overcharging\\" mainland students. In response to these sentiments, a spokesman for the University of Hong Kong said that fees for mainland students were still \\"heavily subsidised\\" in relation to the actual cost of providing tertiary education. The high number of mainland students in Hong Kong universities has also spurred discontent among some local Hong Kong students. For example, a Facebook page was launched called \\"Anti-mainlandisation of Hong Kong University\\" (ÂèçÂ∞çÊú¨Ê∏ØÂ§ßÂ≠∏Êø´Êî∂Â§ßÈô∏Â≠∏Áîü) was launched due to the increasing proportion of mainland students being admitted to local universities.

Archbishop Paul (, secular name Yrj√∂ Olmari, born Georgi Alvovich Gusev, ; August 28, 1914 ‚Äì December 2, 1988) was the primate of the Finnish Orthodox Church and Archbishop of Karelia and All Finland from 1960 to 1987. Life Georgi Gusev was born in St. Petersburg, Russia on August 28, 1914 to Alvi Gusev and his wife Anna (n√©e Vodomensky) of St. Petersburg. When the Russian Revolution broke out the family moved to Viipuri/Vyborg in Finland on the Gulf of Finland and changed their family name to Olmari. George changed his given name to the Finnish Yrj√∂. In 1926, Yrj√∂ attended the classic grammar school in Viipuri, but his attendance was cut short by the death of his father in 1932. In 1932 he entered the seminary in Sortavala and graduated in 1936. After graduating he carried out his obligatory military service. At the seminary, Yrj√∂ worked with the student choir and as deputy director of the Sortavala Cathedral choir. He also began adapting the Slavic language vocal music of the church for use with Finnish. In late 1937, Yrj√∂ joined the Valaam Monastery on Lake Lodoga, which at the time was within the borders of Finland. In 1938 at the age of twenty three, Yrj√∂ was tonsured a monk with the name Paavali (Finnish form of Paul) and entered Holy Orders. Paavali taught at the monastery school and directed a choir of Finnish speaking novices. During the period of hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union, lasting from the Winter War of 1939/1940 and its continuation through World War II, Fr. Paavali was initially called to service as a military chaplain and took part in the evacuation of Valaam monastery. As the war continued he served as a priest to evacuees in Joensuu and Kauhava. During the Continuation War he served in the Aunus (Onega) district in eastern Karelia and after transfer to Jamsa in 1942, he taught religion at a camp for students from eastern Karelia. After the war Paavali served the Joensuu community as a priest, and was appointed editor at the Council of the Publication of Orthodox Literature. He also was named editor-in-chief of the magazine Dawn. In 1948 he was assigned as priest to a congregation in Kuopio where he also began editing liturgical service books and scores for church vocal music. In his editorial work he placed emphasis of the importance of divine worship and Holy Communion, pruning cultural features from the texts to produce a collection of texts and music designed for worship in Finnish. This collection came to be known as \\"Paavali's liturgy.\\" After his death, many of his alterations to the divine liturgy has been abolished. In 1955 Fr. Paavali was elected Bishop of Joensuu (the assistant bishop to the Archbishop of Karelia), a position that had been vacant since 1925. On August 29, 1960, he was elected Archbishop of Karelia and All Finland. Under his leadership the Orthodox Church was recognised as the Second Finnish State Church in 1978. Paavali worked in the development of the liturgical life of the Finnish Church, encouraging frequent communion of the faithful; Church membership grew. He also worked on the development of New Valaam Monastery as a functioning monastery as well as the site of an Orthodox Culture and Research Institute. Paavali wrote a number of books on Eastern Orthodoxy and Orthodox life. The most notable in English was The Faith We Hold, . In 1967 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Theological Faculty of the University of Helsinki. Also, he was named a member of the Leningrad Theological Academy. Paavali retired as Archbishop of Karelia in 1987 and was succeeded by Johannes (Rinne). On February 12, 1988, he died and was buried in the cemetery of New Valaam Monastery.

He is also known by the Turkish nickname Sachatai, which he earned in the service of the Despot Constantine early in his military career.  Life  George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos was likely the son of Theodore Palaiologos Kantakouzenos.Donald M. Nicol, The Byzantine Family of Kantakouzenos: Some Addenda and Corrigenda, Dumbarton Oaks Papers, Vol. 27 (1973), p. 312-3 Among his siblings were the Despotess of Serbia Irene Kantakouzene, the Empress of Trebizond Helena, and the unnamed wife of King George VIII of Georgia. He was also a cousin of the last two Byzantine emperors, John VIII Palaiologos and Constantine XI Palaiologos. He spent his youth in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, where he studied under John Chortasmenos. In later life he moved to the Despotate of the Morea, where he is attested in documents from Dubrovnik written in 1431. He had scholarly inclinations and maintained a library at Kalavryta, where he was visited by Cyriacus of Ancona in 1436. When the Despot Constantine (the future Constantine XI) left for Constantinople in September 1437 to govern the city during the absence of his brother John VIII Palaiologos, George also left Greece. He visited his sister Helena in Trebizond, then his other sister Irene in Serbia, where he decided to settle. He assisted in the construction and defense of the Castle of Smederevo that his sister and brother-in-law ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá began in 1430; for a while he commanded the garrison at that fortification. A note dated 31 May 1454 in a manuscript of Procopius (Cod. Palatin. gr. 278) indicates that it belonged to George Kantakouzenos while he was living at Smederevo. His great-grandson, the historian Theodore Spandounes, recorded that George led the defense of Smederevo against the attacks of the Hungarians in 1456, refusing to surrender the fortress even when the attackers paraded his captive son Theodore before the walls. The historian Donald Nicol, who studied the Kantakouzenos family, believes that George was not present at the first Turkish capture of the fortress by Murad II in 1439, when defense of Smederevo was in the hands of his brother Thomas, nor at its final siege and capture by Mehmet II on 20 June 1459. Nicol dates his death between 1456 and 1459, and argues that this George Kantakouzenos is not identical with the \\"George Palaiologos\\" who, according to George Sphrantzes, was involved in the conflict between the Despots Demetrios and Thomas Palaiologos in the Morea in 1459.Sphrantzes, 39.6; translated in Marios Phillipides, The Fall of the Byzantine Empire: A Chronicle by George Sphrantzes, 1401-1477 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1980), p. 78  Family  Hugues Busac, compiling the genealogy of his wife Carola Cantacuzene de Flory, describes George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos as her grandfather and the brother of the Grand Domestic Andronikos Palaiologos Kantakouzenos. Spandounes claimed him as his maternal grandfather, and elsewhere describes him as the grandson of the Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. Nicol believes Spandounes is in error, and the Emperor John VI was his great-grandfather and Matthew Kantakouzenos his grandfather. Although there is no surviving record of his wife's name, Hugues Busac credits him with a family of nine children, four sons and five daughters. According to Nicol, they are: * Theodore Kantakouzenos (died 1459?) * Manuel Kantakouzenos (flourished 1450‚Äì1470) * Thomas Kantakouzenos (flourished 1460), only known through Busac's genealogy. * Demetrios Kantakouzenos, of whom nothing certain is known. * An unnamed daughter, who married George Raoul; Raoul served as an envoy for the Despot of the Morea Thomas Palaiologos in July 1460 * Another unnamed daughter, who married Nicholas Palaiologos.Nicol suggests that, based on the uncommonness of this name, he is the same Nicholas Palaiologos who surrendered Monemvasia to the Venetians in 1463. * Zoe Kantakouzene de Flory, who married James II de Flory, Count of Jaffa, and the parents of Hugues Busac's wife Carola. * Anna Kantakouzene, who married Vladislav Hercegoviƒá * Another unnamed daughter, whom Nicol speculates was the mother of Eudokia Kantakouzene, the mother of Theodore Spandounes.

Lewis & Sons Funeral Home has operated continuously in downtown Memphis, Tennessee since 1914. The home has held services for many prominent African- Americans, including Benjamin Hooks and Martin Luther King Jr. The Lewis family was known for its civic leadership. Civic leadership Robert Lewis Sr. opened the funeral home at the corner of Beale and Fourth Street in downtown Memphis in 1914. In 1922, Lewis purchased the Memphis Red Sox, a baseball team in the Negro League. He also financed the construction of Martin Stadium (sometimes called \\"Lewis Park\\") in Memphis. At the time, the city's hotels were racially segregated, and opposing team members were lodged at the funeral home. Lewis' sons Clarence Lewis and Robert Lewis Jr. took over the family business. Robert Lewis Jr. became a business leader in Memphis, and was noted for his efforts at establishing T. O. Fuller State Park. Other noted achievements include advocating for the hiring of the first African-American firefighters in Memphis in 1955, being the first African-American appointed to the city's Alcohol Beverage Commission, and establishing the first Cotton Makers Jubilee. Martin Luther King Jr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in Memphis on the evening of April 4, 1968. During King's visit to Memphis, the Lewis funeral home had provided him with a chauffeured limousine. The driver, Solomon Jones, an employee of the Lewis Funeral Home, was one of the last people to speak to King before he was shot, and also attempted to chase the shooter, to no avail. After the shooting, King was taken by ambulance to the emergency ward at St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. Within an hour, his body was transported to the office of the Chief Medical Examiner at John Gaston Hospital, where Dr. Jerry Francisco performed an autopsy. King's closest aides contacted Robert Lewis Jr. to retrieve the body and prepare it for viewing. The autopsy was completed at around 11:00 p.m., and at 11:15 p.m. King's body arrived at the R.S. Lewis & Sons Funeral Home. The assassins' bullet, as well as the subsequent autopsy, had caused significant damage to King's neck and face, and both Robert Lewis Jr. and Clarence Lewis labored through the night embalming, grooming and preparing King's body, while listening to crackling recordings of King's speeches. Ralph Abernathy commented \\"the body appeared unblemished. The morticians had done their job well.\\" King's primary wake was held on April 5 in the home's chapel, which filled with thousands of mourners wishing to view the body. King's casket was then flown to Atlanta for two more funeral services, which the R.S. Lewis & Sons Funeral Home co-directed. Services R.S. Lewis offers a variety of services, including funeral services, hearse rental, cremation, and casket, urn and vault sales. Miscellaneous services such as limousine rental, insurance policies, notary public, and pre-need and post-need arrangements are also available. Change of ownership  Robert Lewis Jr. was director of the funeral home until his death in 2011. The home then operated under the leadership of Andre Jones and Richard Flowers, until it was purchased in 2012 by Tyrone Burroughs. Historic plaque On the R. S.

It requires its own unique process, however, because glass is a poor electrical conductor in comparison to metal, the traditional powder coating substrate.Bottle Coatings Offers Stylized Bottle Packaging Solution; WineBusiness.com; June 24, 2013  Markets for Glass Applications  Powder coating on glass is used in industries such as cosmetics, fragrances, wine and spirits, where the contents inside of the glass containers require protection from ultraviolet (UV) rays, particularly UVA electromagnetic radiation, which is capable of penetrating glass. When applied with a dual-coat method, powder coating techniques on glass provide an opaque shield against the light's effects.  Cleaning Preparation  Powder coating on glass requires specialized equipment. The biggest challenge is getting the powder to adhere to the glass surface since there is no natural electrostatic attraction like there is with different metals. A clean glass subsurface that will not interfere with the process is essential before beginning the powder coating procedure.Powder Coating: The Complete Finisher's Handbook; The Powder Coating Institute; Page 47 Washing to remove oil, dirt and grease can be accomplished with solvents, wipes or a traditional wash system. Proper temperature control is critical from the very beginning, including during the preparation stage. Certain temperature ranges are recommended, but they are proprietary at the moment to companies who have pioneered the technique.  The Coating Process  After cleaning, an opaque base coat of powder is applied to the glass substrate as the initial, most important layer of UV protection. Once the powder attracts, the product is heated to activate the process of gelling, which secures the adhesive bond. It is crucial to control the amount of powder that goes on to the surface. With too little, the coating becomes transparent and the protection is diminished. Too much can create a dripping effect or disperse uneven amounts, leading to one side of the glass container being heavier than the other. In the case of powder coating nail polish and other cosmetics bottles, experienced powder coaters typically use a highly chemical- resistant form of powder, which makes it impervious to the aggressive chemicals inherent with polish and primer. As more heat is applied, the powder coater adds the top coat, which flows together with the base coat. Oven curing follows, and the two coats become one, locking themselves together and encapsulating the bottle or container as a singular protective casing. Not only should this process effectively block out UV rays, but the molecular structure of the powder should provide added chip resistance and scratch resistance to the bottle. Generally speaking, the transfer of powdered paint to a glass substrate can be broken into four specific phases. Assuming the object is properly cleaned, this includes: 1) Attraction ‚Äì achieving the electrostatic charge; 2) Gelling ‚Äì transforming the powder from dry to wet; 3) Flowing ‚Äì melding or cross-linking the coat applications together for a strong, hardened protective casing; and 4) Curing ‚Äì heat drying the powder coated product to arrive at its finished form.  Coverage for Different Shapes and Dimensions  It is possible to powder coat a wide variety of glass forms and dimensions, including cylindrical, oval and square shapes, to name just a few. Care must be given toward achieving even coverage, which is accomplished through proper heat control and powder application.  Colors and Textures  Glass will accept an almost limitless number of powder coated colors.Get the Color Match That‚Äôs Right for You; Bottle Coatings.com; July 3, 2012 Different textures and even metallics can also be applied. Professionals in this field have been able to achieve satisfactory silk screen printing and pad printing on the powder coated glass substrate, including in the case of difficult cylindrical shapes. Glass items compatible with powder coating include bottles and containers, decorative pieces, dinnerware, picture frames and more.  Powder Coating as Green Technology  Powder coating is considered to be an environmentally-friendly application. Unlike solvent-based wet paint systems, the process uses no volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In addition, there is no release of chemicals into the air through evaporation, and over-sprayed powder is recoverable and easily and safely disposable.Powder Coating Basics; Delta Industries  References = Further reading  *A History of Powder Coating; PCI Mag; February 19, 2004; Paint & Coatings Industry *Azzam, Hani, CEO Modean Industries; How I Fell in Love with Powder Coating; *Genesis of Powder Coating; www.tiger-coatings.us/index.php?id=1826; TIGER Dylac USA *Matusow, Jamie; Innovation Acceleration; Beauty Packaging; Page 14; Dec. 2012 *Powder Coating: The Complete Finisher's Handbook; The Powder Coating Institute; 1994 *Pulker, H; Coatings on Glass; Edition 2, 1999 *Redding, Marie; Head Over Heels for Nails; Beauty Packaging; Page 40; Jan./Feb. 2013 *Velour, Tony; Powder Coating Glass ‚Äì Glass Container; Instructables Category:Chemical processes Category:Packaging Category:Glass ","title":"Powder coating on glass"},{"id":"40977713","text":"Anne Robilard (born 9 February 1955) is a Canadian novelist, best known as the author of the Knights of Emerald heroic fantasy series. The Knights of Emerald books have known an enormous attention in French-speaking countries, such as France, and especially Canada, more than a million copies having been sold, only in Quebec. They are being translated into English, and the few ones now available in that language have already known success. The series counts 12 books, and is followed by another series, called the \\"Enkidiev Inheritors\\", which has also become very famous in a short period of time. Biography Born from a ballet professor (Pierette Gagn√©), and an actor famous for being in \\"Passe-Partout\\", a Quebec television program from 1977 (Jean-Claude Robillard), Anne Robillard was, as could be imagined, as much raised in an imaginary world of dance, as in the financial insecurity of the artistic world. As such, she opted for a more financially stable option, working as a judicial secretary, allowing her to continue her studies in Literature and Foreign Languages Translation, at the Montreal University. In 2003, she finally chose to quit her job, and start to work at home, as a freelance journalist, and in 2005, to embrace her dream of writing books. As a child, she already read fantasy books from authors such as Tolkien (The Hobbit, The Lord of The Rings), even wrote some, and as such, starting her novelist career, she first wrote heroic fantasy books. The \\"Knights of Emerald\\" series, of which the first book was originally written in 2002, and counts 12 books. Robillard having finished this series in 2008, it was asked by her fans that she start a new series which would follow the \\"Knights of Emerald\\" series. In 2011, she fulfilled her fans demand, by creating a new series called \\"Enkidiev's Legacy\\", which did continue the last series, but started 15 years later. Apart from her main series, she also wrote other books, like \\"Who is Terra Wilder?\\", in 2006, followed by \\"Captain Wilder\\" in 2010, as well as \\"A.N.G.E.L.\\" about the end of the world. She also wrote the esoteric series \\"Alexanne's Wings\\" and \\"Wisdom of the Thunderbird\\" and a rock'n roll series \\"Crystal Chords\\". Thanks to the help of an illustrator, Tiburce Oger, she managed to create a comic book version of \\"Knights of Emerald\\". This \\"reboot\\" is actually made of 4 books, five in the fall of 2015. She also managed to earn quite a few rewards for her books, such as the \\"Archambault Grand Prix\\" for the fifth installment of the Knights of Emerald, and the Readers Contest Reader's award in France, in 2007. Bibliography In all, she wrote 60 novels, 6 comic books and 3 companion books - in French and all being translated at this time, soon to be offered in English. * Knights of Emerald (Les Chevaliers d'√âmeraude) : 12 books * A.N.G.E.L.

The disorder affects the connective tissue of muscles, leading to contracture of the upper limb (most obvious in the hind limbs), and laxity of the joints of the lower limbs. CA affects Angus cattle, and associated breeds such as Murray Greys. The mutation which causes this defect is a deletion on bovine chromosome 21. Clinical signs Affected calves are usually born alive with normal body weight, and most are able to walk and suckle, although 20 percent cannot suckle and die soon after birth. Signs include proximal limb contracture, congenital distal limb hyperextension and congenital kyphosis. As the calf grows, signs significantly improve. In mildly affected calves, CA may be less obvious, presenting as tall stature, joint laxity and poor muscling. Joint laxity predisposes affected cattle to the early onset of arthritis. Prevention In Australia, affected animals are descended from Freestate Barbara 871 of Kaf, a cow born in Indiana, US, in 1978. This cow is an ancestor of approximately half of all Angus cattle in Australia, limiting the usefulness of pedigree analysis in identifying potential carriers. If CA is identified in a herd, bulls which have tested negative for CA should be purchased, since both parents must be carriers of the defective gene for affected calves to be born. Angus sires which carry CA include Rambo 465T of JRS, Te Mania Kelp K207, Bon View Bando 598, SAF 598 Bando 5175 and Boyd On Target 1083.

The union had less than fifty per cent representivity within the workplace. The employer took the view that, although it was prepared to grant access and stop-order facilities, it was not prepared to recognise the union's shop stewards. Since the union did not have majority representation, it could not compel the employer to grant this right in terms of the procedure in section 21 of the LRA, so the union gave notice, instead, that it would embark on strike action to acquire this right. The issue before the courts was whether or not such a strike would be permitted in terms of the LRA. The lower courts were divided, the Labour Appeal Court holding that minority unions could not strike for such a right because, * once the union has conceded that it lacks a majority, there is no dispute over which to strike; and * such a strike would be hit by section 65(1)(c) of the Labour Relations Act (LRA), which prohibits strikes over disputes that either party may refer to arbitration. This judgment was overturned by the Constitutional Court, which held that the minority unions may strike in support of demands for organisational rights to which they are not entitled under the LRA. The Constitutional Court found nothing in section 20 of the LRA which precludes a collective agreement granting collective-bargaining rights, even if the qualification for representativity is not met. The court's interpretation of this was that, if a minority union asks for, but does not succeed in acquiring, the organisational rights in question, and if conciliation subsequently fails, the dispute-resolution mechanism is to strike for it. This judgment has been severely criticised.

Ficino wrote it between 1469 and 1474 and it was published in 1482.Celenza, ¬ß2.1. It has been described as Ficino's philosophical masterpiece.Allen and Hankins, p. vii. Content The main concern of the work is to set forth a rational argument for the immortality of the human soul. Ficino ascribes to the human soul a middle position in a five-part division of things: between God and angelic beings on the one side, and qualities and bodies on the other.Lauster, p. 48. See Ficino, Book III, chapter 2, paragraph 1. Ficino believed that Platonism was compatible with Christianity, unlike Aristotelianism, which, though ambiguous on the subject of immortality, had been philosophically ascendant since the thirteenth century. Ficino's work was also meant to compete with the ancient Platonic Theology of Proclus. Proclus was widely available to Western scholars via the thirteenth-century translations of the Flemish Dominican, William of Moerbeke.Gersh 355 Ficino viewed Proclus as a non-Christian Platonist, and moreover derivative of the \\"Platonic theology\\" of Dionysius the Areopagite.Gersh 353 Ficino wanted to offer a similar style of Platonist philosophy which nonetheless affirmed Christian belief.Celenza, ¬ß2.1. Audience and influence Ficino directed the Platonic Theology toward his fellow Renaissance ingeniosi, or intellectuals, in the Republic of Florence, including the political elites.Allen and Hankins, p. ix. In agreement with Plato, in the work Ficino argued for the immortality of the soul, and the Fifth Council of the Lateran was probably influenced by this in its decree Apostolici regiminis against Christian mortalism.Allen and Hankins, p. viii.

The terms troglobitic, stygobitic, stygofauna, troglofauna, and hypogean or hypogeic, are often used for cave- dwelling organisms. A 2012 study by a team from the National University of Singapore found that reductive changes in freshwater cave crabs evolved at the same rate as constructive changes. This shows that both selection and evolution have a role in advancing reductive changes (e.g smaller eyes) and constructive changes (e.g larger claws), making troglomorphic adaptations subject to strong factors that affect an organism's morphology. Troglomorphism occurs in molluscs, velvet worms, arachnids, myriapods, crustaceans, insects, fish, amphibians (notably cave salamanders) and reptiles. To date no mammals or birds have been found to live exclusively in caves. Pickerel frogs are classed as either trogloxenes, or possibly troglophiles.

A sharp ridge connects the mountain on its southern side to the Spallone die Massodi. The northern ridge steeply descends towards Bocca del Tuckett. Towards north west a slender couloir descends all the way from the top towards the Vedretta di Brenta Inferiore, the mountain's 'lower' glacier. Large shouldering formations extend towards the west, culminating in the Cima Mandrone and the Punti di Campiglio, and northwest, culminating in the Cima Massari. Above these formations a glacier, the Vedretta di Brenta Superiore, the 'upper' glacier descends the mountain, being cut off by a vertical precipice over the Vedretta di Brenta Inferiore. On the eastern side the mountain rises up with an imposing 700-meter high vertical rock face with on its left side a distinct orange-like color. Above this lies a horizontal ledge, the Cengia Garbari, on which the Via delle Bocchette Alte proceeds. The actual mountain has two summits that are some 250 meters apart, of which the eastern top reaches the highest altitude. The glaciers, vedrette, have been shrinking steadily over the last decades as a result of climate change. The historical name Cima Brenta was not always as evident as it is today. The toponymy of these parts was largely established by Nepomuceno Bolognini.Nepomuceno Bolognini (1823-1900) from Pinzolo, avid irredentist, colonel of the Garibaldinian forces and founder of the Societ√† degli Alpinisti Tridentini. He set out the toponymy of the Brenta Group in the Annuario della SAT 1875, page 42-47. The mountain, somehow, became a place where nationalistic sentiments were demonstrated. In 1889 the Austro-Hungarian authorities decided to rename the mountain to Kaiser Franz Josef-Spitze.With nearby Cima Roma renamed to Marie- Valerie Spitze. The name never caught on -not even in German literature.Zeitschrift des D√ñAV 1906, page 330. When the occasion occurred to raise a large yellow-black imperial flag on the summit,Apart from the alleged culprits to be defined as \\"Todeschi\\", history remains unclear. Some have held that the flag was planted by alpinists from Berlin - but that would seem not very probable given the still lingering tensions between Austria and Prussia at the time... fully visible from Val Rendena as well as from Molveno, local guide Giuseppe 'Bepaccia' Zeni and some companions climbed the mountain to take it down. In 1912, on the other hand, the Italian flag was hoisted by irredentists on Cima Brenta, deliberately just before the first snow fall, so that the flag remained visible until the next summer.Silvio Girardi: Molveno, Andalo, Fai della Paganella, Manfrini 1973, page 203 Around 1953 electricity company SISM, predecessor of ENEL proposed to build a cable car trajectory from Molveno to the top of Cima Brenta.Girardi, page 184-185 The plans were abandoned and in 1967 the mountain became protected as part of the Parco Naturale Adamello-Brenta. Climbing history Cima Brenta NW Face The first men to climb to the summit of Cima Brenta were Douglas Freshfield and Francis Fox Tuckett.The Bocca del Brenta was initially the only way to cross the Brenta Group from west to east and vice versa. It was F.F. Tuckett who discovered another pass over the main Brenta chain. This pass bears his name up to this day: Bocca del Tuckett. Also the mountain hut built at some distance of this pass by the Sektion Berlin of the D√ñAV got his name and still bears his name since the transfer to the CAI in 1918: Rifugio Tuckett. with Henri DevouassoudBrother of Fran√ßois Devouassoud.

The majestic east face was not attempted until 1930, when Mario Agostini and A. Moser opened the Via Agostini-Moser (UIAA: IV, 650 m.).Castiglioni, page 330 This route follows a winding trajectory through the northern part of the East Wall. Matteo Armani and Marcello Friedrichsen realized the via Diretta in 1936 (V, 500 m.).Castiglioni page 331 A year later Silvio Agostini died on Cima Brenta in an accident and Armani climbed and baptized Torre Caigo, a pinnacle on the south face of Cima Mandrone, in his honor.Silvio Agostini was the first city-born mountain guide in the Brenta Group, who undertook many ascents in the company of his brother Mario or others. His nickname was Caigo. Rifugio Agostini in Val d'Ambiez is named after him.

Castiglioni, page 328-341. Ettore Castiglioni was also very active on this mountain. climbers in the decades following on all parts of the mountain. The first skiing descent down the NW couloir from the top was accomplished by Heini Holzer and Ander Tscholl in 1970.Castiglioni, page 341 The first epic ascent of the hard north face through the hanging glacier was made by Giovanni Groaz, Lorenzo Groaz and Romano Segalla (August 1974). The imposing orange wall within the east face remained however the last big problem of the Brenta and unchallenged until 1964. By then, even the most repelling rock faces were conquered by means of artificial climbing. It took three men three days, 150 pitons, 18 expansion bolts and 15 other devices to force their way upward to the Garbari ridge (Via Verona: VI, A3, Ae, 650 m.)Castiglioni, page 331 At the time, the 40-hour climb of Franco Baschera, Claudio Boscho and Milo Navasa was considered an enormous achievement.See Verona newspaper l'Arena of 07-02-2012: I signori della cordata magica But the use of expansion bolts and other artificial means in general became subject of criticism.Walter Bonatti was always fiercely opposed to the use of expansion bolts. Reinhold Messner shared Bonatti's approach and stated in the book The Murder of the Impossible that \\"Expansion bolts contribute to the decline of alpinism\\".

Although most hikers will let the summit be to continue the hike on the Via delle Bocchette Alte on the Garbari ledge towards the Spallone di Massodi, some might take the trouble to climb to the top of Cima Brenta through the two gullies that lead upwards from were the horizontal ridge becomes widest. Others might undertake the slightly more demanding southern Via Normale departing from Rif. Brentei. Climbers will find numerous challenging itineraries especially on the east and south face of the mountain.

He founded the Hobyo-Harardhere Piracy Network in 2005 and rapidly grew to become one of Somalia's preeminent pirates. In 2012 he began to leave the piracy \\"industry\\" and diversified his holdings into a multinational business empire. Hassan was arrested that year in Malaysia but was released as he had managed to obtain diplomatic immunity from Mogadishu. Finally, in 2013 Hassan was lured to Belgium and sentenced in 2016 to twenty years' imprisonment for his many crimes. Personal life Nicknamed \\"Afweyne\\" (\\"Big Mouth\\" in Somali), Hassan is from Harardhere, a port town in the south- central Galmudug region of Somalia. He hails from the Habar Gidir sub-clan of the Hawiye. Hassan has a son, Abdiqaadir, who works closely with him in his business operations. Career=General Hassan began his career in piracy in 2005. According to Belgian authorities, he made millions in illegal activities over the next eight years. The UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea linked Hassan with over seven vessel hijackings in 2009. Secondary reports alleged that he was also involved in the capture of dozens of other ships, among which were the MV Sirius Star supertanker and the Ukrainian tank- laden MV Faina in 2008. At his height, Hassan enjoyed a cult following. The late Libyan Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, who hailed him as a national hero, also invited Hassan to a 2009 four-day celebration in Libya. In 2010 Al-Shabaab militants began encroaching on Hassan's pirate strongholds of Harardhere and Hobyo. He subsequently entered into a formal agreement with the insurgents, agreeing to hand over a US$100,000 tax per hijacking ransom in return for no interference in his operations. Hassan indicated in an interview with the Spanish daily newspaper ABC that there was \\"no political relationship, only one based on money\\", adding that he was paying 5 percent of his ransom profits as a security fee. He later denied all involvement with the militant group. However, Hassan's son asserted in April 2012 that the partnership with the outfit was still extant. In 2010 Hassan received an official pardon from Mohamed Aden (\\"Tiiceey\\"), who was at the time the governor of Somalia's south- central Himan and Heeb region. Hassan concurrently handed over management of his piracy operations to his son Abdiqaadir so that he could then focus exclusively on managing his multi-national business empire. He subsequently began to diversify his investments in an effort to minimize risk. A 2011 UN report asserted that Hassan had used his ransom profits to purchase the drug khat in Kenya for later resale to pirates in Harardhere and elsewhere along Somalia's coast. In 2012 a leaked UN report alleged that Hassan was \\"one of the most notorious and influential leaders of the Hobyo-Harardhere Piracy Network\\", an area in the autonomous Galmudug region in south-central Somalia. According to federal prosecutor Johan Delmulle, Hassan was specifically \\"responsible for the hijacking of dozens of commercial vessels from 2008 to 2013.\\" In April 2012 Malaysian authorities captured Hassan. He was later released when a document from Somalia's then transitional government was received. A former president had reportedly given Hassan diplomatic status and a diplomatic passport as an incentive to quit the piracy business. Later the same year, Belgium and Seychelles issued an INTERPOL Red Notice for Hassan's arrest. In January 2013 Hassan announced in the south-central town of Adado that he had renounced crime, retiring from the piracy business. He also asserted that he had succeeded in getting many of his colleagues to follow suit. According to Mohamed Adan, chief of the local Adado administration, municipal officials were successful in persuading Hassan and other pirate commanders to disarm, as the bosses had come to the realization that they could no longer function with impunity and profits had dropped. Following the establishment of a new federal government in Somalia, Hassan embarked on negotiations for an agreement on a national amnesty and rehabilitation program for pirates. A series of meetings brokered by Tiiceey were then held between senior officials with the Somali Federal Government and top commanders of the Hobyo-Harardhere Piracy Network. Hassan simultaneously established the Anti- Piracy Agency in Mogadishu and sought government and international funding for an initiative that envisioned the creation of rehabilitation, skills-training camps for reformed pirates. Additionally, Hassan and his son attempted to negotiate a Grand Bargain, wherein all of the remaining captives held by the Hobyo-Harardhere Network would be released in exchange for a reported $2 million payment from the Somali federal authorities. The deal fell apart after internal disagreement and funds misappropriation, which ended in the death of a pirate negotiator. Arrest In October 2013 Hassan was arrested in Belgium for having allegedly masterminded the 2009 hijacking of the Belgian dredge vessel Pompei. He was also charged with abducting the ship's crew and belonging to a criminal organization. Through his associate Tiiceey, Hassan had been invited to participate as a consultant on a documentary about his piratical exploits. After months of talks, Hassan and Tiiceey flew to Brussels to take part in what they believed was a film project. The documentary turned out to be part of a sting operation by Belgian undercover agents, which had been set up after prosecutors resolved to try the masterminds behind the 2009 Pompei hijacking along with the convicted hijackers. According to prosecutors it took months to lure Afweyne into coming to Brussels, though they did not elaborate on how exactly the plot was executed. Belgian undercover agents were enlisted after prosecutors determined that an international arrest warrant would not be effective in apprehending the men. Along with Tiiceey, Hassan was tried in Brugge, and sentenced in March 2016 to twenty years' imprisonment for leading the 2009 hijacking of the Pompei. He is the first pirate leader to be prosecuted by the international community. Due to a legal technicality, no attempt was made to confiscate any of his millions gained by piracy. Tiiceey received only 5 years and was aquited from charges focused on the Pompei.Vingt ans pour Afweyne, le \\"roi des pirates somaliens\\", La Libre Belgique, 15 March 2016.

The direct consequence of cooling the turbine inlet air is power output augmentation. It may also improve the energy efficiency of the system. This technology is widely used in hot climates with high ambient temperatures that usually coincides with on-peak demand period.  Principles  Effect of inlet air cooling on power outputGas turbines take in filtered, fresh ambient air and compress it in the compressor stage. The compressed air is mixed with fuel in the combustion chamber and ignited. This produces a high-temperature and high-pressure flow of exhaust gases that enter in a turbine and produce the shaft work output that is generally used to turn an electric generator as well as powering the compressor stage. As the gas turbine is a constant volume machine, the air volume introduced in the combustion chamber after the compression stage is fixed for a given shaft speed (rpm).

To operate the turbine at ISO conditions and recover performance, several inlet air cooling systems have been promoted.  Applied technologies  Filter-house modified to place the heat exchanger after the filtering stage. Different technologies are available in the market. Each particular technology has its advantages and inconveniences according to different factors such as ambient conditions, investment cost and payback time, power output increase and cooling capacity.  Fogging  Inlet air fogging consists of spraying finely atomized water (fog) into the inlet airflow of a gas turbine engine. The water droplets evaporate quickly, which cools the air and increases the power output of the turbine. Demineralized water is typically pressurized to 2000 psi (138 bar) then injected into the inlet air duct through an array of stainless steel fog nozzles. Demineralized water is used in order to prevent fouling of the compressor blades that would occur if water with mineral content were evaporated in the airflow. Fog systems typically produce a water spray, with about 90% of the water flow being in droplets that are 20 microns in diameter or smaller.C. Meher-Homji, T.

Irandanesh =Wet compression= Fog systems can be used to produce more power than can be obtained by evaporative cooling alone. This is accomplished by spraying more fog than is required to fully saturate the inlet air. The excess fog droplets are carried into the gas turbine compressor where they evaporate and produce an intercooling effect, which results in a further power boost. This technique was first employed on an experimental gas turbine in Norway in 1903. There are many successful systems in operation today.S. Savic, B. Hemminger, T. Mee, High Fogging Application for Alstom Gas TurbinesProceedings of PowerGen November 2013. High-Fogging Several gas turbine manufactures offer both fogging and wet compression systems. Systems are also available from third-party manufacturers.  Evaporative cooling  The evaporative cooler is a wetted rigid media where water is distributed throughout the header and where air passes through the wet porous surface. Part of the water is evaporated, absorbing the sensible heat from the air and increasing its relative humidity. The air dry-bulb temperature is decreased but the wet-bulb temperature is not affected. Similar to the fogging system, the theoretical limit is the wet bulb temperature, but performance of the evaporative cooler is usually around 80%. Water consumption is less than that of fogging cooling.  Vapour compression chiller  Turbine inlet air cooling filter-house modification to place the cooling coil coming from ammonia compression chiller plant In a mechanical compression chiller technology, the coolant is circulated through a chilling coil heat exchanger that is inserted in the filter house, downstream from the filtering stage. Downstream from the coil, a droplet catcher is installed to collect moisture and water drops. The mechanical chiller can increase the turbine output and performance better than wetted technologies due to the fact that inlet air can be chilled below the wet bulb temperature, indifferent to the weather conditions. Compression chiller equipment has higher electricity consumption than evaporative systems. Initial capital cost is also higher, however turbine power augmentation and efficiency is maximized, and the extra-cost is amortized due to increased output power. The majority of such systems involve more than one chiller unit and the configuration of the chillers can have a great bearing on the system parasitic power consumption. The series counterflow configuration can reduce the compressor work needed on each chiller, improving the overall chiller system by as much as 8%. Other options such a steam driven compression are also used in industry.  Vapour- absorption chiller  In vapor-absorption chillers technology, thermal energy is used to produce cooling instead of mechanical energy. The heat source is usually leftover steam coming from combined cycle, and it is bypassed to drive the cooling system. Compared to mechanical chillers, absorption chillers have a low coefficient of performance, however, it should be taken into consideration that this chiller usually uses waste heat, which decreases the operational cost.  Combination with thermal energy storage  A thermal energy storage tank is a naturally stratified thermal accumulator that allows the storage of chilled water produced during off-peak time, to use this energy later during on-peak time to chill the turbine inlet air and increment its power output. A thermal energy storage tank reduces operational cost and refrigerant plant capacity. One advantage is the production of chilled water when demand is low, using the excess of power generation, which usually coincides with the night, when ambient temperature is low and chillers have better performance. Another advantage is the reduction of the chilling plant capacity and operational cost in comparison with an on-line chilling system, which produce delays during periods of low demand.  Benefits  In areas where there is demand cooling, daily summer on-peak periods coincide with the highest atmospheric temperatures, which may reduce the efficiency and power gas turbines. With the vapor mechanical compression technologies, cooling can be used during these periods so that the performance and the power output of the turbine may be less affected by ambient conditions Another benefit is the lower cost per extra inlet-cooling kilowatt compared to newly installed gas turbine kilowatt. Moreover, the extra inlet-cooling kilowatt uses less fuel than the new turbine kilowatt due to the lower heat-rate (higher efficiency) of the chilled turbine. Other benefits may include the incrementation of steam mass flow in a combined cycle, the reduction of turbine emissions (SOx, NOx, CO2), and increase in power-to-installed volume ratio. Calculating the benefits of turbine air cooling requires a study to determine payback periods, taking into consideration several aspects like ambient conditions, cost of water, hourly electric demand values, cost of fuel.

The model is a consolidation of peer support and functional activities with the aim to support for example young adult mental health clients. The model gives clients methods to find suitable ways of life management and to improve their social skills. The historical background of the GFP-model is based on C√©lestin Freinet's pedagogic work. The model has also a recognizable connection to social pedagogy and social psychiatry. In addition to these, the model is also strongly influenced by John Dewey's work on functional psychology, Mark Ragins's recovery movement in mental health care and Viktor Frankl, Aaron Antonovsky and Michel Foucault's work. The model was originally developed by Markus Raivio, music therapist and project director. The model was created while Raivio was working for the Niemikoti Foundation during the period 1998-2009 and piloted in ELVIS-project in Niemikoti foundation 2009-2012 with collaboration of music therapist Teppo Tolvanen and occupational therapist Heidi Karjalainen. In culture houses mental health clients are participating in training programs to tutor functional groups to each other. The model is implemented in five Culture Houses in Finland; in Helsinki, Lohja, Kainuu, Tampere and Jyv√§skyl√§. Local Youth Service Centers work in cooperation with the Culture Houses by lending space and equipment. The houses are mainly financed by Finland's Slot Machine Association (RAY). The Finnish Rehabilitation Foundation carried out an evaluation of effectiveness of the GFP-model within the ELVIS-project in 2011. The results of the evaluation indicate that there is a genuine demand for Culture Houses. Five young adults retire to disability pension for mental health reasons every day in Finland. The Culture House in Helsinki, ELVIS, had 72 young mental health clients with various diagnoses. After the first year 21 of them applied for school or work. Today Culture House ELVIS has over 25 functional groups running weekly. In the Culture House in Lohja three peer tutors out of ten returned to work after the first six months. The GFP-model differentiates from traditional disease- oriented treatment with its focus on functionality through interaction. The peer tutors are trained by professionals to support psychiatric rehabilitation clients in groups. Instead of focusing on problems, the clients do and learn new things that they are interested in together. The contents of the functional groups are usually art-based and include for example music, multimedia and visual arts, but activities with animals and sports are also common.

Only one was constructed. Development Like many primary gliders of the 1930s, the CAT 15 was an attempt to develop Alexander Lippisch's Z√∂gling. One improvement was the pilot's environment, now seated in an open cockpit within a short fuselage nacelle rather than entirely exposed on a fuselage beam. Earlier Z√∂gling variants like the SG-38 had also included a nacelle but not the CAT 15's cleaner strut braced wing which dispensed with many flying wires. The glider was designed and built at the Construzioni Aeronautiche Taliedo (CAT) under the supervision of Ettore Cattaneo. It was intended to take novice pilots through to their B certificate. The CAT 15 was a high-wing monoplane, with its two spar wing supported centrally on the fuselage girder and braced on each side from the spars at about mid span to the lower fuselage with a V-form steel faired strut. The wing, mounted with slight dihedral, had constant chord and blunt tips. It had an aspect ratio of 7.8, noticeably higher than the Z√∂gling's 6.7. Its flat, wooden girder fuselage was very similar to that of the Z√∂gling, with an upper and lower horizontal pair of beams and six diagonal and vertical cross braces. Since the CAT 15's wing was rigidly braced it did not need the above wing pylon which anchored the flying wires of the Z√∂gling. The nacelle was a wooden structure with ovoid cross-section and fabric covering which extended aft just beyond the wing trailing edge. The rear of the girder was braced laterally with a pair of steel wires to the wings. The empennage of the CAT 15 was very similar to that of the Z√∂gling, with a triangular tailplane mounted on the upper beam of the girder carrying rectangular elevators with a large cut-out to allow movement of the near-rectangular, deep, balanced rudder. The glider landed on a sprung skid reaching from the nose to the trailing edge.

These microorganisms, also called hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms, can degrade hydrocarbons and, include a wide distribution of bacteria, methanogenic archaea, and some fungi. Not all hydrocarbonoclasic microbes depend on hydrocarbons to survive, but instead may use petroleum products as alternative carbon and energy sources. Interest in this field is growing due to the increasing role of bioremediation in oil spill cleanup. Applications=Bioremediation 'Bioremediation' of oil contaminated soils, marine waters and oily sludges in situ is a feasible process as hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms are ubiquitous and are able to degrade most compounds in petroleum oil. In the simplest case, indigenous microbial communities can degrade the petroleum where the spill occurs. In more complicated cases, various methods of adding nutrients, air, or exogenous microorganisms to the contaminated site can be applied. For example, bioreactors involve the application of both natural and additional microorganisms in controlled growth conditions that yields high biodegradation rates and can be used with a wide range of media. Crude oils are composed of an array of chemical compounds, minor constituents, and trace metals. Making up 50-98% of these petroleum products are hydrocarbons with saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic structures which influence their biodegradability by hydronocarbonclasts. The rate of uptake and biodegradation by these hydrocarbon-oxidizing microbes not only depend on the chemical structure of the substrates, but is limited by biotic and abiotic factors such as temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability in the environment. = Alcanivorax borkumensis = A model microorganism studied for its role in bioremediation of oil-spill sites and hydrocarbon catabolism is the alpha- proteobacteria Alcanivorax, which degrades aliphatic alkanes through various metabolic activities. Alcanivorax borkumensis utilizes linear hydrocarbon chains in petroleum as its primary energy source under aerobic conditions. When further supplied with sufficient limiting nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphor, it grows and produces surfactant glucolipids to help reduce surface water tension and enhance hydrocarbon uptake.[5] For this reason, nitrates and phosphates are often commercially added to oil-spill sites to engage quiescent populations of A. borkumensis, allowing them to quickly outcompete other microbial populations and become the dominant species in the oil-infested environment. The addition of rate-limiting nutrients promotes the microbe's biodegrading pathways, including upregulation of genes encoding multiple alkane hydroxylases that oxidize various lengths of linear alkanes. These enzymes essentially remove the problematic hydrocarbon constituents of petroleum oil while A. borkumensis simultaneously increases synthesis of anionic glucoproteins, which are used to emulsify hydrocarbons in the environment and increase their bioavailability. The presence of crude oil along with appropriate levels of nitrogen and phosphor catalyzes the removal of petroleum either by mechanisms that enhance the efficiency of substrate uptake or by direct biodegradation of aliphatic chains. = Commercial applications = Two well-known oil spills exemplify large scale marine bioremediation applications: In 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground, spilling 41.6 million liters of crude oil, and launching one of the first major bioremediation efforts for an oil spill. Cleanup of Alaskan shorelines relied in part on fertilizer application to augment bacterial growth. In 2010, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill released 779 million liters of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This was the largest oil spill of all time and indigenous petroleum microorganisms played a major role in petroleum degradation and cleanup. Biosurfactants These are microbial-synthesized surface-active substances that allow for more efficient microbial biodegradation of hydrocarbons in bioremediation processes. There are two ways by which biosurfactants are involved in bioremediation. (1) Increase the surface area of hydrophobic water-insoluble substrates. Growth of microbes on hydrocarbons can be limited by available surface area of the water-oil interface. Emulsifiers produced by microbes can break up oil into smaller droplets, effectively increasing the available surface area. (2) Increase the bioavailability of hydrophobic water- insoluble substrates. Biosurfactants can enhance the availability of bound substrates by desorbing them from surfaces (e.g. soil) or by increasing their apparent solubility. Some biosurfactants have low critical micelle concentrations (CMCs), a property which increases the apparent solubility of hydrocarbons by sequestering hydrophobic molecules into the centres of micelles. Oil Recovery Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) is a technology in which microbial environments are manipulated to enhance oil recovery. Nutrients are injected in situ into porous media and indigenous or added microbes promote growth and/or generate products that mobilize oil into producing wells. Alternatively, oil-mobilizing products can be produced by fermentation and injected into the reservoir. Various products and microorganisms are useful in these applications and each will yield different results. The two general strategies for enhancing oil recovery are altering the surface properties of the interface and using bioclogging to change the flow behavior. Biomass, biosurfactants, biopolymers, solvents, acids, and gases are some of the products that are added to oil reservoirs to enhance recovery. Other resources for this application: Biosensors Microbial biosensors identify and quantify target compounds of interest through interactions with the microbes. For example, bacteria may be used to identify a pollutant by monitoring their response to the specific chemical. The biosensor system may simply use bacterial growth as a pollutant indicator, or rely on genetic assays wherein a reporter gene is induced by the chemical. Many analytical techniques require expensive treatment of soil samples and/or expensive equipment to detect the presence of pollutants. Bacterial biosensor systems offer the potential for cheap, robust detection systems that are selective and highly sensitive. One developed system uses Pseudomonas fluorescens HK44 to quantitatively assay for naphthalene using bioluminescence. Challenges Often in the process of degrading a pollutant, a microbe can create intermediates or byproducts that are also harmful, sometimes even more harmful than the original substrate. For example, some microbes produce hydrogen sulfide as a byproduct in the degradation of certain petroleum hydrocarbons and if those gases are not detoxified before escaping the system, they can be released into the atmosphere. Biodegradation pathways The pathways of degradation of different petroleum products vary depending on the substrate and the microorganism (i.e. aerobic/anaerobic). Specific degradation pathways of many hydrocarbon compounds can be found on the University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database.

The current director is Delphine Pinasa, whose portrait is exhibited at the museum. History It is located in the old district of Moulins, Allier Departments of France. Situated on the left side of Allier River, it faces the town and its historic quarter. The museum includes the historic building, which had been partially destroyed during World War II and was restored by Fran√ßois Voinchet, Architect of Historic Monuments for the museum. Villars, named for the native military officer, Marshal Villars (1653‚Äì1734), was built during the reign of Louis XV. The 18th century historical monument Caserne ou quartier Villars, actuellement centre national du costume de sc√®ne was used as a cavalry barracks. The interior of the museum was designed by Jean-Michel Wilmotte and Jacques Brudin. A new building, was built for conservation of the centre's collection. Overview The museum is the first structure, in France or abroad, to be entirely dedicated to scenography and costume heritage. Its mission is to preserve, study and increase the value of a collection of 10,000 theatre, opera and ballet costumes. It also shows paintings, on loan from the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France (National Library of France), the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise and the Op√©ra de Paris (Paris Opera). The museum has four areas: the reserves, exhibition halls, library and the training center. There is a gallery of temporary exhibitions behind eight windows. A large room showcases costumes in a scenography context. It also has educational spaces, an auditorium and a documentation center. Its restaurant was decorated by Christian Lacroix, and it has a museum shop. Collections=Nureyev collection The museum has a collection of Rudolf Nureyev's costumes, as requested in his will to be a \\"place of memory\\". Nureyev, who has been the Paris Opera Ballet director had wished to have his collection placed in a museum in Paris, but suitable locations could not be found. So, his collection was placed in the museum in this Auvergne region museum, which is about 3 hours by train from Paris. It is \\"a permanent collection that offers visitors a sense of his exuberant, vagabond personality and passion for all that was rare and beautiful.\\" The collection has historical artifacts from Nureyev's career including film and photograph material, in addition to 70 costumes. It was shown the De Young Museum in San Francisco, California through 17 February 2013 in a show entitled Rudolf Nureyev: A Life in Dance. Stage costumes Several stage companies and theatres, including the Com√©die Fran√ßaise and Paris Opera, send their costumes to the museum after their final show.

Education After graduating from the University of Colombo with a degree in economics, Kelegama joined the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the early-1950s with the first batch of officers which included Gamani Corea, Warnasena Rasaputra, among others. He proceeded to Oxford University for post graduate studies under a Central Bank scholarship thereafter. Vidyalankara University of Sri Lanka. Career After completing his doctorate in 1957, Kelegama returned to Sri Lanka and re-joined the Central Bank. He was seconded as the Senior Assistant Secretary to the Ministry of Trade in 1960 and in 1963 he was appointed as the Director of Economic Research in the Ministry of Finance ‚Äì a post he held till 1966. It was during the 1960s that Kelegama together with P.B. Karandawala played a crucial role in formulating budgets of the 1960‚Äì1965 government. Kelegama served under three Finance Ministers during that time: T.B. Ilangaratne, Felix Dias Bandaranaike, and Dr. N.M. Perera. He was instrumental in establishing the People‚Äôs Bank and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation in the early 1960s with the then Finance Minister, T.B. Ilangartna. He was also instrumental in introducing the Business Turnover Tax. He contributed to the preparation of budgets of the former Finance Minister, U.B. Wanninayake during 1965‚Äì1967. He became the first Professor of Economics at Vidyalankara after it was converted from a Pirivena to a University in the late 1950s by Prime Minister, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike‚Äôs government. He with a few others pioneered the teaching of Economics in Sinhala at the University of Vidyalankara after swabasha was introduced. His contemporaries at Vidyalankara were K. Dharmasena, Tilak Ratnakara, Kamal Karunanayake, among others. During this period, he wrote many articles and made extensive contributions to the Ceylon Economist and to the news papers. Other contributors to Ceylon Economist at that time were I.D.S. Weerawardena, F.R. Jayasuriya, A.D.V.de S. Indraratna, H.A.de S. Gunasekera, Buddhadasa Hewavitharana, among others. In 1968, he was appointed as the Director-General of Commerce under the Dudley Senanayake government and served in that position for two years.

Humanitarian works During the 1990s, he played a key role in two leading humanitarian organizations, viz., the Cancer Society and Sahanaya and served as the Chairman in both these institutions for many years. Approach to economic analysis Kelegama belonged to the older generation of economists who were every much influenced by Fabian socialism and Keynesian economics. He stood at the centre-left of the political spectrum in his economic thinking. He was a prolific writer with contributions to Ceylon Economist, Economic Review, Sri Lanka Economic Journal and to the newspapers. His papers on the rural economy of Sri Lanka and peasantry are still widely quoted by scholars. During the time of the globalization debate, he made many notable contributions on pros and cons of globalization to various journals. He delivered many lectures on economic topics of contemporary interest at various forums ‚Äì Philip Gunawardena Memorial lecture, N.M. Perera Memorial lecture, etc. His thinking on economic issues was articulated in his weekly column to the Sunday Island under the name Kanes. Under the column, many subjects ranging from: globalization, Washington Consensus, WTO, regional & bilateral free trade agreements, and domestic economic policy issues were discussed. He wrote this column from 1995‚Äì2005. The running theme on many of his articles on the domestic economy was that Sri Lanka is still not prepared for a total free market economy because of the not very strong supply base in the country, and until the supply base was adequately developed a mixed economy should be pursued. A Keynesian type of government initiated fiscal stimulus was necessary, he argued, to develop the supply potential in the economy. In other words, he gave an alternative viewpoint to that of ardent advocates of a total free market economy who argued that with the free operation of the market forces, the supply base will automatically develop with minimum state intervention. Awards In recognition of his service to the Nation he was conferred with Deshamanya by the government of Sri Lanka in 1994 and in recognition of his contribution to economic teaching and economic policy making he was conferred with Artha Shastra Shiromnai by the University of Kelaniya in 2002. He was posthumously awarded Trinity Lion by the Trinity College, Kandy in 2013.

It is in the county of S√ºdwestpfalz within the Palatine Forest and is often called Merzalber Schloss (\\"Merzalben Castle\\"). It is built on a rock plateau high at an elevation of above sea level.  History  Gr√§fenstein Castle was built by the Saarbr√ºcken counts, who had lost their fortress and were in need of a new one. Evidence for the exact date of the castle's building does not exist although the earliest record dates to a 1237 deed of partition by the counts of Leiningen. But from the castle's design and materials it can be deduced that it was built sometime between 1150 and 1200. Another clue is in the date of the restoration of the stone fortress, which took place in 1168, and coincides with first construction work on Gr√§fenstein Castle. The central element of the site, with its bergfried and palas probably dates to the 12th century and thus goes back to the Hohenstaufen era. The upper part of the castle was built on a rock shelf 12 metres high. The building's highlight is the peculiar seven-sided tower. Possession of Gr√§fenstein was first given to the younger counts of the von Leiningen family. The House of Leiningen was related to the von Saarbr√ºcken counts. The castle was built primarily for protection. It lies on the intersection of the Diocese of Worms, Speyer and Metz. The boundaries of these places were contiguous with that of Gr√§fenstein's, so the castle's main function was to maintain a hold on the uncertain borders. So was the protection of the surrounding forests and villages. In 1317 the castle went into the possession of the collateral Leiningen-Dagsburg line. By 1367 they had to sell 7/8 of the estate to Prince Elector, Rupert I of the Palatinate. Through marriage, Gr√§fenstein went in 1421 to the Counts of Leiningen- Hardenburg. They had the castle expanded, particularly the lower ward. The castle was first destroyed in 1525 during the German Peasants' War. Rebuilding work began in 1535 and, in 1540, the castle was sold by its owner, Count Palatine Johann von Simmern to the Count Palatine, Rupert, who used it from then on as his new residence and also introduced the Reformation locally. Rupert had been born in 1506 in Zweibr√ºcken and died at Gr√§fenstein Castle on 28 July 1544. Thereafter the castle continued to change hands, until in 1570 it was transferred, together with its associated villages, to Badenese ownership (Margraviate of Baden-Baden and Baden-Durlach). In 1635, during the Thirty Years' War, the castle was razed by fire (due to \\"carelessness on the part of the imperial forces...\\") and became unusable for a long time. In 1771, when the rule of the Counts of Baden-Baden ended, ownership of the castle passed into the hands of the government of Baden-Durlach. They held the castle until the French Revolution. The castle had at this point reached the crest of its glory, and after that it fell into dereliction. In spite of that the fortification is relatively well preserved. The first conservation measures on the ruins were carried out in 1909/10 and 1936/37. And from 1978 to 1986 the state of Rhineland-Palatinate had the ruins comprehensively restored at some cost.  Site  Schematic plan of the bergfried The bergfried and mantlet wall Map showing the plan of the Gr√§fenstein Castle. Gr√§fenstein is one of the most important, Hohenstaufen era castles in Rhineland-Palatinate. It is about long and about wide.  Bergfried  Gr√§fenstein is the only castle in Germany with a heptagonal keep or bergfried. This may still be climbed today up a narrow spiral staircase. The shape of the tower is based on a combination of an octagon (c.f. Steinsberg) and a triangle. Whilst on a pentagonal tower, a triangular point is added to the rectangular main body on the side facing the enemy, in the case of Gr√§fenstein two shoulders of the octagon have been extended into a point. Another feature is the fact that the bergfried at Gr√§fenstein is not oriented in the direction of an attack, because the castle stands on a conical hill with steep drops on all sides. This underscores the symbolism of military architecture, which was on an equal footing with functionality in the High Middle Ages. The ground-level entrance was not added until more recent times.  Upper ward  Around the bergfried there is a mantlet wall, which appears to represent five sides of a slightly irregular octagon, due to the nature of the terrain. The outer wall of the upper ward consists externally entirely of rusticated ashlars. Access was via a wooden staircase at the site of the present stone one. The gate at this point has not survived. In the northern part of the upper ward lies the Hohenstaufen era palas, whose walls have been preserved as far as the height of the rain gutters. Its plan resembles a pointed triangle. Its windows were replaced in the Late Middle Ages, but the Romanesque window arches in the upper storey can still be made out. The most important late medieval additions to the upper ward are the toilet tower and a staircase tower dating to the 16th century. There were no other structural changes in the palas.  Lower ward  The lower ward, which is laid out in a ring around the foot of the rock on which the upper ward is built, goes back to Hohenstaufen times, at least in its southern and western sections. The shape of the irregular polygon is again repeated on the expected direction of attack, so that there is a triple defence here consisting of enceinte, mantlet wall and bergfried. Thus the southern part of the lower ward was built shortly after the upper ward at the end of the 13th century. The northern part with its zwinger may not have been added until the 15th century. Two small round towers with loopholes for hand weapons guarded the approach on the northeastern side of the lower ward. In the entrance, original stone slabs with cartwheel grooves may still be seen. Two storey buildings were erected against the inside of the curtain wall on the southern side of the lower ward. Four chimneys and six garderobes from these buildings can still be seen. They indicate the presence of a large castle garrison.  References  Literature  * Alexander Thon (ed.): ... wie eine gebannte, unnahbare Zauberburg. Burgen in der S√ºdpfalz. 2. Auflage.

Cartographer of sinister history Krak√≥w 2013,  Work  Tara (von Neudorf) is one of a group of young Romanian artists who contest the traditional brand of art represented by the country's Union of Visual Artists. In the late 1990s they turned to non-public forums for the freedom of artistic expression they sought. The themes addressed by these artists are, in the words of Diana Dochia: Tara's favourite media are black marker pen and red paint, and his best-known works are made on old communist-era schoolroom maps and educational posters. His creative space is the \\"periphery\\" of Europe, but he also references the geopolitics of art. His work is suffused with the context of the place where he comes from and works ‚Äì Transylvania. The local context is his starting point for his artistic narratives about identity, difficult history, the co-existence of cultures, unhealed wounds, and the emptiness of now depopulated towns and villages.On the subject of Tara's art in the context of the history and identity of Transylvania, and especially the history and culture of the Transylvanian Saxons, see: ≈Åukasz Galusek, Cartographer of the void.

Early life Allene Tew was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, on July 7, 1872. Her father, Charles Henry Tew (1849‚Äì1925), was a banker in Jamestown, New York, and her mother was Janet (n√©e Smith) Tew (1854‚Äì1923).The PeerageAnnejet van der Zijl, An American Princess: The Many Lives of Allene Tew, 2017 She was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, which meant she had to show documentation that she was a descendant of someone who fought in the American Revolutionary War. But she may have doctored the evidence in order to encourage Mrs. Astor, the self- proclaimed queen of aristocratic American society at the turn of the century, to accept her as a member of the upper class despite her middle class upbringing, premarital pregnancy, and shotgun wedding.\\"An American Princess: The Many Lives of Allene Tew\\" by Annejet van der Zijl Personal life Throughout her lifetime, Allene was married five times. She married her first husband, Theodore Rickey Hostetter (1870‚Äì1902), a polo player and yachtsman who was one of the wealthiest men of Pittsburgh, in 1891. Tod, as he was known, was the youngest son of Rosetta (n√©e Rickey) Hostetter and David Hostetter, a prominent businessman and banker.Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe, Memoirs of the Harvard dead in the war against Germany, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1923, Volume 4, p. 351 They had apartments in New York City at 8 East 65th Street and several country homes including Raccoon Farm in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, complete with polo grounds and golf links, and a summer house at Narragansett Pier. Together, Tod and Allene were the parents of three children: * Greta Hostetter (1892‚Äì1918), who married Glenn L. Stewart (1884‚Äì1957). She had her debut at Sherry's in 1911. * Verna Hostetter (1893‚Äì1895), who died in early childhood. * Theodore Rickey Hostetter Jr. (1897‚Äì1918), who was killed in World War I. Hostetter died of pneumonia on August 3, 1902 at thirty-two years old. He contracted a cold on his yacht Seneca during a trip to Larchmont, New York to visit his brother Herbert. His estate was valued at $1,349,196, which included shares of the Union Trust Company, the Pennsylvania Gas Goal Company, the Monongahela Coal Company, the Pittsburg, Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad, and the Hostetter Company, the family firm. After his death, it was reported that Tod had lost $1,000,000 in one year because of gambling. Reportedly, \\"[b]efore he was buried the gamblers who claimed that the young man owed them large sums called upon the widow to effect a settlement.\\" Second marriage After Hostetter's death, she remarried to Morton Colton Nichols at St. Thomas's Church by the Rev. Dr. Ernest M. Stires on December 27, 1904. Nichols had previously been rumored to be engaged to Vivien Sartoris, daughter of Nellie Grant and granddaughter of President Ulysses S. Grant. After their honeymoon in Canada, Allene and Morton, a real estate investor with Ladd & Nichols, lived at 3 East 67th Street while their new residence on Park Avenue and 37th Street was being constructed. However, they divorced a year later in 1905 and she resumed the name of Hostetter. In August 1932, Nichols hanged himself in a suite at the Pierre Hotel in New York. Third marriage Her third husband was Anson Wood Burchard, whom she married on December 4, 1912, in London. Among those present at the wedding were Burchard's best man, Edwin W. Rice, Lord and Lady Greville (Lady Greville, a fellow American, was the former Olive Grace, widow of Henry Kerr), the Comte de Paris, Mrs. Hinsdill Parsons (Anson's sister and the wife of GE's General Counsel), Capt. and the Hon. Mrs. Feilden, among others. At the time of their wedding, Burchard, a son of Walter Howard Burchard, was assistant to the President of General Electric. He later served as a director and vice-chairman of the company. In Manhattan, they were listed in the Social Register and resided at 57 East 64th Street on the Upper East Side, in a townhouse designed by architect C. P. H. Gilbert. In 1925, they purchased 690 Park Avenue from Mrs. Henry P. Davison. In Paris, they resided at 4 Rue d'Aguesseau in the 8th arrondissement. During their marriage, both of Allene's children who lived to adulthood died within the same week in 1918. Her husband died suddenly at the home of Mortimer L. Schiff on January 22, 1927. His estate was valued in excess of $3,000,000. Burchard's nephew, Seth Rosewater (son of Charles Rosewater, a part owner of the Omaha Bee), changed his last name \\"to Burchard in order to keep the Burchard name alive\\" and to inherit the millions left by the elder Burchard. Fourth marriage In October 1928, Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss of K√∂stritz accompanied her to the Moulton musicale celebrating Arthur J. Moulton's restoration of the historic Chateau de la Verri√®res in Verri√®res-le-Buisson (formerly owned by the Comte de Lavalette, Napoleon's aide-de-camp in his Italian campaign). Allene had recently purchased a new house at 33 Rue Bardet de Jouy in France, the former residence of the Comtesse de Montebello. In January 1929, she chartered the Indiana, a luxurious houseboat referred to as a \\"floating palace\\", to travel up the Nile River in Egypt. Prince Henry, as he was known in the American press, was among her guests, as was Lord Greville and Lady Greville. On April 10, 1929, she married Prince Henry as her fourth husband in Paris. Capt. Steele, naval attach√© of the embassy in Paris, gave the bride in marriage. The guests at the wedding included German Ambassador Prince Henry XXXII and Prince Henry XXXIV. Prince Henry, a member of one of the oldest reigning houses in Europe, was a grandson of Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach through his mother Princess Marie. He had been divorced in 1922 from Princess Victoria Margaret of Prussia, niece of German Emperor Wilhelm II. Prince Henry served as an officer in the Second Dragoons Guard, the regiment of the Empress Alexandra of Russia and was in the diplomatic service with the German embassy in Paris. During their marriage, she was known for her entertaining, including throwing a debut party at the Waldorf-Astoria for her stepdaughter, Princess Marie Luise Reuss zu K√∂stritz in 1932. The Princess of Reuss' secretary announced in June 1935 that the Prince and Princess had divorced.Milestones: Feb. 4, 1929, Time, February 4, 1929 Fifth marriage Her fifth husband was Capt. Count Pavel de Kotzebue, who was known as Paul de Kotzebue in the American Press, whom she married on March 4, 1936, in Geneva, Switzerland. He was born on February 20, 1884 in Kremenetz and his uncle, Ernst von Kotzebue, was the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. in 1895. It was his first marriage and their guests included Prince Ferdinand of Lippe-Weissenfeld, Prince Lobanoff of Lausanne and Colonel Alexander Kotzebue, the Count's brother. In 1940, they bought Beechwood, the former Newport cottage of Caroline Schermerhorn Astor from Mrs. Astor's grandson, Vincent Astor. They entertained extensively in Newport, including an elaborate garden party for the benefit of the Newport Chapter of the American Red Cross. She negotiated on behalf of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld leading up to his marriage to princess (and subsequently queen) Juliana of the Netherlands because she was a friend of his mother's (Armgard von Cramm).Annejet van der Zijl, Bernhard, een verborgen geschiedenis, 2010, p. 250 In 1938, she became godmother to their eldest daughter, princess Beatrix, later Queen of the Netherlands.Annejet van der Zijl, Bernhard, een verborgen geschiedenis, 2010, p. 288 She died at her villa in Cap d'Ail on the French Riviera on May 1, 1955, at the age of eighty-two. At the time of her death, her New York residence was 740 Park Avenue, considered to be \\"the most luxurious and powerful residential building in New York City\\". After her death, six of her cousins filed claims contesting her $20,113,000 will, which reportedly was the largest filed in Newport Probate Court. Count Kotzebue died in Paris on 13 September 1966.

Biography  Joaquim Silv√©rio dos Reis Montenegro Leiria Grutes was born in Monte Real, a parish in the Portuguese municipality of Leiria, in 1756. Being assigned to Brazil, he was a colonel in the cavalry division of the Minas Gerais province in Borda do Campo (today, Antonio Carlos). He was also a farmer and proprietor of several gold mines in the province of Minas Gerais, during a time where mining was its main economic activity. He married Bernardina Quit√©ria de Oliveira Belo, cousin of Francisco Antonio de Oliveira Lopes and aunt to the Duke of Caxias and the Count of Tocantins.  Inconfid√™ncia Mineira  In the early 18th century, the Portuguese crown began to institute a series of taxes and levies around all mining activity in its Brazilian colony. In 1702, the Stewardship for the Mines was created to fulfill that goal, being controlled directly from authorities in Lisboa. This new agency of the Royal Treasury called for the payment of the 'Quinto' (\\"Fifth\\"), or a fifth of the total amount gold extracted. Additional measures to enforce taxation were manifested in the creation of official foundry houses (Portuguese: Casas de Fundi√ß√£o), where the gold extracted received an official stamp required for commercial circulation. An annual quota for gold extraction was also implemented in order to guarantee a sufficient 'quinto': 1,500 kilograms of gold. When the captaincy of a mining community could not satisfy the royal demand for gold, it was burdened with an additional tax on gold, a process called derrama. The derramas were made in a general climate of fear and violence. With the depletion of several gold mines, especially in Vila Rica (present day Ouro Preto), the local population lived in fear of an even more violent derrama, which in part triggered a group of \\"inconfidentes\\", conspirators against the Portuguese, to start planning a revolt in time for the derrama of 1789. Notable inconfidentes included Lt.-Colonel Francisco de Paula Freire de Andrade and the poets Cl√°udio Manuel da Costa, Tom√°s Ant√≥nio Gonzaga, Alvarenga Peixoto and Joaquim Jos√© da Silva Xavier, who would later be best known as Tiradentes.  Plea  Joaquim became aware of the inconfidentes' intent to revolt and wrote a plea letter on the 11th of April, 1789, to the Governor of Minas Gerais, the Viscount of Barbacena, essentially alerting the colonial authorities to the existence of a movement in Vila Rica which intended to proclaim a Republic in Brazil and free it from Portugal. The derrama for that year was subsequently suspended and the main leaders of the revolt were arrested. As compensation for his plea, Joaquim issued a series of demands: a prize in gold, to be forgiven of his fiscal debts, to be named Treasurer of the provinces of Minas Gerais, Goias and Rio de Janeiro, a private mansion, a lifetime pension, the title of Fidalgo, the honour and uniform of the Portuguese Military Order of Christ and a meeting in Lisboa with the Prince Regent Dom Jo√£o. It is uncertain if any of these demands were met.  Final years and death  Joaquim suffered a series of attempts on his life in Brazil after his plea, being seen as a traitor for making the plea deal. He escaped to Lisboa, only return to Brazil in 1808, to the province of Maranh√£o, where his wife had roots. He died there in February 1819.

Anthecology, or pollination biology, is the study of pollination as well as the relationships between flowers and their pollinators. Floral biology is a bigger field that includes these studies. Most flowering plants, or angiosperms, are pollinated by animals, and especially by insects. The major flower-frequenting insect taxa include beetles, flies, wasps, bees, ants, thrips, butterflies, and moths. Insects carry out pollination when visiting flowers to obtain nectar or pollen, to prey on other species, or when pseudo- copulating with insect-mimicking flowers such as orchids. Pollination-related interactions between plants and insects are considered mutualistic, and the relationships between plants and their pollinators have likely led to increased diversity of both angiosperms and the animals that pollinate them. Anthecology brings together many disciplines, such as botany, horticulture, entomology, and ecology. History The tulip was a popular subject of study among early anthecologists. Anthecology began as a descriptive science relying on observation, and more recently has come to rely upon quantitative and experimental studies. By the 17th century, the sexual nature of plant reproduction was recognized following the work of Nehemiah Grew and the experiments of Rudolf Jakob Camerarius, who showed that pistillate plants need both male and female organs for reproduction. Tulips and maize were popular subjects of study during this time. In 1735, Carl Linnaeus developed a \\"sexual system\\" of the classification of seed plants. In the mid-to-late 18th century, Joseph Gottlieb K√∂lreuter demonstrated that pollen must be transferred from stamen to stigma for reproduction to occur, and also clarified the distinction between nectar and honey. In the late 18th century, Christian Konrad Sprengel showed evidence that flowers attract insects and reward them with nectar. Following the emergence of the Darwinian theory of evolution in the late 19th century, scientists became keen to the selective advantage of cross- pollination. In an 1873 book, Hermann M√ºller made detailed observations of the particular relationships between certain insects and certain flowering plants, called pollination syndromes, and additional comprehensive surveys were made by Paul Knuth. Anethecology went into decline for several decades, but the field was kept alive by several studies including those of honey bees by Karl von Frisch in the mid 20th century. Anthecology gained a resurgence in the 20th century during the rise of neo-Darwinism. Specific plant-insect interactions were further documented, with an emphasis on tropical anthecology, comparative anthecology, and co-evolution. Today, the biology of pollination has attracted the attention of scientists, governments, and the media, following observations of rapid pollinator decline in the late 20th century, including the unexplained and sudden disappearance of honey bees in a phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder.

Established by the husband and wife team Tio Tek Djien and Miss Riboet, the company travelled throughout the Indies and performed various acts, particularly those with action scenes. It was disbanded in 1942, having lost much of its popularity due to competition with Dardanella. History In the late 19th century various forms of popular theatre, inspired by Western techniques and formats, began to develop in the Dutch East Indies, a colony of the Netherlands. The earliest were the Malayan bangsawan troupes, who traveled to Sumatra and Java beginning in the 1880s. The Komedi Stamboel developed in the Indies in the 1890s, inspired by these bangsawan troupes. By 1910 various organisations run by the ethnic Chinese had begun holding stage performances, which they termed \\"operas\\", as fundraisers; these troupes eventually developed into professional ones, acting for profit. In 1925 Tio Tek Djien (1895‚Äì1975), an ethnic Chinese businessman from East Java, established Orion Opera together with his wife, Miss Riboet ( 1900‚Äì1965), who took the lead role. Though Tio drew on the earlier bangsawan and komedi stamboel, as with his contemporaries such as Tengku Katan's Union Dahlia, he introduced several changes. Stories selected were shorter ones, with shorter scenes, which could be completed in a single night. No longer were the characters introduced before the performance, and the number of scenes with singing and dancing was drastically reduced, limited only to inter-act performances. Orion's repertoire was likewise different: instead of traditional tales, such as those based on the One Thousand and One Nights, Orion tended to perform original stories, though it also produced some adaptations of Western works. Initially the troupe's original stories were written by Tio himself. By the late 1920s he had hired Njoo Cheong Seng, a journalist and writer, to help produce original scripts. Works by Njoo which the troupe performed included Kiamat (Apocalypse), Tengkorak (Skull), and Tueng Balah, while Tio wrote such works as R.A. Soemantri. These stories were most often filled with action, and, though written in detail, left room for improvisation. When Miss Riboet proved highly popular as a swordfighter in these plays, as well as a kroncong singer, the troupe was named after her. An advertisement for gramophone records featuring Miss Riboet's vocals Though initially limited to an amusement park in Central Java, the troupe quickly proved popular and travelled from city to city. They sold gramophone records to supplement their income, and Miss Riboet became the first recording star of the Indies. Stores sold Miss Riboet brand merchandise, including wristwatches. In 1927 the company attempted to make a film. Tio asked Nelson Wong to first record the troupe's performances, a task which Wong did using a simple camera. Hoping to create a profitable fiction film, Tio asked Wong to direct, a request Wong accept as long as Tio would help bring Wong's brothers from China. When the brothers arrived in the Indies, Tio bought an old tapioca flour factory in Bandung for them to use as a studio. Nelson and Tio began plans to make a film starring Miss Riboet, but these were cancelled after discovering that Riboet's face was \\"not photogenic\\". In 1926 another theatrical troupe, Dardanella, was established by Willy A. Piedro. As with Miss Riboet's Orion, Dardanella quickly became known for its action-themed plays, a repertoire which included several stories about Zorro and an adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo in Batavia; such was the troupe's popularity that its leading man, Tan Tjeng Bok, was soon styled the \\"Douglas Fairbanks of Java\\". By 1931 the competition from Dardanella had led to an advertising war between the two troupes, each focusing on their best-received works: Gagak Solo from Miss Riboet's Orion and Dr Samsi from Dardanella. In 1934 Njoo and his wife, the actress Fifi Young, migrated to Dardanella. Though Orion continued to perform, it was unable to compete with Dardanella. It was disbanded during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (1942‚Äì1945). After 1950 Tio attempted to reunite the troupe, but was unsuccessful. Reception and legacy Indonesian literary scholar Jakob Sumardjo writes that Miss Riboet's Orion laid the basis for modern theatre in Indonesia, a feat he attributes to both Tio and Njoo having been well educated (as opposed to earlier, business-oriented, theatre patrons). Contemporary critic Tzu You, writing in 1939, considered Miss Riboet's Orion to have had the potential to create high quality, literary, stage plays, but that said potential was wasted as Tio focused only on following the public's tastes. An anonymous review in De Indische Courant recommended the opera company as a good one, particularly praising Miss Riboet's singing and acting. A stageplay put on by Miss Riboet's, entitled Pembalesan Siti Akbari, was reprinted by the Lontar Foundation in 2006 using the Perfected Spelling System. The play is an adaptation of Lie Kim Hok's 1884 poem Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari.

It has white flowers on a woolly stem in leaf axils, long narrow leaves with reddish new growth. Found growing at higher altitudes in moist or sclerophyll Eucalyptus woodland. Description Hakea eriantha is a dense non lignotuberous shrub or small tree tall. Leaves are linear to egg-shaped and 8 to 18.5 cm long and 1 to 30 mm wide. Young leaves are either smooth or with flattened fine hairs, ending with a sharp short point long. The inflorescence consists of 6-10 cream flowers on a stalk about long, they appear in the leaf axils. The pedicel is long and densely covered with white soft hairs extending onto the lower part of the flower. The white perianth is long and the style long. between August and November. The woody fruit is smooth long and about wide with brown blister-like protuberances ending with a short sharp point long.It is wrinkled and has beak that is about 3 mm long. Taxonomy and naming Hakea eriantha was first formally described in 1830 by botanist Robert Brown from a specimen collected near the Hastings River by Charles Fraser. The description was published in an addendum to the Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae. The specific epithet (eriantha) is derived from the Ancient Greek words erion meaning \\"wool\\" and anthos meaning \\"flower\\" referring to the hairy flowers of this hakea. Distribution and habitat Tree hakea occurs in Eucalyptus woodland or forest and the edge of rainforest from Gladstone in Queensland, southward to Gippsland in Victoria. Use in horticulture Hakea eriantha is a fast growing species, suitable for wet cold climates as a screening or hedging plant. A food source for the gang-gang cockatoo (Calocephalon fimbriatum) as they share a similar habitat. Also preferred in some districts by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus funereus) as a food source.

Construction started in 1911 on sections of four of the lines, and three were opened in part before the project was effectively abandoned in 1920. History Following the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859, Queensland consisted of a vast area with a non-indigenous population of ~30,000, most of who lived in the south east corner of the colony. The Queensland Government was keen to facilitate development and immigration, and had approved the construction to the Main Line from Ipswich ~160 km to the fertile Darling Downs region in 1864. This was the first narrow gauge (1067mm or 3‚Äô6‚Äù) main line in the world. For the next 46 years the Queensland government continued to give priority to railway construction projects that were seen as facilitating development and settlement at the expense of system connectivity. At one stage there were 11 separate railway systems in Queensland, and whilst coastal shipping provided adequate service in the absence of a continuous North Coast line, there was no easy equivalent for the interior, where the virtual absence of navigable rivers meant that bullock wagons and horse-drawn coaches were the only transport options before a railway was constructed. By 1910 the benefits of a connected system were seen as worth realising, and the North Coast Line Act was passed authorising a line from Rockhampton to Cairns, which when completed in 1924 provided a 1681 km line linking Brisbane to all major coastal towns and cities on Queensland‚Äôs settled east coast. On the same day the Queensland parliament also approved the Great Western Railway Act, authorising 2063 km of new lines in western Queensland. As John Kerr so succinctly put it, ‚Äú‚Ä¶only 505km was built, and only 468km was opened...the project was designed to bring all country suitable for sheep grazing within economic distance, but it was ill conceived.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Publications 1990‚Äù The Act required all sections to be constructed more or less simultaneously, giving an indication of the political considerations of the day, where competing regions were vocal when perceiving that another had been advantaged by a government decision. It is likely that aspect explains why both Acts were approved on the same day. Proposal details The actual Great Western Railway (GWR) line was to be from Tobermory to Camooweal, following an alignment proposed in the 1880s for a railway from Sydney to Darwin via Bourke. This south-east to north-west alignment paralleled the Queensland coastline, having the benefit of providing roughly equidistant connections to the ports. To connect the GWR line to the rest of the QR system, 4 connecting lines were proposed, described as Sections A to D. These were; Section A ‚Äì From Westgate on the Western Line to Eromanga Section B ‚Äì From Blackall to Windorah Section C ‚Äì From Winton to Springvale Section D ‚Äì From Malbon to an unnamed junction point. The Malbon ‚Äì Duchess section is now part of the Mt Isa line. Construction progress Section A ‚Äì Construction started from a point 21 km south of Charleville, later called Westgate (as in Gateway to the west) in July 1911, and continued until 1917. The village of Quilpie (201 km from Westgate), on the west bank of the Bulloo River was established where construction halted, and became the terminus of the line. The line went west rather than south west as the Commissioner for Railways, following an inspection of the route in 1911, determined a due west route would serve better country. Section B ‚Äì Construction started from Blackall, then the terminus of a branch line from the Central West line station of Jericho in August 1911, and continued until 1917, restarted in 1919 and being abandoned in December 1920, with the village of Yaraka (156 km from Blackall), becoming the terminus when construction ceased. Section C ‚Äì Construction started from Winton, then the terminus of a branch line from the Mt Isa line station of Hughenden in 1913, the start having been delayed whilst the best place to cross the Diamantina River was established. The line initially headed west towards Elderslie as, in the case of Section A, the Commissioner had determined that alignment served better country. Rails laid for 37 km when construction was halted in February 1916 to focus on the construction of the Dobbyn line to provide copper ore for the war effort. Construction never restarted, and the line was never opened for traffic. The rails were salvaged as a job creation program in 1931. Section D ‚Äì Construction started from Malbon, then a station on the Selwyn line, in August 1911, and continued until 1920, with the hamlet of Dajarra (112 km from Malbon) becoming the terminus when construction was abandoned, although work had extended 16 km beyond there. No construction work was undertaken for the GWR line itself. Legacy Today the main legacy of the GWR proposal is the 58 km Malbon ‚Äì Duchess section of the Mt Isa line, which has been upgraded to main line standard and also services the Phosphate Hill line. The Dajarra branch was closed in 1993. The Yaraka branch has been out of service since ~2005. The Westgate ‚Äì Quilpie branch line is still referred to as the Great Western line by QR. The idea of linking the western extremities of the QR lines was fulfilled when the Australian government contracted Qantas to provide air mail services linking Charleville, Blackall, Longreach, Winton and Cloncurry in 1922.

It can also be used to model how a given ocean system responds to inputs like sediment, freshwater, ice, or nutrients, requiring coupled models nested within the ROMS framework.  Framework  ROMS is a 4D model, i.e. a 3-dimensional model that can be run to evaluate change over a given amount of time. It is gridded into vertical layers that make up the water column and horizontal cells that make up the coordinates of the 2D cartesian plane of the model region.

The vertical grid can be squeezed or stretched to increase or decrease the resolution for an area of interest, such as a thermocline or bottom boundary layer. Grid stretching in the vertical direction follows bottom topography, allowing for the idealized flow of water over features such as seamounts.  Horizontal grid  The horizontal grid is a structured grid, meaning that it has a rectangular 4-sided grid cell structure. The horizontal grid is also an orthoganal curvilinear grid, meaning that it maximizes ocean grid cells of interest and minimizes extra land grid cells. The horizontal grid is also a staggered grid or Arakawa-C grid, where the velocities in the north-south and east-west directions are calculated at the edges of each grid cell, while the values for scalar variables such as density are calculated at the center of each grid cell, known as \\"rho-points.\\"  Physics  In both the vertical and horizontal directions, the default equations use centered, second-order finite difference schemes. Higher order schemes are available if desired, for example using parabolic spline reconstruction. In general, the physical schemes used by ROMS are based on three governing equations: # Continuity # Conservation of momentum (Navier-Stokes) # Transport equations of tracer variables (such as salinity and temperature) Equations are coupled to solve for five unknowns at each location in the model grid using numerical solutions: * East-west velocity (u) * North-south velocity (v) * Vertical velocity (w) * Salinity * Temperature  Source code  ROMS uses an open- access source code that can be downloaded by filling out an online request form. It runs on C-processing and was developed for shared computing uses. To download the source code a user must create an account and file a request with the developers on the ROMS website.  Input and output = Input  Boundaries such as coastlines can be specified for a given region using land- and sea-masking. The top vertical boundary, the air-sea interface, uses an interaction scheme developed by Fairall et al. (1996). The bottom vertical boundary, the sediment-water interface, uses a bottom stress or bottom- boundary-layer scheme developed by Styles and Glenn (2000). Inputs that are needed for an implementer to run ROMS for a specific ocean region include: * Bathymetry and coastline * Freshwater input * Wind * Tides * Open boundary forcings (idealized, such as a reanalysis product, or specific data) * Heat flux * Physical mixing (see above) The programming framework of ROMS is split into three parts: Initialize, Run, and Finalize, which is standard for the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF). \\"Run\\" is the largest of these three parts, where the user chooses which options they want to use and assimilates data if desired. The model run must be initialized or compiled before it is run.  Output  The output format of model run files is netCDF. Model output is often visualized using independent secondary programming software such as MATLAB or Python, or visualization software such as Panoply.  User options  The general approach of ROMS gives model implementers a high level of freedom and responsibility. One approach cannot meet the needs of all the diverse applications the model is currently used for. Therefore, it is up to each model implementer (either an individual or a research group) to choose how they want to use each of the available options. Options include choices such as: * Mixing formulations in the horizontal and vertical directions * Vertical grid stretching * Processing mode (serial, parallel with MPI, or parallel with OpenMP) * Debugging turned on or off When using ROMS, if an implementer runs into a problem or bug, they can report it to the ROMS forum.  Applications  A daily, global Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data set from December 2013 produced at 1-km resolution (also known as ultra-high resolution) by the JPL ROMS group. The versatility of ROMS has been proven in its diverse applications to different systems and regions. It is best applied to mesoscale systems, or those systems that can be mapped at high resolution, such as 1-km to 100-km grid spacing.  Coupled model applications  Biogeochemical, bio-optical, sea ice, sediment, and other models can be embedded within the ROMS framework to study specific processes. These are usually developed for specific regions of the world's oceans but can be applied elsewhere. For example, the sea ice application of ROMS was originally developed for the Barents Sea Region. ROMS modeling efforts are increasingly being coupled with observational platforms, such as buoys, satellites, and ship-mounted underway sampling systems, to provide more accurate forecasting of ocean conditions.  Regional applications  There is an ever-growing number of applications of ROMS to particular regions of the world's oceans. These integrated ocean modeling systems use ROMS for the circulation component, and add other variables and processes of interest. A few examples are: * Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) * Experimental System for Predicting Shelf and Slope Optics (ESPRESSO) * New York Harbor Observing and Prediction System (NYHOPS) * Chesapeake Bay Estuarine Carbon & Biogeochemistry (ChesROMS ECB) * Climatic indices in the Gulf of Alaska *LiveOcean daily forecast model of the NE Pacific and Salish Sea  See also  * General circulation model (GCM) * Ocean general circulation model (OGCM) * List of ocean circulation models * Climate model * Oceanography * Physical oceanography * Ecological forecasting  References  External links  * ROMS website * ROMS Documentation Portal Category:Numerical climate and weather models Category:Physical oceanography ","title":"Regional Ocean Modeling System"},{"id":"40979040","text":"Sparganothina cultrata is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Political career Goutam is a member of the largest political party in India, the Indian National Congress. He is a president of Dhar District Congress Committee. He ran on the Congress ticket in the 2008 Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly Election from Dhar Vidhan Sabha Constituency, but lost due to unfair means, against Neena Verma of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Goutam won the seat by two votes in the first vote count; he received 50,507 votes against Verma's 50,505. Verma and her party requested to recount the votes, and she was declared winner by a margin of only one vote. The final tally of votes was 50,510 to 50,509. Goutam was very confident and challenged Verma's election and the recounting process in the Madhya Pradesh High Court in 2009. He petitioned that there was a misconduct in counting the postal votes. The Indore Bench of High Court ruled in favour of Goutam and declared Verma's election void on the grounds of non-compliance of the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act. Verma filled a recrimination petition against Goutam, which was rejected by the Bench. He was declared elected by the Court and took his oath of office on 24 September 2013. On 5 November 2013, the All India Congress Committee announced Goutam as the party's candidate from Dhar Constituency for the 2013 state legislative assembly election; the election held on 25 November.

Oxford University Press. Web. 23 Dec. 2015 Hans Witdoeck broke the three-year training contract with Vorsterman after only two years at the instigation of his father. He then trained for two years with the painter Cornelis Schut who introduced him to painting. He subsequently trained with Rubens where he learned the engraving of large plates. After the death of Rubens in 1640, Witdoeck worked mainly as an art dealer. He married Catherina Gommaerts on 24 June 1642. Since there are no further records on Witdoeck following his marriage, it is presumed that he died shortly afterwards.Van Hout, Nico, Abraham en Melchisedek: een proefdruk van een Rubensprent voor het Koninklijk Museum, in: Rubensbulletin 3-2011 Supper at Emmaus Work In his early engravings he made for Cornelis Schut, Witdoeck followed a traditional style similar to that of Cornelis Galle and his workshop. This early style was characterized by dry lines using many curves and an emphasis on plasticity. Witdoeck made two engravings after paintings of Cornelis Schut and nine Madonna images, usually of a small size. His style became more fluid while he worked at Rubens' workshop where he produced his best work. At Rubens' workshop Witdoeck learned to engrave large plates. Witdoeck worked between 1634 and 1638 under the close supervision of Rubens on many engravings, including Abraham and Melchizedek, the Adoration of the Magi, the three-part Raising of the Cross, the Supper at Emmaus, Saint Ildefonso receiving the chasuble, Cicero and Demosthenes. Rubens specified the year 1638 for all these prints likely so that he only needed to apply for one printing privilege for the lot. The following year an Assumption of Mary and the Miracle of St. Just by Witdoeck were published. Witdoeck also produced a few undated prints while at Rubens' workshop. M. Tullius Cicero It is clear from the revision and production process of these prints that Rubens was closely involved in their design and execution. This is documented by the process of the creation of a series of twelve plates after antique marble portrait sculptures (heads, busts, herms) by the four printmakers Hans Witdoeck, Paulus Pontius, Lucas Vorsterman, and Boetius √† Bolswert working for Rubens. The production of the prints was closely supervised by Rubens as is demonstrated by five retouched proof impressions. Only six of Rubens' preparatory drawings for the series have survived.Twelve Famous Greek and Roman Men / Sophocles Sophili F. Atheniensis at the British Museum Witdoeck showed in his prints after Rubens a great skill in capturing the movement and variety of colour in the original works through his clever use of black, grey and white tones. A typical example is Abraham and Melchizedek.  References Further reading *A. MICHIELS, Histoire de la peinture Flamande, 8 (1869), pp. 382, 387. *A. MICHEL, Histoire de l‚Äôart, 6 (1922), 856f. *W.

It is one of the largest youth clubs in the United Kingdom, with a membership of over 4,000 young people. Based in Bolton's town centre, the Club is open 7 days a week, 51 weeks a year and welcomes all young people aged 8 to 19 years old (up to 21 for young people with disabilities). Bolton Lads and Girls Club offers a range of targeted and universal provisions including sports, arts, mentoring and community outreach work.  History  Bolton Lads and Girls Club was established in 1889 in Bark Street, Bolton, during a time of great industrial and social change, by two church leaders and three industrialists, who decided they needed to help improve the lives of young people in Bolton. The Club was open every evening from 7 pm to 9:30 pm and provided a place to wash and eat, as well as a reading room, gymnasium and a games room that offered football, cricket, swimming, harriers, chess club, and wood turning. The Club also ran an annual camping holiday. In June 1890 the Club was officially opened by the Bishop of Manchester, Dr Moorhouse, and in his opening speech he stated that when he first came to Bolton it struck him that the whole of this part of the country was covered with houses and human beings and that he could not see where there would be any open spaces for breathing or exercising. He commended the Club founders saying, \\"they could do not a greater service to a youth than to give him opportunities for healthy outdoor exercise.\\" An extract from the 1896 Club Review shows how quickly the Club became popular: Bolton Lads and Girls Club has been active in Bolton since 1889 \\"They came in their hundreds, for of all animals, lads are perhaps the most gregarious. They came to meet their fellows under conditions somewhat more comfortable and convenient than their natural meeting place, the street. They initially came for amusement and for games and for nothing else, and if we had told them it was our intention to improve them they would certainly not have come. But it is interesting how quickly their attitude to the Club has changed, it is no longer our Club, it is theirs, and we merely manage it for them. It is no longer a mere place of amusement, but is a place which plays a real part in their lives, it is a place for honour and for success.\\" In 2002 Bolton Lads and Girls Club opened a purpose-built, state of the art youth facility in the town centre from where they provide a range of universal and targeted services that are fully accessible and affordable at 50 pence per session. The Prime Minister David Cameron visited the Lads and Girls Club in 2010. In July 2012, David Cameron gave the Club's Chief Executive, Karen Edwards OBE a number of tickets to the 2012 Summer Olympics in response to the 2011 England riots, and to specific people who had contributed to their communities and the \\"Big Society\\" policy.

He ascended to become the personal physician of Victor Emmanuel, king of Italy, and he convinced Albert Einstein to become patron of a conference organised by him. Early life Leander Tomarkin was born on 13 December 1895 in Zollikon, Switzerland. A doctor's son, he was the black sheep of the family, obtaining bad results at school and dropping a chemistry degree at college. He also soon developed a reputation of dishonesty. He did not take up regular employment but spent his time in his father's laboratory, hoping to invent something. Tomarkin rose to fame when he offered to cure Pope Benedict XV pneumonia in January 1922. The Pope died without Tomarkin being allowed to treat him but reporters subsequently picked up the story and enabled the progress of Tomarkin's medical career with publicising his Antimicrobum tomarkin medicine, whose active ingredient he named Aminoortobenzoilsulfoisoamiloidrocupronucleinforminsodico. The Antimicrobum was to reduce pneumonia mortality from about one third to 2%. Tomarkin was allowed to treat a cousin of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, and the cousin recovered. As a result, the king named Tomarkin the personal physician of the family. A clinical test at the Santo Spirito hospital in Rome was also successful, later attributed to the better care for test patient and the relatively early stage of pneumonia that the patients were in. Tomarkin- Foundation Chemistry Research In May 1924 Tomarkin emigrated to the United States, and three years later founded Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research. At this research centre he developed Catalysan and Disulphamin, claiming that these medicines bring about mood changes and treat sickness in that way. The Tomarkin Foundation soon spread to Europe. Its dependency in Locarno started to organise conferences between 1930 and 1938. These conferences were set beautifully and had rich side programs and thus attracted prominent people such as surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch. In 1931 Albert Einstein assumed the honorary presidency of the conference. Einstein only stayed in that position for one year, after a former landlady of Tomarkin contacted him to help retrieve debts. At the onset of World War II Tomarkin again emigrated to the US, due to his Jewish ancestry. With the development of industrially manufactured antibiotics in 1939 his medical invention became obsolete. He ventured into other areas, trying to invent waterproof paint and synthetic diamonds but was unsuccessful with both. Tomarkin died in 1967.

The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) manages Singapore‚Äôs foreign reserves; Temasek Holdings is an investment company owned by the Government of Singapore. Prior to running for Singapore‚Äôs elected presidency, President Tony Tan was Executive Director of GIC.Istana, Biography of the President. An example of an effort to build up social reserves, he said, was the way that he had expanded Singapore's President's Challenge charity event to go beyond fund-raising to promote volunteerism and social entrepreneurship.Leong Wai Kit, ‚ÄúS‚Äôpore needs both financial and ‚Äòsocial‚Äô reserves to thrive: President Tony Tan‚Äù, Today, 6 November 2013.

He has taught at the University of Paris X-Nanterre, at the University of California Irvine and is currently an Anniversary Chair Professor at the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy (CRMEP) at Kingston University and a Visiting Professor at the Department of French and Romance Philology at Columbia University. Life Balibar was born in Avallon, Yonne, Burgundy, France in 1942, and first rose to prominence as one of Althusser's pupils at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure. He entered the √âcole normale sup√©rieure in 1960. In 1961, Balibar joined the Parti communiste fran√ßais. He was expelled in 1981 for critiquing the party's policy on immigration in an article. Balibar participated in Louis Althusser's seminar on Karl Marx's Das Kapital in 1965. This seminar resulted in the book Reading Capital, co-authored by Althusser and his students. Balibar's chapter, \\"On the Basic Concepts of Historical Materialism,\\" was republished along with those of Althusser in the book's abridged version (trans. 1970), until a complete translation was published in 2016. In 1987, he received his doctorate degree in philosophy from the Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen in the Netherlands. He received his habilitation from the Universit√© Paris I in 1993. Balibar joined the University of Paris X-Nanterre as a professor in 1994, and the University of California, Irvine in 2000. He became Professor Emeritus of Paris X in 2002. His daughter with the physicist Fran√ßoise Balibar is the actress Jeanne Balibar.  Work  In Masses, Classes and Ideas, Balibar argues that in Das Kapital (or Capital), the theory of historical materialism comes into conflict with the critical theory that Marx begins to develop, particularly in his analysis of the category of labor, which in capitalism becomes a form of property. This conflict involves two distinct uses of the term \\"labor\\": labor as the revolutionary class subject (i.e., the \\"proletariat\\") and labor as an objective condition for the reproduction of capitalism (the \\"working class\\"). In The German Ideology, Marx conflates these two meanings, and treats labor as, in Balibar‚Äôs words, the \\"veritable site of truth as well as the place from which the world is changed...\\" In Capital, however, the disparity between the two senses of labor becomes apparent. One manifestation of this is the virtual disappearance in the text of the term \\"proletariat.\\" As Balibar points out, the term appears only twice in the first edition of Capital, published in 1867: in the dedication to Wilhelm Wolff and in the two final sections on the \\"General Law of Capitalist Accumulation\\". For Balibar, this implies that \\"the emergence of a revolutionary form of subjectivity (or identity)... is never a specific property of nature, and therefore brings with it no guarantees, but obliges us to search for the conditions in a conjuncture that can precipitate class struggles into mass movements...\\". Moreover, \\"[t]here is no proof‚Ä¶ that these forms are always and eternally the same (for example, the party-form, or the trade union).\\" In \\"The Nation Form: History and Ideology,\\"Balibar, Etienne. \\"The Nation Form: History and Ideology.\\" Trans. Immanuel Wallerstein and Chris Turner Review (Fernand Braudel Center 13.3 (1990): 329-361. Balibar critiques modern conceptions of the nation-state. He states that he is undertaking a study of the contradiction of the nation-state because \\"Thinking about racism led us back to nationalism, and nationalism to uncertainty about the historical realities and categorization of the nation\\" (329). Balibar contends that it is impossible to pinpoint the beginning of a nation or to argue that the modern people who inhabit a nation-state are the descendants of the nation that preceded it. Balibar argues that, because no nation-state has an ethnic base, every nation-state must create fictional ethnicities in order to project stability on the populace: Etienne Balibar with Judith Butler in Berkeley, 2014 > \\"the idea of nations without a state, or nations 'before' the state, is thus > a contradiction in terms, because a state always is implied in the historic > framework of a national formation (even if not necessarily within the limits > of its territory). But this contradiction is masked by the fact that > national states, whose integrity suffers from internal conflicts that > threaten its survival (regional conflicts, and especially class conflicts), > project beneath their political existence to a preexisting 'ethnic' or > 'popular' unity\\" (331) In order to minimize these regional, class, and race conflicts, nation-states fabricate myths of origin that produce the illusion of shared ethnicity among all their inhabitants. In order to create these myths of origins, nation- states scour the historical period during which they were \\"formed\\" to find justification for their existence. They also create the illusion of shared ethnicity through linguistic communities: when everyone has access to the same language, they feel as if they share an ethnicity. Balibar argues that \\"schooling is the principal institution which produces ethnicity as linguistic community\\" (351). In addition, this ethnicity is created through the \\"nationalization of the family,\\" meaning that the state comes to perform certain functions that might traditionally be performed by the family, such as the regulation of marriages and administration of social security.

Location  The Kesselberg is located, like the Kalmit, in the mountain range of Haardt between the Edenkobener valley in the north and the Modenbach valley in the south. From the Rhine Plain the mountain is hidden behind the Bl√§ttersberg (618 m). Views over the surrounding regions in the Palatine Forest are blocked by the trees that cover the summit.  Gletschermulden  On the summit plateau are various rocks, named on hiking maps as the Gletschermulden, with striking round depressions in the Bunter sandstone of which they are composed. In addition to an unprovable theory that they were originally Celtic sacrifice bowls, there is also an theory that they are glacial potholes or mills. However, they would require a thick ice sheet to have covered the region and there is no evidence, such as glacial stria, anywhere in the Palatine region. It is thus questionable whether this could have been a periglacial site in the last ice age, as has been posited. A new interpretation suggests the depressions were simply formed by weathering processes in the various layers of sandstone. The old signpost on the Kesselberg has been replaced by a new one. It discusses the formation of the depressions in both an amusing, but also a scientific, way.  Access The summit may be climbed from the trail forks at Benderplatz and Kohlplatz. From the main trail that links both junctions, a smaller footpath branches off, leading to the summit. This footpath was blazed in 1953 by the historian, Friedrich Sprater, and named after him. The Benderplatz may be reached from the Lolosruhe car park and the Forsthaus Heldenstein (a former forester's lodge), the Kohlplatz from the Modenbach valley and the Edenkobener valley near the Edenkobener Hut.

He is most known as a crewmember of the Kon-Tiki raft expedition from South America to French Polynesia in 1947. Erik Hasselberg's camera from the Kon-Tiki expedition Erik Hesseberg's sextant from the Kon-Tiki expedition Biography Erik Hesselberg was born at Brevik in Telemark, Norway. He grew up at Larvik in Vestfold. He knew Thor Heyerdahl from his childhood years. Having graduated from his secondary school, Erik Hesselberg went on to a sailors' school and later worked as a professional sailor for five years, making several trips around the world. Later Hesselberg studied art in Hamburg, Germany. He stayed in Germany when World War II began, so he could not return to Norway and started working as a decorator in Braunschweig. In 1945, he and his German-born wife, Liselotte (Liss) G√ºldner, relocated to Lillehammer, Norway.Stationen eines Lebens. Der Kosmopolit Heinrich Heidersberger Kon-Tiki expedition In 1947, Hesselberg lived in the village of Borre and worked as a painter. Thor Heyerdahl approached him and invited to become a navigator on the Kon-Tiki expedition. During the trip, he worked as an astronavigator and cartographer as he was the only professional sailor. He painted the large Kon-Tiki figure on the raft's main sail. Also, he drew sketches, took photographs, carved wooden statuettes, and played guitar. Later years After the expedition, Hesselberg wrote and illustrated his only book Kon-Tiki og Jeg (Dreyers Vorlag. 1949) The book was since been translated into a number of languages including English. Later he built and lived on his own ship sailing for 11 years to in such places as C√¥te d'Azur, Corsica and Italy, while working as a sculptor and painter. Among his friends were Pablo Picasso, Georges Simenon, Jean Cocteau, and Carl Nesjar. Subsequently, he sold his ship and lived in the United States, Germany, and Sweden, until his final return in 1969‚Äì1970 to Larvik. He was married several times and had three children: daughter Anne Karin Hesselberg (b. 1946), son Caelou Hesselberg (b. 1958), and daughter Susanna Hesselberg (b. 1967). Hesselberg died in Larvik at age 58 of a heart condition and was buried there. He left many photographic pictures, graphic works, sculptures, and more than 200 songs for guitar.

The group was set up in October 2010 and held its first demonstration that month in Amsterdam, Netherlands, at the trial of Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders.  Dutch Defence League  Dutch Defence League logo The Dutch Defence League was a Dutch offshoot of the English Defence League and member of the European Defence League. The organisation's spokesman was Bert Jansen.  EDL offshoot  The DDL was affiliated with EFI, the European Freedom Initiative, and with English Defence League offshoots in other countries. Although many followers support The Freedom Party from Geert Wilders, they are not affiliated. In February, members of the DDL attended an English Defence League march in Luton, England. On 13 June 2011 the group announced the immediate termination of its activities.  Controversy  The DDL distances itself from neo-Nazi ideas by explicitly stating the following phrase in their charter; The DDL rejects Nazi-ideologies the same way as it rejects radical Islamism and further it sincerely respects every human being, no matter the race, religion or lifestyle. In prelude to the demonstration in Amsterdam on 30 October 2010, the media predicted a clash between Ajax hooligans and EDL members who would visit Amsterdam from England. The concern for a clash reached the point to which the mayor decided to move the demonstration to another location, a decision the DDL wanted to fight in courtDagelijkse Standaard: Van der Laan maakte slapende honden wakker. but later reconsidered and refrained from doing so.  Demonstrations  On 30 October 2010, members of the Dutch Defence League rallied in Amsterdam, together with some English Defence League members, and protested for freedom of speech and in support of Geert Wilders. Wilders, a Dutch politician also against radical Islam, indicated he was not too happy with the demonstration.Wilders is not happy with demonstration EDL After the demonstration the city concluded that there were no major problems Norwegian Defence League The Norwegian Defence League is a Norwegian anti- Islam group closely associated with the English Defence League (EDL). The NDL is an offshoot of the European Defence League and was formed around New Year 2010/2011, inspired by the EDL which had been formed in 2009. There were conflicts regarding the leadership of the group, and it was immersed in a struggle involving multiple competing factions in early 2011. The group was eventually led by Lena Andreassen for about a month until she was dismissed by EDL appointed liaison officer Steve Simmons following a failed demonstration that was held on 9 April 2011. The NDL has been headed by a board of administrators since then, and one of its leading figures has been Ronny Alte. Alte said that the group is not far-right or racist and that the NDL seeks to gather people of all races to fight for democracy and freedom of speech, which he said is threatened by \\"the ideology Islam.\\" He also said that the group is not anti-Islam, but Islam-critical. Alte resigned abruptly both as leader and member of the NDL on 19 April 2012 over a dispute with the rest of the organisation's leadership related to its connection with Anders Behring Breivik. Following Alte's resignation the NDL website was taken offline. Other sources claim that Ronny Alte was removed from his position after refusing to follow advice from the administration team of the NDL. A new website, with the old layout, has appeared at a .info address rather than the old one which was a .com address. EDL offshoot The group uses Facebook for organisation. The NDL had more than 1,300 members on its closed Facebook group by September 2011 and had more than 30,000 likes on its open Facebook page that year. Rivalries existed between several different Facebook groups all vying for the support of the English Defence League, at least until August 2011. One of these were created by Ronny Alte. According to the British anti-fascist Searchlight magazine in a 26 July 2011 press release, the NDL's Facebook page was administered by Steve Simmons who was appointed European Liaison Officer by EDL Leader Tommy Robinson aka Steven Lennon. The role of Anders Behring Breivik In December 2009 Anders Behring Breivik, the convicted perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, proposed a group similar to the English Defence League in a forum post. It is not known whether Breivik was in fact part of establishing the organization, although it has been claimed that he was. Whether Breivik actually was a member of the Norwegian Defence League is also debated, as Breivik is said to deny it. Three of the organization's past leaders said he was a member. Following the 2011 Norway attacks on 22 July, it was revealed that Anders Behring Breivik had formerly been a member of the NDL. Breivik has been identified as a member of the NDL under the pseudonym \\"Sigurd Jorsalfar\\" (after the medieval Norwegian crusader-king Sigurd the Crusader). The first documented initiative for establishing a Norwegian sister organization to the EDL had also originated in a forum post by Breivik on the Norwegian website Document.no on 6 December 2009. There Breivik proposes to establish a Norwegian version of the English Defence League. Breivik writes that he sees this as the only way to stop left-wing radical groups like Blitz and SOS Rasisme from harassing Norwegian cultural conservatives. According to the newspaper Dagbladet, Breivik however denies to have been a member of the NDL. Lena Andreassen states that Breivik was ejected from the organization when she took over as leader because he was too extreme, while Ronny Alte and H√•var Krane have said that Breivik left because he thought the group was too mild regarding its methods. Breivik's perceived connection to the NDL is seen as a major problem for the group in the area of recruiting new members. Formation The founding of NDL was inspired by the English Defence League, and took place around New Year 2010/2011. In February 2011, 22-year- old Remi Huseby from Haugesund emerged as its spokesperson during an EDL rally in Luton, England. At this point the group was immersed in conflict, as according to newspaper Dagbladet, reportedly \\"Nazi sympathizers, nationalists and more moderate opponents of Islam\\" vied for control over the group. On 28 February the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) announced it was watching the NDL, which it defined as an \\"extreme right group.\\" In its annual public threat assessment for 2011, the PST expressed concern about the emergence of groups hostile to Islam. It judged that online activism, particularly in social media, could cause a rise in xenophobia, and that this in turn could lead to polarization within and between extreme political movements. Furthermore, it stated that an increase in activism could lead to more violence, particularly in connection with political rallies. On 1 March Huseby left the group as he said it had been \\"overtaken by Nazis.\\" Later that month, on 19 March, Lena Andreassen became the leader of the group after an internal power-struggle. Having announced in an interview six days earlier that she sought to rid the group of neo-Nazis, she stated in April that such supporters of the group had now been \\"weeded out\\" after an internal \\"Nazi hunt\\". She said that she had cooperated with the Oslo police to get rid of \\"unwanted persons\\", and that she had close contacts with PST. Although in the start-up phase, she announced that the group sought to establish so-called \\"divisions\\" in various Norwegian cities. A local Troms√∏ newspaper iTroms√∏ wrote that a soon-to-resign sergeant in the Home Guard Task Force was \\"central\\" in the effort there, although Andreassen denied that he had been given any special role. By 1 April it was reported that the group had in excess of 300 supporters on its Facebook page. Andreassen stated that \\"[the NDL] is not against ordinary Muslims, only the fundamentalist groups\\", and said that the NDL has Muslim members. She has said that the NDL also opposes radical Norwegian extreme right groups. Both Andreassen and former spokesperson Remi Huseby has previously joined the EDL for demonstrations in England. A demonstration was announced for 26 March on the group's web pages. Permission from the police to protest was never sought, and the leader, Andreassen, warned members against taking part. On 9 April, the day of the anniversary of the German invasion of Norway in 1940, the NDL organised a protest against what it called a \\"Muslim occupation of Norway\\" at Akershus Fortress in Oslo. Before the demonstration was held, both the NDL and the police confirmed that the NDL was under threat from both extreme left and extreme right groups, the latter due to their expulsion from the group. The demonstration failed to gather more than a dozen supporters, while a representative of the EDL held a guest appeal. Then-leader Lena Andreassen also gave a speech to the NDL protesters who had turned up. At the same time, an anti-racist counter-protest at Jernbanetorget nearby gathered between 700 and 1,000 people. The police later stated that both demonstrations had been peaceful, and without clashes. Four days after the demonstration, on 13 April, the EDL broke its ties with the NDL's then-present leadership. Lena Andreassen and her leadership was subsequently thrown out of the group. Andreassen would then resign her membership completely. Following the failed demonstration, Ronny Alte, a high school teacher from Stokke, Vestfold, was announced as the new leader of the NDL. He stated in an interview in August that ever since the leadership struggle earlier that year, the organization has been led by five administrators (including Alte), supported by the leadership of the EDL. Alte said that the organization distances itself from any use of violence, and he also asserted that it has become a gentler organization than under its previous leadership. He also maintained that the NDL supports the nation of Israel. Infiltration On 11 March 2012 Norwegian tabloid Dagbladet wrote that during 2010 and until the spring of 2011 the leadership of the NDL was infiltrated by members of the left-wing anti-racist group SOS Rasisme. Several anonymous sources told the newspaper that the anti-racists in fact commanded a majority on the board. One of the sources, an SOS Rasisme member, was one of the NDL board members. Another anti-racist, whom the sources named as an NDL board member, denied those claims. The anti-racists were using false identities and were reporting directly back to SOS Rasisme. According to the newspaper, Lena Andreassen who was leader of the NDL in the spring of 2011 didn't know about the infiltration. Ronny Alte, NDL spokesperson , confirmed they had come to realize that there were infiltrators in the NDL in 2011. In 2013 it was also revealed that NDL had been infiltrated by informants working for the Norwegian Police Security Service. These infiltrators were also able to acquire very central positions, wrote speeches for the official spokesperson and may even have played an important role in establishing a working organization. The most active of the informants claims to have expelled Anders Behring Breivik from NDL in 2010. On 4 August 2011, TV 2 revealed that H√•var Krane, a mayoral candidate in Kristiansund for the marginal, right-wing Democrats party who had served as the leader of the NDL for three weeks during an early transitional period, had talked about his desire of \\"putting a Glock in the neckhole\\" of Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re and \\"blocking all the exits with Molotov cocktails\\" during the government cabinet's Christmas dinner. The secretly recorded informal conversation between Krane and Kaspar Birkeland, another member of the Democrats party and mayoral candidate in neighboring √Ölesund, had taken place during a meeting in Oslo organized by the Stop Islamisation of Norway group in February 2011. According to TV 2, an investigation in late August of the electoral lists for the 2011 local elections revealed that eight politicians, representing five different parties, had been members of the NDL's Internet forum. In addition to Krane and Birkeland, also Magnar Tanem, candidate for mayor in Oslo for the Christian Unity Party had been a member of the forum. Resignation of Ronny Alte On 19 April 2012, on the fourth day of the trial of Anders Behring Breivik, Ronny Alte, who had been called to witness for the defence, announced his resignation from both his position on the organisation's leadership group, called the \\"admins\\", and from the NDL. Alte claimed that he had wanted to distance himself from Breivik as much as possible but that the rest of the \\"admin\\" community had told him not to talk to the media. He said he was considering starting a group of his own. Activities The Norwegian Defence League, in cooperation with Stop Islamisation of Norway, held its first successful public rally in Stavanger on 23 June 2012. Around 40 people participated according to the police who also called the protest \\"peaceful\\". Some counter-protesters, however, were fined for refusing to leave the area. In addition to protesting the \\"Islamisation of Norway and Europe\\", the Norwegian parliament's recent decision to change the constitution to relinquish Christianity as state religion and equate all religions was also protested. A counter-rally was organized and police in combat attire physically separated the groups. SOS Rasisme was expelled from the counter-rally and later protested that it was \\"too passive.\\" On 28 February 2013, newspaper Verdens Gang wrote that the NDL had published a list of Muslims on its web page. The list had been compiled on the basis of listings in the Public Entity Registry. Lars Johnny Aardal, deputy leader of the NDL, said that it was published \\"to show the extent of Islam and Muslims in Norway\\". Former secretary general of the Islamic Council Norway characterized the list as \\"frightening\\" and \\"fear-mongering\\". Senior scientist at the Norwegian Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities, Terje Emberland, told the paper that such a list had only been made once before in Norway, when an anti-semite in the 1930s published a list of Jewish businesses in Norway. He also said that \\"In this way, the NDL clearly exposes its character, and aligns with the fascist and racist tradition to which it belongs.\\" Scottish Defence League The Scottish Defence League (SDL) is active in Scotland, although some activists in the country identify primarily with the EDL. Like the EDL, the group protested against the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013. It claimed 4,000 members at the time of the murder in May 2013. Aberdeen City Council rejected a bid from the SDL to march on 29 June 2013 due to Armed Forces Day marches on the same day and plans to pass a local mosque. The SDL held a static protest in Pollokshields on 27 July, the birthday of local Kriss Donald, the white victim of Scotland's first-ever race murder in 2004. Hogesa Hogesa or Hooligans against Salafists () is a German street movement mainly originating from right-wing hooligan groups from all over the country. The movement purports to oppose the rise of Salafism in Germany. Their demonstrations have attracted between roughly 3,000 and 5,000 people. It is an offshoot of the European Defence League, which itself is an offshoot of the English Defence League. Some segments of the media have described the movement as Islamophobic. The majority of the group's organizing occurs online.Hooligans streiten √ºber weitere Aufm√§rsche ‚Äì In den Farben und der Sache getrennt, tagesschau.de vom 29.

On 31 March 2012, the European Defence League held their first major event, in Aarhus, Denmark. Robinson had hoped for an attendance of 700, although it was later estimated at around 160, with only 15 English activists in attendance. Local police made 80 arrests at the rally. The rally also faced a left-wing counter- demonstration. Academic Matthew Goodwin stated that despite the low attendance, the links and networking from the event would be significant.

In it, Hobsbawm comments on what he sees as the disastrous failures of state socialism, capitalism, and nationalism; he offers an equally skeptical take on the progress of the arts and changes in society in the latter half of the twentieth century. Hobsbawm calls the period from the start of World War I to the fall of the so-called Soviet bloc \\"the short twentieth century\\", to follow on \\"the long 19th century\\", the period from the start of the French Revolution in 1789 to the start of World War I in 1914, which he covered in an earlier trilogy of histories (The Age of Revolution: Europe, 1789-1848, The Age of Capital: 1848‚Äì1875, The Age of Empire: 1875‚Äì1914). In the United States, the book was published with the subtitle A History of the World, 1914‚Äì1991 (). The book made the British best seller list and was translated in thirty languages.

Towards the Millennium Failure of prediction Hobsbawm points out the abysmal record of recent attempts to predict the world's future. \\"The record of forecasters in the past thirty or forty years, whatever their professional qualification as prophets, has been so spectacularly bad that only governments and economic research institutes still have, or pretend to have, much confidence in it.\\"The Age of Extremes, pp. 5-6 [all page numbers are from Time Warner Books, 2002 Abacus edition reprint.] He quotes President Calvin Coolidge, in a message to Congress on December 4, 1928, on the eve of the Great Depression, as saying \\"The country can regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism.\\" The Age of Extremes, p.85 Speaking of the future himself, Hobsbawm largely confines himself to predicting continued turmoil: \\"The world of the third millennium will therefore almost certainly continue to be one of violent politics and violent political changes. The only thing uncertain about them is where they will lead,\\"The Age of Extremes, p.460 and expressing the view that \\"If humanity is to have a recognizable future, it cannot be by prolonging the past or the present.\\" The Age of Extremes, p. 585 In one of his few more concrete predictions, he writes that \\"Social distribution and not growth would dominate the politics of the new millennium.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.77 Failure of communism The Russian Revolution of 1917 was not the revolution of the most advanced capitalist societies predicted by Karl Marx. As Hobsbawm puts it, \\"Capitalism had proved far easier to overthrow where it was weak or barely existed than in its heartlands.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.82 Even within Russia, Hobsbawm doubts the ostensibly \\"progressive\\" effects of the revolution: \\"What remained [after revolution and civil war] was a Russia even more firmly anchored in the past... [W]hat actually governed the country was an undergrowth of smaller and larger bureaucracy, on average even less educated and qualified than before.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.379 It is a central thesis of Hobsbawm's book that, from the start, State Socialism betrayed the socialist and internationalist vision it claimed to uphold. In particular, State Socialism always dispensed with the democratic element of the socialist vision: \\"Lenin... concluded from the start that the liberal horse was not a runner in the Russian revolutionary race.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.58 This anti-liberalism ran deep. In 1933, with Benito Mussolini firmly in control of Italy, \\"Moscow insisted that the Italian communist leader P. Togliatti withdraw the suggestion that, perhaps, social-democracy was not the primary danger, at least in Italy.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.104 As for support for international revolution, \\"The communist revolutions actually made (Yugoslavia, Albania, later China) were made against Stalin's advice. The Soviet view was that, both internationally and within each country, post-war politics should continue within the framework of the all-embracing anti-fascist alliance.... There is no doubt that Stalin meant all this seriously, and tried to prove it by dissolving the Comintern in 1943, and the Communist Party of the United States in 1944.The Age of Extremes, p.168 \\"[T]he Chinese Communist regime, though it criticized the USSR for betraying revolutionary movements after the break between the two countries, has no comparable record of practical support for Third World liberation movements.\\"The Age of Extremes, p. 72 On the other hand, he is no friend of the Maoist doctrine of perpetual revolution: \\"Mao was fundamentally convinced of the importance of struggle, conflict and high tension as something that was not only essential to life but prevented the relapse into the weaknesses of the old Chinese society, whose very insistence on unchanging permanence and harmony had been its weakness.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.469 Hobsbawm draws a straight line from this belief to the disastrous Great Leap Forward and the subsequent Chinese famine of 1959‚Äì1961.The Age of Extremes, pp.468-9 Socialism, Hobsbawm argues, ultimately fell because, eventually, \\"...hardly anyone believed in the system or felt any loyalty to it, not even those who governed it.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.488Danny Yee, The Age of Extremes, 1994 End of imperialism Hobsbawm has very mixed feelings about the end of the nineteenth-century imperial order, largely because he is no happier with the nation-states that replaced the empires. \\"[World War I]... had made the habitual and sensible process of international negotiation suspect as 'secret diplomacy'. This was largely a reaction against the secret treaties arranged among the Allies during the war... The Bolsheviks, discovering these sensitive documents in the Tsarist archives, had promptly published them for the world to read.\\" The Age of Extremes, p.34 \\"The botched peace settlements after 1918 multiplied what we, at the end of the twentieth century, know to be the fatal virus of democracy, namely the division of the body of citizens exclusively along ethnic-national or religious lines.\\" The Age of Extremes, p.139 \\"The reductio ad absurdum of... anti-colonialist logic was the attempt by an extremist Jewish fringe group in Palestine to negotiate with the Germans (via Damascus, then under the Vichy French) for help in liberating Palestine from the British, which they regarded as the top priority for Zionism. (A militant of the group involved in this mission eventually became prime minister of Israel: Yitzhak Shamir.)\\" The Age of Extremes, p.172 Failure of free-market capitalism None of this throws Hobsbawm into the embrace of free-market capitalism: \\"Those of us who lived through the years of the Great Slump still find it almost impossible to understand how the orthodoxies of the pure free market, then so obviously discredited, once again came to preside over a global period of depression in the late 1980s and 1990s, which once again, they were equally unable to understand or to deal with.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.103 \\"As it happened, the regimes most deeply committed to laissez-faire economics were also sometimes, and notably in the case of Reagan's United States and Thatcher's Britain, profoundly and viscerally nationalist and distrustful of the outside world. The historian cannot but note that the two attitudes are contradictory.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.412 He points up the irony that \\"[T]he most dynamic and rapidly growing economy of the globe after the fall of Soviet socialism was that of Communist China, leading Western business-school lectures and the authors of management manuals, a flourishing genre of literature, to scan the teachings of Confucius for the secrets of entrepreneurial success.\\"The Age of Extremes, pp.412-413 Ultimately, in world terms, he sees capitalism being just as much of a failure as state socialism: \\"The belief, following neoclassical economics, that unrestricted international trade would allow the poorer countries to come closer to the rich, runs counter to historical experience as well as common sense. [The examples of successful export-led Third World industrialization usually quoted -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea ‚Äî represent less than two percent of the Third World population].\\" (brackets in the original)The Age of Extremes, p.571 Fascism Denying fascism's claim to philosophical respectability, Hobsbawm writes: \\"Theory was not the strong point of movements devoted to the inadequacies of reason and rationalism and the superiority of instinct and will\\", and further on the same page: \\"Mussolini could have readily dispensed with his house philosopher, Giovanni Gentile, and Hitler probably neither knew nor cared about the support of the philosopher Heidegger.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.117 Instead, he claims, the popular appeal of fascism lay with its claims to technocratic achievement: \\"Was not the proverbial argument in favour of fascist Italy that 'Mussolini made the trains run on time'?\\"The Age of Extremes, p.124 He also writes: \\"Would the horror of the holocaust be any less if historians concluded that it exterminated not six millions but five or even four?\\"The Age of Extremes, p.43 Hobsbawm's use of statistics Hobsbawm often uses statistics to paint a broad picture of a society at a particular time. With reference to the contemporary United States (at the time of writing) he points out, \\"In 1991, 58 per cent of all black families in the United States were headed by a single woman and 70 per cent of all children were born to single mothers,\\"The Age of Extremes, p.322 and \\"In 1991 15 per cent of what was proportionally the largest prison population in the world ‚Äî 426 prisoners per 100,000 population -- were said to be mentally ill.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.337 He finds damning statistics to back up his claim of the total failure of state socialism to promote the general welfare: \\"In 1969, Austrians, Finns and Poles could expect to die at the same average age (70.1 years) but in 1989, Poles had a life expectancy about four years shorter than Austrians and Finns,\\"The Age of Extremes, p.472 \\"...The great [Chinese] famine of 1959-61, probably the greatest famine of the twentieth century: According to official Chinese statistics, the country's population in 1959 was 672.07 millions. At the natural growth rate of the preceding seven years, which was at least 20 per thousand per year, one would have expected the Chinese population in 1961 to have been 699 millions. In fact it was 658.59 millions or forty millions less than might have been expected.\\" The Age of Extremes, pp.466-467, note Similarly, \\"Brazil, a monument to social neglect, had a GNP per capita almost two-and-a-half as large as Sri Lanka in 1939, and over six times as large at the end of the 80s. In Sri Lanka, which had subsidized basic foodstuffs and given free education and health care until the later 1970s, the average newborn could expect to live several years longer than the average Brazilian, and to die as an infant at about half the Brazilian rate in 1969, at a third of the Brazilian rate in 1989. The percentage of illiteracy in 1989 was about twice as great in Brazil as on the Asian island.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.577 Hobsbawm on the arts Hobsbawm writes on Post-war modernist art practice: :\\"...consisted largely in a series of increasingly desperate gimmicks by which artists sought to give their work an immediately recognizable individual trademark, a succession of manifestos of despair... or of gestures reducing the sort of art which was primarily bought for investment and its collectors ad absurdum, as by adding an individual's name to piles of brick or soil ('minimal art') or by preventing it from becoming such a commodity through making it too short-lived to be permanent ('performance art'). :\\"The smell of impending death rose from these avant-gardes. The future was no longer theirs, though nobody knew whose it was. More than ever, they knew themselves to be on the margin.\\"The Age of Extremes, pp.516-517 Hobsbawm on popular culture Hobsbawm also comments on popular culture, a subject he has left alone in other books. He writes, \\"Buddy Holly, Janis Joplin, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix and a number of other popular divinities fell victim of a life-style designed for early death. What made such deaths symbolic was that youth, which they represented, was impermanent by definition.\\"The Age of Extremes, p.324 Of these, Joplin's and Hendrix's deaths were drug-related; Jones's may have been (the coroner's verdict was \\"death by misadventure\\"; there has been much controversy surrounding the events leading to his death); Holly died in a plane crash and Marley of cancer. However, he does use youth culture as a lens to view the changes in the late-twentieth- century social order: :\\"The novelty of the new youth culture was threefold. :\\"First, 'youth' was not seen as a preparatory stage of adulthood but, in some sense, as the final stage of full human development. As in sport, the human activity in which youth is supreme, and which now defined the ambitions of more human beings than any other, life clearly went downhill after the age of thirty... :\\"The second novelty of the youth culture...: it was or became dominant in the 'developed market economies'... What children could learn from their parents became less obvious than what parents did not know and children did. The role of generations was reversed. Blue jeans..., pioneered... by students who did not wish to look like their elders, came to appear... below many a grey head. :\\"The third peculiarity of the new youth culture in urban societies was its astonishing internationalism... The English language of rock lyrics was often not even translated... The heartlands of Western youth culture themselves were the opposite of culturally chauvinist... They welcomed styles imported from the Caribbean, Latin America and, from the 1980s, increasingly Africa.\\" The Age of Extremes, pp.325-327 Hobsbawm goes on to write that \\"The cultural revolution of the latest twentieth century can thus best be understood as the triumph of the individual over society, or rather, the breaking of the threads which in the past had woven human beings into social textures\\"The Age of Extremes, p.334 and evokes this as paralleling Margaret Thatcher's claim that 'There is no society, only individuals'.The Age of Extremes, p.337Margaret Thatcher (Wikiquote) Reception The book was praised for its broad scope and for its insights. Criticisms focused on the book's pessimism and Hobsbawm's alleged inability to appreciate capitalism's adaptability and contribution to living standards. Edward Said called the book \\"unsettling and powerful\\" in the London Review of Books. He also wrote that Hobsbawm's own participation in the events he narrated added to the appeal of the book, and that there was a significant overlap of history and memory in it. Moreover, Said commended Hobsbawm's ability to draw conclusions from political and economic trends in the West, but criticized him for being unaware of relevant debates in the historical study of non-Western societies. In particular, Said criticized Hobsbawm's claim that politicized religion was an exclusively Muslim phenomenon. Said also lamented the lack of \\"a view from within\\" in the book, constructed with the experiences of witnesses and activists, as opposed to the large scale and impersonal overview that Hobsbawm offered. Similarly to Said, M.E. Sharpe observed that the book was written as both history and memory. Sharpe also wrote that without historians like Hobsbawm we would be utterly lost. Francis Fukuyama wrote in Foreign Affairs that \\"it was a work of great insight coupled with extraordinary blindness\\". He commended Hobsbawm's erudition and the book's breadth but he criticized him for failing to appreciate the strengths of capitalism. Fukuyama similarly disparaged Hobsbawm's preference for centralized governments. Finally, Fukuyama was also critical of the short space that the book dedicated to capitalist Asia. Tony Judt, writing in the New York Review of Books, underlined Hobsbawm's impact on historical writing but criticized his Marxist convictions. Lawrence Freedman wrote that the book set the standards for accounts of the twentieth century and praised it for its \\"powerful analysis\\" and \\"broad sweep\\". Nevertheless, Freedman thought that Hobsbawm was not justified in seeing capitalism as an unruly and intrinsically extremist force nor did he share Hobsbawm's worry about anarchy becoming triumphant in the post-cold-war world. In his reply to Freedman's review, Hobsbawm criticized Freedman for passing his ideological beliefs as historical judgements and defended his pessimism on the world's future. https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/28 NotesExternal links * https://web.archive.org/web/20091014085320/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/hobsbawmsageofextremes.html * http://libcom.org/library/age-extremes-1914-1991-eric-hobsbawm Category:1994 non-fiction books Category:20th-century history books Category:History books about politics Category:History books about the 20th century Category:Books by Eric Hobsbawm ","title":"The Age of Extremes"},{"id":"40979626","title":"Or Noir"},{"id":"40979641","text":"The UN City (Danish: FN Byen) is located in Copenhagen, and consists of two campuses that combined house 11 United Nations agencies.

In Peru, pisco is a \\"designation of origin\\" that is reserved for the alcoholic beverage belonging to a variety of grape aguardiente produced in Peru since the late 16th century. It is the typical destillate of this country, elaborated from fermented wine of certain grapes (Vitis vinifera), whose value has crossed its borders, as evidenced by the records of shipments made through the port of Pisco to Europe and other parts of the Americas since the 17th century, places such as England, Spain, Portugal, Guatemala, Panama and United States, from the mid-19th century. It is one of the productos bandera del Per√∫ and it is only produced on the coast (up to 2000 meters above sea level) in the departments of Lima, Ica, Arequipa, Moquegua y Tacna. About the designation of origin pisco, there is a dispute between Chile and Peru.  Background  Piskos in the valley of Lunahuan√° District. In Southern Quechua language, spoken largely on the Peru previous to the arrival of the Spanish, the term pisqu (prononunced [pis.qu], also found in the chronicles as pisku, phishgo or pichiu) designates small birds. It is part of the name of the toponymy of various regions of the country, both via Southern Quechua as through other varieties of Quechua, which is often found in the form pishqu and the like. The Peruvian coast has been characterized for hosting huge populations of birds that feed on the abundant fish, especially in the \\"Sur Chico\\". In this area are found corresponding valleys of Pisco, Ica and Grande rivers. In the valley of Pisco lived a group of people more than two thousand years ago, known for its pottery and, at the time of the Inca Empire, was characterized by its remarkable products potters, called piskos. Since that time, one of these pottery products were vessels or amphoras, which were used to store beverages of all kinds, including alcoholics. These vessels were called piskos. Thus, the first grape aguardiente that was produced in Peru was stored in piskos and, over time, this beverage acquired the name of its container.  Peruvian pisco production = Making  The elaboration of Peruvian pisco is most dominated by medium-range industry, usually handicraft. This one takes care of the old manufacturing processes and quality, and often does not respond to strictly commercial purposes but a kind of generational pride of Peru. It is a producto bandera del Per√∫.

His parents were Fla√≠n Mu√±oz and his wife Justa Fern√°ndez, daughter of count Fernando Berm√∫dez de Cea. He was the paternal grandfather of Jimena D√≠az, wife of Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar El Cid,Margarita Torres Sevilla-Qui√±ones (2000-2002) argues that El Cid himself was nephew of Fernando, that the latter's father, Fla√≠n Mu√±oz, is identical to the La√≠n Nu√±ez named by Historia Roderici as paternal grandfather of El Cid. Gonzalo Mart√≠nez D√≠ez (2007) maintains that contemporary documents use Munio and Nu√±o as distinct names, and since the seemingly-complete account of Fernando's siblings does not include a Diego, El Cid's grandfather La√≠n Nu√±ez must have been a different man than Fla√≠n Mu√±oz. and the direct ancestor of the important medieval noble lineage of the Osorios. He married Elvira Pel√°ez, daughter of Pelayo Rodr√≠guez and Gotina Fern√°ndez de Cea, with whom he had at least seven children: Fla√≠n, Oveco, Justa, Pedro, Pelayo, Mu√±o and Diego. He was the tenente of Aguilar and documented with the title of count as of 1028. Jointly with his son, Fla√≠n Fern√°ndez, he governed the city of Le√≥n until 1038 when the kingdom was already under the control of King Sancho III of Pamplona.  Biographical sketch  He first appears in medieval charters in 999 when, jointly with his brother Munio, confirmed a donation by the Bishop of Le√≥n to the Monastery of Sahag√∫n. On 26 February 1020, he and his wife accompanied by several of his children founded the Monastery of San Mart√≠n de Pereda in Valle de Valdebur√≥n which was subsequently incorporated in the Monastery of Benev√≠vere.The children mentioned in this donation, which was also confirmed by King Alfonso V of Le√≥n and his wife Elvira Men√©ndez, and by Infante Bermudo (later Bermudo III), were as follows and in this order: Fla√≠n; Oveco; Pedro; Pelayo; Munio; and Diego Fern√°ndez.

As a loyal vassal of King Alfonso V of Le√≥n, he appears constantly confirming royal charters and was honored with the title of count at the end of the reign of Alfonso and at least from 1028. After the death of Alfonso V and the succession to the throne by Bermudo III of Le√≥n, Fernando supported his first cousin King Sancho III of Navarre,Justa Fern√°ndez, Fernando's mother, was the sister of Queen Jimena Fern√°ndez, mother of King Sancho III. although, at first, he accompanied the young monarch as evidenced in a donation made by Bermudo III in November 1028 to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela where he appears with other magnates confirming the royal charter. His presence in the curia regis of King Bermudo III was infrequent from 1029 until 1035 and this absence could be attributed to his involvement ‚Äî active or behind the scenes ‚Äî in the assassination of Garc√≠a S√°nchez, Count of Castile in 1029 when Garc√≠a went to the city of Le√≥n to meet Sancha, his promised bride and future wife of King Ferdinand I of Le√≥n. He was back at the court of Bermudo III to whom he remained faithful until the king was killed in the Battle of Tamar√≥n in 1037. Fernando Fla√≠nez did not hand over the capital of the Kingdom of Le√≥n to Ferdinand I until 1038 and kept all his honors and estates until his death, after 1049, the last year in which he appears in the charters of the Monastery of Sahag√∫n.  Marriage and issue  He married his first cousin, Elvira Pel√°ez, daughter of Count Pelayo Rodr√≠guez and Countess Gotina Fern√°ndez, another daughter of Fernando Berm√∫dez de Cea, and as such, also a sister of Queen Jimena and of Justa Fern√°ndez, Fernando's mother. They were the parents of the following children, all except Justa born before February 1020, the date on which they appear confirming the donation made by their parents: *Fla√≠n Fern√°ndez (died before 1065), a count, husband of Toda Fern√°ndez and father of Mart√≠n Fla√≠nez, ancestors of the Osorio; *Oveco Fern√°ndez, married to Onecca Guti√©rrez; *Pedro Fern√°ndez *Pelayo Fern√°ndez (died after June 1049), royal alf√©rez in 1039 and in 1050 and count as from 1043. He could have been the father of Fla√≠n Pel√°ez; *Munio Fern√°ndez (died after June 1049), also a count, married Elvira Pel√°ez, daughter of Count Pelayo Froilaz the Deacon and Aldonza Ord√≥√±ez, daughter of the infantes Ordo√±o Ram√≠rez and his wife Cristina Berm√∫dez. They were the parents of Countess Aldonza Mu√±oz, the wife of Count Vela Ov√©quiz. He last appears in June 1049 with his brother Pelayo; *Diego Fern√°ndez, the father of Jimena D√≠az, wife of El Cid; *Justa Fern√°ndez, named after her paternal grandmother, Justa was the second wife of Count Ansur D√≠az and step-mother of powerful count Pedro Ans√∫rez On 29 September 1047, Justa and her husband founded the Monastery of San Rom√°n.

The show was originally split into three segments. It began with a discussion between Richardson and the show's pundits of the weekend's European football (from the German Bundesliga, French Ligue 1, and Italian Serie A) along with highlights of matches played in the featured leagues. That led into the programme's featured live football match, which could've been from either the French or Italian leagues. Following the match, more discussion took place on the events of the match, and goings on from the world of football over the previous week. However, more recently the show only lasts for one 1 hour and 15 minute segment of discussion from the weekend's news, with the live match becoming a separate programme afterwards. As well as a change in format, the Portuguese Primeira Liga was added to the show's focus leagues. An additional show, named European Football Show Extra, is broadcast on the following Monday, with Richardson and the pundits discussing various football topics show-by-show.  Airings  The European Football Show is presented live every week from 18:30 to 19:30 or 19:45 (GMT) (dependent on the following game's kick-off time), mainly on BT Sport 1 but sometimes on other BT channels, it was previously shown on BT Sport Europe before the channel changed its name to BT Sport 3. When the show included a live match, it ran until 22:00. It is repeated throughout the following week. European Football Show Extra is shown on Monday nights, with repeats shown throughout the week.  Features  The chat between the pundits is broken up by a number of different features related to the past week's football: * Highlights - A round-up of the goals from one of the three featured leagues will be shown - this is repeated three times throughout the programme, once for each league, so that all goals are covered. Primeira Liga goals are also shown, but only those involving Benfica, Porto and Sporting CP. * Around the World in 80 seconds - featuring highlights from other football leagues around the world, including goals, trophy wins and comedy events. * Football Maths - Stats related to events of the past week are discussed (for example record consecutive wins if a team has won a lot of matches). * Debater Generator - A random topic which has been in the news over the past week is chosen, which the pundits then discuss. * Top 5 Goals - The programme is concluded with a compilation of the five best goals from the past week's football. * Viewer Questions - Viewers are encouraged to send in questions and discussion topics via Twitter using the #btsnf hashtag,Twitter - #btsnf some of which are then brought up on the show. * Euro Star - The pundits pick an up-and-coming young player from around Europe to showcase. * Hartbeat - A feature following Joe Hart's career in Serie A with Torino during 2016‚Äì17. * Phrase Book - A featured word from one of the league's spoken language related to football. * Transfer Rumours - The pundits have 90 seconds to dissect as many transfer rumours as possible.  Pundits  The programme is presented by James Richardson, along with regular pundits covering each of the featured leagues. These are Julien Laurens (Ligue 1), Raphael Honigstein (Bundesliga) and James Horncastle (Serie A). Other pundits and football personalities sometimes join the regular punditry team, these have included Steffen Freund, Dietmar Hamann, David Platt, David Ginola and Emmanuel Petit.

The Kassel-based Kurhessenbahn (KHB) is the first of six regional networks to be created by Deutsche Bahn AG as part of its middle class offensive. It forms a unit that is formally split into DB RegioNetz Verkehrs GmbH and DB RegioNetz Infrastruktur GmbH in order to comply with the legal requirements after separation of network and operations. The aim is to maintain low capacity utilisation by changing the organisational structure and local activities in the long term. Financial figures The Kurhessenbahn has a total of 65 stations (50 of its own) on a 275-kilometre network of five lines. 25 diesel railcars travel 2.5 million train kilometers (140 trains per day) and carry 6,500 passengers per day. This service is provided by 208 employees. The Kurhessenbahn also has a DB Class 218 diesel locomotive for freight and special transports. This is mainly used in timber traffic, which originates from the Breidenstein loading station at the Scheldetalbahn, which was established in 2007. History Wolfhagen station of Kurhessenbahn. The company was launched on 7 December 2000 as the first regional networkNeue Regionalnetze: Die Strategie der Deutschen Bahn. In: Eisenbahn-Kurier, Nr. 345, Juni 2001, , S. 8 and founded in early September 2002 as DB RegioNetz Verkehrs GmbH / Infrastruktur GmbH Kurhessenbahn. The Kurhessenbahn has leased several branch lines in Hesse and North Rhine- Westphalia from DB Netz AG for a period of twenty years from 1 January 2002. At the same time, a long-term transport contract was concluded with the responsible authorities. This included the operation of the local transport lines Brilon Wald-Korbach, Kassel-Korbach, Marburg-Frankenberg and Marburg- Erndtebr√ºck. A special feature was the Wabern-Bad Wildungen line, which was operated by the Hessische Landesbahn between 1998 and 2008 and therefore could not fulfil the synergy effects between network and operation, which was highlighted by those responsible. At the end of 2003, the Willingen-Korbach section of the line, which was closed for four years due to dilapidated viaducts, was put back into operation. At the same time, the line was comprehensively rehabilitated and the top speed increased, reducing the travel time between Korbach and Brilon Wald by 13 minutes. In 2006, the Kassel- Korbach line was closed for several months and rehabilitated and upgraded for the operation of the Kassel RegioTram. From December 2006, the regional railway in the Kassel-Wolfhagen section was replaced by the Kassel RegioTram RT4 line with two-power railcars, whereby a second external transport company operates local transport services on the Kurhessenbahn network. Since then, the Kurhessenbahn has only operated the regional express trains between Kassel and Korbach. At the same time, free-cutting work began in 2005 in the Frankenberg-Herzhausen section to reactivate the section of line. With the financial support of the Waldeck-Frankenberg district, excursion traffic was introduced every two hours on Sundays and public holidays in the Herzhausen- Frankenberg-Battenberg (Eder) section from 2005. This traffic should be a precursor to the planned closure of the gap between Korbach and Frankenberg. However, an expert opinion in 2007 showed that closing the gap in the form planned at that time did not make economic sense. The Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund (NVV) then made use of its right of withdrawal in the implementation contract and the Waldeck-Frankenberg district cancelled its financial participation in the excursion traffic, to which it was suspended. At this time, plans envisaged investments of 43 million euros to close the gap and accelerate the C√∂lbe-Korbach route. Subsequently, a slimmed-down variant was developed, which provides for only one two-hour cycle instead of one hour and no more acceleration measures. An economic benefit could be determined for this variant. In a tender procedure of the Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund (NVV) the Kurhessenbahn was able to secure the operation of the line (Kassel -)Wabern-Bad Wildungen (17 km). The line was taken over by Hessische Landesbahn, which had previously operated the line for ten years, with the 2008/2009 timetable change in December 2008. In 2010, work began on the rehabilitation of the Marburg-Frankenberg section. The stops and the route infrastructure were modernized and the signalling was converted to an ESTW. 628.2 of Kurhessenbahn on the way from Bestwig to Marburg at Brilon Wald station. After years of political debate, it was finally decided in September 2012 that the entire Frankenberg (Eder)-Korbach route would again be served by passenger services from December 2014. The reopening was officially celebrated on 14 September 2015 with a track festival with historical and modern vehicles.http://korbach-frankenberg.de/ Since then, traffic has been offered every 2 hours. In addition, continuous connections from Brilon Stadt or Bestwig to Marburg are again offered. With the timetable change 2015/2016 in December 2015, a new timetable concept was introduced on the Main‚ÄìWeser Railway in the Kassel-Treysa section, which extended most journeys on the Wabern-Bad Wildungen line to Kassel and ordered additional journeys to Treysa from the Kurhessenbahn during peak traffic hours. In March 2016, the Kurhessenbahn won the tender for the Northwest Hesse diesel network and will thus operate its existing network for another 15 years from December 2017. The operation will be completely converted to used Stadler GTW (number: 13) and Siemens Desiro (number: 14) low-floor multiple units. As part of the new transport contract, vehicle maintenance is transferred to Korbach, where the foundation stone for the new workshop was laid on 29 September 2017.

The RB 52 also carries the brand name of the Volmetal-Bahn, the RB 53 is called the Ardey-Bahn, the RB 54 is called the H√∂nnetal-Bahn and the RE 57 is called the Dortmund Sauerland- Express. In December 2004, DB Regio NRW took over or retained operations of these services. Previously the RB 53, RB 54 and RE 57 had been operated by DB Regio NRW and RB 52 had been operated by the Dortmund-M√§rkische Eisenbahn (DME). The RE 17 (Sauerland-Express) service will be included in the Sauerland Net under the next contract for the operation of services beginning in 2016.  Tender  The Zweckverband Nahverkehr Westfalen-Lippe (local transport association of Westphalia-Lippe, NWL) published a call for tenders for the operation of passenger services on the Sauerland Network from December 2016 in the Official Journal of the European Union on 9 October 2012. As a result, Regional-Express services RE 17 and 57 and Regionalbahn services RB 52, 53 and 54 might have had a new operator. Some improvements are to be made on trains for the carriage of the disabled and there will be more space for bicycles, more guards, ticket machines on the trains rather than on the platforms, as well as improved connections in Menden (to Dortmund) and Schwerte (to M√ºnster). It will involve about 5.6 million train-kilometres a year, at a cost of ‚Ç¨9‚Äì10 per train-km, a total cost of about ‚Ç¨50 to 55 million. Because the operation of the network is to be contracted for a period of 12 years, it will be worth more than ‚Ç¨600 million. Competition is needed in order to maintain fares. The NWL has offered financing for the rollingstock through the municipal budget and to reimburse the top three losing tenderers tender costs of up to ‚Ç¨100,000. Passengers will benefit from the competition in the Sauerland as the trains will be accessible to the disabled with entrance heights of 1.2 metres as is already the case with the Sauerland-Express. Due to the great success of the Ruhr Valley Cycle Route, RE 17 will have additional space for bicycles (which already exists on RE 57 services). In addition, the NWL has specified that future trains on the Upper Ruhr Valley Railway (RE 17/57) will have a top speed of 140 km/h. Thus, the journey time to Schwerte will be cut, which will allow a connection to M√ºnster. The timetable will be changed to ensure a quick connection at Fr√∂ndenberg from Neuenrade and at Menden to Dortmund. The current service is to be maintained. The same applies to the sale of tickets at DB ticket offices and DB agencies. However, ticket machines should be available in trains from the end of 2016 and no longer on the platforms, as this will prevent damage from vandalism. After 7 PM all trains will be staffed with on-board staff, this will increase total staff on the trains. The contract was awarded to DB Regio, which will use LINK (II or III) DMUs made by the Polish manufacturer PESA.  Operations  The existing timetable was largely retained when DB Regio NRW gained the current concession. It procured 21 new Alstom Coradia LINT (class 648) diesel railcars for operation on the Sauerland Net. These replaced older Deutsche Bahn rollingstock. The increased comfort of the new trains has been well received by passengers.  RB 52 ‚Äì Volmetal-Bahn  The Volmetal-Bahn (RB 52) service connects Dortmund, Hagen and L√ºdenscheid. On its way from Dortmund Hauptbahnhof to L√ºdenscheid station, the service first runs over a section of the Dortmund‚ÄìSoest railway and then over a section of the D√ºsseldorf- Derendorf‚ÄìDortmund S√ºd railway. It runs over the Hagen‚ÄìDieringhausen railway (also known as the Volmetalbahn, meaning Volme Valley Railway) from Hagen Hauptbahnhof to Br√ºgge (Westfalen) station. Finally, it runs over the Br√ºgge‚ÄìL√ºdenscheid railway from Br√ºgge station to the higher L√ºdenscheid station.  Services  The service runs every hour, seven days a week, except that services run every two hours on Sunday mornings.  Planning  The Volmetal-Bahn will in future run an hour earlier from L√ºdenscheid to Hagen on Saturdays and Sundays. In addition, the M√§rkischer Kreis is campaigning for a 30-minute cycle of the Volmetal-Bahn from L√ºdenscheid via Hagen to Dortmund, since L√ºdenscheid station would support higher demand.  RB 53 ‚Äì Ardey-Bahn  The Ardey-Bahn (RB 53) service connects Dortmund, Schwerte and Iserlohn. It follows the Ardey Railway (Ardeybahn in German).  Services  The service runs every half hour during the week and every hour on the weekend.  RB 54 ‚Äì H√∂nnetal-Bahn  The H√∂nnetal-Bahn (RB 54) service connects Unna, Fr√∂ndenberg and Neuenrade. The service follows the Fr√∂ndenberg‚ÄìKamen railway, the Letmathe‚ÄìFr√∂ndenberg railway and the H√∂nne Valley Railway (H√∂nnetalnbahn in German).  Services  The service runs hourly during the week. On Sundays services run every two hours between Menden and Neuenrade.  RE 57 ‚Äì Dortmund-Sauerland-Express  The Dortmund-Sauerland-Express (RE 57) connects Dortmund and Fr√∂ndenberg with Winterberg and Brilon Stadt. It runs along the Ardey Railway, the Upper Ruhr Valley Railway and then on either the Nuttlar‚ÄìFrankenberg railway or the Alme Valley Railway.  Services  The service runs hourly during the week. It runs alternately to Winterberg or Brilon Stadt.  Fares  The following fares apply to the Sauerland Net: the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (Rhine-Ruhr transport association) fares in the Dortmund and Hagen areas, the Verkehrsgemeinschaft Ruhr-Lippe (Ruhr-Lippe transport community) fares in the Sauerland/Ruhr-Lippe fare zone and the NRW statewide fares.

Calwich Priory It was founded circa 1130 as a satellite cell of Kenilworth Priory and was dedicated to St Margaret. In 1349 it became independent from Kenilworth with the right to elect its own prior. It was always a small and relatively poor establishment. After the death of the prior in 1530 only one canon remained in residence and in 1532 the house was suppressed and handed over to Rocester Abbey for disposal. By 1543 the property had been acquired by the Fleetwood family, who converted the priory buildings into a dwelling house. Calwich Abbey country house Derelict stable block, Calwich Abbey The estate was purchased from the Fleetwoods by Bernard Granville. He demolished the priory house and built a new house nearer the stream which he turned into a lake. Granville died childless in 1775, bequeathing the property to his nephew, the Reverend John D'Ewes, who assumed the surname Granville on inheriting the estate. He also left the estate in 1826 to a nephew, Court D'Ewes, who similarly adopted the surname Granville. This house hosted visits by Erasmus Darwin, Handel, Anna Seward and the philosopher, Rousseau. The estate was then acquired by the Duncombe family in the 1840s, who rebuilt the house in 1849‚Äì50 on higher ground in a Jacobean style by architect William Burn.

For example, in English, the conjunction that may be considered a relativizer in a sentence such as \\"I have one that you can use.\\"Fox, Barbara A. and Thompson, Sandra A. (2007) \\"Relative Clauses in English conversation: Relativizers, frequency, and the notion of construction\\", Studies in Language, 31 (2), p. 293-326(34). Relativizers do not appear, at least overtly, in all languages; even in languages that do have overt or pronounced relativizers, they do not necessarily appear all of the time. For these reasons it has been suggested that in some cases, a \\"zero relativizer\\" may be present, meaning that a relativizer is implied in the grammar but is not actually realized in speech or writing. For example, the word that can be omitted in the above English example, producing \\"I have one you can use\\", using (on this analysis) a zero relativizer. Analysis Since as far back as 1712, people have written about relativizers and what functions they have. They have been classified as conjunctions in earlier times, and have later been referred to as clause markers. They are known today as relativizers. Despite an agreement in nomenclature, there are multiple analyses which attempt to account for the grammatical function and distribution of relativizers. Promotional analysis The promotional analysis is a transformational analysis from 1973 depicting relative clauses in English, and how relative pronouns are introduced into the embedded clause. This analysis assumes that there is no overt head noun in the deep structure of the main clause. In order to form a relative construction, the noun phrase from the embedded clause is promoted to the empty head of the noun phrase of the main clause. From there, a corresponding relative pronoun leaves a trace in the space of the vacated noun phrase in the embedded clause. For example: Figure 1: Tree displaying Promotional Analysis Matching analysis The Matching Analysis is another type of transformational analysis from the 1970s, which was in competition with the Promotional Analysis at that time. In this analysis the relative pronoun is introduced into the embedded clause by corresponding or matching to the head noun in the main clause. This is done by taking the noun phrase from the embedded sentence in the deep structure that matches the head noun in the noun phrase of the main clause, and replacing it with a relative pronoun. The relative pronoun thus co-references the head noun in the main clause. Finally, the relative pronoun is moved to the clause- initial position. For example: Figure 2: Tree displaying Matching Analysis Ouhallian analysis There are two separate phrasal heads that relativizers can occupy. Cross-linguistically, relativizers may occupy either the head of a complementizer phrase (C-Type Relativizer) or the head of a determiner phrase (D-Type Relativizer). C-Type Relativizers can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase, or they can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a verb phrase. D-Type Relativizers may only introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase. English is a language which uses a C-Type Relativizer, that, as a part of its relativization strategy because \\"that\\" can introduce a relative clause as either the argument to a Noun Phrase or the argument to a Complementizer Phrase. The following examples from English shows the same morpheme being used in both syntactic contexts. {Figure 3: Tree displaying Relativizer as an argument to the Verb Phrase  Figure 4: Tree displaying Relativizer as an argument to the Noun Phrase } Conversely, Arabic uses two phonologically distinct morphemes to account for these syntactic phenomena. In the same sentences in a D-Type language like Arabic, each example would employ the use of a different morpheme as shown in examples 1 & 2. In Classical and Standard Arabic, the D-Type relativizer declines according to the gender and number of the noun, but the C-Type does not do so (according to the verb). 1) paris lli' bƒßibba Paris RM I.love.it''' The Paris that I love 2) xabbaret-na laila  îenno l-mmaslin m îadrabiin told-us laila that the-actors on.strike Laila told us that the actors are on strike.'' In modern English There are three types of relativizers used in English to introduce relative clauses: zero or null relativizers, wh-relativizers, and the that-relativizer.Sag, Ivana A. 1997. ‚ÄúEnglish relative clause constructions‚Äù. Journal of linguistics. 33 (2), p. 431-483. DOI: 10.1017/S002222679700652X Comparative distribution of null and overt relativizers Relativizers have been analyzed to be optional in certain languages and are variably omitted in the English language. Such relativizer omission, or use of the null or zero variant of relativizers, does not pattern uniformly in English and has been predicted to be conditioned and constrained by a number of linguistic and social factors.Levey, Stephen and Hill, Carolyn. (2013). ‚ÄúSocial and Linguistic Constraints on Relativizer Omission in Canadian English‚Äù, American Speech, 88 (1), p. 32-62.] These social factors and the potential influence of age, gender, and education have been minimally explored and seem to exhibit a lesser effect on relativizer omission. Linguistic constraints, such as sentence structure and syntactic position of the relativizer, main clause construction type, lexical specificity of the head NP, type of antecedent, and the adjacency, length, and grammatical subject of the relative clause have been implicated as having more significant influence on the patterning of relativizer omission in Canadian English. The omission of relativizers tends to occur more frequently in conversation than in formal writing. =Distribution with subject and object relative clauses= The syntactic position or function of the relativizer in the relative clause is a major determiner for the choice of relative marker. The null relativizer variant is more common in object than subject relative clauses. 3) I have friends that are moving in together. (subject) 4) That's one thing that I actually admire very much in my father. (direct object) 5) Everyone's kinda used to the age group [√ò] they work with. (object of preposition) =Informational content of the main clause determines distribution= There is a preference for null relativizers when a main clause that is informationally light is directly adjacent to the relative clause. For example: 6) It's just kinda something [√ò] I noticed recently. 7) They get values and stuff like that from church that they might not get at home. In this example, the main clause 'it's just kinda something' provides little semantic information and it is adjacent to the relative clause 'I noticed recently'. As such, it is thought that the main clause and the relative clause are processed together as a unitary processing chunk that is functioning like a single statement, which results in a null relativizer. =Distribution with empty head noun phrases= Empty head noun phrases, which are not lexically specific and which index generic groups or sets, have been correlated with the use of the null relativizer. Examples of empty noun phrases include words like all, way, time, etc. 8) All [√ò] she wants to do is sleep. 9) She held onto all those jewelry boxes that everybody made for her when we were kids. Unique head noun phrases, which include superlatives and nouns with the words only and first, also take the null relativizer. For example: 10) That's the only place [√ò] you can go at night. 11) That's the first compliment [√ò] I've got in a long time. 12) That was the worst job [√ò] I ever had. 13) You have a home here that you could rent. =Length of the noun phrase determines distribution= Longer head noun phrases often co-occur with an overt relativizer, whereas shorter noun phrases are more likely to co- occur with a null relativizer. For example: 14) This pair of suede pants that I got. 15) The weight [√ò] I should be at. In these examples, the first sentence contains a longer noun phrase ('This pair of suede pants') in comparison to the second sentence, which contains a very short noun phrase ('The weight'). Thus, it is observed that the sentence containing the longer noun phrase also contains the relativizer 'that', whereas the sentence with the shorter noun phrase has a null relativizer. =Definiteness of the noun phrase determines distribution= Null relativizers have been found to be correlated to the definiteness of the nominal antecedent. For example: 16) I don't think you have the dedicated teacher that I had. 17) And it was a guy [√ò] she worked with for a few years. The first sentence contains a definite noun phrase, whereas the second sentence contains an indefinite noun phrase which co-occurs with the null relativizer. =Distribution with relative clause pronominal subjects= When the grammatical subject of a relative clause is a pronoun, it is more likely that the relativizer will be omitted. When the subject of a relative clause is a full noun phrase, the overt relativizer will be retained. For example: 18) I have two cats [√ò] I'd like to turn in to the Humane Society. 19) Do you remember exactly the road [√ò] I'm talking about? 20) That was one of the things [√ò] he did when he was living elsewhere. 21) I always go to my girlfriends 'cause there's stuff that your parents just don't need to know. Distribution of overt English relativizers The overt relativizers of Modern English include the words ‚Äúwhich‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äù, ‚Äúwhen‚Äù, ‚Äúwhere‚Äù, ‚Äúwho‚Äù, ‚Äúwhom‚Äù and ‚Äúwhose‚Äù, and these can be referred to within linguistics as \\"wh-words\\". These are officially classified as relative pronouns, but can be referred to as ‚Äúwh-relativizers‚Äù in instances where their function is to introduce a relative clause. The other overt relativizer of Modern English is the word ‚Äúthat‚Äù, which can be referred to as the ‚Äúthat-relativizer‚Äù where it introduces a relative clause. There is some debate as to whether to classify it as a relative pronoun like the wh-words, a subordinating conjunction, or a complementizer. The distribution of the different types of English relativizers varies depending on several factors. =Fused relative clauses= Fused relative clauses, sometimes referred to as ‚Äúfree‚Äù relative clauses, are different from most other types of relative clauses in that there is no nominal antecedent to which the relative clause refers. In many cases, the relativizers of English are relative pronouns, meaning that they are in coreference with a noun that precedes them in the sentence. This nominal function is ‚Äúfused‚Äù with the relative clause in free relatives, and this leaves the relativizer without an overt entity to which it can refer. For example: 22) I wonder what inspired them 23) I wonder whose dog died There is no noun preceding the relative clause in these cases, and that is why it is said that this noun‚Äôs function is ‚Äúfused‚Äù with the relative clause. =Grammatical function of the relativized nominal determines relativizer case form= Where there are different grammatical case forms of a relativizer, the case form that surfaces will depend on the grammatical function of the noun that appears previously (known as the nominal antecedent) within the relative clause itself. The only examples in Modern English of this phenomenon are the forms ‚Äúwho‚Äù and ‚Äúwhom‚Äù. ‚ÄúWho‚Äù surfaces when it refers to a noun that is the subject of the relative clause, and ‚Äúwhom‚Äù surfaces when it refers to a noun that is an object of the relative clause. However, speaker judgments vary as to whether it is grammatical for \\"who\\" to surface when it is referring to an object of the relative clause. Since, depending on speaker judgments, either only \\"whom\\" or both \\"who and \\"whom\\" can grammatically introduce a relative clause referring to an object, there is an \\"m\\" in brackets on the end of the relativizer in example (21) below. * Subject antecedent 24) The person who visited Kim * Object antecedent 25) The chairman listened to the student who(m) the professor gave a low grade toEckman, Fred R. and Bell, Lawrence and Nelson, Diane. \\"On the generalization of relative clause instruction in the acquisition of English as a second language\\", Applied Linguistics. (1988), 9 (1), p. 1-20. DOI: 10.1093/applin/9.1.1 =Animacy of the antecedent determines distribution= Only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to human antecedents, and similarly, only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to non- human antecedents. ‚ÄúWho‚Äù, ‚Äúwhom‚Äù, and ‚Äúwhose‚Äù can only refer to human antecedents, ‚Äúwhich‚Äù, and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù can only refer to non-human antecedents. ‚ÄúThat‚Äù, however, can refer to both human and non-human antecedents. To exemplify: * Human antecedent 26) The Pat that I like is a genius 27) The Pat who I like is a genius 28) The only person that I like whose kids Dana is willing to put up with is Pat * Non-human antecedent 29) Every essay that she's written which I've read is on that pile 30) Every essay which she's written that I've read is on that pile =Restrictiveness of the relative clause determines distribution= Restrictive relative clauses add extraneous information that is not vital for the listener or reader‚Äôs understanding of which aforementioned noun is being referenced; or in other words, which noun is the nominal antecedent. Both wh-relativizers and the that-relativizer can be used to introduce restrictive relative clauses. Nonrestrictive relative clauses have semantic properties which make them necessary to prevent the sentence from being ambiguous. They are used in cases where the context that surrounds the sentence is not sufficient for the distinction between the potential nominal antecedents. Commas mark nonrestrictive relative clauses, and only the wh-relativizers can be used to introduce them. To exemplify: * Restrictive sentences: 31) He has four sons that became lawyers Bache, Carl and Jakobsen, Leif K. (1980) \\"On the distribution between restrictive and nonrestrictive relative clauses in modern English\\", Lingua, 52 (2), p. 243-267 32) The soldiers who were brave ran forward * Nonrestrictive sentences: 33) He has four sons, who became lawyers 34) The soldiers, who were brave, ran forward =Finiteness of the relative clause determines distribution= In non-finite clauses (clauses in which the verb is left unconjugated), the relativizer appears as an object of preposition, or in other words, directly after a preposition in the sentence. These relative clauses appear to be introduced by the preposition itself, but they are actually introduced by both the preposition and the relativizer, since these two grammatical particles form a ‚Äúprepositional phrase‚Äù; and it is this phrase that introduces the clause. For example: 35) A yard in which to have a party 36) The baker in whom to place your trust 37) A student *who to talk to us just walked in Note that (37) is ungrammatical because the relativizer introduces a non-finite relative clause, but it is not contained within a propositional phrase. Examples in other languages=Indonesian Teochew Teochew is a Chinese language originating from the Chaoshan region of the eastern Guangdong province. Indonesian Teochew refers to the Teochew dialect spoken in Indonesia. The most common way to form relative clauses in Indonesian Teochew is to use the relativizer kai. These relative clauses can appear head-finally or head- initially. =Jambi Teochew= Jambi Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the province of Jambi on the island of Sumatra. In this language, the relativizer kai is used to form relative clauses. In these relative clauses, the kai is obligatory. This relativizer comes from the Chinese language. The relativizer yang is optional, and is borrowed from Malaysian. The relativizer kai must always follow the modifying clause. If the optional relativizer yang is used, it would precede the modifying clause, as shown by example #43. If the relativizer kai is not present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, regardless of whether yang is present or not. This is demonstrated in example #45. 38) Aling pha î kai nongki«é khau. Aling hit REL child cry ‚ÄòThe child that Aling hit cried.‚Äô 39) yang Aling pha î kai nongki«é khau. REL Aling hit REL child cry ‚ÄòThe child that Aling hit cried.‚Äô 40) *Aling pha î nongki«é khau. Aling hit child cry ‚ÄòThe child that Aling hit cried.‚Äô 41) *yang Aling pha î nongki«é khau. REL Aling hit child cry ‚ÄòThe child that Aling hit cried.‚Äô Another way of forming relative clauses in Jambi Teochew is through using the classifier. The main difference between the kai and classifier relative clause is that there is the presence of a classifier in the classifier relative clause. The classifier in classifier relative clauses can only appear head-initially. The classifier agrees with the head noun type and is in the place of the relativizer kai. 42) ka Aling kai kau zin tua tsia î. bite Aling REL dog very big CL. ‚ÄòThe dog that bit Aling is a very big one.‚Äô 43) ka Aling tsia î kau zin tua tsia î. bite Aling CL dog very big CL. ‚ÄòThe dog that big Aling is a very big one.‚Äô Headless relative clauses do not have a pronounced head. It is the equivalent of ‚Äúthe one‚Äù in English. Headless relative clauses are formed with the relativizer kai. The Malaysian relativizer yang can be used optionally before the modifying clause. 44) [zazik khau kai] si zi su m ui. yesterday cry REL COP this CL one. ‚ÄòThe one who cried yesterday is this one.‚Äô The relativizer kai is obligatory. In addition, it is not possible to form a headless relative clause with a classifier in the place of the relativizer kai. 45) zi pung phou si [Aling sia kai]. this CL book COP Aling write REL. ‚ÄòThis book is the one that Aling wrote.‚Äô 46) *zi pung phou si [Aling sia pung]. this CL book COP Aling write CL ‚ÄòThis book is the one that Aling wrote.‚Äô = Pontianak Teochew = Pontianak Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the capital city of Pontianak in the province of West Kalimantan. The relativizer kai is used to form relative clauses. It is obligatory in head-final relative clauses. If kai is not present in the sentence, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, as demonstrated by example #52. Pontianak Teochew does not allow the use of the Malaysian relativizer yang. When this relativizer is present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical. This is shown in example #53. 47) Aling pha î kai nongki«é khau. Aling hit REL child cry ‚ÄòThe child that Aling hit cried.‚Äô 48) *Aling pha î nongki«é khau. Aling hit child cry ‚ÄòThe child that Aling hit cried.‚Äô 49) *yang Aling pha î kai nongki«é khau. REL Aling hit REL child cry ‚ÄòThe child that Aling hit cried.‚Äô Ute Ute is a language that belongs to the Northern Division of the Uto-Aztecan language family that spans the distance from the Rocky Mountains to Popocatepetl volcano south of Mexico City. In Ute, relative clauses that modify the subject are introduced in a different manner than those that modify the object. In both cases, there is no overt relativizer morpheme, rather nominalization and case morphology are used to introduce relative clauses. For example, nominalizing suffixes are attached to verbal elements in subject relative clauses. 50) √°apachi 'u [sivaatuchi 'uway paqha-puga-tu]'' boy.SU 3s.SU goat.O 3s.O kill-REM-NOM The boy who killed the goat In relative clauses that are introduced as arguments to an object, the verbal elements are inflected with nominalizing morphology similar to that of their subject relative clause counterparts and the subject of the embedded clause is inflected with the genitive case. 51) po'oqwatu 'uru [na'achichi 'uway po'o-na]-y punikya-qha-n book.O the.O girl.GEN 3s.GEN write- NOM-O see-ANT-1s I saw the book that the girl is writing ReferencesBibliography *van der Auwera, Johan (1985) \\"Relative That: A Centennial Dispute‚Äù, Journal of Linguistics, 21 (1), pp. 149‚Äì179.

Before taking part in this game, a personality test is required to determine if SPARX will be suited and helpful for the future user.  Game scenario  Based in a 3D fantasy world, the game leads players through seven realms (each lasting between 30 and 40 minutes). In the beginning of SPARX, the user meets the Guide who explains what SPARX is and how it could help. Then the user customizes an avatar and starts to journey within the seven provinces in order to complete different quests. In the first level, gamers challenge GNATS (Gloomy Negative Automatic Thoughts). These GNATS fly towards the avatar and say negative things like, for example: \\"you're a loser\\". Further in the game, the user meets different characters, solves puzzles and completes mini games. As soon as a quest is completed, the Guide explains how to use new skills in order to feel better, solve problems and enjoy real life. Players complete one or two levels in the game each week, during three to seven weeks.  Development  Behind the SPARX project is a team of researchers and clinicians from The University of Auckland.

A. Cohen or Jerry Cohen, was a Canadian political philosopher who held the positions of Quain Professor of Jurisprudence, University College London and Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory, All Souls College, Oxford. He was known for his work on Marxism, and later, egalitarianism and distributive justice in normative political philosophy.  Life and career  Born into a communist Jewish family in Montreal, Quebec, on 14 April 1941, Cohen was educated at McGill University (BA, philosophy and political science) in his hometown and the University of Oxford (BPhil, philosophy), where he studied under Isaiah Berlin and Gilbert Ryle. Cohen was assistant lecturer (1963‚Äì1964), lecturer (1964‚Äì1979), then reader (1979‚Äì1984) in the Department of Philosophy at University College London, before being appointed to the Chichele chair at Oxford in 1985. Several of his students, such as Christopher Bertram, Simon Caney, Alan Carter, C√©cile Fabre, Will Kymlicka, John McMurtry, David Leopold, Michael Otsuka, Seana Shiffrin, and Jonathan Wolff went on to be important moral and political philosophers, while another, Ricky Gervais, has a successful career in comedy. Known as a proponent of analytical Marxism and a founding member of the September Group, Cohen's 1978 work Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence defends an interpretation of Karl Marx's historical materialism often called technological determinism by its critics. In Self- Ownership, Freedom, and Equality, Cohen offers an extensive moral argument in favour of socialism, contrasting his views with those of John Rawls and Robert Nozick, by articulating an extensive critique of the Lockean principle of self-ownership as well as the use of that principle to defend right as well as left-libertarianism. In If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich? (which covers the topic of his Gifford Lectures), Cohen addresses the question of what egalitarian political principles imply for the personal behaviour of those who hold them. Cohen was close friends with Marxist political philosopher Marshall Berman. Cohen died on 5 August 2009.

Honoured with the People's Artist of Russia title in 1992, Velikanova then lost her voice due to incompetent medical treatment and had to stop performing. She died in 1998, two hours before her farewell concert in Moscow. Biography Gelena Velikanova was born in Moscow; both her parents came from Poland, father Marceli Welikanis, was half-Lithuanian. She graduated from the secondary school in 1941, but had to abandon her plans of joining the musical college, due to the outbreak of World War II broke and her family were subsequently evacuated to Tomsk. In 1944 Gelena returned to Moscow, enrolled into the Glazunov Musical college and after the graduation continued her education in the estrada department of the Moscow Art Theater School Studio. In 1948 Gelena Velikanova debuted as a professional singer. In 1950 she started to perform regularly as a member of the Mosconcert stuff. Soon she turned to more serious music; songs with lyrics based on the poems by Sergey Esenin and Novella Matveyeva, among others, started to appear in her repertoire. Velikanova's musical development has been influenced by her husband, poet Nikolai Dorizo. In 1969 Gelena Velikanova was honoured with the title Meritorious Artist of RSFSR, but soon lost the crystal-clear timbre of her high-pitched voice, due to incompetent medical treatment for her vocal chords. In 1986-1996 she taught at the Gnesin College and in the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts. In mid-1990s Velikanova enjoyed the renewed interest in her musical legacy. On 16 April 1998, the Velikanova Star was set at the Rossiya concert hall square. On 10 November 1998, the singer was about to give her farewell concert at the Moscow Actor House. She died in her home two hours before the show. She was buried at the Vagankovskoye Cemetery, in Moscow.

The notebooks were compiled in their original German in the Soviet Union by researchers at Moscow's Marx‚ÄìEngels‚ÄìLenin Institute, decades after Marx's lifetime. They were first released in Berlin in 1932, and in 1933, there followed a republication of this work in the Soviet Union (Moscow-Leningrad), also in German. Context The Manuscripts were composed during the summer of 1844, when Marx was 25 or 26 years old. They evolved from Marx's proposal to write separate pamphlets critiquing the various topics of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's philosophy of law - law, morals, politics, etc. - ending with a general treatise that would show their interrelations. They are a fragmentary, incomplete work, that range from extracts from books with comments, loosely connected notes and reflections on various topics, to a comprehensive assessment of Hegel's philosophy. Hegel is just one figure that the Manuscripts discuss. They also mark the first appearance together of what Friedrich Engels described as the three constituent elements in Marx's thought: German idealist philosophy, French socialism and English economics. Marx addresses the work of various socialist writers, and that of the fathers of political economy: Francois Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Jean- Baptiste Say, and James Mill. Die Bewegung der Produktion by Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz is also a key source. Ludwig Feuerbach's humanism is an influence that underlies all of Marx's notes. They are best known for their articulation of Marx's argument that the conditions of modern industrial societies result in the estrangement (or alienation) of wage-workers from their own products, from their own work, and in turn from themselves and from each other. Istv√°n M√©sz√°ros notes that the language and terminology of the Manuscripts is one of the work's main difficulties. He mentions that a key term \\"Aufhebung\\" can be translated from German to English simultaneously as \\"transcendence\\", \\"suppression\\", \\"preserving\\" and \\"overcoming\\". Christopher J. Arthur comments that the term, which appears in Hegel's Science of Logic, has in ordinary language the double meaning of \\"to abolish\\" and \\"to preserve\\". Arthur translates the word as \\"supersede\\" when the stress is more on abolition, and as \\"sublate\\" when the emphasis is more on preservation. A second terminological difficulty is the translation of the German words \\"Ent√§usserung\\" and \\"Entfremdung\\". While both words can be translated to English as \\"alienation\\", Entfremdung is often translated as \\"estrangement\\" and Ent√§usserung as \\"alienation\\", to draw a distinction between the two concepts. Christopher J. Arthur notes that Ent√§usserung is an unusual German word that can also be translated as \\"renunciation\\", \\"parting with\\", \\"relinquishment\\", \\"externalization\\", \\"divestiture\\" or \\"surrender\\". Arthur believes \\"externalization\\" is the closest of these translations, but he avoids using this word as it may be confused with a distinct term that Marx uses elsewhere: \\"Vergegenst√§ndlichung\\" or \\"objectification\\". Arthur claims \\"Entfremdung\\" is a narrower concept than \\"Ent√§usserung\\" in that it applies only to cases of interpersonal estrangement, and could not be used with reference to transfer of property. He takes estrangement to be a state and alienation to be a process. The dialectical structure of Marx's theory is another difficulty of the text, as the definition of certain key concepts can be hard to understand for those trained in positivist and empiricist philosophical traditions. What is more, the meaning of certain terms borrowed from Marx's contemporaries such as Feuerbach is often changed by Marx's appropriation of them. Because the 1844 Manuscripts show Marx's thought at the time of its early genesis, their publication (in English not until 1959)Tedman, Gary. (2004) \\"Marx's 1844 manuscripts as a work of art: A hypertextual reinterpretation.\\" Rethinking Marxism 16.4: 427‚Äì441. has profoundly affected scholarship on Marx and Marxism. At the time of their first publication, their most striking feature was their dissimilarity to the philosophy of dialectical materialism that was official within the Soviet Union and the European Communist Parties. The Manuscripts offer a trenchant analysis of Hegel that is far more difficult and complex than the \\"dialectics of nature\\" that Georgi Plekhanov and his disciple Lenin had derived from Friedrich Engels's Anti-D√ºhring.  Themes  In the Manuscripts, Marx relates economic categories to a philosophical interpretation of man's position in nature. Marx's notebooks provide a general philosophical analysis of the basic concepts of political economy: capital, rent, labor, property, money, commodities, needs, and wages. Their key concept appears when Marx uses philosophical terminology to advance a critique of capitalist society based in \\"alienation.\\" Marx's theory is adapted (not without changes) from Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) and Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity (1841). Alienation is not merely a descriptive concept, it is a call for de-alienation through radical change of the world.  Alienated labor  Marx's first manuscript consists largely of extracts or paraphrases from the works of the classical economists, such as Adam Smith, that Marx was reading at the time of the Manuscripts' composition. Marx here levels a number of criticisms at classical political economy. Marx accuses political economy of dealing with man not as a human being, but as one would a house, reducing the greater part of mankind to abstract labor. Marx follows Smith's definition of capital as the power of command over labor and its products. He disagrees with Smith's distinction between a landlord and a capitalist, claiming that the character of landed property has been transformed from feudal times so that society is now divided into only two classes - workers and capitalists. He further criticizes the conception of labor found in the classical economists on grounds that their conceptions are superficial and abstract. Marx argues that the classical economists start with a fictional primordial state that takes concepts such as private property, exchange and competition as facts, without seeing a need to explain them. Marx believes he has offered a more coherent account that addresses the connection and the history of these factors. Marx explains how capitalism alienates man from his human nature. Man's basic characteristic is his labor, i.e. his commerce with nature. Where in earlier societies people could rely in part on nature itself to satisfy \\"natural needs\\", in modern society, where land ownership is subject to the laws of a market economy, it is only through money that one may survive. A worker's labor and his product have become alien from him. His productive powers are a commodity to be bought and sold like any other, at the market price determined by the minimum cost of maintenance. The worker does not toil to satisfy his need to work, but only to survive: \\"he receives an object of labor, i.e., in that he receives work, and, secondly, in that he receives means of subsistence. This enables him to exist, first as a worker; and second, as a physical subject. The height of this servitude is that it is only as a worker that he can maintain himself as a physical subject and that it is only as a physical subject that he is a worker.\\" While his work produces wealth for the capital class, the worker himself is reduced to the level of an animal. If the wealth of society is diminishing, it is the worker who suffers the most; if it is increasing, then capital is increasing and the product of labor is increasingly alienated from the worker. The modern productive process does not promote the development and deployment of essential human capacities. Human individuals thus experience their lives as lacking meaning or fulfillment; they feel \\"estranged\\" or do not feel at home in the modern social world. Marx argues that the worker is alienated in four ways: # From the product he produces # From the act by which he produces this product # From his nature and himself # From other human beings The relation of the worker to the objects of his production is the primary cause of his impoverishment and dehumanization. The object produced by a worker's labor stands as an alien thing, a power independent of its producer. The more the worker produces, the more he approaches loss of work and starvation. Man is no longer the initiator in his interchange with the world outside himself; he has lost control of his own evolution. Marx draws an analogy with religion: in religion, God is the subject of the historical process, and man is in a state of dependence. The more man attributes to God, the less he retains in himself. Similarly, when a worker externalizes his life in an object, his life belongs to the object and not to himself. The object confronts him as hostile and alien. His nature becomes the attribute of another person or thing. The act of production of the object is the second dimension of alienation. It is forced labor and not voluntary. The labor is external to the worker and not part of his nature. The worker's activity belongs to another, causing the loss of his self. The worker is only at ease in his animal functions of eating, drinking and procreating. In his distinctly human functions, he is made to feel like an animal. The third dimension of alienation that Marx discusses is man's alienation from his species. Marx here uses Feuerbachian terminology to describe man as a \\"species-being\\". Man is a self-conscious creature who can appropriate for his own use the whole realm of inorganic nature. While other animals produce, they produce only what is immediately necessary. Man, on the other hand, produces universally and freely. He is able to produce according to the standard of any species and at all times knows how to apply an intrinsic standard to the object. Man thus creates according to the laws of beauty. This transformation of inorganic nature is what Marx calls man's \\"life-activity\\", and it is man's essence. Man has lost his species-being because his life-activity has been turned into a mere means of existence. The fourth and final dimension of alienation is drawn from alienation's other three dimensions: Marx believes that man is alienated from other men. Marx has argued that the product of a worker's labor is alien and belongs to someone else. The worker's productive activity is a torment for the worker; it must therefore be the pleasure of another. Marx asks who is this other person? Since the product of man's labor does not belong to nature nor to the gods, these two facts point out that it is another man who has control of a man's product and a man's activity. From his analysis of alienation, Marx draws the conclusion that private property is the product of externalized labor, and not the reverse. It is the relation of the worker to his labor that produces the relation of the capitalist to labor. Marx attempts to bring forth from this that social labor is in turn the source of all value and thus of the distribution of wealth. He argues that while the classical economists treat labor as the basis of production, they give nothing to labor and everything to private property. For Marx, wages and private property are identical, as they are both consequences of the alienation of labor. An increase in wages does not restore labor to its human meaning and significance. The emancipation of the workers will be the achievement of universal human emancipation, because the whole of human servitude is involved in the relation of the worker to production.  Communism  Marx discusses his conception of communism in his third manuscript. Marx here claims that previous socialist writers had offered only partial, unsatisfactory insights on the overcoming of alienation. He mentions Proudhon, who advocated the abolition of capital, Fourier, who advocated a return to agricultural labor and Saint-Simon, who advocated the correct organization of industrial labor. For Marx, communism is \\"the positive expression of the abolition of private property\\". Marx discusses two forms of communism that he deems inadequate. The first is \\"crude communism\\" - the universalization of private property. This form of communism \\"negates the personality of man in every sphere,\\" as it does not abolish the category of worker but instead extends it to all men. It is an \\"abstract negation of the entire world of culture and civilization.\\" Here the only community is a community of (alienated) labor and the only equality is one of wages paid out by the community as universal capitalist. The second form of communism that Marx sees as incomplete is of two sorts: \\"(a) still of a political nature, democratic or despotic; (b) with the abolition of the state, but still essentially incomplete and influenced by private property, i.e. by the alienation of man.\\" David McLellan takes Marx to here refer to the utopian communism of Etienne Cabet as democratic, the despotic communism to be the dictatorship of the proletariat advocated by the followers of Gracchus Babeuf, and the abolition of the state to be the communism of Th√©odore D√©zamy. Having discussed the nature of \\"crude communism\\", Marx describes his own idea of communism: Marx discusses three aspects of his conception of communism in depth: its historical bases, its social character and its regard for the individual. Marx firstly draws a distinction between his own communism and other \\"underdeveloped\\" forms of communism. He cites the communism of Cabet and Villegardelle as examples of communism that justify themselves by appealing to historical forms of community that were opposed to private property. Where this communism appeals to isolated aspects or epochs of past history, Marx's communism, on the other hand, is based in the \\"entire movement of history;\\" it finds \\"both its empirical and its theoretical basis in the movement of private property, or to be more exact, of the economy.\\" The most basic alienation of human life is expressed in the existence of private property, and this alienation occurs in man's real life‚Äîthe economic sphere. Religious alienation occurs only in man's consciousness. The overcoming of private property will thus be the overcoming of all other alienations. Marx secondly claims that the relation of man to himself, to other men and to what he produces in an unalienated situation shows that it is the social character of labor that is basic. Marx believes that there is a reciprocal relationship between man and society: society produces man and is produced by him. Just as there is a reciprocal relationship between man and society, so is there between man and nature: \\"society is therefore the perfected unity in essence of man with nature, the true resurrection of nature, the realized naturalism of man and the realized humanism of nature.\\" Man's essential capacities are produced in social intercourse: when working in isolation, he performs a social act by virtue of being human; even thinking, which uses language, is a social activity. This emphasis on the social aspects of man's being does not destroy man's individuality: \\"Man, however much he may therefore be a particular individual - and it is just this particularity which he makes him an individual and a real individual communal being - is just as much the totality, the ideal totality, the subjective experience of thought and experienced society for itself.\\" The rest of Marx's third manuscript explicates his conception of the total, all-sided, unalienated man. Marx believes the supersession of private property will be a total liberation of all human faculties: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, thinking, observing, feeling, desiring, acting and loving will all become means of appropriating reality. It is difficult for alienated man to imagine this, as private property has conditioned men so that they can only imagine an object to be theirs when they actually use it. Even then, the object is only employed as a means of sustaining life, which is understood as consisting of labor and the creation of capital. Marx believes that all physical and intellectual senses have been replaced by a single alienation - that of having. The \\"supersession of private property\\", Marx claims, \\"is therefore the complete emancipation of all human senses and attributes.\\" Need or satisfaction will lose their egoistic nature, and nature will lose its mere utility \\"in the sense that its use has become human use\\". When man is no longer lost in an object, the manner in which his faculties appropriate the object becomes totally different. The object that unalienated man appropriates corresponds to his nature. A starving man can only appreciate food in a purely animal way, and a dealer in minerals sees only value, and not beauty, in his wares. The transcendence of private property will liberate man's faculties to become human faculties. A full and harmonious development of man's cultural potentialities will arise, where abstract intellectual oppositions‚Äî\\"subjectivism and objectivism, spiritualism and materialism, activity and passivity\\"‚Äîwill disappear. \\"The practical energy of man\\" will instead tackle the real problems of life. In a passage that anticipates Marx's later detailed accounts of historical materialism, Marx next claims that it is the history of industry‚Äîrather than that of religion, politics and art‚Äîthat reveals man's essential faculties. Industry reveals man's capabilities and psychology and is thus the basis for any science of man. The immense growth of industry has allowed natural science to transform the life of man. Just as Marx earlier established a reciprocal relationship between man and nature, so does he believe that natural science will one day include the science of man and the science of man will include natural science. Marx believes that human sense-experience, as described by Feuerbach, can form the basis of a single all-embracing science. Publication and reception The Manuscripts were published for the first time in Moscow in 1932, and would become the most important reference for \\"Marxist humanism\\". They were edited by David Ryazanov under whom Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs worked in deciphering them. Luk√°cs would later claim that this experience transformed his interpretation of Marxism permanently. On publication, their importance was recognized by Herbert Marcuse and Henri Lefebvre: Marcuse claimed that the Manuscripts demonstrated the philosophical foundations of Marxism, putting \\"the entire theory of 'scientific socialism' on a new footing\\"; Lefebvre, with Norbert Guterman, was the first to translate the Manuscripts into a foreign language, publishing a French edition in 1933. Lefebvre's Dialectical Materialism, written in 1934-5, advanced a reconstruction of Marx's entire body of work in the light of the Manuscripts. In the post-World War 2 period, he was paralleled in this regard by the Italian Galvano Della Volpe, although Della Volpe's interpretation differed greatly from that of Luk√°cs, Marcuse and Lefebvre. The existential Marxism of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean-Paul Sartre also drew heavily from the Manuscripts. Many Catholic writers, particularly those in France, took interest in the Manuscripts at this time. In 1961, a volume containing an introduction by Erich Fromm was published in the USA. Since the terminology of alienation does not appear in any prominent manner in Marx's magnum opus Capital, the publication of the Manuscripts caused great debate regarding the relationship of the \\"Young Marx\\" to the \\"Mature Marx\\". The Soviet Union largely ignored the Manuscripts, believing them to belong to Marx's \\"early writings\\", which expound a line of thought that had led him nowhere. Where the Marxist humanists saw continuity between the philosophical humanism of the Manuscripts and the economic theory of Marx's later work, the structural Marxism of Louis Althusser inherited the Soviet Union's harsh verdict of Marx's early writings. Althusser believed there was a \\"break\\" in Marx's development - a break that divides Marx's thought into an \\"ideological\\" period before 1845, and a scientific period after.

It tends to view the state and law as ultimately an instrument or tool for individuals of the economically dominant class to use for their own purposes, particularly maintaining economic exploitation while winning ideological assent to their hegemony. This view is contrasted with structural Marxism, which views the class background of policymakers and so on as purely incidental to the \\"bourgeois\\" nature of the modern state, which is seen instead as a result of the position of the state and law in the objective structure of capitalist society and their objective (i.e. consciousness- independent) function of reproducing the relations of production and private property regardless of the class background of the individuals involved in the administration thereof.Poulantzas, Nicos (November‚ÄìDecember 1969). \\"The Problem of the Capitalist State\\". New Left Review. 1:58. For example, whereas for instrumentalist Marxists the formal equality of contract law in capitalist societies is a kind of ideological shell or mystification used by the elite to conceal the real kernel of exploitation, for structural Marxists that formal legal equality is itself the real normative basis for properly capitalist exploitation, whether or not elites understand it as such as it allows labour- power to be traded at its real exchange-value (though not the value of its product), thus making regularity and rational allocation in labour markets possible.Poulantzas, Nicos. \\"Marxist Examination of the Contemporary State and Law and the Question of the 'Alternative'\\".

In the framework of the structure and agency debate in sociology, instrumental Marxism is an agent-centred view emphasizing the decisions of policymakers, where the relevant agents are either individual elites, a section of the ruling class, or the class as a whole whereas structural Marxism is a structural view in which individuals are no more than the bearers of certain objective structural relations.

Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. Most Marxist critics, who were writing in what could chronologically be specified as the early period of Marxist literary criticism, subscribed to what has come to be called \\"Vulgar Marxism.\\" In this thinking of the structure of societies, literary texts are one register of the superstructure, which is determined by the economic base of any given society. Therefore, literary texts are a reflection of the economic base rather than \\"the social institutions from which they originate\\" for all social institutions, or, more precisely human‚Äìsocial relationships, are in the final analysis determined by the economic base. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. The English literary critic and cultural theorist Terry Eagleton defines Marxist criticism this way: > Marxist criticism is not merely a 'sociology of literature', concerned with > how novels get published and whether they mention the working class. Its aim > is to explain the literary work more fully; and this means a sensitive > attention to its forms, styles and, meanings. But it also means grasping > those forms, styles and meanings as the product of a particular history.T > Eagleton, Marxism and Literary Criticism, Berkeley, U of California P, 1976 The simplest goals of Marxist literary criticism can include an assessment of the political 'tendency' of a literary work, determining whether its social content or its literary form are 'progressive'. It also includes analyzing the class constructs demonstrated in the literature. Further, another of the ends of Marxist criticism is to analyze the narrative of class struggle in a given text. Does the text serve to perpetuate the ruling class ideology; to subvert that ideology, such as William Morris's News from Nowhere; or to signify both a perpetuation and subversion of the dominant ideology, such as in the works of Charles Dickens with Hard Times being the novel that most openly textualizes such a double signification as it offers a damning criticism of capitalism while also and at the same time seeking a perpetuation of a class- structured society.  History  Karl Marx's studies have provided a basis for much in socialist theory and research. Marxism aims to revolutionize the concept of work through creating a classless society built on control and ownership of the means of production. In such a society, the means of production (the base in the architectural metaphor Marx uses to analyze and describe the structure of any given society in written human history) are possessed in common by all people rather than being owned by an elite ruling class. Marx believed that economic determinism, dialectical materialism and class struggle were the three principles that explained his theories. (Though Marx does attribute a teleological function to the economic, he is no determinist. As he and Friedrich Engels write in The Communist Manifesto, the class struggle in its capitalist phase could well end \\"in the common ruin of the contending classes,\\" and as Terry Eagleton argues in Why Marx Was Right, \\"Capitalism can be used to build socialism, but there is no sense in which the whole historical process is secretly labouring towards this goal.\\") The bourgeoisie (dominant class who control and own the means of production) and proletariat (subordinate class: the ones who do not own and control the means of production) were the only two classes who engaged in hostile interaction to achieve class consciousness. (In Marx's thought, it is only the proletariat, the working class, that must achieve class consciousness. The bourgeoisie is already quite well aware of its position and power in the capitalist paradigm. As individuals, workers know that they are being exploited in order to produce surplus value, value produced by the worker that is appropriated by the capitalists; however, the working class must realize that they are being exploited not only as individuals but as a class. It is upon this realization that the working class reaches class consciousness). Marx believed that all past history is a struggle between hostile and competing economic classes in state of change. Marx and Engels collaborated to produce a range of publications based on capitalism, class struggles and socialist movements. These theories and ideologies can be found within three published works: * The Communist Manifesto * Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859) * Das Kapital or Capital (1867) The first publication Communist Manifesto (1848) argues that ‚Äòthe history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle‚Äô.Quoted Marx ‚Äì W Duiker & J Spielvogel, The Essential World History, vol, II: since 1500, 3rd ed, Thomson Higher Education, Belmont, 2008, p. 428 As class struggle is the engine room of history, to understand the course of history, one must analyse the class relations that typify different historical epochs, the antagonisms and forms of class struggle embodied in such class relations. This involves the development of class consciousness and follows the revolutionary movements that challenge the dominant classes. It extends to rating the success of these revolutions in developing new modes of production and forms of social organization.D Mclellan, The Thought of Karl Marx, Macmillan Press, London, 1971, p. 42 In contrast to the Manifesto, Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859) and Capital (1867) focus on the unfolding logic of a system, rather than class struggle. These provide an alternative account of historical development and emphasize the self-destructive contradictions and law of motion of specific modes of production.R Stones, Key Sociological Thinkers, Macmillan Press, London, 1998, p. 24 The Preface argues that society‚Äôs economic organization consists of a distinctive pattern of forces and relations of productions. From this foundation arises a complex political and ideological superstructure,D Mclellan, p. 124 where economic development impacts upon societal progress. Capital was more concerned with the genesis and dynamic of capitalism. As Mclellan (1971) states, \\"it refers to class struggle mainly in the context of the struggle between capital and labour, within capitalism, rather than over its suppression.\\"As quoted in D Mclellan, p. 67 Capital was less concerned with forecasting how capitalism would be overthrown, than considering how it had developed and how it functioned.I McIntosh, Classical Sociological Theory: A Reader, Edinburgh University Press, Great Britain, 1997, p. 73 The key to understanding this logic was the ‚Äòcommodity‚Äô form of social relations ‚Äì a form that was most fully developed only in capitalism.  Ideologies  It is through the theories of class struggle, politics and economics that Marxist literary criticism emerged. The thought behind Marxist criticism is that works of literature are mere products of history that can be analyzed by looking at the social and material conditions in which they were constructed.K Siegel, ‚ÄòIntroduction to Modern Literary Theory‚Äô, viewed 15 March 2011, http://www.kristisiegel.com/theory.htm Marx‚Äôs Capital states that \\"the mode of production of material life determines altogether the social, political, and intellectual life process. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but on the contrary their social being, that determines their consciousness.\\" Put simply, the social situation of the author determines the types of characters that will develop, the political ideas displayed and the economical statements developed in the text.  The development of Marxist criticism  Although Marx and Engels detailed theories of socialism in the mid-nineteenth century, it was not until the 1920s that Marxist literary theory was systematized. The greatest impetus for this standardization came after the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia. The event instigated a change in belief around socialist ideals in government and society.K Siegel While these ideals developed, socialist realism was accepted as the highest form of literature ‚Äì a theory based on an art movement that depicted and glorified the proletariat's struggle towards societal progress. These ideas guided both literary creation and official literary criticism in the Soviet Union,K Siegel where works focused on the lives of the different classes. In the years since then, the beliefs of some Marxist schools regarding literary theory have been modified to acknowledge that literary creation is a result of both subjective inspiration and the objective influence of the writer's surroundings.K Siegel This system of belief relies on the social classes as well as the economic and political development of society. Thus, Marx‚Äôs theories intertwined with the emerging ideologies of the new Russian movement and spread throughout the world.  Writers influenced by Marxist criticism  In addition to being the guiding principle behind most literary works in Soviet Russia, Marxism also greatly influenced many Western writers. Richard Wright, Claude McKay, Jean- Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Bertold Brecht were deeply influenced by Marxist and socialist theories of the day, and much of this type of reflection is evident in their writings of the time.K Siegel  Suggested reading  * Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels (2004) [1848].

Later English editions, such as an 1869 Hamburg edition, were entitled The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. The essay discusses the French coup of 1851 in which Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte assumed dictatorial powers. It shows Marx in his form as a social and political historian, treating actual historical events from the viewpoint of his materialist conception of history. The title refers to the Coup of 18 Brumaire in which Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in revolutionary France (9 November 1799, or 18 Brumaire Year VIII in the French Republican Calendar), in order to contrast it with the coup of 1851.  Contents of the book  In the preface to the second edition of The Eighteenth Brumaire, Marx stated that the purpose of this essay was to \\"demonstrate how the class struggle in France created circumstances and relationships that made it possible for a grotesque mediocrity to play a hero's part.\\" This essay contains the most famous formulation of Marx's view of the role of the individual in history, often translated as: \\"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.\\" The Eighteenth Brumaire taxonomises the mass of the bourgeoisie, which Marx says impounded the republic like its property, as consisting of: the large landowners, the aristocrats of finance and big industrialists, the high dignitaries of the army, the university, the church, the bar, the academy, and the press. , il manifesto, n. 3-4 marzo-aprile 1970, p.29, republished in F. Indovina (1972) Lo spreco edilizio It also shows more criticism of the proletariat than is typical of his other works, referring to the bureaucracy as a \\"giant parasitic body\\" and describing widespread perceptions of the proletariat as a \\"party of anarchy, socialism, and communism,\\" a party paradoxically established on precepts of an oppositional \\"party of order.\\"  Impact on the development of Marxism  Along with Marx's contemporary writings on English politics and The Civil War in France, the Eighteenth Brumaire is a principal source for understanding Marx's theory of the capitalist state.Jon Elster, An Introduction to Karl Marx, Cambridge, England, 1990 (first pub. 1986), p 8. Marx's interpretation of Louis Bonaparte's rise and rule is of interest to later scholars studying the nature and meaning of fascism. Many Marxist scholars regard the coup as a forerunner of the phenomenon of 20th-century fascism.Tucker, R.C. \\"The Marx-Engels Reader, 2nd ed.,\\" page 594. New York: Norton, 1978. First as tragedy, then as farce This book is the source of one of Marx's most quoted and misquoted statements, that historical entities appear twice, \\"the first as tragedy, then as farce\\", referring respectively to Napoleon I and to his nephew Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III): > Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages > appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the > second time as farce. Caussidi√®re for Danton, Louis Blanc for Robespierre, > the Montagne of 1848 to 1851 for the Montagne of 1793 to 1795, the nephew > for the uncle. And the same caricature occurs in the circumstances of the > second edition of the Eighteenth Brumaire. Marx's sentiment echoed an observation made by Friedrich Engels at exactly the same time Marx began work on this book. In a letter to Marx of 3 December 1851, Engels wrote from Manchester: > .... it really seems as though old Hegel, in the guise of the World Spirit, > were directing history from the grave and, with the greatest > conscientiousness, causing everything to be re-enacted twice over, once as > grand tragedy and the second time as rotten farce, Caussidi√®re for Danton, > L. Blanc for Robespierre, Barth√©lemy for Saint-Just, Flocon for Carnot, and > the moon-calf together with the first available dozen debt-encumbered > lieutenants for the little corporal and his band of marshals. Thus the 18th > Brumaire would already be upon us. Yet this motif appeared even earlier, in Marx's 1837 unpublished novel Scorpion and Felix, this time with a comparison between the first Napoleon and King Louis Philippe: > Every giant ... presupposes a dwarf, every genius a hidebound philistine.... > The first are too great for this world, and so they are thrown out. But the > latter strike root in it and remain.... Caesar the hero leaves behind him > the play-acting Octavianus, Emperor Napoleon the bourgeois king Louis > Philippe....Quoted in , pages 25-26. Wheen points out the similarity between > this passage and the one in Eighteenth Brumaire, but his quotation of the > latter is a different translation or version than the one which appears > above, or is perhaps a garbled combination of the Marx and Engels passages. However, neither Marx nor Hegel thought that history was cyclical, and there is no source in Hegel's writings, lectures, or letters of this sentiment. Marx comment is most likely about Hegel's Lectures on the Philosophy of History (1837), Part III : The Roman World, Section II: Rome from the Second Punic War to the Emperors, regarding Caesar : > But it became immediately manifest that only a single will could guide the > Roman State, and now the Romans were compelled to adopt that opinion; since > in all periods of the world a political revolution is sanctioned in men‚Äôs > opinions, when it repeats itself. Thus Napoleon was twice defeated, and the > Bourbons twice expelled.

Elliman was born in Dublin, a son of Maurice Elliman, who had fled from Tsarist persecution in Russia. He was educated at Synge Street CBS. His father became involved in cinema by establishing the Theatre De Luxe in Camden St. in 1912. After university Louis started work at a pharmacy but after a few years gave that up to become a film agent in London. In the meantime Maurice acquired Dublin's Gaiety Theatre, which was passed on to Louis.Roderick Flynn, Patrick Brereton: Historical Dictionary of Irish Cinema. Scarecrow Press, 2007, p. 99. In the early 1930s, Louis Elliman sold a 50% share in the Gaiety to entrepreneur Patrick Wall, a Clare man. The pair also owned the Metropole and the Savoy cinemas. Along with Patrick Wall, Elliman acquired the Theatre Royal, Dublin in 1936. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Wall and Elliman were forced to keep the two theatres going with native talent only. This led to the emergence of a raft of Irish acts who were to provide the mainstay of the Royal's output for the remainder of its existence. These included such Irish household names as Jimmy O'Dea, Harry O'Donovan, Maureen Potter, Danny Cummins, Mike Nolan, Alice Dalgarno, Noel Purcell, Miche√°l MacLiammoir, Cecil Sheridan, Jack Cruise, Paddy Crosbie and Patricia Cahill. In July 1951 Judy Garland appeared for a series of sold out performances at the Royal and was received with tremendous ovations. The legendary singer sang from her dressing room window to hundreds of people who were unable to get tickets and critics dubbed her \\"America's Colleen\\" Popular Irish American entertainer Carmel Quinn also made her singing debut in the Theatre Royal during the early 1950s. After a spell acquiring cinemas around the country, which were taken over by the Rank Organization, Louis went into film production. In 1957 he opened Ardmore Studios. With managing director Emmet Dalton he travelled to the US to promote the studios and to acquire foreign investment. The studios accordingly landed its first major foreign booking with 1959's Shake Hands with the Devil, starring Oscar winner James Cagney and Dana Wynter. A year later progress was consolidated when Robert Mitchum appeared in Tay Garnett's \\"A Terrible Beauty\\". In 1961, Ardmore Studios hosted the controversial \\"The Mark\\", directed by Guy Green, which was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and earned its star, Stuart Whitman, an Oscar nomination. Other films produced at this time include Don Chaffey's The Webster Boys and \\"Johnny Nobody\\" with Cyril Cusack. Hammer Films also utilised the studios as a base for their production, The Viking Queen. The studios went into receivership in 1963 but re-opened later. Under pressure from rising overheads and the increasing popularity of the cinema and the introduction of television, the Theatre Royal closed its doors on 30 June 1962. By this time Louis was dogged by bad health and died in 1965.

The dispute concerned 532 flats in Page Street, Vincent Street and Regency Street, Pimlico, London. These had been designed by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and erected between 1928-30 for the 2nd Duke and the other family trustees. In 1937 the trustees leased them (for a peppercorn rent of 1 shilling) to the council on a 999-year lease containing the stipulation that they be used only as \\"dwellings for the working classes... and no other purpose.\\" In 1990 the Council argued that the term \\"working class\\" was now meaningless and that the stipulation should be overturned, allowing them to sell the leaseholds of the flats to anyone, against the Duke's wishes. The Duke maintained that the properties should remain available as low-rent accommodation for those who could not afford to purchase long leaseholds. His freehold interest means the Duke can charge for extensions and structural alterations.Landlord and Tenant Act 1927 If a majority of a block becomes privately owned that majority can pay for and cease his future such rights: via collective enfranchisement. The case was dubbed Westminster v Westminster by the media. p.286 Background='Building Stable Communities' policy Local Conservatives formed a reduced majority of 4 on Westminster City Council in the 1986 local council elections. The area split roughly into thirds by ward result: strong Labour, strong Tory and marginal-majority two- or three- councillor wards. Following this and fearing her fellow members would lose control unless there was a radical change in the social composition of the borough, council leader Shirley Porter instituted a secret policy known as 'Building Stable Communities' (BSC), focusing on eight marginal wards where the Conservatives wished to gain votes at the 1990 local council elections. An important part of this policy was the slow renovation and designation of much of Westminster's council housing for open market sale, rather than re-letting whenever a short term tenancy became vacant. The designated housing was concentrated in those wards most likely to change hands to Labour in the elections and the policy was intended to force people on low incomes - perceived to be likely Labour supporters - out of the area by disposing of social housing. The council expected that this would result in more owner-occupiers, rather than renters, \\"a pattern of tenure which is more likely to translate into Conservative votes.\\" Grosvenor Estate Page Street, Pimlico. The flats designed by Lutyens featured a distinctive 'checkerboard' fa√ßade. The properties, collectively known as the Grosvenor Estate, had been built in Pimlico on the instructions of the 2nd Duke of Westminster, who owned the land. Demolished housing on the site had been \\"dilapidated\\", prone to flooding and the \\"densely populated slum\\" was demolished in 1928 after being condemned by the Westminster Medical Officer of Health. Lutyens, who has been described as \\"arguably the greatest architect the country has produced\\", was at the time working as a consultant architect for the nearby Grosvenor House and was asked by the Duke to design new housing for workers on Page Street, Vincent Street and Regency Street. In 1937 the duke and his family trustees granted leases of the 532 flats to Westminster council for 999 years (retaining the freehold) containing the condition that the flats be used as \\"dwellings for the working classes... and no other purpose.\\" As part of Porter's policy (later found illegal), the flats, being in swing wards, were selected for Designated Sales. Since 1988 this had enabled anyone working in the City of Westminster to purchase such council homes, generally leasehold, when vacant, at 30% of their true market value. A Home Ownership Centre (operated by estate agents Ellis & Co.) had been opened by the council in Victoria, London to facilitate the sales, described by BBC journalist Hosken as \\"the council's great machine of social engineering...that would sell thousands of council [homes] to prospective Tory voters.\\" That is, at an unusually generous discount to any local person who could afford them. The council claimed that this would enable first-time buyers and middle-income families to settle in Westminster. The new leases it granted contained a very brief recouping mechanism on resale prices thus \\"the council's housing stock was wide open to property speculators looking for a quick profit by buying up a council flat at a huge discount and then selling a few years later at full market value.\\" Challenged at the time by Labour councillors, who were just beginning to unravel the conspiracy behind BSC, the council flatly denied that the designated sales were intended \\"to change the balance of the electorate in marginal wards, or indeed that purchasers were anything other than 'working class'.\\" Hearing Sir Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster, photographed in 1988. The case was brought by Westminster City Council after Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster, who at the time the wealthiest man in Britain, refused to withdraw the clause in the lease. As a compromise he would agree to 10% of the properties being offered for sale provided that the remainder were kept as low-rent accommodation, but this was rejected by the council. The council asked that the court set aside the stipulation on the grounds that the term \\"working classes\\" had \\"no meaning in contemporary society.\\" Part of the council's case rested on a precedent set in Guinness Trust (London Fund) Founded 1890, Registered 1902 v Green [1955][1955] 1 WLR 872 in which the Court of Appeal had \\"unanimously ruled that the working class in Britain had been abolished.\\" The case was heard before Mr. Justice Harman at the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Chancery Division, over 3 days in November 1990. John Colyer, QC, for the council, told the court: \\"As of today, the phrase 'dwellings for the working classes', whatever it meant in 1925 or 1937, has fallen out of the legislation.\\" Judgment Judgment was passed in the Duke's favour on 26 November 1990. Mr. Justice Harman ruled that the clause was \\"as valid today as when it was made\\" and that there was no evidence that the term \\"working class\\" was now obsolete. He also said that it was \\"unbecoming for the council to 'blow hot and cold' and seek now to set aside the terms under which it had accepted the second duke's generosity in 1937.\\" Westminster City Council were, he said, under a continuing obligation to house the working class in Pimlico and could not sell the flats to anyone other than sitting tenants. On a separate issue it was held: where a contract to erect buildings on land and to grant a lease of that land are substantially one transaction (as by the 2nd Duke), the expenditure of money on the buildings would not be past consideration (therefore doubtful) for the execution of the lease, even though the lease was not executed until on or after completion of the buildings. Reactions During the hearings the Sunday Correspondent newspaper offered a prize of a crate of brown ale for the best definition of 'working class'. The winning entry was: \\"Wearing overalls on weekdays, painting somebody else's house to earn money? You're working class. Wearing overalls at weekends, painting your own house to save money? You're middle class.\\" Dennis Skinner for Bolsover (), said: \\"There is still a working class. It's exploited every day by people with fancy names such as entrepreneur.\\" His neighbouring MP Joe Ashton for Bassetlaw (), said: \\"The Lady Porters will always need the working classes to clean up after them. It shows that nobs [slang: nobility] like the Duke know more about how the world ticks than the heiress to a Tesco fortune.\\" Charles Irving for Cheltenham (), disagreed with: \\"We are all working class... Even the rich have to work.\\" Ex-barrister John Mortimer, playwright and screenwriter of Rumpole of the Bailey quipped that Margaret Thatcher \\"had already abolished the working class and that these days, people [are] either 'middle-class or sleeping in a cardboard box.'\\" The ex-Council leader said: \\"In a week when the son of a trapeze artist [John Major] has been battling to become [Conservative] Prime Minister... the courts have ruled that we must remain wedded to an outdated class system.\\" Peter Bradley, then the deputy Leader of the Labour Group at Westminster Council, responded: > [Porter] says that the council's housing policies are intended \\"to enable > less well-off families to become better off.\\" She makes no mention of those > Westminster people who are forced to raise their families in inadequate > housing or, worse still, have become homeless as a direct consequence of her > politically motivated depletion of the council's housing stock.\\" In May 1996, after long investigations, the District Auditor concluded that the 'Building Stable Communities' policy had been illegal.

He was a signatory to the petition to Major George Johnston calling for the deposing of the Governor of New South Wales, William Bligh, having only lived in the country for one year. Awarded a 400 acre ground by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1812 during the fallout from the Rum Rebellion, Uther expanded his interests to include agriculture - specifically meat production. Admired for his innovative farming techniques in Australia, Uther unsuccessfully petitioned the British Colonial Office during a visit back to England for the government to bequeath him more land upon which to farm. He married in 1812, though he was widowed in 1829 when his wife accidentally drowned. He expanded his industrial interests to include that of ironmongery and mining, and married a second time.

This 501(c) organization was established by Mark Horrocks in 2005. The mission of Habitat for Hope is to support, serve, and care for families facing the serious or long-term illness of a child. The levels of support range from economic to spiritual. Habitat for Hope provides lodging, transportation, and food to families in the mid-south who are undergoing treatment. The families are welcomed into the Habitat for Hope home in Millington for gatherings and counseling. Since its creation in 2005, the organization has served over 400 families.  Property  The 48-acre Habitat for Hope property with a 4,000-square-foot home is located in Shelby Forest at 2041 Locke Cuba Road Millington, Tennessee. The main house houses a staff host family, and up to two additional families at a time. There are two bedrooms and a private bath (short term) within the home that are offered free of charge to family members that come to the area to help care for an ill child. There is also an apartment in lower level of The Refuge that can be used long- term basis by families with chronically ill children. Lodging is also provided in the downtown Memphis area, where Habitat for Hope maintains two fully furnished apartments. All of these living areas are provided free of charge to families who are in the area as a result of a serious illness of a child. Habitat for Hope services any family entering the mid-south for the treatment of a critically ill child. The Habitat for Hope properties allow families, regardless of size, to stay together in a home-like environment.  Origin  Mark and Mylissa Horrocks decided to found this organization as a result of their own personal history. When their daughter, Bella Rose, was diagnosed with stage IIIA Malignant Melanoma in 2003, the family was uprooted from their home in Florida to come to Memphis for treatment. While the Horrocks family received support from their community back home, they realized that there were many families who relocated to Memphis for medical treatment that did not enjoy similar resources. Because of this, the Horrocks worked with many people, including their friends Rob and Ana Brennan, to create place of refuge for these types of families  Funding  Habitat for Hope has many fundraising projects. Some of the largest fundraising events are the annual LUVMUD/LUVGLO races. LUVMUD, a 5K obstacle/mud race was created in 2010 specifically to benefit Habitat for Hope. A few years later, LUVGLO was added to family of races. This 5K is a glow in the dark race with glow parties and glow pools. From 2010 to 2013, over 6,000 runners have participated in these races, and 100% of the profits after cost go directly to Habitat for Hope References Category:Children's health-related organizations Category:Charities based in Tennessee ","title":"Habitat for Hope"},{"id":"40980374","text":"Boudiaf was killed by one of his own bodyguards, Lambarek Boumaarafi, presented officially as an Islamic fundamentalist, and a sympathiser of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), who acted alone.

The gunman and at least 40 other people were killed or injured in the attack. Among the wounded were the Minister of Industry and a top provincial official. International circumstances Boudiaf's assassination coincided with the Algerian state-owned oil company Sonatrach's launch in London of a first onshore leasing round in which it sought participation by foreign oil companies in opening up new production facilities in Algeria. Oil prices rose on immediate fears that the killing of Boudiaf might trigger unrest that could hit production, but they fell back later in the day. Sources believe there may be a short-term disruption of exports from Algeria, but the country will have to sell oil eventually. Iran and other members of fundamentalist Muslim governments praised the killing of the Algerian leader, while the United States, the Organization of African Unity, France and other western nations condemned it. French leaders in particular voiced fears of civil war or a full military takeover of the former French colony. The attack on Boudiaf was the Arab world's most dramatic political killing since Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated by Islamic fundamentalists in 1981.CTC International Group LimitedPrincipal Dates and Time Line of History of Algeria 1945-1957 See also *Algerian Civil War *Lambarek Boumaarafi *Assassination of Anwar Sadat References Category:Algerian Civil War Category:Assassinations in Algeria Category:1992 crimes in Algeria Category:June 1992 events in Africa Category:1992 murders in Africa Category:1990s murders in Algeria Category:Filmed assassinations ","title":"Assassination of Mohamed Boudiaf"},{"id":"40980386","text":"Azeyevo () is the name of several rural localities in Russia. *Azeyevo, Ryazan Oblast, a selo in Azeyevsky Rural Okrug of Yermishinsky District in Ryazan Oblast *Azeyevo, Republic of Tatarstan, a selo in Novosheshminsky District of the Republic of Tatarstan ","title":"Azeyevo"},{"id":"40980404","title":"2013 World Wushu Championships"},{"id":"40980428","text":"Mahendra Cave is a cave located in Pokhara-16,batulechaur, Kaski district, close to the Kali khola, is the large limestone cave. It is a rare example of a cave system in Nepal containing stalagmites and stalactites. The cave attracts thousands of tourists every year. A statue of Hindu lord Shiva can be found inside the cave. History The cave gets its name from former King, Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. This cave was discovered in the late 1950s by young shepherds of Pokhara. Since then it has remained one of the most visited places in Pokhara. It was first properly surveyed in 1976 by a small team of spelaeologists from the UK including Jane Wilson-Howarth who documented the animals that lived in the dark zone of the cave. Copies of the expedition report are lodged with the UK copyright libraries and at the Royal Geographical Society. Location Mahendra Cave is located in the city of Pokhara in the western region of Nepal. It is about 1100 metres above sea level. It has formed in young (Pleistocene) limestone which is overlaid by conglomerates. The cave can be accessed by visitors from the Pokhara Airport within 30 minutes by taxi, one hour by public buses and two hours by foot. From the Prithvi Buspark, it is ten minutes shorter than from the airport via public vehicles. Adventure The cave corridors are completely dark with continuously dripping water overhead. The cave is formed in limestone, which falls to the ground and continuously forms electrical sparks. Due to the darkness, artificial lighting is provided inside approximately half of the accessible cave. The cave consists of about 100m of easily accessible passages and a further 100m of low unstable corridors entered by way of a collapsed passage only perhaps half a metre high. A survey of the entire cave and lists of the bats and invertebrates living inside are found in the report of the 1976 British cave expedition to the region. Sightseeing near Mahendra cave The place where Mahendra cave lies is full of greenery. The grazing horses and mules can frequently be observed in this area. This place lies in the bottom of a hill covered with greenery. Many surrounding hills full of greenery can be observed from here. Another great cave called Bat Cave can also be visited by travelling in the trail path just beneath the hills within ten minutes by foot.

The interference can be in the form of prevention of the transformation of a mutagenic compound into mutagen, inactivation, or otherwise the prevention of Mutagen-DNA reaction. Antimutagens can be classified into: Desmutagens, that inactivate the chemical interactions before the mutagen attacks the genes and Bio-antimutagens, that stop the mutation process once after the genes are damaged by mutagens. There are a number of naturally occurring anti-mutagens that show their efficient action.  Examples of antimutagens =Micronutrients Nutrients such as vitamins and minerals are examples of micronutrients that are necessary for the proper maintenance of metabolism homeostasis in humans and other species. Micronutrients are also pointed to perform a role in genome stability acting as potential antimutagenic agents (see the examples below): * Carotenoids: Induction of single break DNA repair by a rejoining mechanism and elimination of 8-oxoguanine which is usually resulted from oxidative stress in cells; * Vitamins: Can induce cell programmed death via activation of p53 and increase of cellular mechanisms against strand breaks; * Flavonoid polyphenolics: Found to perform antimutagenic activity through the increase of OGG1 expression, which is an enzyme responsible to remove 8-oxoguanine a mutagenic product created after cell‚Äôs exposure to oxidative stress; Increase of single break repair by rejoining and induction of genes related to base and nucleotide excision repair such as XPA and XPC; * Selenium: Induces programmed cell death via many signalling pathways as well as protects the cells against cell damage caused by oxidative stress. * Magnesium: Essentially necessary for the process of nucleotide excision repair where in cells treated in absence of this micronutrient the repair was impaired. UV blockers Sunscreens are products commonly known by their capacity of protecting skin against sunburns. The active components present in sunscreens can vary, thus affecting the mechanism of protection against UV light, which can be done through absorption or reflection of UV energy. As UV light can cause mutations by DNA damaging, sunscreen is considered an antimutagenic compound as it blocks the action of the UV light to induce mutagenesis in cells, basically the sunscreen inhibit the penetration of the mutagen. Tumor suppressor genes These genes have the function of protecting cells against tumor-like behaviour, such as higher proliferative rates and unlimited growth. It is common to find those genes down regulated or even inactivated in tumor cells. Thus, tumor suppressor genes can be recognized as antimutagenic agents. * TP53: This gene encodes for the p53 protein, which is known to act on the apoptotic signalling pathway and is also described to be important in the break excision repair of cells that had their DNA damaged. p53 is a transcription factor that is involved in the transcription of many genes, some of which related to the process of cell response against DNA damage. Some types of cancer show a high prevalence of lower or even absent levels of expression of this protein, sustaining its importance against mutagenesis. * PTEN: PTEN is another gene considered a tumor suppressor and acts through the inactivation of the PI3K-AKT pathway that leads to cell growth and survival. In other words, this gene is important to cause the cell growth arrest avoiding posterior effects and consequences of mutagenesis.

As the names suggest, these flies feed on and develop in a variety of fruits, primarily in the Caribbean. They mainly infest mature to overripe fruits. While thought to have originated in Cuba, the Caribbean fruit fly can now also be found in Florida, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. A. suspensa is a small brown and yellow fly that is can be distinguished from similar species by the placement of the veins in the wings. This fly is a pest species and has negative agricultural and economic impacts. Due to their ability to travel great distances (over 120 km) and wide range of adaptability, A. suspensa poses risks to any fruit growing country importing fruit from the Caribbean.  Description  The adult fly is between 11 and 14 mm long and may appear yellow, orange, brown, or a combination of the three. The setae, or hairlike structures on insects, are red-brown to dark-brown, causing a darker overall appearance. Similar to other species in Anastrepha, their thorax is primarily yellow to orange-brown with slender bands of color running down the thorax to the scutum. In addition, dark spots may be found on the thorax and wings of the fly. The wings often alternate between bands of yellow-brown and brown bands. It may be possible that the yellow and brown color may be adopted from bees to discourage predators, but no studies have thoroughly examined this form of mimicry. Male and female A. suspensa can easily be distinguished. Female A. suspensa have a prominent ovipositor, which is the organ through which a female insect deposits her eggs. The ovipositor is with serrations near the tip for cutting into fruit. A. suspensa may be distinguished from other similar species of Anastrepha by characteristics of the ovipositor and wings. A.suspensa is closely related to Anastrepha ludens and shares many characteristics. Distribution  As the common name Caribbean fruit fly suggests, A. suspensa has primarily been identified in Caribbean Islands and Central America in countries including the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. A. suspensa has also been found in California and Florida, as well as in French Guiana in South America. A. suspensa prefer tropical climates with consistent precipitation. While tropical climates may include anything greater than 1500 mm of precipitation annually to less than 600 mm, there has been no distinct preference between these subcategories by A. suspensa. The spread of A. suspensa throughout the globe has largely been attributed to the movement of spoiled fruit that contained A. suspensa larvae The ability to fly long distances also contribute to the spread of this species.Tropical fruits which A. suspensa. consumes. Food resources A. suspensa on fruit. A. suspensa have been recorded to infest and consume over 100 foods, most of which have been fruits. These fruits are almost always mature, overripe, or spoiled. These flies seem to prefer consumption of guavas, the Cayenne cherry, rose apple, tropical almonds, grapefruit, and oranges. They have also been noted to infest papaya, Natal plum, kumquat, mango, mombin, and an array of cherries. The data shows that the consumption of different fruit may depend on the location of the A. suspensa.  Life history  alt= Like all Diptera, A. suspensa undergoes 4 main lifestages: egg, larva (with 3 instars or substages), pupa, and adult.  Egg A. suspensa females lay about 200 eggs on the exterior of mature and rotting fruit. The eggs are laid and will hatch in flavedo part of the fruit. A. suspensa eggs are elliptical in shape. The color of these eggs ranges from pale to gleaming white. The anterior end of the egg contains a micropyle, which is an opening for the sperm to enter. On the same end of the egg there is a characteristic polygonal pattern in the surface architecture of the chorion.  Larva The larvae which hatch from the eggs are vermiform maggots, similar to other fruit flies. They possess an elongated and cylindrical shape. These larvae progress through 3 instars, or stages between molting. First instar larvae appear clear to pale white. During this period, the mouth hooks are formed and become the main feature. These two sets of thin brown hooks are located on the ventral surface of the larvae. The color of second instar larvae begins to change towards a pale cream color. In this stage, the larvae will begin to develop features like the anterior spiracles to allow oxygen to enter the respiratory system. They will also start to develop small oral ridges and black mouth hooks. Third instar larvae transition from a cream to a light yellow color and are about 8 to 10 mm in length. During this the time, the overall body surface becomes rough and the morphology of the larvae solidifies. The mouth hooks have now transformed into a single pair of sharp, black teeth that are strongly sclerotized. The oral ridges become more distinct, and there are creeping welts that begin to form. Due to the close resemblance of A. suspensa and other species in Anastrepha, it can be difficult the accurately identify A. suspensa larvae. Larvae and pupae advance from the flavedo towards the center and pulp sections of the fruit as it matures because of the increased sweetness. This then leads to more rapid development. Larvae may feed on the fruit constantly over a 24 hour period. No group sociality has been observed apart from feeding on the same areas.  Pupa After completing growth as a larva, the immature A. suspensa transition into a pupa. The pupae are fully encompassed by the hardened skin of the 3rd larval instar which forms a covering called a puparium. The pupae possess an ellipsoid shape and appear golden to reddish- brown. During this phase, there are visible spiracles on the anterior surface that allow for respiration. After completing pupation, the adult fly breaks out of the puparium.  Adult behavior = Mating  While mating studies were conducted during spring and summer, this species does not undergo winter diapause, so mating behavior may occur throughout the year. During the early morning, males and females often interact on host fruit like guava and Cayenne cherries. The males will be feeding and courting, and the females will be feeding and ovipositing. As temperature and light increase as the morning progresses, males and females will both move to areas under shaded leaves. In afternoon and late afternoon, males compete for single-leaf territories. Since territorial fights are a crucial component to mating; flies that were larger could claim larger territories, demonstrated higher levels of fitness, and had better matting success. In these claimed areas, the males puff to release sex pheromones from glands near their anal canal as scent markings and sing songs to attract females. These pheremones are used as scent markings Male A. suspensa make two distinct sounds towards females: the calling song and the precopulatory song. Both of these sounds are created through rapid wing vibrations by the male fly. Male fitness can be communicated through the songs as larger males produce more intense songs. Male size seems to be negatively correlated with frequency of calling songs, but there is no correlation between male size and frequency of precopulatory songs. Females are attracted to areas where the calling song is broadcast, but more research is needed to determine if calling males have higher mating success than males that do not call. Since unsuccessful precopulatory songs were not as loud and had a broader bandwidth than that of successful songs, it is believed that the precopulatory song may be the last acoustic opportunity for males to display their fitness to the female. This could explain greater mating success for better males giving precopulatory songs due to increased female compliance once a male has mounted. However, longer precopulatory songs correlate with shorter matings. This is thought to occur because longer precopulatory songs are employed by males with mates that are less sexually responsive; therefore, the longer song may be just enough to lead to mating. Since larger males coupled longer, it is believed that the increased strength that comes with size helps in a conflict of interest when it comes to mating between males and females.  Oviposition  The eggs may be deposited in groups or as individuals based on the size of the fruit. As a form of egg guarding and to prevent overpopulation in a fruit, A. suspensa females have deposit pheromones from anal membranes that deter repeated attempts of oviposition in a fruit. This water-soluble pheromone may deter additional oviposition attempts by A. suspensa for at least 6 days. The plant compounds naringin and quinine inhibit oviposition, reducing the areas in which A. suspensa may inhabit and reproduce. A. suspensa on a leaf  Natural enemies and control  For A. suspensa, there are a few natural enemies like P. cindemmaiae and E. annulipes which are parasitoids whose larvae live in and feed upon the fly larvae as their host, eventually killing the fly. Historically, these parasitoids have been introduced by humans in Puerto Rico and Florida to help combat against A. suspensa. Research has focused on classical biological control of A. suspensa, where natural enemies are introduced, and less on natural parasites and predators. There have been an array of species like A. indica, D. anastrephilus, and T. daci that attack A. suspensa as larvae. Due to the large economic damage that A. suspensa is capable of inflicting, there have been extensive studies on biological control of A. suspensa. An example of this biological control is the endoparasitoid braconid wasp, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata', which caused a 40% reduction in A. suspensa populations in research studies. The small wasps lay eggs in A. suspensa larvae. When the fly enters the pupal stage the eggs of the wasp hatch and begin to feed on the larvae. The A. suspensa pupa is often killed before it can develop into an adult. Earliest methods of control for A. suspensa to protect fruits were as simple as using hot water; recent solutions are much more intricate. Recent studies in Florida have focused on biological control of A. suspensa using entomopathogenic nematodes. There have also been studies using imidacloprid- treated spheres for control and eradication of A. suspensa in areas where it may be difficult to spread a large range of insecticides.  Physiology  Studies on A. suspensa physiology have greatly matched the physiology of other species in Anastrepha. Flight It has been shown that flight in A. suspensa may be influenced by age, size, sex, and weight. On average, adult A. suspensa can fly 120 kilometers, which allows for the spreading of the species. Studies have examined the effect of gamma irradiation on flies at different stages of their life to make them sterile. It was observed that females that were treated with gamma irradiation fly farther and faster early in their life than untreated females but slower later in their lives. This difference may be due to affecting the female's role in reproduction. For males, being sterilized by gamma irradiation did not produce significant differences. Gamma radiation also changed the waveform of the sound created by the wings of the flies. By sterilizing the pupae, it was observed that wing beat frequency decreased.  Light and Vision  While most studies on A. suspensa have been in a laboratory setting, the results have been telling for the set-up of vision in A. suspensa. Research has shown clear inclinations for A. suspensa towards objects that are colored orange. This preference is then followed by yellow and yellow-green. Colors that did not greatly attract A. suspensa were dark green, red, blue, white, and black. Based on these preferences, it was hypothesized that the photoreceptors in A. suspensa respond specifically to 580-590 nm visible light range. Responses to this light range seems to correspond with fruit seeking. Other studies have discussed the strong sense of vision for A. suspensa and how this has allowed for conducting experiments with clear cages to further test the behavior of the flies.  Sound and Hearing  In the process of creating a better way to search fruits for the presence of A. suspensa larva than cutting the fruit, scientists discovered that A. suspensa larvae and pupae create sounds while chewing. While the interactions based on sound between organisms at this age have not been studies, the sounds are important for scientists in understanding the life cycle in terms of feeding with A. suspensa.  Gustation  Since larvae burrow beneath the surface of fruits that they occupy, it is difficult to observe feeding behavior of these early stages of the flies. In adult A. suspensa, it has been noted that food coloring does not affect the fitness parameters of the flies. Additionally, it was learned that A. suspensa ingested both liquids and solid particles. This information elucidated a feeding mechanism similar to that of the Mediterranean fly.  Microbiome  While A. suspensa has not been identified with gut microbiome directly, there are indirect interactions. It has been studied and noted that A. suspensa interact with different bacteria microbial violates. It has been noted specifically in E. agglomerans and other Enterobacteriaceae that A. suspensa females are attracted to their volatile chemicals. Despite this preliminary study, there is not enough evidence to fully support direct ties and interactions between these bacteria and A. suspensa.  Mutualism  Based on research that has been conducted in A. suspensa, there are no clear cases of mutualism with either plants, animals, or microbes. These flies resemble partially parasitic relationship with fruits and they may be influencing the ability of A. suspensa to maintain mutualistic relationships. Even though typically A. suspensa infest spoiled and rotten fruit, they may be influencing the ability for the fruit to disperse its seeds by making it less appealing to animals. At the same time, A. suspensa larva reap the benefits of the fruit for growth.  Interactions with humans  Historically, adult A. suspensa are considered the most serious fruit fly pests tropical fruit fly pests. Due to their large array of host fruits ranging from guava to oranges, the economic damage is expansive. A. suspensa are believed to be highly invasive due their potential to their broad native range and strong ability to adapt to different environments. These interactions are amplified by the high likelihood of entry into different countries through legal and illegal means. A. suspensa are also difficult to detect and to control without causing expansive damage, making them very costly combat. In order to inhibit the spread of the flies, many countries like Bermuda, Brazil, China, Colombia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United States have adopted strict protocols to maintain fly-free zones when importing fruit.  Conservation  Since A. suspensa is seen as an agricultural and economic threat, there are no cases of conservation of A. suspensa. The parasitic nature of the fly has allowed A. suspensa to expand into various habitats. There is a case on how A. suspensa used to reside in California; however, it no longer is spotted in the Southern California region, indicating unexplained habitat loss.

The club, like all others in the territory, play at the Victoria Stadium on Winston Churchill Avenue. History The club was previously known as Britannia FC and was previously one of the more dominant sides in Gibraltar, winning several championships in the 1950s, until going into administration and regrouping under its current name in 2009. In 2014 they secured promotion back to the Premier Division after winning the Second Division title. Their first season saw them avoid relegation due to the league's expansion. The club began their second season in the top-flight well under Alan Arruda, being third for the majority of the first half of the season. However, his resignation in early 2016, coupled with the departure of key players, saw them plummet down the league and finish in 9th, meaning they had to participate in a play-off to determine their fate. After losing their play-off to Mons Calpe, they resigned from the league. Futsal Britannia launched their futsal team in 2015, however, after resigning from the football league, the club remained inactive for a year. In 2017, the club relaunched its futsal team, and joined the Gibraltar Futsal Third Division. In 2018, they joined the new look First Division, after the leagues were rebranded and merged into two tiers, the Premier Division and the First Division. Current futsal squad Stadium  Victoria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Gibraltar. It is currently used mostly for football matches and holds about 5,000 people.

Other relevant factors include * other advantages to the industry; * whether the admission would promote orderly collective bargaining; and * the extent to which the applicant party may disrupt the working of the bargaining council. The Labour Court also considered any possible contribution to the organisational diversity of the council within its sector and area, the threshold for admission and other requirements of the constitution of the bargaining council. The court concluded that the FRA should be admitted as a new member, and made an order to that effect.

MRRA is overseen by an 11-member board of trustees appointed by the Governor of Maine and confirmed by the legislature. MRRA is located at the former United States Navy base, now called Brunswick Landing, in Brunswick, Maine. MRRA is responsible for implementation of the Reuse Master Plans. for both the Naval Air Station Brunswick and the former Topsham Annex, located in the town of Topsham, Maine across the Androscoggin River from Brunswick. MRRA also owns and manages the Brunswick Executive Airport.  Land Transfers  MRRA acquires former Navy property through what are known as Economic Development Conveyances (EDC) and Public Benefit Conveyances (PBC). Before land is transferred, it must be cleared of any environmental issues by the Navy, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Overall, MRRA will receive about 2,100 acres from the Navy when all conveyances are complete. In the case of Brunswick Executive Airport, MRRA was given the property, almost 1,000 acres, via a PBC. With EDCs, MRRA purchases the property from the Navy through a somewhat complex payment schedule that includes a revenue sharing mechanism. As of Nov. 1, 2013, MRRA owns 722.19 acres of 1,098 acres of non-airport property and 992.2 acres of airport property. The Town of Brunswick and Bowdoin College will receive the remaining Navy property. Under its land transfer agreement with the Navy, MRRA was required to enter into a $3 million loan agreement with the U.S. government for transfer of EDC property. MRRA plans to begin paying off the loan in 2014, although it is not required to pay until 2015. The Navy Covenant arrangement includes further contingencies for MRRA in that the 25 percent annual share is required for real estate proceeds in excess of $7 million and up to $37,400,000. If proceeds are excess of $37,400,000 and less than $42,400,000, MRRA is not required to pay the government any portion of the proceeds. If the real estate proceeds exceed $42,400,000, MRRA must pay the government 50 percent of all gross real estate proceeds annually. These requirements will be in effect for 23 years, starting after the initial closing or January 1, 2018, whichever is earlier.  Redevelopment  MRRA has identified five target industry sectors on which to focus its economic development efforts‚Äîaviation/aerospace, biotech/biomed, composites and advance materials, information technology, and renewable energy. MRRA has been recognized for its success compared to its 2005 BRAC peers in rapidly repurposing the former Navy base. The authority says it has 25 businesses on the Brunswick Landing campus, including Southern Maine Community College. Other businesses located at Brunswick Landing include M√∂lnlycke Health Care, Tempus Jets, Kestrel Aviation, American Bureau of Shipping, Oxford Networks, and Providence Service Corporation. Those businesses have created 350 jobs . as of November 1, 2013. MRRA helped host the Association of Defense Communities (ADC) Base Redevelopment Forum September 24 to Sept. 26, 2013 in Portland, Maine. It has been lauded for its accomplishments by both the ADC and the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Economic Adjustment.

Personal life Heen was born in Hen, M√∏re og Romsdal, and worked as a tailor in nearby √Öndalsnes. He was a half brother of Gunnar Randers junior and uncle of J√∏rgen Randers. His father Gunnar Randers senior (1877-1963) was a civil engineer that worked in √Ölesund after the 1904 fire. Heen's mother Sofie Heen (1877‚Äì1959) at the time worked as a waitress in √Ölesund. His parents did not marry. Arne Randers Heen was a tailor like his mother. Career Heen is known for several first ascents, and his many ascents of Romsdalshorn, including the first winter climbing of the mountain. He was Norway's leading mountaineer from the 1920s to the 1950s. Heen was largely autodidact in mountaineering, and an unconventional outsider to a sport defined by Norsk Tindeklub in Oslo's western suburbs.Gjelstenli, Iver (1988). Arne Randers Heen.

Heen had several times attempted Trollryggen, a 2 kilometer long pillar at the edge of Trollveggen. One attempt was in the summer of 1940 with Arne N√¶ss. In 1958 he finally succeeded together with Ralph H√∏ibakk, their only equipment was rope, 10 pitons, 6 carabiners and a hammer each. Ten years later, with improved equipment, the two climbed the route in only 10 hours. In 1984 he was one of the guides for Carl Boenish and his wife during their BASE- jumping in the area. During the second world war he worked for the resistance movement and the allied intelligence. Heen helped XU-agent Sven S√∏mme escape through a difficult mountain pass between Isfjorden and Eikesdalen. He also helped escaped Russian prisoners climb through the mountains to Valldal where locals protected the Russians until the end of the war. At √Öndalsnes the Estonian Harry Wood worked at the headquarter of Organisation Todt. Wood handed over detailed maps and photos of German military facilities along the coast between Stad and Bergen to Heen. Wood's documents were an intelligence sensation for the allied.

Commonly confused with the snow cone or snowball, the ice of a sno-ball is fine and fluffy; while a snow cone's ice is coarse, crunchy, and granular. Moreover, in a snow cone the flavored syrup sinks to the bottom of the cup; while in a sno-ball the ice absorbs the syrup. Sno-balls are a seasonal treat as they are generally sold only from roughly March to October. They are vended from \\"sno-ball stands\\" throughout parts of Louisiana and Mississippi.  History  Before the 1930s ice was manually scraped from a block of ice, producing a coarser, crunchier version of the sno-ball. In 1933, Ernest Hansen began work on an ice-shaving machine; and by 1934, he had invented the first motor-driven ice-shaving machine. For two years, Hansen kept the machine within his family, making sno-balls for only his children and relatives. In 1936, Ernest and his wife Mary took their machine to the streets of New Orleans and opened Hansen's Sno-Bliz. The business ran discontinuously for the following two years because Mary needed to care for her children. In 1939, they opened the shop and remained in business for the next 67 years. By this time, grocer George Ortolano had invented his own ice-shaving machine, which he later called the Sno-Wizard. Ortolano redeveloped his wooden machine into one made of galvanized metal after he began receiving requests from people who wanted to use his machine to start their own businesses. Soon thereafter, he drew up blueprints for his machine and set his product into automated production. Ortolano's Sno-Wizards are now the primary sno-ball machines used in Louisiana and throughout the Gulf Coast.  Flavors  The following list contains many of the sno-ball flavors available at sno-ball stands around New Orleans. * Almond * Banana * Bahama Mama * Blue Bubble Gum * Blueberry * Blue Raspberry * Buttered popcorn * Cake batter * Cherry * Chocolate * Coconut * Coffee * Cotton Candy * Cream soda * Creamsicle * Daiquiri * French vanilla * Grape * Ice cream * Key lime pie * King cake * Kiwi * Lemon * Margarita * Nectar * Orange * Orchid cream vanilla * Peach * Peanut butter * Pi√±a colada * Pineapple * Raspberry * Rocket 88 * Root beer * Silver fox * Spearmint * Strawberry * Tamarind * Tiger's blood * Tutti frutti * Vanilla malt * Watermelon * Wedding cake  Variations  * Cheesecake Stuffed Snowball: created by Sno-La Snowballs, the snowball is stuffed with cheesecake in the center, surrounded by the snowball flavor of choice. *Stuffed sno-ball: a sno-ball stuffed with vanilla or chocolate softserve ice cream * Cream-flavored sno-ball: a sno-ball made with flavored syrup mixed with evaporated milk * Sugar-free sno-ball: a sno-ball made with sugar-free syrup * Toppings: soft-serve ice cream, condensed milk, marshmallow fluff, Oreos  References Further reading  External links Category:Cuisine of New Orleans Category:Ice-based desserts ","title":"Sno-ball"},{"id":"40981085","text":"Kasper Beier K√∏hlert (born 25 July 1989) is a Danish footballer who currently plays for Varde IF.

The poem is short, only ten lines, and briefly describes an interaction between the speaker and \\"creature, naked, bestial\\" encountered \\"in the desert\\", eating his heart.  Reception  Crane's poetry has been given significantly less scholarly attention than his fiction. In fact, none of Crane's poems were anthologized until 1926. When the poems were published, Crane was criticized for the unusual form of the poems and was said to have some nerve in presenting these \\"disjointed effusions\\" as poetry. The first reviewers found The Black Riders to be \\"artless and barbaric\\". In his correspondence with an editor of Leslie's Weekly in 1895, Crane wrote that he preferred The Black Riders to his novel The Red Badge of Courage. Crane wrote, \\"I suppose I ought to be thankful to 'The Red Badge,' but I am much fonder of my little book of poems, 'The Black Riders'. My aim was to comprehend in it the thoughts I have had about life in general, while 'The Red Badge' is a mere episode in life, an amplification.\\"  Criticism  Joseph Katz states that \\"In the Desert\\" presents an interaction between a primary voice reporting an incident (\\"In the desert / I saw a creature, naked, bestial\\") and a second character representing a position which is perceived to be inferior. The primary speaker assumes a dominant role over the \\"creature\\". \\"In the Desert\\" also serves as an example of Crane's tendency to state universal truths, and this leads to Crane's use of abstraction. Though Crane has this tendency, his use of abstraction is tempered by his allegory and parable. Crane uses only two characters in a general form, the speaker and the creature, and both characters serve the larger purpose of the narrative. They do not hold importance due to their individual characteristics. \\"In the Desert\\" presents an ambiguous state of mind, but affirms a stance toward God and the Universe. In this poem, no particular sin is pointed out to the reader; instead, Crane shows that human nature is inherently sinful and corrupt. Max Cavitch writes, that \\"In the Desert\\" is well-deserving of a permanent place in American literature along with Crane's The Black Riders.

He was a tank commander during the Second World War. Biography=Early life Thompson was born in Murree, in pre-partition India (now Pakistan), where his father worked in public health. He returned to the UK to be educated at Marlborough College and then learn about natural sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Second World War His time at Cambridge was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. He volunteered for the army at a Reception Unit in Reading in September 1939. After initially assisting his father (who by then was the Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth) in setting up casualty clearing stations, he volunteered to join the Royal Tank Regiment. Before his call up in 1941, Thompson had joined the Local Defence Volunteers and then the Home Guard. He was sent to Sandhurst for officer training, and was commissioned into the 4th (Queen's Own) Hussars. After transferring to the 4th County of London Yeomanry, he sailed to join the 7th Armoured Division (Desert Rats) in North Africa and took part in Operation Crusader in November 1941. Involved in much of the fighting across the Libyan desert, Thompson, now a Tank Commander, was severely wounded in May 1942, during the Allied defence of the Knightsbridge Box. His Crusader A15 Mark VI had been hit and disabled and Thompson was fortunate to escape his tank with a leg wound. The rest of his crew were all killed or taken prisoner. He was evacuated to a field hospital in Tobruk, and from there to Cairo by train, where doctors operated to save his leg. Cloudsley-Thompson was then shipped to Britain to recuperate and became a tank gunnery instructor at Sandhurst. He also married Anne Cloudsley in 1944, and updated their surname to Cloudsley- Thompson. He rejoined his tank regiment in time for the Normandy Landings. He took part in the Battle of Villers-Bocage on 13 June 1944; his Cromwell tank was destroyed and he and his crew were lucky to scramble out alive. During July 1944, Thompson took part in Operation Goodwood, the attempt to storm the Bourgu√©bus Ridge. Naturalist After the war, Cloudsley-Thompson returned to Cambridge to complete his studies, gaining his MA and PhD. He then became a lecturer in zoology at King's College London. However, he still harboured a close interest in the desert he had fought across. In 1960, he became professor of zoology at the University of Khartoum, and keeper of the Sudan Natural History Museum. Following a short spell in 1969 as visiting professor at the University of Albuquerque in the deserts of New Mexico, he and Anne returned to London in 1972. He was appointed professor of zoology at Birkbeck College, University of London, and remained with the university until he retired in 1986, when he was made emeritus professor. Cloudsley-Thompson was also a former chairman of the British Naturalists' Association between 1974‚Äì83, and the recipient of the Association's highest honour for outstanding services to the understanding of natural history, the Peter Scott Memorial Award in 1993. By the time of his death in October 2013, he had written over 50 books on desert fauna and the adaptations used by its wildlife such as spiders and scorpions. His wife Anne predeceased him in 2012.

It opened with the theme park in 1987 as the Runaway Train. The original ride was closed in 2012 for refurbishment and reopened on 14 March 2014, with the same track layout but new name and theming. Scorpion Express is set in a small mining village, featuring an animated metalwork scorpion. History The Runaway Train in 2010 This Mack Blauer Enzian family coaster opened as the Runaway Train in 1987 and operated for over twenty five years. It had an Old Western theme, and featured an extensively themed area and queue, primarily designed by John Wardley, taking guests above buildings, around a lake and down into a small mine. The coaster was originally designed to travel in and out of a cave feature, which enclosed half the track and hid much of the structure, creating an interacting rocky landscape. However, due to its semi- temporary construction and prolonged lack of maintenance over the years, the cave feature was removed in late 2012 and the ride closed. Boiler feature in the queue In 2013, the area surrounding the Runaway Train was boarded off with notices up saying that the ride would be \\"Re-launching in 2014\\". Over the closed season, the animatronic scorpion was installed after 208 hours of off site construction. During this downtime, the ride had all its original cave design, landscaping and theming features removed, now placing the track completely in the open and the queue on flat ground. The ride was complete on time to open for the park's Annual Passholder Preview Days when it soft- opened. The ride officially launched on Wednesday 19 March after having slight alterations and theming adjustments. Advertising During the resort's annual February Half-Term event - African Adventures - advertising for the ride was placed on large billboards at the zoo entrance and on the back of the gate maps. At the same time a mini site for the ride was launched on the parks website, which showed the concept art for the attraction among other details. During this time it was also announced that the ride would feature fire, water and smoke effects, as well as an animated scorpion. Days after the ride's soft opening, adverts for the attraction were broadcast across British television. Several other media stunts including newspaper articles about the ride appeared at this time. None of the footage used in the Scorpion Express TV adverts was from the actual ride, instead shots of a bigger (but similarly themed) family coaster at Heide Park, and computer generated clips, were used to advertise the ride. Scorpion Express received mixed response since its launch in 2014, largely to do with its minimal theme featured compared to how the ride was originally designed. However it remained a popular family attraction as it had since opening in 1987. Description The ride's premise revolves around a town named Scorpion Valley, which has supposedly been overrun with scorpions after an explosion caused the gold mine to collapse and all the residents fled the town, according to text and posters stuck up in the switchback queue line. The Town Governor has supposedly left behind a giant, mechanical steam-powered scorpion fashioned from scrap metal from the debris of the explosion, in an attempt to guard the gold from chancing looters. Queue Vinyl posters in the queue for Scorpion Express display the ride's backstory. The new ride in Mexicana starts with a long winding queue. At the start of the queue, a radio station can be heard playing in the background, notices from the Governor of Scorpion Valley are pinned up in the queue, which reveal the ride's backstory. Riders then enter and queue in a dark, mine- themed building where live scorpions feature. Upon exiting, riders go over a bridge, before arriving at the station. Ride The ride takes guests on a train journey through an abandoned mining town, across deserts and near to the mine itself. It features animatronic scenery, smoke, fire and water effects. The height minimum is 90 cm, while guests with a torso +51 inches are not able to ride. Riders under 110 cm must be accompanied by a person aged 16 or over. The layout is a basic figure of 8 loop with a straight piece of track at the back and consists of several helixes, some of which go over and under the queue line, which itself snakes around the ride. The ride makes at least two laps of the circuit, and more on off peak days. An on-ride photo is taken immediately before the train returns to enter the station for the first time.

Since restoration, the 765 was added to the National Register of Historic Places as no. 96001010 on September 12, 1996 and has operated excursion trains across the Eastern United States. In 2012, the FWRHS's steam locomotive no. 765 was added to the Norfolk Southern's 21st Century Steam program.  History  The Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society was formed in 1972 and currently has over 400 members and over 70 volunteers. The group was formed with one purpose in mind: to restore an old steam locomotive to operational use and see it running down the tracks again. The history of the group actually begins before the FWRHS was formally conceived. The Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society's story began with a series of events that began long before anyone had the idea to form a preservation group. In the mid-1950s, diesel locomotives began replacing steam locomotives for mainline freight and passenger service due to the cheaper operating costs of the diesels. With many of its steam locomotives retired or otherwise not in service by 1958, the New York, Chicago, & St. Louis Railroad, also known as the Nickel Plate Road, classified many of its steam locomotives in non- operating \\"stored-serviceable\\" condition. In 1958, the 765 was fired up as a stationary steam generating boiler in the Nickel Plate Road's New Haven, IN shops. Following a few short years in this role, the railroad officially retired the locomotive in 1963 and offered it to the city of Fort Wayne, IN as a static monument. The city was eager to accept the railroad's offer, however, they wanted to receive locomotive 767 rather than the 765. They wanted the alternative locomotive because in October 1955 the city, in conjunction with the railroad, built an elevated railroad line through the city to eliminate railroad grade crossings that tied up traffic between the North and South ends of town, and the 767 was used to pull the ceremonial train across the newly constructed bridge. Due to a grade crossing accident and being stored outdoors afterwards, the 767 was much more deteriorated than the 765, which had been stored indoors. The city accepted the 765 and had its numbers repainted to 767. The steam engine was then pushed into Fort Wayne's Lawton Park, where it remained as a monument and a reminder of steam for the next 12 years. In September 1971, at a convention for the Nickel Plate Railroad Historical & Technical Society, a group of individuals decided they wanted to discuss the possibility of restoring the 765, the 767, and a Wabash Railroad locomotive (no.534) cosmetically. By November of the next year, four individuals, Wayne York, Glenn Brendel, Walter Sassmannshausen, and John Eichman drafted incorporation paperwork with Allen County and the Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society, INC. was born. In 1973, the new group worked out a deal with the city of Fort Wayne to acquire the locomotive in Lawton Park under a 25-year lease. They then began looking at the locomotive on a more in-depth level and decided that the necessary repairs could not be done at the Lawton Park site. On September 6, 1974 the FWRHS built temporary tracks. through the city to connect to the existing railroad tracks and they pulled the 765 from the park to the FWRHS property in New Haven. From 1975-1979, a group of unpaid volunteers completely rebuilt the 765 and in September 1979, the NKP 765 was fired and ran under its own steam for the first time for testing since 1963 Along with operating NKP 765, from 1994 to 2001, the facilities also housed another Berkshire locomotive, the Chesapeake and Ohio 2716 and operated it in 1996 on short excursions.  About the 765  Railroads commonly relied on drag freights with engines that could pull heavy tonnage, but at low speeds. Following experiments with existing designs, Lima Locomotive Works developed a new wheel arrangement, the 2-8-4, to accommodate an increase in the size of the locomotive's firebox. An increase in the firebox size allowed more coal combustion and subsequent heat output, improving the amount of steam developed and increasing horsepower. These and other modifications created the concept of \\"horsepower at speed.\\" The NKP 765 is a steam locomotive built for the Nickel Plate Road in 1944 by the Lima Locomotive Works. Classified as an \\"S-2\\" Berkshire-type steam locomotive, the locomotive is based on a 2-8-4 wheel arrangement. It operated freight and passenger trains until retirement in 1963. The Berkshire locomotives earned their name from the Berkshire Mountains in Southwest Massachusetts. The Berkshire class of locomotives was not the heaviest, fastest, or most powerful, but was a popular all-around type intended for fast freight service. It survived in regular use until 1958, between Chicago, Fort Wayne, Cleveland, and Buffalo. The Nickel Plate was one of the last Class I railroads to regularly use steam locomotives, only the Illinois Central, Norfolk & Western, and Grand Trunk Western were to continue longer, until spring 1960. The Nickel Plate Road had a fleet of 112 of the 2-8-4 Berkshire type steam locomotives. After retirement, most obsolete locomotives were cut up for scrap and melted down. A total of six were saved by various means. Five survivors were from the second batch of the S-2 Class, 755-769, which were built at the height of World War II in summer and fall 1944. The sixth survivor was from the S-3 Class, 770-779, built in spring 1949. The 779 was requested to be saved because it was the last steam locomotive of any type built by the Lima Locomotive Works, Lima, Ohio, the third largest commercial builder of steam locomotives in the United States. The 765 was on display from 1963-1974 in Fort Wayne, Indiana's Lawton Park before being leased by the FWRHS. From 1975 to 1979, 765 was restored to operating condition at the corner of Ryan and Edgerton Roads in New Haven, IN. The restoration site lacked conventional shop facilities and protection from the elements, but on September 1, 1979 the 765 made its first move under its own power. Later that winter it ran under its own power to Bellevue and Sandusky, Ohio for heated, indoor winter storage. In spring of 1980, 765 underwent a series of break-in runs followed by its first public excursion, making 765 the first mainline steam locomotive to be restored and operated by an all volunteer non-profit organization. From 1993 to 2005, the 765 was completely rebuilt at a total cost of $750,000, which involved over 13,000 volunteer hours. The Society has an outstanding safety record and a professional, experienced crew of determined volunteers, several of whom have been with the Society since its inception. This rebuild included adding an MU stand and in-cab signalling to allow the crew to know what the line-side signal aspect says before it comes into view. On average, the locomotive experiences 3,000 visitors a day when operating, with visitor and passenger numbers running between 40,000 and 60,000 ticket buyers in 2009 and 2011 in less than 30 days, respectively. Typical passenger trains carry anywhere from 600-1,000 people at a time with tickets for many trips selling out in 24 hours. Press reports indicate the continuous presence of large crowds of \\"locals and out of towners\\" and on 765's ability to boost tourism in the towns that it travels through. In 2012, the Pittsburgh Tribune's headline photo proclaimed that the 765 was the \\"engine that still can\\" with CBS Pittsburgh describing it as \\"400 tons of Americana\\". When not operating excursions, 765 is maintained in a restoration shop in New Haven and maintained by a crew of 70-100 volunteers throughout the year. The shop is open to the public and houses a variety of other railroad equipment including vintage steam and diesel locomotives, passenger cars, cabooses, and more.  Future Plans  Since 2012, the FWRHS has worked alongside the Norfolk Southern Railroad as a part of the 21st Century Steam Program. In this program, the 765, along with other historic steam locomotives in the Eastern United States, operate excursion trains for tourists and company employees & VIP's over the railroad's trackage. As well as being a part of the 21st Century Steam Program, the FWRHS is working with the city of Fort Wayne to develop a downtown riverfront property that will house the NKP 765 and the FWRHS as well as being a centerpiece for walking & biking trails and a park. The project, known as Headwaters Junction, is still in the planning phase, but if approved could boost the popularity and recognition of the FWRHS by making it a prominent attraction in the city.

History Black Buccaneer was originally opened in 1988 as Smugglers Galleon in Pirates' Cove, an area adjacent to Transylvania in Chessington World of Adventures Resort. It was manufactured by Huss Rides. The ride received a soundtrack in late 2013. The ride and surrounding buildings were refurbished in 2014. During the 2016 season, frequent rainfall meant the motor underneath the ride flooded, causing the attraction to close for around a month. For the start of the 2017 season, the ride received a new coat of paint, a single rider queue was also added. For the start of the 2018 season, until July it was not open and was on land near Seastorm. After spending the 2018 Winters Tail event operating the ride closed for normal winter maintenance, and at the start of the 2019 season was announced as opening late along with three other rides. Whilst the other rides opened after a month, Black Buccaneer remained in pieces and was not re-built. It was eventually removed from the queue time boards, park app and website before Chessington confirmed on social media that the ride will not operate for at least the 2019 season. The ride was to be replaced for 2020 with a brand new ride hardware replacement ship with a blue colour. Work however stopped due to COVID-19 and the progress of construction is unknown. Description The ride is themed as a pirate ship. Riders sit in 9 rows of 5, before swinging back and forth at heights of up to 60 feet. It is painted was black (hence the name), but is now painted silver. ;Restrictions You have to be a minimum of 1 meter tall to ride. Anyone under 1.3 meters must be accompanied by an adult. In the 2016 season, a rule was added where you have to be 16 years or older to be seated on the edges of each row, which meant anyone under 16 had to be seated in the middle.

Published in 1999, two years after her Newbery Honor winning novel Ella Enchanted, \\"The Fairy's Mistake\\" follows along the same lines by taking the well-known fairytale Diamonds and Toads and turning it on its head. The story focuses on identical twin sisters Rosella and Myrtle, whose respective rewards and punishments end up doing exactly the opposite of what was intended.  Synopsis  The widow Pickering sends her daughter Rosella to the well to fetch water where she meets an old woman who is actually the fairy Ethelinda in disguise. After Rosella gives the old woman some water, the old woman tells Rosella that her kindness deserves a reward. From then on, any time Rosella says anything, jewels and gems fall from her mouth. Rosella returns home with the water and her mother is delighted at Rosella's gift. Myrtle, Rosella's sister, grabs the bucket and races to the well in the hopes that the same will happen to her. When Myrtle reaches the well, instead of the old woman, there is a knight whom she refuses to help. Ethelinda, disguised as the knight, punishes Myrtle by making vipers and insects fall from her mouth. Later, while Rosella is singing and working in the garden, Prince Harold rides by and, on noticing the jewels scattered around, proposes to Rosella, who accepts. The prince assigns attendants to catch the jewels whenever Rosella speaks and even though he asks her many questions, he is too focused on the jewels to listen to what she is saying. As the days pass, Rosella begins to feel very ill, but Prince Harold insists on making her speak. While Rosella lives at the castle, Myrtle realizes that she can use the bugs and snakes as a way to terrorize the neighbors into getting anything she wants. Ethelinda realizes that her reward and punishment are doing the exact opposite of what she intended, so she resolves to fix her mistake. Myrtle agrees to help Rosella and takes her place when Harold comes to visit her. Myrtle screams and yells at Harold who is terrified as vipers and insects fall from her mouth instead of the jewels he is expecting. After Myrtle extracts a promise from Prince Harold that he will listen to Rosella, Ethelinda offers to reward Myrtle who declines, saying that the vipers and insects are reward enough. When Prince Harold comes to visit Rosella again, they reach an agreement that he will receive half of the jewels from Rosella, with the other half going to the people. Meanwhile, Pickering and Myrtle start a lucrative betting business where Myrtle speaks into a jar and people can bet on which creature will win a race. Ethelinda resolves to never again make a mistake with rewards and punishments like those of Rosella and Myrtle.  Characters  * Ethelinda A fairy who disguises herself in order to reward those who are good and kind and punish those who are rude and wicked. * Rosella The \\"good\\" sister who gives an old woman water from the well and is rewarded to have jewels fall from her mouth every time she speaks. * Myrtle The \\"bad\\" sister who refuses to help a knight at the well and is punished to have vipers and insects fall from her mouth every time she speaks. * The widow Pickering The mother of identical twins Rosella and Myrtle. * Prince Harold The greedy prince who marries Rosella when he sees the jewels that fall from her lips when she speaks.  Relation to original story  \\"The Fairy's Mistake\\" is based on the French fairytale Diamonds and Toads. As in the original story, a fairy disguises herself in order to reward those who are good and punish those who are bad. In the original tale, the wicked mother drives out the younger daughter who has jewels fall from her mouth and a prince finds the girl wandering the woods. Later the wicked mother also drives out the older daughter, who dies alone in the woods. Gail Carson Levine keeps the beginning of the tale, but plays with the idea that all rewards and punishments do not go exactly as planned. The \\"good\\" daughter still marries a prince, but he is materialistic, and the \\"bad\\" daughter and wicked mother begin a lucrative business together.

This is the first novel published by Patchett, and it was selected as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. Patchett completed the manuscript for The Patron Saint of Liars during a fellowship at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The novel focuses on a young woman named Rose who abandons her life in California as a married woman. She leaves for Kentucky and takes residence at a home for unwed mothers that is owned by the Catholic Church. As she watches girls give birth and disappear from the home, she must think of her own plans and what the future has in store for her.  Plot  The book is divided into four sections: Habit, Rose, Son, and Sissy  Habit  In 1906, George Clatterbuck witnesses a miracle as his daughter, June Clatterbuck, is healed by water from a spring in the back pasture of their property. The healing qualities of the spring attract visitors from afar including the Nelsons, wealthy horse breeders from Lexington. Upon discovering that there wasn‚Äôt a hotel in Habit, Lewis Nelson commissioned a hotel to be built to create space for all the visitors seeking out aid from the spring. The hotel was opened in 1920 as Hotel Louisa in honor of Lewis‚Äô wife, Louisa Nelson. When the spring dried up and the stock market crashed in 1929, the hotel was given to the Catholic church and renamed Saint Elizabeth‚Äôs. It was shortly used as a home for nuns to live out their days. Later, the nuns were moved to Ohio and the Hotel Louisa remained empty for some time before it became a Roman Catholic home for unwed mothers.  Rose  It is 1968, and Rose Clinton finds herself in a bind as she is pregnant with her husband's child, and she has no desire to keep the baby. Unhappy with her life, she seeks out Father O'Donnell and learns of a place called Saint Elizabeth's in Habit, Kentucky. It is a home for unwed mothers, but Rose begs Father O'Donnell to assist her. She sets out from California on Highway 40, making several stops along the way. Rose arrives at Saint Elizabeth's and finds herself living with a girl named Angela. Thinking about her mother and husband often, Rose tries to fit in and quickly learns the routine of Saint Elizabeth's, taking a job in the kitchen with Sister Evangeline. Sister Evangeline grows fond of Rose, keeping her in the kitchen frequently to assist her. She often attempts to tell Rose what she knows about her future, but Rose tends to brush her insight to the side. As the months pass, Rose starts to grow to the idea of being a mother, especially as Beatrice asks for her assistance in delivering her twin boys. After an exhausting night delivering Beatrice's babies, Rose wanders off outside in the snow. Son finds her, and carries her back to his home. Rose finally admits that she wants to keep her daughter and Son suggests that she marry him and live at Saint Elizabeth's with him. She agrees quickly and begs to be married that night. Following their ceremony, Rose and Son share their news with Angela and Sister Evangeline, while attempting to build a foundation for their marriage with little knowledge of each other.  Son  Now married and adjusting to life as a new father, Son thinks a lot about his life prior to Rose and Sissy. He reflects on his time as a teenager, starting with his roller coaster romance with a girl named Cecelia, enlisting in the army, and having to leave abruptly. Throughout his story, he reflects on memories of Sissy growing up, developing her personality and the transformation of her relationship with both himself and Rose.  Sissy  Now fifteen years old, Sissy is adapted to the lack of emotional connection with her mother, Rose. Although she has grown up without a strong bond with Rose, she doesn't keep herself from trying to have a relationship with her mother, as she asks Rose to teach her how to drive. Once she knows the key to her mother's heart, nothing will keep Sissy from rekindling the friendship and love she had for her mother.  Main characters  * Martha Rose Clinton is the mother of Cecelia Abbott. She was previously married to Thomas Clinton, prior to leaving California and marrying Wilson Abbott upon her decision to raise her daughter. * Mother Corinne is the head nun at Saint Elizabeth‚Äôs. She is regarded as somewhat strict and mean by most of the unwed mothers. * Sister Evangeline is one of the nuns at Saint Elizabeth's. Her primary role is cooking for the women. Prior to being the cook, she was the head nun at Saint Elizabeth's, up until the time that Mother Corinne took over. * Wilson \\"Son\\" Abbott is the groundskeeper/maintenance man at Saint Elizabeth‚Äôs. He marries Rose, and takes on the role of Cecelia's father. * June Clatterbuck is the owner of the property of Saint Elizabeth's. She becomes good friends with Rose and becomes more involved with Saint Elizabeth's. * Cecilia \\"Sissy\\" Helen Abbott is Rose‚Äôs daughter. Her father, according to her birth certificate, is Son. Her biological father is Thomas Clinton.  Reception  Many reviews have praised Patchett for her first novel. Annabel Davis-Goff, for Entertainment Weekly, wrote, \\"...this is a wonderful novel. Patchett writes with a simplicity of style and clarity of voice that make one eager for her next book.\\" Gerald Costello, for U.S. Catholic, wrote, \\"One often hears of talented new writers that they show great promise.... For Ann Patchett, the promise has already been fulfilled; with The Patron Saint of Liars, she has arrived.\\" Alice McDermott, of the New York Times Book Review, said, \\"Ann Patchett has written such a good first novel that among the many pleasures it offers is the anticipation of how wonderful her second, third, and fourth will surely be.... It is a world that Ms. Patchett draws with wit and imagination.... It is about pilgrimage and healing. A made-up story of an enchanted place. A fairy tale. A delight.\\"  Adaptation  In 1998, The Patron Saint of Liars was adapted as a television film, for CBS.

At the same time, his reworkings of Schumann's A-minor sonata for violin and piano and Tchaikovsky's second piano concerto (premiered in 1986 by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under James Levine) remain loyally romantic.John von Rhein (3 July 1986). \\"Fennimore's Tchaikovsky Project Finally to See the Light of Debut.\\" Chicago Tribune.

Painting by Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine. Election Diet in 1697. On June 17, 1696, King John III Sobieski died in his palace at Wilan√≥w near Warsaw. This meant that another free election was necessary, as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was left without a monarch. One of the candidates for the Polish throne was the Duke of O≈Çawa (Lower Silesia) and son of the late king, James Louis Sobieski. He was initially supported by the Kingdom of France and the Swedish Empire. Also, among his followers were szlachta from Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, and Bishop of Kujawy, Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖmbski. James Louis Sobieski, however, did not get along with his French-born mother, Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d'Arquien. The mother and her son argued about properties of John III Sobieski, and as a result, James Louis lost the support of Polish nobility. Another candidate, the Elector of Saxony Augustus II the Strong, was backed by influential and powerful Emperor Leopold I. To win the support of Roman Catholic, conservative Poles, Augustus decided to convert from Lutheranism to Catholicism. The conversion took place in Vienna, on June 2, 1697, and this decision won for Frederick the support of Pope Innocent XII. The main opponent to the Saxon elector was Francois Louis, Prince of Conti, backed by King Louis XIV of France. His candidacy won support of several Polish and Lithuanian magnates, many of whom were bribed by French envoy, Melchior de Polignac. On October 24, 1696, Primate of Poland Micha≈Ç Stefan Radziejowski, who had previously backed James Louis Sobieski, switched sides and declared his support of Francois Louis. Since Radziejowski at that time was the interrex, his decision attracted the nobility, which followed him. Nevertheless, key role in the oncoming election was played by the Tsardom of Russia, which was Polish ally in the ongoing war against the Ottoman Empire (see Great Turkish War). The Russians backed Augustus, who had previously declared that he would continue the war, and who had in 1695-1696 commanded Austrian - Saxon army in its Hungarian campaign. The election of Francois Louis meant quick end to the Polish-Ottoman war, and possibility of a Polish- Russian conflict. The Russians, well aware of this danger, sent large sums of money to the Commonwealth, trying to win the support of Polish-Lithuanian nobility. The election took place in Wola near Warsaw, on June 27, 1697. By popular support, Francois Louis, Prince of Conti was elected new King of the Commonwealth. This was immediately contested by Augustus the Strong, who declared himself the new monarch. Third candidate, James Louis Sobieski, expressed his support of Conti. On July 27, 1697, Augustus, backed by Russia, Austria and Brandenburg-Prussia, crossed Polish border near Czelad≈∫ in Lesser Poland. He marched towards Krak√≥w, but was not allowed to enter the ancient capital, as the Starosta of Krak√≥w, Franciszek Wielopolski, himself a supporter of Conti, did not let him into the city. The stalemate was quickly solved after Wielopolski had accepted a bribe, but soon another problem appeared. According to the Polish law, the coronation in Wawel Cathedral was to be carried out only with royal insignia, kept in Wawel Treasury. There were eight locks in the door to the Treasury, with eight keys. The keys were kept by eight Senators, out of which six supported Conti. Augustus II and his entourage decided to make a hole in the Treasury wall, leaving the door intact. On September 15, 1697, Augustus signed the Pacta Conventa, and was crowned new King of Poland, August II, by Bishop of Kujawy, Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖmbski. Primate Radziejowski refused to recognize the coronation, stating that Conti was the rightful monarch. Radziejowski started the so-called ≈Åowicz Rokosz, which gathered supporters of the Frenchman. Conti himself arrived at the Baltic Sea port of Gda≈Ñsk on September 26, 1697, with a squadron of six ships commanded by Jean Bart. Since Russia concentrated its army near Lithuanian border, a possibility of an international conflict was real. The situation was solved without foreign intervention, as on November 9, the attack of troops loyal to Augustus forced Conti to abandon his quarters in Oliwa, and to leave Poland. On December 12, 1697, Conti returned to France. Primate Radziejowski refused to recognize Augustus until spring of 1698, when he received a large sum of money, and was promised a government post.

Manufactured by Mack Rides, the ride gave guests a guided tour of Chessington Zoo, and in its first year, the construction of Chessington World of Adventures theme park. The ride ran for almost thirty years before closing abruptly in late July 2015. In early January 2016, the park announced that the ride would be retired due to continuous troubles with maintenance for the ride.http://www.chessington.com/plan/faq/150/safari-skyway.aspx History Safari Skyway was opened in 1986, as one of the first rides to open at Chessington World of Adventures. Safari Skyway's entrance was towards the back of the Market Square area, and the monorail gave a guided tour of the zoo, lawn and mansion area. In later years of the ride's operation, maintenance of the aging monorail system became difficult, and it suffered frequent breakdowns, including an incident in 2009 when a park-wide power cut stranded the monorail cars mid-route, forcing those inside to be rescued by a cherry picker. Description The ride took approximately 8 minutes, and the maximum height restriction for riders was 1.96 meters. Riders under 1.1 meters had to be accompanied by someone 16 or over. The ride passed such features in Chessington Zoo, such as Sea Lion Bay, Amazu, Trail of the Kings and other areas. It first passed the smaller animals in the Children's Zoo, before going behind the Sea Life Centre and near to the Lodge Gate entrance. The ride continued passing nearby (but not directly above) the gorillas, lions and sea lions before returning to the station via the theme park.
