In birds and mammals, sleep is defined by eye closure and the presence of typical patterns of electrical activity in the brain, including the neocortex, but fish lack eyelids and a neocortex. Some species that always live in shoals or that swim continuously (because of a need for ram ventilation of the gills, for example) are suspected never to sleep. There is also doubt about certain blind species that live in caves.Parzefall, J. (1993): Behavioural ecology of cave-dwelling fish; pp. 573–606 in: Pitcher, T.J.(ed.), The Behaviour of Teleost Fish; London: Chapman&Hall.; Other fish seem to sleep, however, especially when purely behavioral criteria are used to define sleep.

On the other hand, sleep patterns are easily disrupted and may even disappear during periods of migration, spawning, and parental care.Reebs, S.G. (2002) Plasticity of diel and circadian activity rhythms in fish, Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries 12: 349–371.  Behavioural sleep  Instead of examining brain activity for sleep patterns, an alternate approach is to examine any rest/activity cycles that might indicate \\"behavioural sleep\\". The following four behavioural criteria are characteristic of sleep in birds and mammals and could be extended to fishes: (1) prolonged inactivity; (2) typical resting posture, often in a typical shelter; (3) alternation with activity in a 24-h cycle; (4) high arousal thresholds. Based on these criteria, many fish species have been observed sleeping. The typical sleep posture of the brown bullhead is with the fins stretched out, the tail lying flat on the bottom, the body inclined to one side at an angle of 10-30 degrees to the vertical, the cardiac and respiratory frequencies much slower than normal, and much less sensitivity to sound and to being touched.Titkov, E.S.

Mozambique tilapia are motionless at the bottom at night, with a lower respiratory rate and no eye movement, and they do not respond as readily as during the day to electrical currents or food delivery.Shapiro, C.M., and Hepburn, H.R. (1976) Sleep in a schooling fish, Tilapia mossambica. Physiology and Behavior 16: 613-615. At night, Spanish hogfish, bluehead wrasse, the wrasse Halichoeres bivittatus, the cunner Tautogolabrus adspersus, and even requiem sharks, can be picked up by hand without eliciting a response.Tauber, E.S., Weitzman, E.D., and Korey, S.R.

A 1961 observational study of approximately 200 species in European public aquaria reported many cases of apparent sleep.Weber, E. (1961) Über Ruhelagen von Fischen, Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie 18: 517–533. Divers can easily see fishes settling down for the night in typical shelters, such as holes and crevices, underneath ledges, amidst vegetation, inside sponges, or buried in sand.Reebs, S.G. (1992) Sleep, inactivity, and circadian rhythms in fish. Pp. 127-135 In Rhythms in Fishes (M.A. Ali, editor). Plenum, New York. Some extra protection can be derived from special secretions, such as the mucous envelope produced by several species of wrasse and parrotfish, either around the fish themselves or at the opening of their shelter. These envelopes screen the sleeping fish from predatorsWinn, H.E., and Bardach, J.E.

Biology Letters 7: 292-294. In the laboratory, periods of inactivity often alternate with periods of activity on a 24-h basis, or a near 24-h basis when the lighting conditions are constant. Circadian rhythms of activity have been documented in over 40 different fish species, including hagfish, lamprey, sharks, cyprinids, ictalurids, gymnotids, salmonids, and labrids.Reebs S.G. (2011) Circadian Rhythms in Fish. In: Farrell A.P., (ed.), Encyclopedia of Fish Physiology: From Genome to Environment, volume 1, pp. 736–743. San Diego: Academic Press.Zhdanova, I. and S.G. Reebs.

Physiological sleep  One physiological characteristic of sleep goes by the name of \\"homeostatic regulation\\". This is the notion that animals need a more or less constant amount of sleep every day, so that if a subject is deprived of sleep one day, the amount of sleep tends to \\"rebound\\" (increase) the next few days. This has been observed in zebrafish. At night, zebrafish appear to float in the water column, either horizontally or with the head slightly up. The frequency of mouth and gill movement is reduced by almost half and they are twice as hard to arouse as during the day. If they are deprived of this sleep-like behaviour, the sleep bouts thereafter are longer and the arousal threshold is higher than usual, suggesting a rebound effect.Zhdanova, I.V., Wang, S.Y., Leclair, O.U., and Danilova, N.P. (2001) Melatonin promotes sleep-like state in zebrafish. Brain Research 903: 263-268.Yokogawa, T., Marin, W., Faraco, J., Pézeron, G., Appelbaum, L., Zhang, J., Rosa, F., Mourrain, P., and Mignot, E. (2007) Characterization of sleep in zebrafish and insomnia in hypocretin receptor mutants. PloS Biology 5: 2379-2397. Similarly, in the convict cichlid, activity decreases on days that follow an experimental disruption of the fish's normal rest behaviour at night.Tobler, I., and Borbély, A.A. (1985) Effet of rest deprivation on motor activity of fish. Journal of Comparative Physiology A 157: 817-822.  Absence of sleep  Traditionally Mahayana Buddhists believed fish never sleep, and fish became a symbol of wakefulness. Pictured is a hollow slit drum called a wooden fish or Chinese temple block. These are used when chanting sutras to keep the rhythm and remind practitioners to remain alert. Many pelagic fish species, such as bluefish, Atlantic mackerel, tuna, bonito, and some sharks, swim continuously and do not show signs, behavioural or otherwise, of sleep.Olla, B.L., and Studholme, A.L.

Pp. 131-151 In: Rhythmic Activity of Fishes (J.E. Thorpe, ed.). Academic Press, London. It has been argued that one function of sleep is to allow the brain to consolidate into memory the things it has learned during the animal's normal period of activity. The brain might not be able to do this while still assailed by new stimuli and new information to process. Therefore, the role of sleep would be to periodically shut down sensory input to allow the brain to form memories. Pelagic species swim in an environment that is rather boring (kilometers upon kilometers of open water with not much happening in it). In such species, the sensory input is so low that memory formation could take place even if the fish keeps on moving (a repetitive activity) and does not fall asleep in the traditional sense of the word.Kavanau, J.L. (2010) Schooling by continuously active fishes: clues to sleep's ultimate function, Pp. 57-85 In: Evolution of sleep: phylogenetic and functional perspectives (McNamara, P., Barton, R.A., and Nunn, C.L., eds.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Diurnal damselfish normally sleep motionless in crevices within coral reefs at night, but three species (the green chromis, the marginate dascyllus and the whitetail dascyllus) spend the night between coral branches where they beat their fins at a rate about twice that of normal daytime swimming. This creates water currents that keep the inner zone of the coral (and thus the fish themselves) well oxygenated, at levels about four times higher than in the absence of the fish. Though the fish are active (mostly in a repetitive way), they do not respond to light or to the presence of potential predators. The researchers who documented this behaviour called it \\"sleep-swimming\\".Goldshmid, R., Holzman, R., Weihs, D., and Genin, A. (2004) Aeration of corals by sleep-swimming fish. Limnology and Oceanography 49: 1832-1839. Sleep could also be absent during specific parts of a fish's life. Species normally quiescent at night become active day and night during the spawning season. Many parental species forego sleep at night and fan their eggs day and night for many days in a row. This has been observed in threespine stickleback,Reebs, S.G., Whoriskey, F.G., and FitzGerald, G.J.

Geography  Chiarone Scalo is about 58 km from Grosseto and 11 km from Capalbio, and it is situated in the plain of southern Maremma between the hills of Capalbio and the Tyrrhenian Sea, next to the mouth of the river Chiarone, which marks the border between the provinces of Grosseto and Viterbo, Lazio. Chiarone Scalo is the southernmost village in Tuscany.  History  The small town was born in the late 18th century as border point and customs between the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States and it developed in the next century with the opening of the railway station (1867). With the Maremman Riforma agraria (land reform) in the 1950s it became the centre for various newborn rural villages which converge on it: the hamlet of Selva Nera and several others named after the letters of the alphabet (Centro A, Centro B, Centro C, Centro D, Centro E, Centro F, Centro G, Centro H, Centro I, Centro L, Centro M).

The palace was then named after the family who lived there after the dismantling of customs. The palazzo is divided into nearly a hundred rooms and among them there were also the papal apartment, stables and a prison.Aldo Mazzolai, Guida della Maremma.

It is located approximately 3 miles northeast of the community of North San Juan just off California State Route 49 within the Oregon Creek Day Use Area of the Tahoe National Forest.  Current Status  The bridge was rehabilitated in early 2018 and is now open to light motor vehicles, with a 5-ton weight limit. This involved replacing the entire cover, and reworking the abutments.http://bridgehunter.com/ca/yuba/oregon-creek/ Prior to this, the bridge was officially closed to all traffic but pedestrians can and do access it. The National Bridge Inventory lists it as \\"structurally deficient.\\"National Bridge Inventory Data Base There is extensive graffiti inside. The roof is now covered with corrugated metal sheeting and the deck is supported by metal I-beams. This description was written in 1974 on the Nomination Form for the bridge's inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places: > The hand hewn wooden Ponderosa Pine beams are approximately 16 inches square > and are still sound. The sides consist of wooden siding and the structure > originally had a shake roof. The abutments were originally of unmortared > stone construction. The east abutment appears to be as originally > constructed, however, the west abutment was faced with concrete at some > later date. Yuba County replaced the wooden siding and replaced the shake > roof with one of corrugated tin because of the snow loads, some 40 to 50 > years ago.  History  The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The following is excerpted from the Nomination Form, which was filled out in 1974 by George W. Taylor, Land Use Planner for the Tahoe National Forest: > The covered bridge over Oregon Creek has been used continuously since its > construction over a century ago. The actual construction date is in > question, however. Thompson and West indicates that Tom Freeman built a > bridge across Oregon Creek in 1858 and in 1871 built another a little above > the first at a cost of $2,500.00. The original bridge was washed away > subsequent to the construction of the new bridge. (1879:100) Other > references quote various dates, including 1860, 1861 and 1862 as the year > that the bridge was constructed. (Adams 1963:134) In any event, this bridge > is either the oldest, or one of the oldest covered bridges in the western > United States still in general use. (Adams 1963:134) Tom Freeman, who built > the bridge, operated it and another bridge across the Middle Yuba River > nearby, as toll bridges, apparently until his death, in 1892. Subsequently, > Yuba County acquired the bridge and still operates it. The date of > acquisition is unverified, but is thought to be about 1910. (Thompson § West > 1879:100) The bridge is unique in the annals of American covered bridge > building in that the portals curve to meet the traveler at either end. > (Adams 1963:134) In 1883, the failure of the English Dam far upstream on the > Middle Yuba River sent a mass of water flooding downstream. The high flood > waters surged upstream in Oregon Creek, lifted the bridge from its abutments > and carried it away. When the flood waters subsided, the bridge was found > some 50 yards below its original location. Mr. Freeman hired a logging > contractor, Solon Chatfield, to return the bridge to its abutments.

This route was attractive because goods could be shipped up the Sacramento River from the San Francisco Bay to Marysville before being loaded onto wagons for the trans-Sierra journey.Sierra College eJournal Story on Henness Trail  References   External links  * Link to photo showing queen post and truss: http://bridgehunter.com/photos/20/31/203124-L.jpg * Link to photo showing Native Daughters of the Golden West plaque at the bridge: http://bridgehunter.com/photos/20/31/203128-L.jpg * Link to photo showing Highway 49 plaque at the bridge: http://bridgehunter.com/photos/20/31/203129-L.jpg * Link to 1922 photo by Larry Matthews: http://bridgehunter.com/photos/10/13/101327-M.jpg' * Link to photo of the Rudyard (English) Dam: http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/FindingAids/dynaweb/calher/miscster/figures/I0047282A.jpg * Photo of Oregon Creek Covered Bridge at Freeman's Crossing between North San Juan and Camptonville Category:Covered bridges in California Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Buildings and structures in Yuba County, California Category:Former toll bridges in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Yuba County, California Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Wooden bridges in California Category:Queen post truss bridges in the United States ","title":"Oregon Creek Covered Bridge"},{"id":"43384620","text":"Goodman Dlamini is a South African footballer who plays as a midfielder.https://www.thefinalball.com/jogador.php?id=101114&op;=statseason Career On 20 May 2018, he scored the winning goal in the Nedbank Cup final to lead Free State Stars to their first title in 24 years.

Some popular ones included \\"Ansias\\" by Luis Abelardo Núñez and \\"Amorcito\\" by Lucas Borja.  History  Paco Maceda was born on January 15, 1933, in the Peruvian province of Piura. At 16 years old, Maceda first started experimenting with guitars and the vals criollo genre. In 1954, Maceda, along with Juan Jiron and Juan Ruiz, formed \\"Los Ruiseñores.\\" In 1955, Paco Maceda teamed up with Luis Abanto Morales to write the hit song \\"Nunca Podran.\\" Genaro Ganoza Torres, co-founder of Los Kipus, was born on July 10, 1931.

In August 1959 their first song, \\"Por que sigues llorando\\" was written with assistance from Rafael Otero. Despite numerous changes to the female lead, the band always consisted of two acoustic guitars, a female voice lead, and native Peruvian percussion instruments. Eva Ayllón, in later interviews, described Maceda and Ganoza as \\"very important Creole guitarists and composers\\" who had \\"a way of making the strings cry that is very unique.\\" As the band leader and manager, Maceda took Los Kipus throughout South America in the 1960s and 1970s.

Founded in 1986, the club is one of New York City’s oldest, always featuring diverse lineups of well-known and local comedians. Comedians Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, and Jon Stewart performed here. Past performers at Stand-Up New York include: Louis C.K., Susie Essman, Mike Birbiglia, Lewis Black, Judah Friedlander, John Oliver, Jay Oakerson, Hannibal Buress, Godfrey, Dave Attell, Anthony Jeselnik, Aziz Ansari, and Amy Schumer. Originally owned by then television writer and producer, now Broadway performer Cary Hoffman, the club was bought as it was struggling financially in 2008 by Dani Zoldan and Gabe Waldman, who both frequented the club as teenagers. The two immediately employed prominent interior designer Steve Lewis for the roomy, 110 seat space, composed of both a bar and showroom. Within ten months of Zoldan and Waldman taking over, revenue had tripled. The club is now owned by former hedge fund manager James Altucher, who wrote a post on LinkedIn on August 13th 2020 stating that “NYC is dead forever” as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and was subsequently called a “putz” by comedian Jerry Seinfeld in an op-ed in The New York Times. The club offers shows seven days a week with a showcase format, meaning each of the five to seven comedians performs for 10-20 minutes. A regular week will consist of two shows Sunday through Thursday, three shows on Friday, and four shows on Saturday. Stand Up New York also hosts open-mics every weekday and rents out the venue for private events. In February of 2012, comedian Chris Rock made an impromptu appearance at the club, hoping to test out new material before presenting at the Academy Awards. Rock could be overheard consoling comedian Jodie Wasserman, whom Rock had bumped from the line-up, saying, “Sorry about that, but I’m presenting at the Oscars.” Actor Zach Galifianakis once worked as a night manager at Stand Up NY. After learning this in May 2013, club owner Dani Zoldan jokingly tweeted at Galifianakis, asking if the Hangover star would be available to work a shift the following night. Much to Zoldan's surprise, Galifianakis visited the club alone that night. Although the actor turned down an offer to take the stage, Galifianakis stuck around to watch a show and was seen sitting at the bar.

It was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. The film is about the life and experiences of a young Armenian by the name of Nazareth Manoogian against the backdrop of the Armenian Genocide and its repercussions in different parts of the world. Plot The film starts by showing how life, as a blacksmith, was in the city of Mardin, where Nazareth and his family used to live. Although Nazareth had his suspicions about possible effects of the World War I, and he was considering the possibility of non-Muslim minorities of the Ottoman Empire being conscripted to fight in the army, his family and friends were trying to be optimistic, although they heard stories of disappearing men from different villages. One night, Ottoman soldiers came to his door and took him to work for the army at a road construction, which is basically in the middle of an uninhabited area. While he was working there and as time passed by, he and his friends started to notice different groups of passer-by Armenians, under arrest. They even witnessed a rape. At one point, an Ottoman officer came to their camp and asked them if they would accept to convert to Islam. Some did and some did not. The officer and his fellows took the converts and left. Some soldiers and convicts, recruited solely to kill Armenians, arrived the next day to kill the rest. The convict responsible for cutting the throat of Nazareth could not go all the way with it and made only a small cut on his throat, which sufficed to cause Nazareth to faint, thereby survive the massacre. However, while saving his life, the cut also made him mute. This \\"cut\\" not only symbolizes Nazareth's becoming mute but also his being cut from his life and family and the Armenian society's silence about the Genocide at the time. His executioner, who is an Ottoman subject, returned and took Nazareth, with whom later on Nazareth joined a gang composed of former defectors. This gang is mainly formed by Ottoman Turks, based on their clear accent, yet they were willing to take Nazareth with them, which is a sign that the ordinary people did not have any problems and the Genocide was substantially based on political will and motive. While trying to survive with the gang, Nazareth came across to an old customer from Mardin, who told Nazareth that surviving Armenians went to Raʾs al-ʿAin, which became one of several cities Nazareth visited to trace his family. When he concluded that everyone in his family had died, he was devastated and unsure about what to do. At that point, he met a soap maker from Aleppo, called Umair Nasreddin. The soap maker provided refuge to not only Nazareth but also many more Armenians, which can also be interpreted as a metaphor: bystanders to the Genocide cleansing their guilt by helping the surviving victims. It is in Aleppo that Nazareth learned that his daughters might still be alive and set out to find them first in Lebanon, then in Cuba and finally in Ruso, North Dakota, United States.

The FCA soon had chapters across the country, and was one of the main forces behind formation of the Canada Council in 1957. After this, the national organization withered, and only the British Columbia chapter remained active. A drive for expansion began in 1977, causing a renewal of activity that started in western Canada and then spread. Expansion stalled out in the late 1990s when funding cuts hit the Federation as hard as it hit other arts organization. Renewed vigor by volunteers and staff in recent years has brought new life to the Federation and expansion is again underway. The organization has about 2,700 paying members and 5,000 artist contacts throughout Canada as of the end of 2017, a permanent gallery in Vancouver, and organizes approximately 44 exhibitions every year. Foundation Leaders of the Federation of Canadian Artists at a meeting in Toronto in May 1942. From left to right Arthur Lismer, Frances Loring, Lawren Harris, André Charles Biéler, A. Y. Jackson André Charles Biéler organized the first conference of Canadian artists in 1941. This conference, held in Kingston, Ontario, led to the foundation of the Federation of Canadian Artists. At his opening address at the Kingston conference Bieler insisted that \\"we should not try to unify ourselves or to attempt to make a school that would cover the whole country. On the contrary, I believe we must keep that regional aspect.\\" The Federation of Canadian Artists was founded in Toronto by a group of Canadian artists. Biéler was the first president. The Federation was divided into regions, each with a regional organizer. Lawren Harris of the Group of Seven was head of the West Coast region. The other organizers were Gordon Sinclair (Western region), Ernest Lindner (Saskatchewan), Byllee Lang (Manitoba), A. Y. Jackson (Ontario) and Walter Abell (Maritimes). Goals Writing in Maritime Art (February–March 1943) Arthur Lismer proposed that the goals of the Federation were to improve understanding of the role of artists in society, to encourage youth while supporting established artists and to bring art to the community. The FCA became a powerful national lobby for public patronage of the arts, recognized as the legitimate representative of Canadian artists. J. Delisle Parker wrote in February 1945, \\"This is not just another art society, nor is it intended to replace any existing art society. It is an organization formed to unite all the artists in Canada, whether member of existing societies or not, in a federation which it is hoped will become a power in the country. The Federation hopes to bridge the isolation of artists in different parts of the country, discover talent and organize regional as well as country-wide activities and to publish an art magazine to serve the interests of art and artists in the country as a whole...\\" History Walter Abell's journal Maritime Art became Canadian Art in 1943 when Abell moved to Ottawa to join the staff of the Art Centre of the National Gallery of Canada. The Federation sponsored Canadian Art, which was the only national art magazine in the 1940s. Canadian Art became an important vehicle for communication between artists, curators and collectors. In June 1944 the Federation and other national art organizations prepared a brief on cultural aspects of Canadian post-war reconstruction. This led to the formation of the Canadian Arts Council. The FCA was a key member of the Canadian Arts Council after it was founded in 1944. At first the FCA sponsored lectures and plays in addition to exhibitions and workshops. After about 1949 it began to focus on the visual arts. The FCA made a major presentation to the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, the Massey Commission, in Vancouver in 1949. The presentation was instrumental in forming the Canada Council, which came into being in 1957. The FCA began to phase itself out as a national organization after this as communication across Canada became easier. By the 1960s there was little activity at the national level, although the regional branches persisted. In British Columbia there were 600 members. In 1977 Allan Edwards of the Vancouver branch, by now almost all that was left of the FCA, became president and began a drive for expansion. The FCA organized traveling exhibitions in British Columbia and Alberta, with some going to the east of Canada or the USA. In the 1980s the FCA began to organize annual painting seminars on Saltspring Island, which drew students from across western Canada and the USA.

The presently visible church, however, dates from the late 15th or early 16th century, with the exception of the sacristy (13th century) which is the only remains of the earlier, probably otherwise wooden, church. The church is constructed of fieldstone, with brick having been used for details and decorations in the façade. The external bell tower, made of wood, was erected in 1748. Inside, the church is decorated with frescos, dating from 1623. These were painted over during the 18th century but have since been restored. Among the church furnishings, a late medieval sculpture of the Holy Virgin and a number of wooden funeral coat of arms from the local nobility can be mentioned. The altarpiece is especially noteworthy as it was painted by Anna Maria Ehrenstrahl and donated by her to the church.

She plays as a forward in the Indian national team. Vandana rose to prominence in 2013, being India's top goal-scorer in the 2013 Women's Hockey Junior World Cup, where India won a bronze medal; she scored five goals in the tournament, the third by any player.

Water was generally supplied by wells. Residents had chickens, pigs, cows and horses that grazed on pastureland between La Loma and the Taos Plaza.

Several people have posed in this stance in costume, most recently Kehinde Wiley who made a painting of a young black man in the same pose.

Because he is positioned facing left, we know that this is not a wedding pendant, as Hals always placed the woman on the right facing left. Heythuizen never married and died a bachelor.

Early life and career Louey was born in Melbourne on 7 July 1909 to the son of a Chinese Australian. He returned to China when he was young and was educated at the Holy Trinity College in Guangzhou when his father and his uncle founded the Kowloon Motor Bus Company (KMB) in Hong Kong in 1922. After he graduated, Louey joined the KMB as an assistant manager and rose to Chief Manager in 1933. At that time, there were several independent bus operators. William Louey bought a few of them and applied for the franchise of the bus service in 1933. He won the franchise to operate bus services in Kowloon and the New Territories, while China Motor Bus (CMB) secured the rights to provide services on Hong Kong Island. Together with Tang Shiu Kin, Lui Leung, Tam Woon-tong and Lam Ming-fan, William Louey renamed the company 'Kowloon Motor Bus Company (1933) Limited' (KMB). At the time, there were 106 small single- deck buses in the embryonic KMB bus fleet, offering two seat classes: first class (with cushion) and second class (wooden). KMB services stopped operating during the Pacific War and Japanese occupation. After the war, Louey largely expanded his company from about a hundred vehicles to more than seven hundred. Before his death, he ordered more than a hundred buses from the United Kingdom, bringing the fleet size to 895. Louey also experienced a few new company's change of policies. In early December 1962 when the workers took the industrial action, Louey later on announced to raise the wage of the bus drivers. Public service Louey was chair of the Rotary Club of Kowloon and Kowloon Residents' Association, deputy director of the Civil Aid Service, founder of the Kowloon Chamber of Commerce and member of the Advisory Committee on Public Transport and Committee on Technical Education. He was made a Justice of the Peace in 1957. Louey also ran in the 1952 Urban Council election and was elected to the Urban Council with Brook Bernacchi of the Reform Club of Hong Kong. He lost his seat a year later in 1953 re-election. Between 1956 and 1957, Louey became the President of the Hong Kong Football Association with the support of South China Athletic Association. He defeated Chan Shu-woon, Urban Councillor and the coach of the China national football team who was supported by Eastern Athletic Association, by 43 votes to 9 on 6 October 1956. By that, He also became the President of the Asian Football Confederation. Personal life and death In the morning of 22 December 1958, Louey was shot and injured in an armed robbery at his own residence, No. 81, Waterloo Road, Kowloon. Three men entered his house at about 10:30 a.m. wounded Louey on the right side of his abdomen during their struggle with Louey and his son, Ronald. Although the condition was not serious, Louey was admitted to the Kowloon Hospital. Louey died suddenly from acute heart attack at 10:30 p.m. on 9 December 1962 in his residence at No. 81 Waterloo Road at the age of 53. He had two sons, Ronald Kwok-wah Louey and Kwok-kwan Louey, and two daughters, Kwok-chun and Kwok-wan. Kwok-wah and Kwok-kwan were both educated in Australia and Kwok-kwan worked at the Kowloon Motor Bus. The funeral service was held at the All Saints' Cathedral, Kowloon on 12 December and was attended by many government officials and KMB staff. His ashes were sent back to his birthplace in Australia.

The film stars Ethan Hawke, Bruce Greenwood, Zoë Kravitz, Jake Abel, and January Jones. It competed for the Golden Lion at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. It was also screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Major Thomas Egan is an officer with the U.S. Air Force stationed at an Air Force Base near Las Vegas, Nevada. He is a former F-16 Falcon pilot, married, with two children who live with him in a suburban house off-base. His current assignment involves flying armed MQ-9 Reaper drones in foreign air space in support of the U.S. War on Terror. He is admired by his commanding officer and support staff for his calm demeanor, precise flying, and adaptability. Privately, he is concerned about the assignment, which he took after being informed there was reduced call for and increased competition among fighter pilots in the Air Force. His previous CO informed him that a tour flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would look good on his record and would increase his chances of being posted back to a flying assignment. At first, the new assignment seems stressful but relatively benign. He is assigned to attack more clear-cut terrorist cells, vehicles, and facilities in Afghanistan. He flies these assignments during daylight hours over his targets, which is night-time in Las Vegas, leaving his days free for his sleep period, and to spend time with his wife and children. However, the high-tempo assignment – he is attacking targets on almost a daily basis – begins taking its toll. His wife notices the stress he's under and he begins drinking when off-duty. Still, his performance is excellent and his crew is rated among the highest in the squadron, so, on the orders of his commanding officer, he is assigned to more challenging missions under the direction of CIA controllers. Many of these targets are in Yemen and Somalia, places where the U.S. has no acknowledged military mission. The targets themselves are increasingly morally ambiguous: crowds the CIA controller calls terrorist cells, public buildings the controller says are sleeping spots for high level terrorist leaders or factories for making explosives. Collateral damage goes from being a rare occurrence to a routine one. On several occasions, the CIA controller orders strikes on obvious civilian targets – including women and children – describing these casualties as unfortunate but necessitated by terrorist leaders using them as human shields. Egan's performance declines and his drinking intensifies. He narrowly avoids being arrested for drunk driving, and starts avoiding home commitments, not wanting to inflict the stress he's under on his wife. He relishes a rare overwatch assignment protecting U.S. troops as they sleep, but must break a promise to his wife in order to perform the mission. On another overwatch mission, the troops are killed by an improvised explosive device that Egan could not protect them from. After a stress-induced violent episode at home, Egan's wife demands to know the details of Egan's work, and Egan tells her. She appears appalled. Soon after, she says she is leaving him and taking the children to Reno, Nevada, blaming his drinking and violent behavior. Finally, Egan cracks. His CIA controller orders a strike on a small group of civilians responding to an explosion at a building Egan had previously destroyed. Rather than obey the order, Egan simulates a glitch in the UAV control system and the targets escape. His CO has no choice but to demote him away from the attack role into a surveillance one. While on a surveillance mission, Egan notices a man whom he had previously watched rape a woman several times approaching her home. His Mission Intelligence Coordinator had previously described this man as \\"a bad guy. But not our bad guy.\\" Egan conspires to send his support staff on a break, then uses the surveillance UAV to attack and kill the rapist. He then leaves the base without orders and is seen driving away from Las Vegas toward Reno.

Staples of Abruzzo cuisine include bread, pasta, meat, cheese, and wine. The isolation which has characterized the region for decades has ensured the independence of its culinary tradition from those of nearby regions. Confesercenti, an Italian trade organization, conducted a 2013 study which called Abruzzo the best place to dine in Italy. Ingredients Abruzzese cuisine is known for the following ingredients: *Saffron, cultivated primarily in Navelli and L'Aquila * Olive oil produced in Colline Teramane (the Teramo hills), marked by the quality level DOP and considered some of Italy's best *Licorice, primarily produced in Abruzzo and Calabria * Lamb and mutton, primarily in the mountains Sheep's milk (or ricotta) is an important source of Abruzzese cheese, and lamb intestines are used as sausage casing or for stuffed meat rolls. Mountain goat meat is also common in Abruzzo. * Truffles and mushrooms, particularly wild mushrooms from the forests and hills * Garlic, especially red garlic * Rosemary * Hot chili pepper or peperoncini, regionally known as diavolilli or diavoletti, is common in Abruzzese cuisine and often used to add spice to dishes. * Vegetables such as lentils, grasspeas and other legumes, artichoke, eggplant, and cauliflower Dishes =Starters= alt=Bread with vegetable toppings Abbruzzese starters () include: * Bruschetta: bread spread with salt and oil, sausage, or vegetables such as tomato or zucchini with mozzarella * Antipasto di fegatini: appetizer from Teramo consisting of chicken livers, onion, peppers, vinegar, sugar, dry wine, pepper, salt and oil * Mussels of Vasto: mussels stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, garlic and parsley, olive oil, lemon juice, and tomato sauce * Mussels with saffron: steamed mussels prepared with parsley, onion, bay leaf, white wine, olive oil, and saffron sauce * Stockfish or salt cod: cod cooked in a pan with potatoes, tomatoes, oil, garlic, parsley, onion, red pepper, salt, and black olives * Sauce all'aquilana: beef marrow with saffron, eggs, cream and butter =Pasta= Maccheroni alla chitarra One of the region's most popular dishes is maccheroni alla chitarra. The pasta is prepared by pressing dough through a chitarra, creating long, thin noodles similar to spaghetti. It is served with a tomato-based sauce, often flavored with peppers, pork, goose or lamb, accompanied by regional side dishes such as the bean-and-noodle soup known as sagne e fagioli (flavored with tomatoes, garlic, oil, and peperoncini). Other popular pasta dishes are , flavored with bacon and pecorino cheese, and pastuccia (polenta with sausage, eggs, and cheese). =Main courses= alt=Meat on wooden skewers The region features several types of roast lamb and mutton, including: * Arrosticini: skewered lamb or mutton * Pecora al cotturo: lamb or mutton stuffed with mountain herbs and cooked in a copper pot * Lamb cooked whole in a bread oven * Agnello cacio e ovo: a lamb-based fricassee Other meat-based main coursees include: * Mazzerella: lamb intestines stuffed with lamb, garlic, marjoram, lettuce, and spices * Le virtù: a soup from Teramo with legumes, vegetables and pork, usually eaten in the spring at celebrations *Timballo abruzzese: lasagna-like dish with pasta sheets (scrippelle) layered with meat, vegetables and rice; often served for Christmas and Easter * Porchetta abruzzese: moist boneless- pork roast, slow-roasted with rosemary, garlic, and pepper It was brought by Abruzzese immigrants to the northeastern United States (particularly Philadelphia), where it is known as \\"Italian roast pork\\" or \\"roast pork.\\" * Sagne e fagioli, handmade pasta with beans and tomato sauce Seafood also plays a role in the cuisine of Abruzzo, especially areas near the coast.

The goal of these nonprofit groups is to educate and help others become more familiar with the end of life. The idea originates with the Swiss sociologist and anthropologist , who organized the first café mortel in 2004. Jon Underwood a UK web developer was inspired by Crettaz’s work and developed the Death Cafe model in 2011. He was instrumental in the spread of the idea. They have since been held in 66 countries. The death café is not a physical location, but is an event hosted at someone's house or other pop-up/ temporary venue. The official objective of a death café is to help people make the most of their finite lives. Individuals can discuss their understanding, thoughts, dreams, fears and all other areas of death and dying at these events. There have been Death Cafes which specifically create a chance for health/care professionals to talk about death (Miles & Corr, 2015). Generally a death café will have in the region of 12 people gathered in a group discussing death related topics and usually lasts 2 hours (Adler, Remer, Coulter, & Miller, 2015). Tea and cake are one of the most important features to the event they assist with creating a nurturing and supportive environment (Underwood, 2015). The concept has spread due to media attention and because of the topic evoking so many different people's thoughts of what death means (Miles & Corr, 2015).

The American Opportunity Tax Credit, under this legislation, would provide a maximum credit of $2,500. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Student and Family Tax Simplification Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide for an American Opportunity Tax Credit, in lieu of the current Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits and the tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses, that provides for each eligible student (i.e., a student who meets certain requirements of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and who is carrying at least 1/2 the normal full-time course load) a credit of 100% of up to $2,000 of qualified tuition and related expenses (i.e., tuition, fees, and course materials, excluding expenses for courses involving sports, games, or hobbies or for expenses unrelated to academic instruction), plus 25% of so much of such expenses as exceeds $2,000, but not more than $4,000. Makes up to $1,500 of such credit refundable. Modifies the phaseout of such credit based on taxpayer modified adjusted gross income by increasing the income level for such phaseout. Allows an inflation adjustment to credit and phaseout amounts for taxable years beginning after 2018. The bill would eliminate the disallowance of the credit for students who have been convicted of a felony drug offense. The bill would require a taxpayer claiming such credit to include on the taxpayer's tax return the employer identification number of the educational institution to which qualified tuition and related expenses were paid. The bill would exclude from gross income, for income tax purposes, amounts received as a Federal Pell Grant in taxable years beginning after 2014. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on June 25, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3393 would amend certain education-related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The bill would permanently extend, in modified form, the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for tuition and related post- secondary expenses that is currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Modifications to the credit would include increasing the refundable portion (starting in 2015) and indexing the credit and income phaseout amounts for inflation (starting in 2019). The Hope tax credit, which is scheduled to come back into effect in 2018 when the AOTC expires, would be replaced by the AOTC, and the Lifetime Learning tax credit would be repealed. In addition, for Pell grant recipients, the bill would increase the amount of expenses that potentially qualify for the AOTC, and Pell grant amounts that exceeded certain education expenses would no longer be considered taxable income. The bill would also modify the information-reporting requirements on higher educational institutions. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting H.R. 3393 would increase direct spending over the 2014-2024 period by about $73.7 billion, and reduce revenues over that period by about $22.7 billion. JCT therefore estimates that enacting the legislation would increase federal budget deficits by about $96.5 billion over the 2014-2024 period. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending and revenues. Because enacting H.R. 3393 would affect revenues and direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Student and Family Tax Simplification Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on October 30, 2013 by Rep. Diane Black (R, TN-6). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. On July 17, 2014, the bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-526. On July 24, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 449 to pass the bill 227-187. On July 24, 2014, President Barack Obama released a statement in opposition to the bill. Debate and discussion President Barack Obama released a statement that he opposed the bill because \\"it is part of a broader effort to pass permanent, unpaid-for extensions of traditional tax extenders that, taken together, would add approximately $800 billion to the deficit.\\" However, the President did say that he supported making the American Opportunity Tax Credit itself permanent. Rep. Diane Black, who sponsored the bill, argued that \\"streamlining the number of education provisions and retooling those that are most effective allows us to simplify the (tax) code and reduce some of the confusion that exists today. As a result, students can spend less time figuring out how to finance the cost of a higher education and more time developing the skills they need to succeed in a knowledge-based economy.\\" Rep. Sander Levin (D-MI) opposed the bill, arguing that \\"in simplifying education provisions within the tax code, this bill leaves behind numerous undergraduate students, graduate students and lifetime learners\\" because of the other tax provisions it eliminates and the limit of only the first four years of schooling being eligible for the credit. According to Levin, \\"in 2013, the Lifetime Learning Credit, which this bill eliminates, served nearly two million students with incomes at or below $75,000, including 1 million with an income of $40,000 or less.\\" Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) objected to the permanence of the tax credit, arguing \\"there's no provisions to pay for it, and it buries us in more debt.\\" Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI) counter-argued that having a permanent tax credit was necessary to make sure that \\"families and students can rely on a constant policy.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3393 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3393 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3393 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3393 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3393 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3393 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Taxation in the United States ","title":"Student and Family Tax Simplification Act"},{"id":"43385814","text":"The International Spiritist Council (ISC) is an organization founded on November 28, 1992, by national associations of the Spiritist movement in various countries.

He is largely remembered for his bookjacket and textile designs. After training in Munich and Berlin, Hans Aufseeser moved to Paris and then London. He changed his name to Hans Tisdall in around 1940, marrying the journalist and Tamesa Fabrics founder Isabel Tisdall in 1941. Career Hans Tisdall made his name in the 1930s as a textile designer with Edinburgh Weavers. In the 1960s, he created many designs for Tamesa Fabrics – working alongside designers such as Marianne Straub. Fabrics woven at Warner & Sons were used for a number of prestigious commercial projects. Tisdall was among the designers who contributed to the Festival of Britain in 1951, winning the competition to design the entrance to the funfair at Battersea Park's pleasure gardens. From the 1950s on, Tisdall also became known for creating bookjackets, notably for Jonathan Cape. A typeface based on his brushstroke style, known as Tisdall Script, was created by Michael Harvey in 2001. Another typeface called Blesk, loosely based on his lettering for books by Ivor Brown, was created in 2015. Tisdall taught at Central School (now University of the Arts) from 1947-1962, initially in the textile department and later in the school of painting. Works Of Tisdall's paintings, Moorings at Kew and two still lifes are in the collection of Manchester Art Gallery and Hastings is part of the collection of Pallant House Gallery in Chichester.

Fred Singer's Science & Environmental Policy Project, and later supported by the Heartland Institute lobbying group, in opposition to the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the issue of global warming. The NIPCC presents itself as an \\"international panel of nongovernment scientists and scholars who have come together to present a comprehensive, authoritative, and realistic assessment of the science and economics of global warming\\". Because it is not a government agency, and because its members are predisposed to dispute that climate change is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions, NIPCC claims to offer an independent “second opinion” of the evidence reviewed – or not reviewed – by the IPCC. The scientific validity of the claims made by the NIPCC report have been heavily criticized, as has the methodology of their reports and the lack of expertise of many of their authors. History NIPCC states that their purpose is to objectively analyze and interpret data and facts without conforming to any specific agenda. They intend their organizational structure and purpose to stand in contrast to those of the United Nations’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which they contend is government-sponsored, politically motivated, and predisposed to believing that climate change is a problem in need of a U.N. solution. NIPCC traces its beginnings to an informal meeting held in Milan, Italy, in 2003, organized by S. Fred Singer and the Science & Environmental Policy Project (SEPP). The purpose was to produce an independent evaluation of the available scientific evidence on the subject of carbon dioxide-induced global warming in anticipation of the release of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). NIPCC scientists concluded the IPCC was biased with respect to making future projections of climate change, discerning a significant human- induced influence on current and past climatic trends, and evaluating the impacts of potential carbon dioxide-induced environmental changes on Earth’s biosphere. To highlight such perceived deficiencies in the IPCC’s AR4, in 2008, SEPP partnered with the Heartland Institute to produce “Nature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Climate”, a summary of research for policymakers that has been widely distributed and translated into six languages. In 2009, the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change joined the original two sponsors to help produce Climate Change Reconsidered: The 2009 Report of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) as an alternative to the reports of the IPCC. In 2011, the three sponsoring organizations produced Climate Change Reconsidered: The 2011 Interim Report of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), a review and analysis of new research released since the 2009 report or overlooked by the authors of that report. In 2013, the Information Center for Global Change Studies, a division of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, translated and published an abridged edition of the 2009 and 2011 NIPCC reports in a single volume. On June 15, the Chinese Academy of Sciences organized a NIPCC Workshop in Beijing to allow the NIPCC principal authors to present summaries of their conclusions. In September 2013, NIPCC released Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, the first of three volumes expanding and bringing up-to-date the original 2009 report as well as offering a counterpoint to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report. In 2014, the second volume of Climate Change Reconsidered II, subtitled \\"Biological Impacts\\", was published. It offered more than 1,000 pages of reviews of scientific research finding the impact of man-made global warming is benign and even beneficial to mankind and the natural world. In November, 2015, the three lead NIPCC authors – Craig Idso, Robert M. Carter, and S. Fred Singer – wrote a small book titled Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming: The NIPCC Report on Scientific Consensus stating that no survey or study shows a consensus on important scientific issues in the climate change debate, and that most scientists do not support the claims of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. From March through June 2017, the Heartland Institute mailed 300,000 copies of the second edition of this book to K-12 and college science teachers across America. Publications In April 2008, Singer’s Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) and The Heartland Institute partnered to produce \\"Nature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Climate\\", subtitled “Summary for Policymakers of the Report of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change.” The 48-page report listed 24 contributors from 14 countries and included a foreword by Frederick Seitz, one of the world’s most renowned scientists. (Seitz passed away on March 2, 2008.) It was released at Heartland’s First International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC-1) on March 2-4, 2008. In 2008, Singer conducted an extensive international tour to promote the new report. He spoke at events in the Netherlands (June 3-4), Brussels-EU (June 5), Germany (June 6-12), Vienna, Milan, Paris (June 19-20), and London (June 22-25). Local free-market think tanks arranged those events. Heartland distributed approximately 100,000 copies of Nature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Climate in 2008, and the booklet has been translated into French, German, Italian, and Spanish. In the tradition of the IPCC, NIPCC had published its \\"Summary for Policymakers\\" in advance of completing the underlying report. The first full report, produced with a new partner, the Center for the Study of Global Warming and Global Change, was released in 2009. It was titled \\"Climate Change Reconsidered: The Report of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC)\\". In 2011, NIPCC produced its third report, \\"Climate Change Reconsidered: The 2011 Interim Report\\". The volume summarized new research produced after the deadline for inclusion in the 2009 report as well as some research that had been overlooked when the first volume was produced. In September 2013, NIPCC released Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, the first of three volumes expanding and bringing up-to-date the original 2009 report as well as offering a counter-point to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report. Also in 2013, four NIPCC scientists produced a Scientific Critique of IPCC’s 2013 \\"Summary for Policymakers\\". In 2014, the second volume of Climate Change Reconsidered II, subtitled \\"Biological Impacts\\", was published. It offered more than 1,000 pages of reviews of scientific research finding the impact of man-made global warming is benign and even beneficial to mankind and the natural world. Also in 2014, a team of climate scientists led by Robert M. Carter, a NIPCC lead author, produced a Commentary and Analysis on the Whitehead & Associates 2014 NSW Sea-Level Report, finding the Whitehead report does not provide reliable guidance to the complicated issues of measuring, forecasting, and responding to sea-level rise. In November, 2015, NIPCC released Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming: The NIPCC Report on Scientific Consensus. The three lead NIPCC authors – Craig Idso, Robert M. Carter, and S. Fred Singer – reveal how no survey or study shows a “consensus” on the most important scientific issues in the climate change debate, and how most scientists do not support the alarmist claims of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This short book is a preliminary version of Chapter 2 of the forthcoming and final volume in the Climate Change Reconsidered II series, to be subtitled \\"Benefits and Costs of Fossil Fuels\\" which was published in 2017. Organization NIPCC is a project of three independent nonprofit organizations: Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP), Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change (CO2 Science), and The Heartland Institute. Contributions to all three organizations help support the project. S. Fred Singer, the founder of NIPCC, acts as chairman and ambassador of the group. As a retired professor of environmental science, he travels the world meeting with fellow scientists, discussing NIPCC’s research, and recruiting new members to the group. Craig D. Idso, founder and chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, leads the research and writing effort for NIPCC publications. He hosts the CO2Science.org website featuring reviews of new research that will be edited for inclusion in the next edition of Climate Change Reconsidered, and works with an international team of authors, editors, contributors, and reviewers. Joseph L. Bast, president of The Heartland Institute, leads the publication and promotional efforts of NIPCC. He and Heartland’s staff edit and produce NIPCC books, host the events at which the reports are released, and market the project’s efforts.

GAI was founded in 2012 by Peter Schweizer and Steve Bannon with funding from Robert Mercer and family.Zuckerman, Gregory, Keach Hagey, Scott Patterson and Rebecca Ballhaus, \\"Meet the Mercers: A Quiet Tycoon and His Daughter Become Power Brokers in Trump’s Washington\\" (subscription), The Wall Street Journal, January 8, 2017. Retrieved 2017-01-08. Schweizer serves as the group's president. The group is known for pushing conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton in 2016, as well as conspiracy theories about Joe Biden before the 2020 election.  Overview  According to Bloomberg Businessweek, it is \\"a self-styled corruption watchdog group chaired and funded by conservative mega-donor Rebekah Mercer.\\" Members of GAI's board of directors include Steve Bannon, Peter Schweizer, Hunter Lewis, Ron Robinson (president of Young America's Foundation), and Wynton Hall. GAI's research methods include analyzing tax filings, flight logs, and foreign government documents as well as engaging in data-mining on the deep web, which includes the 97% of information on the World Wide Web that isn't indexed by traditional search engines. Between 2012 and 2014, GAI received donations of almost $4 million from the Mercer Family Foundation and the Koch brothers-affiliated Donors Trust. Activities The organization has most notably been involved with the research and publication of political conspiracist books including Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich and Bush Bucks: How Public Service and Corporations Helped Make Jeb Rich. Clinton Cash, published in May 2015, is an investigation of donations made to the Clinton Foundation by foreign entities, paid speeches made by Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the Clintons' personal enrichment since leaving the White House in 2001. Bush Bucks, an e-book published in October 2015, raises questions about the millions of dollars former Florida Governor Jeb Bush earned after leaving office from companies that benefited from Bush's policy while he was serving as Florida's Governor. In October 2012, GAI released a report which asserted that \\"campaigns that aggressively raise money online are soliciting donations from people around the world-whether they intend to or not,\\" and asserted that the Obama campaign had lacked \\"rigorous screening for donors' citizenship\\" (it is illegal for non-U.S. citizens to contribute to U.S. campaigns). The report provided no evidence that the Obama campaign had received any unlawful contributions.Mike Burns, Fox Hypes Unsubstantiated Claim That Obama May Be Receiving Illegal Foreign Donations, Media Matters for America (October 9, 2012). In December 2013, a GAI analysis found that from July 12, 2010, to November 30, 2013, President Obama's public schedule showed zero one-on-one meetings between Obama and then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, though the study concedes that there was one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Links to Breitbart News A November 2016 investigation by The Washington Post detailed ties between the Government Accountability Institute and the conservative website Breitbart News. Three GAI employees received full-time compensation while simultaneously being employed elsewhere. From 2012 to 2015, GAI co-founder and executive chair Steve Bannon received $376,000 for working 30 hours a week. He simultaneously served as executive chairman for Breitbart News. GAI communications strategist Wynton Hall received $600,000 during the same time period. Hall worked as a writer for Breitbart News and was promoted to managing editor in 2013. GAI president and treasurer Peter Schweizer, also an at-large editor and writer for Breitbart News, was paid $778,000 by the GAI from 2012 to 2015. As a 501(c)(3) public charity, GAI's political advocacy has raised the question of whether the organization had been illegally intervening in political campaigns. The Washington Post report also found that, from 2013 to 2015, GAI purchased over $200,000 in advertising from Breitbart's website.

These characteristics can include size or amount of data, completeness of the data, correctness of the data, possible relationships amongst data elements or files/tables in the data. Data exploration is typically conducted using a combination of automated and manual activities.Stanford.edu, 2011 Wrangler: Interactive Visual Specification of Data Transformation Scripts, Kandel, Paepcke, Hellerstein Heer. Automated activities can include data profiling or data visualization or tabular reports to give the analyst an initial view into the data and an understanding of key characteristics. This is often followed by manual drill-down or filtering of the data to identify anomalies or patterns identified through the automated actions. Data exploration can also require manual scripting and queries into the data (e.g. using languages such as SQL or R) or using spreadsheets or similar tools to view the raw data.Stanford.edu, IEEE Visual Analytics Science & Technology (VAST), Oct 2012 Enterprise Data Analysis and Visualization: An Interview Study., Sean Kandel, Andreas Paepcke, Joseph Hellerstein, Jeffrey Heer Proc. All of these activities are aimed at creating a mental model and understanding of the data in the mind of the analyst, and defining basic metadata (statistics, structure, relationships) for the data set that can be used in further analysis. Once this initial understanding of the data is had, the data can be pruned or refined by removing unusable parts of the data (data cleansing), correcting poorly formatted elements and defining relevant relationships across datasets. This process is also known as determining data quality. Data exploration can also refer to the ad hoc querying and visualization of data to identify potential relationships or insights that may be hidden in the data. Traditionally, this had been a key area of focus for statisticians, with John Tukey being a key evangelist in the field.Exploratory Data Analysis, Pearson. Today, data exploration is more widespread and is the focus of data analysts and data scientists; the latter being a relatively new role within enterprises and larger organizations.  Interactive Data Exploration  This area of data exploration has become an area of interest in the field of machine learning. This is a relatively new field and is still evolving. As its most basic level, a machine-learning algorithm can be fed a data set and can be used to identify whether a hypothesis is true based on the dataset. Common machine learning algorithms can focus on identifying specific patterns in the data. Many common patterns include regression and classification or clustering, but there are many possible patterns and algorithms that can be applied to data via machine learning. By employing machine learning, it is possible to find patterns or relationships in the data that would be difficult or impossible to find via manual inspection, trial and error or traditional exploration techniques.Machine Learning for Data Exploration Software * Trifacta – a data preparation and analysis platform * Paxata – self-service data preparation software * Alteryx – data blending and advanced data analytics software * Microsoft Power BI - interactive visualization and data analysis tool * OpenRefine - a standalone open source desktop application for data clean-up and data transformation * Tableau software – interactive data visualization software See also * Exploratory data analysis * Machine learning * Data profiling * Data visualization  References  Category:Machine learning Category:Data analysis Category:Data management Category:Data quality ","title":"Data exploration"},{"id":"43385937","text":"In the Linux kernel, kernfs is a set of functions that contain the functionality required for creating pseudo file systems used internally by various kernel subsystems. The creation of kernfs resulted from splitting off part of the internal logic used by sysfs, which provides a set of virtual files by exporting information about hardware devices and associated device drivers from the kernel's device model to user space, into an independent and reusable functionality so other kernel subsystems can implement their own pseudo file systems more easily and consistently.

Early life Kett was born at Ponders End, Lea Valley, London on 28 July 1913. He was a descendant of Robert Kett, who had led Kett's Rebellion in 1549. Brought up and educated at Blackheath, Hedley Kett first went to sea as a deck apprentice with the Bolton Steamship Company, and was later with the Glover Brothers company. His ship, the tanker Romney, was requisitioned by the Admiralty during the Spanish Civil War, making Kett part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and in 1938 he joined the Royal Naval Reserve. He was second officer of RFA Arndale at the outbreak of the Second World War, and became her gunnery officer. He returned to Britain, and was called up for service in November 1939. Volunteering to serve on submarines, he joined the Odin-class submarine as her navigator. He joined in August 1940, at first as her navigator, later as her first lieutenant. Clyde was involved in an action in Tarrafal Bay on 21 September 1941, after having been ordered to ambush U-boats that were meeting there to refuel and resupply. Kett was officer of the watch during the attack, and after attempting to torpedo , Kett dived to reload, and collided with . He then attempted to ram . U-111 sustained heavy damage in the collision, was unable to dive, and was sunk on 4 October by HMT Lady Shirley. U-67 was also badly damaged, and forced to abandon her patrol and return to France. Clyde was then used for 'Magic Carpet' runs, transporting fuel and supplies from Gibraltar to Malta, with Kett overseeing the loading and unloading of the submarine, gaining the nickname 'Tanker'. Clyde would submerge in the harbour by day and unload the goods at night. After carrying out five supply runs, Kett flew back to Britain aboard a Vickers Wellington and attended the course for submarine captains. He married Doris May Mitchell during the brief time between his arrival in Britain, and the start of the course. He also received the Distinguished Service Cross at about this time for his work. Of the eighteen captains on Kett's course, only two survived the war, one was Kett, the other was John Roxburgh, later an admiral. Command Graduating from the course, Kett was given command of ,HMS P 555 (P 555) uboat.net, accessed 1 January 2019 assigned as a dummy target off Tobermory for surface ships practising anti-submarine tactics. In January 1943 he took command of ,HMS Ultimatum (P 34) uboat.net, accessed 1 January 2019 spending the next two years as her commander, and carrying out twelve patrols in her. He attacked a U-boat while off Toulon on 30 October 1943, and was credited, erroneously, with sinking . He received a bar to his DSC. One of Kett's last services in the Mediterranean was to use Ultimatums sonar to plot the location of enemy mines of the southern French coast prior to Operation Dragoon.

Early years Walter Halsey Abell was born in 1897 in Brooklyn, New York. The Barnes Foundation sponsored him to study in France. He became a teacher of art and an art theoretician, interpreting art from Marxist and psychological viewpoints. He taught at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio (1925–27). Career Abell taught at Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada from 1928 to 1943. He was one of the first professors of fine art at a Canadian university. Abell helped to found the Maritime Art Association, and was founding editor of Maritime Art. The first issue of Maritime Art, the first magazine in Canada devoted to the visual arts, appeared in October 1940. The Carnegie Corporation provided a small grant to help with starting up, and the Maritime Art Association gave organizational support. Abell was editor, but Violet Gillet was responsible for production of the first issues. In the late 1930s Abell saw Canadian modernists, particularly women such as Pegi Nicol and perhaps Paraskeva Clark, as a \\"very important group of young Canadian painters ... more important than the Group of Seven.\\" André Charles Biéler organized the first conference of Canadian artists in Kingston, Ontario. Abell told the delegates at the Kingston conference that Canada was a \\"cultural plutocracy ... determined by a small group possessing great wealth.\\" He proposed that experiments in children's art, folk art and amateur creative workshops were \\"movements of modern art that have broken old forms and prepared the way for new ones, with increasing emphasis upon the creative possibilities in the common man.\\" The Kingston conference led to the foundation of the Federation of Canadian Artists in 1941. The Federation was divided into regions, each with a regional organizer. Abell was head of the Maritimes region. Walter Abell's journal Maritime Art became Canadian Art in 1943 when Abell moved to Ottawa to join the staff of the Art Centre of the National Gallery of Canada. Abell moved on to Michigan State University where he taught from 1943 to 1956. He died in 1956 in East Lansing, Michigan.

Life and career He was born on 1 January 1933 in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, where he completed his secondary education and graduated in English and German languages and literatures at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Sarajevo (1957). After working for three years as a teacher of English at the Institute of Foreign Languages in his hometown, he was appointed by the Department of English, Faculty of Philology, University of Belgrade as a teaching assistant (1961), to progress through the academic hierarchy to the rank of Professor of English (1980). In 1988 he also became Professor of General Linguistics in the same institution, in a new Department which he was instrumental in setting up. He retired in 2000 but remained academically active in different ways for many years thereafter. He did postgraduate research at University College London with Professor Randolph Quirk as his adviser (1962/63) and was a Visiting Scholar at Columbia University, New York on a Ford Foundation scholarship (1966/67). After obtaining his Ph.D. degree from the University of Belgrade (1969) by defending a dissertation on a subsystem of English prepositions, he spent the academic year 1969/70 as a Fulbright lecturer at the University of Chicago and a Visiting Professor of Linguistics at Northeastern Illinois State College, Chicago. In addition to courses or individual lectures at nearly all the universities of the former Yugoslavia, he was a guest lecturer at 24 other universities in Europe, the USA and Australia (London, Oxford, Paris-Sorbonne, Leiden, Kraków, Vienna, Munich, Barcelona, New York-Columbia, California- Berkeley, Chicago, Cornell, Sydney-Macquarie, Melbourne-Monash, etc.). Works and reception As a researcher, lecturer and author he has been active in the fields of English and general linguistics, contrastive and applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, language policy and planning, language in relation to identity, culture, ethnicity and nationalism, language attitudes, written language and literacy, terminology and bibliography, translation theory, history of linguistics, the status of Serbo-Croatian, political manipulations of language and wartime hate speech, current Serbian slang, etc. He is the author of some twenty books, ten edited volumes, and scores of articles, book chapters and reviews in international journals, congress proceedings and other collective volumes, mostly in English or Serbo-Croatian but some in German, French, Spanish and several other languages. (For a selective list see below). Among his noted contributions are his early research on English prepositions, acknowledged as a thematic and methodological precursor of cognitive linguistics, his notion of graphic relativity as an extension of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity, his role in defining and organising applied linguistics as an academic discipline in Yugoslavia and internationally, the conception of Serbo-Croatian as one polycentric standard language linguistically but several national languages politically, and his recent pioneering work on lexical blends in Serbian. Professor Bugarski at his Ljubljana lecture on language identity 2014.He has participated in several dozen Yugoslav, European and world congresses, symposia and other conferences, often also as an organiser or invited plenary speaker. He was the academic organiser of two international conferences at the University of London and editor (with Celia Hawkesworth) of their proceedings: Language Planning in Yugoslavia (Columbus, OH: Slavica, 1992. Pp. 233\\\\. ) and Language in the Former Yugoslav Lands (Bloomington, IN: Slavica, 2004. Pp. 325\\\\. ). He has edited scholarly journals and, as translator and editor, introduced to the Yugoslav public the works of some leading linguists (Chomsky, Sapir, Whorf) and modern linguistic disciplines (transformational-generative grammar, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics). At the same time, he has kept international audiences informed about the changing language situation in Yugoslavia and its successor states, with a special focus on the official dissolution of Serbo-Croatian. In 2017, he has signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins.

Freke was the eldest son of Thomas Freke of Hinton St. Mary, Dorset and his second wife Elizabeth Clarke, daughter of Sir William Clarke of Ford Place, Wrotham, Kent. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford on 19 March 1675, aged 15 and was also admitted at the Middle Temple in 1675. He married Elizabeth Pile, the daughter and coheiress of Thomas Pile of Baverstock, Wiltshire on 10 October 1683. He succeeded his great-uncle to Hannington Hall in 1684. Freke was returned as Member of Parliament for Cricklade in a double return at the 1685 English general election and was allowed to sit until 10 June 1685 when it was resolved against him. At the 1689 English general election he was defeated in the poll at Cricklade, but was seated on petition on 5 April 1689. He was returned as MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis at a by election on 22 May 1691 and was returned again at the 1698 English general election. He declined to stand in 1701 for various reasons, including the disruption to his domestic life. Later, in 1701, his wife inherited the Shroton estates of another Thomas Freke and he took up residence there. He was undecided where to stand for Parliament again until the 1705 English general election when he was returned unopposed as MP for Lyme Regis. He voted for the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705. He was returned as a Whig for Lyme Regis in a contest at the 1708 British general election. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He retired from Parliament at the 1710 British general election. Freke's wife, Elizabeth, died in 1714, and he married as his second wife, in December 1718, Mary Corbett.

Biography  = Early life = Pearsall was born in Pontiac, Michigan on 3 March 1922. He attended high school in Keego Harbor, Michigan and attended General Motors Institute (now Kettering University) from 1940 to 1942. He served in World War II from 1942 to 1945 in the Naval Air Corps, first as a navigator on a submarine patrol and later as a pilot. He also married Marjorie Lee Fewel on July 22, 1944. After the war, he attended the University of Denver and graduated in 1947 with a Bachelor of Arts and Science degree. He then served in the Naval Air Reserve at Buckley Field from 1948 to 1954. = Business and engineering career = Pearsall worked with Honeywell Corporation as a heating and air conditioning sales engineer for seven years before founding the Pearsall Company in 1955. Pearsall founded Statitrol Corporation in Lakewood, Colorado in 1963. A few months later Lyman Blackwell, one of Pearsall's engineers at Statitrol, improvised a test to measure the flow of ions in an airstream discharging from a generator. When a technician, smoking nearby, casually exhaled smoke into the fan inlet of the generator, the ion meter pegged. Pearsall immediately realized that the basic ionization technology of this device could also be used for smoke detection. This accidental discovery was similar to a discovery made by Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger in the late 1930s. In 1965 Pearsall began the long process to develop and market a home smoke detector powered by a battery which could be easily installed and replaced. These first units were dubbed \\"SmokeGard 700,\\" Pearsall was awarded a design patent for this in 1973, and began mass-producing them in 1975. Shortly afterwards, he began working with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). His work with NFPA would eventually lead to the change of the uniform building codes to require smoke detectors in new construction. Statitrol sold the smoke detector invention to Emerson Electric in 1980. Pearsall sold Statitrol in 1977. Later into his life Pearsall founded several companies and retired three separate times. He was a spokesman and advocate for American small business, which he considered to be the \\"backbone of the nation's economy.\\" He travelled to Washington, D.C. numerous times to testify before Congressional committees on small business issues. Pearsall helped found the Small Business Council of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 1976, and was chairman of the Colorado Small Business Council in 1979. From 1975 to 1978, he served as a director of the Denver Chamber of Commerce, and from 1982 to 1989, he was a director of the Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry, serving as its chairman from 1985 to 1986. In 1983, Pearsall co-founded Columbine Venture Funds, an organisation specializing in new technology located in Denver. = Later life = Pearsall and his wife Marge lived in Dillon, Colorado from 2000 to 2007. They moved to Denver in 2007. Pearsall died on 11 April 2010 at his home in Denver. Awards and Legacy Pearsall has won several awards and honours for his contributions to fire safety. In 1976, the Small Business Administration named Pearsall as Small Business Person of the Year for Colorado. That same year President Gerald Ford presented him with the National Small Business Person of the Year award. The Society of Fire Protection Engineers recognised him as Fire Protection Man of the Year in 1980. Pearsall was a charter member of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Fire Protection Engineering Board of Advisers and helped create the university's fire protection engineering program, now recognized as one of the leading fire safety study programs in the world. The university has honored him with an honorary doctorate and named him the first recipient of the Center for Fire Safety Studies Herrick Drake Commemorative Award in 1987. In 1996, WPI awarded him an honorary doctorate degree in science and in 2004 presented him with the WPI Presidential Medal.Duane Pearsall Collection The Rockies Venture Club, an organization that helps entrepreneurs obtain funding, established the Duane Pearsall Entrepreneurial Award, given at irregular intervals to noteworthy business owners in Colorado.

It was one of the earliest Independent chapels in the Cynon Valley and remained an active place of worship until 2009. Early history The history of Ebenezer dates back to the late eighteenth century when a congregation including Independents and Calvinistic Methodists worshipped together in dwelling houses, and occasionally succeeded in getting an ordained minister to visit them. The two denominations separated towards the end of 1799. The Independent cause then continued at the home of one Timothy Davies, which became known as Ty'r Capel (Chapel House) In 1804 the small congregation adapted a small house on Penypound for use as a place of worship, and obtained a licence as a house of worship in the court of Llandaff on 16 October 1804. G. Hughes of Groeswen ministered to the congregation at this time, but in 1809, Methusalem Jones of Merthyr took over, as he was closer to the congregation that his predecessor. Joseph Harrison, the future minister of Ebenezer, joined the congregation around this time. The first chapel A chapel was built in 1811 and although land had been offered by Griffith Davies of Blaengwawr it was decided to build at Trecynon, then known as Heolyfelin, literally the 'Mill Road', a reference to the Aberdare Ironworks at Llwydcoed which were established in 1800. It was said that the congregation gathered stones for the original building from the common above Trecynon. The builders are recorded as Morgan Shon Morgan, John Richards of Penywaun and Thomas Philip Richards. In 1813, the congregation resolved to call a minister and they chose David Jones, a member of the church at Mynyddbach, near Swansea. Jones was ordained at Ebenezer on 29 July 1813. However, within three years, the area was affected by a depression in trade and Ebenezer could not sustain the minister, Jones departed to be minister at Llanharan and Taihirion. The pastorate of Joseph Harrison, 1817–35 Joseph Harrison, who had started preaching in 1812, became minister at Ebenezer in 1817 and presided over the church for the next twenty years. At the commencement of Harrison's ministry, there were only 26 members. However, its membership grew rapidly thereafter and it became the mother church of most Independent churches in the Cynon Valley. From 1828 until 1830 there was a period of revivalist fervor, and the increasing congregation meant that the original building was too small, and it was replaced in 1829 by a larger building that could accommodate around 600 people. The new building cost around £700 but the debt had been reduced to £240 by the time that Harrison's ministry came to an end in 1835. Nebo, Hirwaun was established as a branch of Ebenezer in 1823. A split in 1835 saw Joseph Harrison leave with fifteen members and form Salem, Robertstown. The pastorates of John Davies and Thomas Rees, 1836–42 Thomas Rees In 1836, Ebenezer, together with Nebo, Hirwaun, invited John Davies of Llantrisant to be minister. Davies remained for four years, before moving to Mynyddbach. Following his departure the era of joint ministry with Nebo came to an end. Thomas Rees, later of Swansea, became the minister of Ebenezer from 1840 until 1844. Rees had a short but successful ministry, and doubled the membership to around 300 within a year of his arrival. An increased membership resulted in an increased income for the church, but this led to a dispute between the minister and some of the senior members over whether the funds should be used to increase the minister's salary or to reduce the debt. Rees decided to leave Ebenezer in March 1842 having accepted a call from Siloa, Llanelli. Ebenezer had no minister for the next two years and during this period, in 1843, a number of members left Ebenezer to establish Siloa, Aberdare. These included David Price, who became minister of the new church. The pastorate of William Edwards 1844–84 Thomas Rees was succeeded by William Edwards, who remained until his death in 1884, during which time he played a part in founding most of the Independent churches of the Aberdare Valley. Edwards was a native of Ffestiniog, North Wales, who had worked for several years in the slate quarries before earning enough money to further his education and enter the ministry. His home at Trecynon was known as Meirion Cottage. Edwards studied at Brecon College and was invited to be minister at Ebenezer while still a student at that institution, and was inaugurated on 1 and 2 July 1844. Together with David Price of Siloa, Aberdare, he was responsible for establishing new causes at Cwmbach, Mountain Ash and Aberaman. In 1859, Horeb, Llwydcoed was established as a branch of Ebenezer. Despite the loss of members to these new churches, the membership of Ebenezer continued to grow, and was higher than at any time in its history by 1871. Ebenezer was renovated in 1852 and an adjacent 'Ebenezer Hall' built which housed the Sunday School. By 1853, Ebenezer was recorded as having 340 members, with 224 in the Sunday School, In 1859, the chapel was built for a third time at a cost of at least £800. The chapel could accommodate 900 people, In 1856, Edwards sought election to the Aberdare Local Board of Health, seeking to emulate Thomas Price of Calfaria, Aberdare who had set a precedent by being the first nonconformist minister to participate in local government in the locality. During the 1868 General Election in the Merthyr Boroughs constituency, a number of political meetings took place at Ebenezer, in support of both Henry Richard and Richard Fothergill. The meeting in support of Richard, in September 1868, was chaired by David Davis, Maesyffynnon. Fothergill's meeting, in October, was equally enthusiastic and presided over by the Baptist minister, William Harris of Heolyfelin. Edwards became President of the Union of Welsh Independents towards the end of his life. During his time at Aberdare he had a celebrated argument with Thomas Price about Baptism but the rift was healed and Price participated at his funeral. At the end of his ministry he was elected president of the Union of Welsh Independents. The pastorate of Grawys Jones, 1885–1925 The next minister was Grawys Jones, who was ordained as minister on 22 and 23 September 1885. Grawys Jones also served for forty years, until 1925. An extensive refurbishment by Owen Morris Roberts & Son took place in 1902. Following the renovation, preaching services were held in an attempt to clear part of the debt of £1,000. Elfed was among the guest preachers. 1904–05 Religious Revival Ebenezer was particularly affected by the 1904–05 Religious Revival, which had begun at Loughor near Swansea. The revival aroused alarm among ministers for the revolutionary, even anarchistic, impact it had upon chapel congregations and denominational organization. In particular, it was seen as drawing attention away from pulpit preaching and the role of the minister. The local newspaper, the Aberdare Leader, regarded the revival with suspicion from the outset, objecting to the 'abnormal heat' which it engendered. On Sunday 13 November, the revivalist Evan Roberts held meetings at Bryn Seion chapel in Trecynon. On the following evening, Monday 14 November, the revivalist meetings commenced at Ebenezer. Roberts addressed the meeting, reportedly repeating much of what he had said at Bryn Seion the previous day. After he spoke, one of his female companions (whose presence at the meetings was a notable feature of the revival) began to sing a hymn, and was soon joined by the entire congregation. Two more women addressed the meeting, while another woman read from the Scripture and prayed. Further meetings were held over the next two days, one of which lasted for several hours and another was addressed by Roberts's female followers from Loughor. Both the spontaneity of these meetings and the role played by women contrasted sharply with the conservative nature of nonconformist culture. Within a week, the editor of the Aberdare Leader' was increasingly strident in his criticism of the revival, with the emotion being compared with the jingoism of the Boer War a few years previously. Ebenezer's minister, Grawys Jones, was also singled out for criticism for allowing such emotion to be displayed at a meeting where he presided. Revivalist meetings in the town of Aberdare itself were said to be far more disciplined and orderly than those at Trecynon. The annual preaching meetings were turned into revival meetings which were said to have continued until a late hour on successive nights. 20th century After four years without a minister, William Morse arrived at Ebenezer in 1929 and remained for thirty years. During this time, David Emlyn Thomas, MP for Aberdare from 1946 until 1954 was a deacon at Ebenezer. Membership fell to 365 by 1945 and to 330 by 1954. Later history Membership was 564 in 1907 and remained at 330 in 1954. Ebenezer's last minister was R.O. Thomas, who served from 1961 until 1986. The chapel remained active into the twenty first century and ceased to be a place of worship in April 2009. The congregation still meet today in single numbers in the Chapel School Room, renamed 'Ebenezer Newydd 2009'.

History  The first initiative to map the creative industries from any country was from the United KingdomThe document´s name is “Creative Industries Mapping Documents”, released in 1998 by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in the UK. at the end of 1990. The goal was to prove that these sectors have an important role to the culture and the potential to generate jobs and wealth to the country. Then, these creative industries were mapped, and all others who maintained relations with them as well. Thus, it was built a view of the weight of the creative chains in the production process. Three years after this pioneering work, specifically in 2001, two others arose: * One from researcher John Howkins, who built his study according to a corporate vision (based on marketing concepts of intellectual property); * And another one from teacher Richard Florida, which showed off the so-called \\"creative class\\" (professionals who work with creative processes). It did not take long for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2008) to launch another study on the subject, only this time with an international scope. According to the survey, the exports of the creative industries in the world exceeded 500 billion dollars. Given the importance of the issue to the world and specifically to Brazil, the study A Cadeia da Indústria Criativa no Brasil (read \\"The Chain of Creative Industry in Brazil\\"), was undertaken. It was updated in 2011 and published in 2012. This tool to map the creative industry in the country is able to list information about each of these professions, such as the number of jobs and the amount of wages and the education level required. Thus, it unites information from both the Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas (i.e. \\"National Classification of Economic Activities\\") and the \\"Brazilian Classification of Occupations\\". In general, the creative industries encompass \\"economic activity directly related to the art world - especially the visual arts, performing arts, literature and publishing, photography, crafts, libraries, museums, galleries, archives, spots designated by the National Historic Landmark and festivals of arts (...) electronic media and other recent media (...) design-related activities. The theme is sometimes confused with the term \\"cultural industry\\". However, \\"the scope of the creative economy is determined by the extent of the creative industries.\\" In other words, cultural products and services would be part of a larger category of creative products and services.  Chain  For the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the chain of creative industry comprises the \\"cycles of creation, production and distribution of goods and services that use creativity and intellectual capital as primary inputs.\\" Thus, it can be divided into three major areas: creative core (the creative economic activities) related activities (provide goods and services directly to the core) and support (provide goods and services indirectly to the core). The United Kingdom's Department for Culture, Media and Sport considers as creative industries activities \\"that have their origin in creativity, skill and individual talent and which have a potential for creating wealth and jobs through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property.\\" Based on this concept, it can be said that Brazil is very important when it comes to creative industry. After all, he is one of the largest producers in the world of creativity. Analyzing the remuneration of the Brazilian people, it was found that the wages of those working in the creative industry in Brazil are almost three times higher than the national average wage (comparison value: R$4,693 and R$1,733, respectively). And among creative professionals, those from Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and the Federal District receive the best salaries. These are data from the \\"Creative Industries Mapping\\", which was based on information from 2011. The study addresses issues such as jobs, wages, average wage per state, number of employees by segment and even from the GDP creative country.  Acknowledgement  The sector has gained so much importance that, in May 2012, the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff decreed the creation of the Secretaria da Economia Criativa (\\"Creative Economy Secretariat\\"). The goal of SEC is to create, implement and monitor public policy that have the culture as a strategic axis, \\"prioritizing support and encouragement to professionals and to the micro and small Brazilian creative endeavors.\\" According to a report from the United Nations, Brazil is not among the top twenty producers in the industry yet, but the initiative of creating the SEC indicated the government's desire to reposition the \\"culture as development axis of the Brazilian state.\\" To the President of the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), Luciano Coutinho, this is a recognition that creative activities are important for the country \\"in a long- term perspective, having as a goal a more inclusive and sustainable development. Globally, the countries that have excelled in the industry are China, in the first place, followed by the United States and Germany. But Brazil has contributed greatly in the fields of architecture, fashion and design, revealing its creative potential worldwide.  Brazilian x-ray  The creative industry in Brazil gathers, generally, \\"young, educated and well-paid professionals\\" that earn 42% above the average wage in the country. It is difficult to know how much an idea or innovation costs, once they are intangible assets. One way of finding that out would be to create metrics and to use qualitative and quantitative researches. What is possible to identify are general economic data related to the Creative Industry in Brazil, such as: * Share of GDP: R$110 billion * Enterprises: 243 thousand * Professionals: 810 thousand, of which the most numerous are: # Architects and engineers: 229 877 employees formal; # Programmers information systems: 50,440; # Business analysts: 45,324; # Research and market analyst: 25,141; # Marketing manager: 20,382; # Advertising agents: 14,032; # Graphic Designer: 17,806; # Biologist: 15,182; # Manager of research and development: 13,414; # Designer of bespoke shoes: 13,068. *Wages: the best paid creative activities are: # Geologists and geophysicals: R$11,385; # Directors of TV shows: R$10,753; # Actors: R$10,348; # Biotechnologists: R$8,701; # News room directors: R$7,774; # Magazine editors: R$7,594; # Architects and engineers: R$7,524; # Electrical Engineers, electronics engineers and Computer engineers: R$7,431; # Screenwriters: R$7,347; # Researchers in general: R$7,102.

It is the former Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground, which was one the “big three” in Helsinki. It was in use 1963–79. It is located between Talinranta, the Tali Golf Course and the Vermo harness racing track, on the northern shore of the Laajalahti Bay, north of Tarvo Island and Finnish national road 1. History The Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground was one of the big three rubbish dumps of Helsinki. The other two were the Pasila dumping ground (1949–63, before 1949 the Finnish State Railways dumping ground) and the Vuosaari dumping ground (1966–1975 ja 1979–1988). After the Pasila dumping ground was closed, the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground became the main dumping ground of Helsinki. It was located near the Tali sewage treatment plant and the Tali Golf Course, between the brooks of Mätäjoki and Monikonpuro. It was earlier a shoreline meadow, but then the top soil was removed and the landfill with the dump was begun on top of clay land. At the end of the 1960s, the dumping ground was enlarged so that it ended up covering parts of the bay as well. Blasted stone was used to separate the rubbish from the sea water. Most of the rubbish accumulated during the 1970s. In the end much more accumulated that the clay base could bear, since there was no alternative at the time. Finally the dumping ground sank so that the rubbish from the 1960s are now below the water line. The total amount of the waste is ca. 3,5 million m3. In the 1960s and 1970s, those driving along the Finnish national road 1 toward Turku (then called the Tarvo Highway, from the nearby Tarvo Island), could see the nature of the place easily from a distance. Also noticeable were the great amounts of seagulls. Talinhuippu today Outwardly the Talinhuippu hill looks like any landfill site, and due to the growth of the trees, it can no longer be discerned from natural hills. The view to the Laajalahti Bay is beginning to grow over, when the gas emissions from the dumping ground have ceased. Earlier these emissions prevented the growth of flora at the site. The area has recreational paths and minor roads connected to the nearby Vermo harness racing track and a training ground owned by the city of Helsinki, and used e.g. by Helsingin Palveluskoiraharrastajat ry (‘The Helsinki Care Dog Society’) and other associations. In addition to this, the area has a frisbee golf course, which is 1865 m long with a par of 58. In the winter, the Tali Golf Course skiing tracks (6,5 km) extend to Talinhuippu and beyond.

When a bank is short of ready money, it is able to sell or repo its assets to a more liquid bank.  Commercial loan theory  Prior to the concept of shiftability, the orthodox theory of banking limited banks to making short-term commercial loans to help producers of goods during their business cycles. For example, apple farmers may require short-term financing until the crop is ready for sale. This theory postulates that by making short- term commercial transactions that will mature in a timely manner will keep banks in a ready state to meet the demands of their depositors.  Shiftability  Although banking at the time was not a new concept, what had changed was that deposits had become the primary liability of banks. In 1830 the capital of banks was about three times the deposits, but less than one hundred years later depositors had come to represent approximately 68 percent of the equity in banks. This increase in the proportion of deposits had many worried about the possibility of a run on the banks and the inability to get much needed cash. It was shown that short-term commercial lending oftentimes did not mature or liquidate at maturity due to changing business cycles. Growing opposition began to showcase the need for an improved banking system that could avoid forced liquidation of this short-term paper that came about more or less periodically. It proposed that banks, rather than relying on the liquidity of these assets in a crisis, should be able to shift these earning assets to another institution with a better cash position thereby creating the reserves needed. This ability to shift assets provides liquidity to otherwise non-liquid assets. The key piece of legislation that led to this reality was the Banking Act of 1935. One of its amendments provided that, a federal reserve bank may discount any commercial, agricultural or industrial paper for liquidity purposes. It also allowed necessary advances to its member banks secured by \\"any sound asset\\" that would otherwise be described as ineligible by the orthodox theory to provide bank reserves. Although there was much resistance to this idea and many believed it would be better to return to pre- war practices, it was Marriner Stoddard Eccles, an author of the Banking Act of 1935, that continued to push that bank asset liquidity in times of stress was dependent on the ability of a Central bank to exchange those assets for currency or credit.  During a crisis  One shortcoming of the Shiftability Theory, similar to one that led the banking system away from the orthodox theory, was that in times of stress or crisis, the effectiveness of these assets for liquidity purposes goes away as there is no market for them. If all banks are looking to liquidate assets, they are doing so at a cost because it would be difficult to find buyers, meaning lower prices for the assets and ultimately by doing so would not leave the banking system as a whole in a more liquid condition.

The earliest segment was constructed by the Peekskill Traction Company in 1899, running from the New York Central Railroad train station at Peekskill to Lake Mohegan. The company was unable to meet payments for construction of the line, so the contractor operated the railroad until it was sold to the Peekskill Lighting and Railroad Company in 1900 (itself a consolidation of the Peekskill Gas Light Co., Peekskill Electric Light and Power Co., and the Peekskill Traction Co.). The associated Westchester and Putnam Traction Company built extensions beyond Lake Mohegan, though the two companies were operated as one. In 1902, an extension was constructed through Buchannan to Verplanck. Another extension was opened in 1907 to Cortlandville, and Varian's Mills (later Williams Corners) in 1908. The final extension to Oregon (Putnam Valley) opened in 1909. President of the company was F.A. Stratton, who was also president of the Hudson River and Eastern Traction company, operators of the Ossining Electric Railway. Decline and Conversion to Bus Operation The first cutbacks came in 1924. The trolley system operated at a deficit for months, first reducing service to Oregon and Putnam Valley to Saturday-only in 1925, and ending service on the Oregon line on August 29, 1925. The remaining track around Peekskill was closed and trolley service ended on June 30, 1926. Peekskill Lighting and Railroad Co. created Peekskill Motor Bus Company as a new subsidiary to acquire and operate the transportation franchise in place of trolleys in 1926. Four routes were operated, using the Peekskill train station as a hub. At the time of its abandonment, the trolley lines of Peekskill Lighting and Railroad Co. was the last of the Consolidated Gas Company affiliated utilities to offer common-carrier rail transportation.

An alternate version of Tai appears in Toei Company's 1999 series as the main protagonist of Digimon Adventure, a supporting character in the sequel and once again as the protagonist of the films Digimon Adventure tri. and Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna. In this timeline, Tai is the leader of the first season DigiDestined. He is adventurous and a born leader, and is usually the first to spring into action. He is partnered with the dinosaur-like Agumon in the Digimon Adventure anime series. Tai was created by manga author Tenya Yabuno from V-Tamer 01. Multiple voice actors have voiced him across the franchise. Critical reception to Tai has been positive by writers from manga and anime websites. While his role and personality in the first Digimon series has been positive, writers expressed mixed thoughts about Tai's characterization in Tri due to lacking his hotblooded personality. Development Tai's original character was designed by Tenya Yabuno, one of the authors of manga V-Tamer 01. He was based on Kentarou Kamon, the protagonist of the Digimon manga pilot, C'mon Digimon. While creating the Digimon Adventure short, director Mamoru Hosoda wanted to focus on Tai and Kari's relationship with Koromon, the Digimon that appeared in their house, but did not want to portray it as friendship, instead portraying Digimon as dangerous creatures. Satoru Nishizono and the other staff members picked Tai's name using a name analysis software, where they chose kanji that related to \\"luck.\\" While Tai was conceptualized as the main character, Toei wanted to focus on all the Digidestined children at the same time resulting in an ensemble cast. Nishizono stated that with the exception of Tai and Agumon, Toei was told to make in-depth young characters to fit's the series' viewers. The staff considered Tai to remain as a protagonist for Digimon Adventure 02, but he ended up as a supporting character instead. For Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!, Hosoda wanted to focus on Tai's naivete through his nervousness on interacting with Sora despite needing her help. While finding Tai's actions out of character, Hosoda wanted Tai to try his best to apologize with Sora. For tri., Keitaro Motonaga stated the staff at Toei devised multiple scenarios to compare how he aged with his previous appearances. The staff also focused on his rivalry with Matt Ishida, due to how differently the two matured. Motonaga also commented that Tai was in a stage where he thought he would not be a teenager, which changed his characterization. In the Digimon Adventure tri. series, Tai's teenage appearance was designed by Atsuya Uki. In Japan, Tai's appearances were voiced by Toshiko Fujita. During auditions, the staff immediately chose her as they were fans of her works. Fujita liked Tai's character, due to how he cares for his sister and for his clumsy personality. She did not find difficulties in voicing Tai for the first series. She also liked the relationship between Tai and Agumon, believing it to be one of the best from the anime based on their similarities For tri, Fujita was replaced by Natsuki Hanae, who had been a fan of the series since he was a child and enjoyed Tai's character based on his bravery and sense of justice. He rewatched the first anime and the film before auditioning. at the same time pressured. When reading the script, Hanae noted Tai was different due to how he aged and felt this change was natural. In the English dub, the character's name was shortened to \\"Tai\\" from \\"Taichi.\\" Joshua Seth provides his voice. He did not find any impressions, during his audition for the character with comments on how he was close to the people in the cast. He felt Tai was similar to him so he \\"pitched up [his voice] little bit younger\\". Additionally, he stated he enjoyed voicing the character. However, by the time the film Revenge of Diaboromon was dubbed in English, he had retired from the voice acting industry in 2005, causing casting director Jeff Nimoy to cast Jason Spisak as his replacement, remarking how similar he sounded to Seth. Seth commented that his regular is very similar to the one from Tai in Tri was not difficult as he initially thought he had to \\"warm\\" up to the character.

Additionally, Tai and Koromon's brief return to the real world as listed as another moment due to Tai's brief interactions with his younger sister, Kari. Crunchyroll agreed, finding this episode showed Tai's flaws for the first time in the anime and how it resulted in SkullGreymon's evolution. Anime News Network highly praised Tai's character in the first series due to how he matures as a kid due to how he takes care of his sister most notably when she was sick and he got tired of seeing her inside the house while her parents were busy at work. Additionally, the site commented on Tai and Yamato's misrelationship due to their multiple differences that made them often clash. Retro Junk liked for how he looks after his group and that despite his issues, his friends respect him. THEM Anime Reviews liked the rivalry between Tai and Yamato, citing that at the same time both are similar character due to the two of them being big brothers who are often worried about their siblings. The same site also praised Joshua Seth for making Tai more appealing. Adam \\"OMEGA\\" Arnold from Animefringe praised the amount of focus given to Tai's character in the trilogy film Digimon: The Movie alongside other present characters. Shamus Kelley from Den of Geek also acclaimed Seth's acting in the movie due to the multiple emotions Tai shows across the trilogy as well as how the character tries to handle his relationship with Sora. In the book Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces, Brian Camp stated that Tai's apparent relationship with Sora who is later revealed to be interested into Matt was well handled as due to the characters' ages in contrast to other Western series. Tai's characterization in Tri. resulted in mixed comments by Jacob Hope Chapman from Anime News Network due his new hesitations which might not appeal to viewers of the series. While feeling it as part of Tai's character arc Christian Chiok from Japanator found Tai's traits out of character contrasting previous Digimon main characters. However, there were positive comments by Shamus Kelley from Den of Geek approved of Tai's new character arc noting that Tri focuses on personal responsibility and his potential for character growth. DVDTalk's writer Chris Zimmerman praised the still ongoing arguments between Tai and Yamato in Tri as fans from the first Digimon series would still find it memorable due to the history between these two characters. Otaku USA noted the arguments between these two characters as well and stated \\"Tai is actually the character who seems to be suffering from arrested development the most\\". Kelley complained about Tai and Yamato's still ongoing conflict in the next films commenting there were already enough in the first film and the possibility that Tai did not have character development in such movie. For the next film, Kelley readdressed such issues that were more present in the movie. In a Coexistence review, Anime Now's Richard Eisenbeis believes Tai managed to fully mature during the climax of the film due to his decisions in regards to who is the enemy, contrasting the original series where it was more obvious where Tai, as a kid, could easily be the enemy.

Chartered in 1892 as the Ossining Street Railway, the first section of the line opened in 1893, starting at the New York Central Railroad station at Ossining, and terminating at the Methodist Meeting Grounds (later Camp Woods) 1.8 miles away. There was also a short branch off Main Street to Sparta Hill. The town purchased the company in 1897 for unpaid taxes and continued operation until 1902 when the Westchester Traction Company took control. The new company announced an ambitious project to build a new line to White Plains as well as a route to Port Chester, but the only extension built was from Sparta Hill to Ossining Hospital. Westchester Traction Company took control of the Danbury and Harlem Traction Company project, which was only partially constructed between Danbury, Connecticut and North Salem, New York, and never put into operation. The Industrial Contracting Company was hired to construct the Danbury and Harlem line as well as the extension of the Ossining Electric Railway. Considerable grading and some track construction took place on the Danbury line, but no evidence of construction on the Ossining line could be found. In July 1906, the railroad suspended service while it made repairs to its powerhouse and other properties, but quickly determined by August that they could not afford to complete the work. The line was abandoned on October 20 and the rails were removed and scrapped by the town. The affiliated Danbury and Harlem Traction Co. had not seen any construction progress beyond roadbed grading from North Salem to Goldens Bridge. Its rails were removed sometime between 1910–1915. Established in February 1906, the Hudson River and Eastern Traction Company began construction of a new line over the same route in 1907. The new railway included a branch on Spring Street. Permission was secured in 1911 to construct a 17-mile extension running through Briarcliff Manor, Pleasantville, Sherman Park, and White Plains, but construction never began. Revenues declined through the 1920s until the railway was purchased by the Westchester Coach Co. in 1926. All trolley service was converted to bus operation immediately after.

Eccleston Jr. (1910 – December 20, 2000) was an American ice hockey, football and baseball coach. Eccleston spent most of his career at Burrillville High School in some capacity but was also the head coach for Providence for eight seasons. Career Tom Eccleston graduated from Brown University in 1932, playing four years of soccer, and immediately moved into a teaching position at Burrillville High in Burrillville, Rhode Island. Initially a history teacher and football coach, Eccleston eventually added the coaching duties of baseball and ice hockey to his responsibilities, winning state championships in all three sports. For 23 years Eccleston declined all offers to coach at the collegiate level but finally accepted an offer from Providence in 1956 to alleviate issues that had arisen while coaching his sons. Eccleston became the fifth head coach at Providence (the second since the program restarted after World War II) and immediately provided the school with its best record in 1956-57 at 11-7. Eccleston continued to keep the Friars in a strong position for the duration of his tenure, including its transition into ECAC Hockey in the early 1960s, recruiting players like Lou Lamoriello, Bob Bellemore and Larry Kish. In eight seasons behind the bench Eccleston had only one losing season and in 1963-64 gave Providence its first conference title and NCAA tournament appearance. The '64 season was the best in Providence's history to that point and very few have topped it. For the outstanding year Eccleston received the Spencer Penrose Award and then stepped down from his position to devote more attention to being the school superintendent in Burrillville. In 1987, after 32 years away, Eccleston returned to Burrillville High to coach the ice hockey team when it was in jeopardy and revived the program.

The line was sanctioned by parliament in 1864, and opened in 1869; much of the line is flat, with extensive straight sections; the crossing of the River Ouse required a major bridge, the Skelton Viaduct (or Goole swing bridge). There are two minor stations on the line and ; the present Goole railway station was also created as part of the line, replacing an earlier terminus in the docks. Description Modern bridge on the Goole Knottingley canal (2007) The Hull and Doncaster Line is a railway running from Staddlethorpe junction (also known as Giberdyke junction) on the Hull and Selby Line southwest past to the River Ouse crossing by the Skelton viaduct swing bridge near Skelton and then making an end on junction at Goole railway station.Ordnance Survey Sheets 228NE, 228NW, 228SW, 237SE (1904–1950) At Goole the line diverges southwest passing over the westward running line of the former Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway (WP&GR;); Knottingley and Goole Canal (Aire and Calder); and the Dutch River, then passing Thorne and crossing the Stainforth and Keadby Canal section of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, connecting with the Barnsley to Barnetby Line at Thorne junction.Ordnance Survey Sheets 237SE, 252NE, 252SE, 252SW, 266NW, 266SW (1904–1950) The line then ran to Doncaster over the Barnsley to Barnetby branch line to Doncaster. As of 2014 Network Rail classes the line as a secondary route, part of the SRS H.08 set of route which include Goole-Knottingley and Moorthorpe-Knottingley-Church Fenton lines. The line is double tracked, with the exception of the junction at Thorne. The line code is TJG: TJG1 Thorne junction to Thorne is ; and TJG2, Gilberdyke junction to Thorne North, . Route availability is 8 or 9, with loading gauge W6 to W9, the linespeed mostly . The line is used for both passenger and freight trains, with an average of two passenger trains per hour. History =Background= Early proposals for a line connecting Hull to Doncaster included the Hull, Sheffield and Midland Direct Railway, promoted in 1845, which was for a line from the Hull and Selby Line near Gilberdyke, crossing the Ouse near Goole by a tunnel, then via Thorne and Kirk Sandall to Doncaster, then west to a junction with the North Midland Railway (Midland Railway) near Wath upon Dearne. This was abandoned by 1846. Another scheme, the Hull, Goole and Doncaster Railway was promoted in 1855 to connect South Yorkshire coalfields to Hull. In 1860 another scheme, called the 'Hull and Doncaster Railway', was submitted to parliament. The line was to run from the Thorne branch of the South Yorkshire Railway (SYR) to a junction with the Hull and Selby Railway east of Staddlethorpe station. Both the SYR and Great Northern Railway (GNR) were to have running powers to Hull over the line. The North Eastern Railway (NER) persuaded the original promoters to withdraw the scheme on the understanding that the NER would promote and build a similar line. The NER submitted a scheme for a railway connecting Doncaster (South Yorkshire) and Hull via a line from Staddlethorpe to Hull; the NER's line face three other rival schemes: the independently promoted Hull and West Riding Junction Railway; and lines from south Yorkshire towards Hull promoted by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;), and by the SYR, the 'Hull and West Riding Junction' scheme was withdrawn at an early stage, the remaining three schemes undertook and expensive three way battle in parliament for an enabling act. The NER's scheme was passed by the House of Commons but defeated in the House of Lords. In the next session of parliament (1862/3) the NER reached an agreement with the SYR and Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railways (MSLR, then lessor of the SYR from 1861) not to oppose the bill, in exchange for mutual running powers over the two companies' lines between Hull and Doncaster. The NER also reached an agreement with the L&YR;, who had a rival bill in parliament, with both companies agreeing running powers on each other's routes to Normanton, and mutual running powes to Hull, and to Barnsley. The NER's scheme was submitted in 1862, and in the same session the SYR submitted a bill with clauses enabling it to modify a previously permitted line from Doncaster to Thorne (South Yorkshire Railway Act, 1862.) to add a junction and branch north to near the Selby-Bawtry turnpike, northwest of the town of Thorne. The NER's act was enabled by parliament 23 July 1863, as the North Eastern Railway (Hull and Doncaster Branch) Act, 1863; and the SYR's deviations and branch were incorporated into the South Yorkshire Railway Act, 1863, both passed in the same session. =Construction= Skelton viaduct or Goole swing bridge (2009) The line was to run from the NER's Hull and Selby Line west of Staddlethorpe station at Staddlethorpe junction; to a connection with the SYR southwest of Thorne, joining the main line at Thorne junction; with a chord making a connection to the WP&GR;'s (L&YR;) existing railway at Goole from Potter's Grange junction. The act allowed £310,000 in shares, and £103,000 in loans to be raised specifically for the construction of the line. Most of the route of the line was relatively flat ground, representing an easy route for construction of a railway. The main feature of the line was the wrought iron bridge crossing the River Ouse, the Skelton viaduct; at the time of construction it was amongst the largest opening bridges in the world, with a swing span, and total length including fixed spans of . The contractors for the bridge were Butler and Pitts of Stanningley (fixed spans), and Pease, Hutchingson and Company (Skerne Ironworks) for the swing span, with hydraulic machinery from William Armstrong (Newcastle upon Tyne). Bridges were also required in close succession west of Goole: one over the L&YR; line into the docks ; the Knottingley and Goole Canal, crossed by an iron trellis girder of around ; and the Dutch River, with two iron trellis girders of . On the southern part of the line, west of Thorne, bridges were required over the Stainforth and Keadby canal, and the Thorne-Selby road. Stations were built at Laxton (Saltmarshe station), a new through station at Goole, and a second station at Thorne (Thorne North station). Construction of the Hull-Thorne section, and straightening of the Doncaster-Thorne Line had begun by 1864; work on the SYR's line was continued through 1865, with the line (Sandall to Maude's Bridge) opened 10 November 1866. Work on the Thorne-Doncaster section continued through 1866 and 1867, with the line nearly completed in 1868 and the Skelton viaduct over the Ouse complete enough by February 1868 to allow officials of the NER to pass over it in a train. The length of new line was , gives a figure of 18 miles between Staddlethorpe and Thorne, seemingly erroneously. Brassey and Field were the main contractors for the line, represented by J. Stevenson; the main engineer was the NER's T.E. Harrison, with John Malt the resident engineer; Buttler and Pitt were contractors for the fixed bridges. =1869–present= (original) Bridge over the Dutch River (2007) The line opened 30 July 1869. gives a date of 2 August. The line replaced the former route into Hull from the south along the Normanton-York branch (former York and North Midland Railway) via Milford junction onto the Leeds and Selby Line. The original L&YR; station in Goole became defunct with trains diverted into the new station. The line was the main route for south Yorkshire coal to Hull, together with the Hull and Barnsley Railway (after 1885). The Goole and Marshland Light Railway, later Axholme Joint Railway was established in 1898, with a junction at Marshland junction. It was bought by the North Eastern Railway for £27,500 on 1 October 1903, while still under construction, and opened on 2 January 1905. The line closed to passengers on 15 July 1933, while freight traffic ceased on 5 April 1965, but the track was not lifted, and was retained as a long siding. The Central Electricity Generating Board paid for its maintenance, as the railway bridge at Crowle was the only one strong enough to allow stators from Keadby Power Station to be taken away for maintenance. This practice continued until Lindsey County Council built a new bridge on the A161, crossing the Stainforth and Keadby Canal at Crowle, and the rails were finally lifted in 1972. By the beginning of the 20th century there were also sidings to peat moss works on Thorne and Hatfield Moors. Creyke's Siding was originally a small trailing siding to the west of the line. Its construction was negotiated by Richard Boynton Creyke, and authorised by an agreement dated 7 May 1863. It was close to Moor Road, and there was a signal box to the east of the line at the crossing. The Peat Moss Litter Company built a works to the east of the line in 1886, and agreement was reached for a longer trailing siding to serve the works, on the opposite side of the main line to the original siding. The agreement was dated 11 February 1887. The siding agreement was assigned to William Smith & Co on 9 February 1894, who had taken over the works in 1889. The works was served by a network of gauge horsedrawn tramways, extending onto the moors. Smiths also built a firelighter and disinfectant works near the northern end of the siding. Both products were peat based. The British Moss Litter Co Ltd took over the site in 1896, but failed to notify the North Eastern Railway, who noted the change in 1909. Lengthy correspondence followed, resulting in a new siding agreement being reached on 21 January 1910. The railway company also recorded that the siding was used by a farmer called Mr G Dougherty and by the Nego Firelighting Company in 1908. The peat works operated until 1950–51, and was largely demolished in 1970–71. Moorend Works was situated a little further to the south. The works were established in the 1860s, although its exact purpose at the time is unclear, but Newman & Owston Moss Litter Co Ltd took over the site in 1888. They negotiated a short branch line with a passing look, in an agreement dated 24 April 1889. It ran eastwards from the main line, sweeping round to the south as it entered the works. The peat company merged with the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Co Ltd on 11 May 1893, and the siding agreement was assigned to them on 15 February 1894. In addition to gauge tramways, they built around of canals on the moors to serve the works. The British Moss Litter Co also took over this works, in 1896, and the siding agreement was assigned to them on 14 October 1898. The works were destroyed by a fire in 1922, after which no further peat was processed there, although the remaining buildings were used as a maintenance workshop until 1956. The standard gauge siding was not lifted immediately after production ceased, as it was still in evidence in the mid-1930s, and appears on the 1948 Ordnance Survey map, although not on the 1956 edition. In 1910 a new route of the L&YR; (Pontefract-Goole Line) into Goole was opened, avoiding the former path into the docks, joining the line just east of the original junction; also in 1910 the Goole and Selby Line began running into Goole station via the new L&YR; line onto the Hull-Doncaster branch.Ordnance Survey. Sheet 237SE. NB Goole- Selby Line missing from the 1938 provisional revision In 1909 the NER also obtained an act to widen a short section of the line on the approach to Staddlethorpe junction.

It also extends into North African nations such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia, although bands in the North African region associate themselves more closely with the MENA region in terms of cultural and social consistencies. African heavy metal is characterized by the use of European and American metal genres, often blended with traditional African instruments and musical styles, creating distinct regional differences.  History  = Southern Africa = Author Edward Banchs traveled extensively through the African countries with the most prominent metal scenes and published a book covering the musicians and the rise and struggles of the respective scenes in the Sub-Saharan and island countries. According to Banchs, South Africa has developed a robust metal scene due to the existing music industry and the large population that could support the growing metal scene. In South Africa, heavy metal was introduced in the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s in Johannesburg and was met with support with the relative success of bands such as Odyssey, Ragnärok, Urban Assault, and Voice of Destruction. The arrival of metal music in the country was controversial. For example, the government and the N.G Kerk banned certain records from being imported, and fans of the genre faced hostility from the public with accusations of satanism. With the rise of the dance music around the turn of the century, the genre experienced a relative decline until its resurgence in the mid-2000s. In 2010, some South African music groups such as Red Helen, Facing The Gallows and Betray The Emissary followed a more international standard and approach to music. In South Africa, the fan base and band members are predominantly made up of white South Africans unlike in other African countries, such as Botswana, where the fan base is predominately from the black majority. The first black metal band in South Africa with all black members, Demogorath Satanum, has formed and works to change the perception of metal music as a genre for white people and bring more black fans into the South African metal scene. The Botswana heavy metal scene started in the 1970s with the introduction of classic rock and evolved into a distinctive sub-culture with a cowboy inspired aesthetic. Wrust, Overthrust, and Skinflint have achieved some international success and recognition. The 2014 documentary March of the Gods: Botswana Metalheads documents the heavy metal scene in Botswana. Other Southern African countries such as Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Madagascar are developing metal scenes as well. The Mozambique metal scene is the subject of the documentary, Terra Pesada. Namibia held a metal festival in Windhoek intermittently between 2007 and 2014 called the Windhoek Metal Fest. Zimbabwe held its first documented metal concert in Harare in 2015 and the first album recorded in Shona was released in 2018. Madagascar also has a developing metal scene recorded by Edward Banchs. The Angola metal scene was documented and featured in the film Death Metal Angola. Not much is known about any metal scenes in the other Southern African countries. = North Africa = Metal made an appearance in North Africa in the 1980s. North African heavy metal bands in particular are aligned with the political side of metal, and members of metal bands are often activists. The metal scenes in North Africa are marked by political and social repression. In January 1997, between 78 and 87 metal fans were forcibly removed from their homes and imprisoned under Egypt's statute against the \\"contempt of heavenly religions\\" and for obscene acts, drug possession, and promoting extreme ideas. The media took hold of the information about the arrests and spread stories of drug abuse, Satanic rituals, animal sacrifice, and orgies. Defendants were eventually released due to a lack of evidence, but some were held for as long as three weeks. The metal scene retreated following the crackdown in 1997 but came back slowly and cautiously to avoid suspicion in the 2000s and has now largely recovered from the 1997 arrests. The 2011 revolution in Egypt politicized metal further and caused the genre to gain popularity in mainstream audiences. However, heavy metal is still not fully accepted by society in Egypt. Security forces have prevented 35 metal bands from entering the country, and, in 2012, the media and the Muslim Brotherhood accused fans of the genre of Satanism, although the allegations did not produce the same effects as those made in 1997. Many bands have since left Egypt, however, finding that the end of the revolution has caused the scene to wane. The metal scene in Morocco faced a similar series of arrests as Egypt. Nine heavy metal band members and five fans were sentenced to serve prison time for being anti-Islamic in 2003. The 14 individuals were released after Moroccans protested. Despite the scrutiny metal fans face in Morocco, festivals like L'Boulevard which host hip hop and metal musicians from around the world have gained popularity and government support in recent years, and an organization called the Moroccan Metal Community organizes metal concerts and promotes Moroccan metal bands. Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria have smaller metal scenes than their North African counterparts. Tunisian bands note that the scene is struggling due to a lack of access to equipment, record labels, venues, and recording studios. Musicians also cite the revolution in 2011 as a reason for the lack of development of the heavy metal scene. Libya's art scene is also where a heavy metal scene is developing after the Libyan Civil War (2011). Algeria's metal scene is strong, beginning in the 1990s as an underground movement during the Algerian Civil War and has sustained attacks by the media and the public. = East, Central, and West Africa = Eastern and Western Africa have seen less of a presence. Kenya and Uganda in Eastern Africa have metal scenes. Kenya first was introduced to metal music in the 1990s and grew in popularity in the 2000s. Kenyan musicians use their Christian beliefs and the post-election crisis of 2008 as inspiration for their songs. Central Africa and Western Africa do not have a documented history of metal music. Researchers attribute the lack of metal scenes in African countries to multiple factors. First, music scenes require a degree of urbanization. African metal scenes are often centered in capital cities, and music scenes require regular access to power for musicians to be able to produce and play music. Researchers also attribute the lack of metal scenes to a lack of Internet access, which is required for the influx and spread of Western music in African countries, and the lack of a music infrastructure in African countries in general including venues and record labels. Despite these barriers, metal has spread considerably across the continent in recent decades, and nascent scenes that are not documented formally are possible. The availability of music online and tutorship from world class musicians whose instructional videos are freely available has had an impact on how musicians in the heavy metal genre improve themselves and include new and trending sounds such as djent or black metal.

Life  His father was the painter Louis-Pierre Verwee and his brother Louis- Charles Verwee would become a painter as well. He was originally trained to be a surveyor, but could not complete his engineering studies due to family financial difficulties. Painting had long been a hobby so, with his father's support, he began to pursue that as a career. One of his earliest influences was the French artist Constant Troyon, a member of the Barbizon school. In 1853, he took lessons from the landscape and portrait painter François Charles Deweirdt (1799-1855), who had been a friend and collaborator of his father's. He later enrolled at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts, but attended only a few classes. Mare with Foal (date unknown) His first exhibition was in 1857, but he didn't achieve true recognition until 1863, when he had a show at the Brussels Salon, where he was awarded a gold medal. He won another gold medal at the Paris Salon in 1864. On the advice of professional acquaintances, he settled in Paris and made contact with more painters of the Barbizon school. This didn't lead to the expected financial success, however, and he returned to Brussels a year later. Then, from 1867 to 1868, he lived in London but, again, commercial success was unobtainable and he returned home broke. Despite this, he married and then undertook a tour of the Netherlands. That same year, he became a founding member of the \\"Société Libre des Beaux-Arts\\", a group that was opposed to academicism in art. During this time, he began painting plein air to achieve a naturalistic style. From 1875 to 1880, he attempted to create a grand vision of the Flemish countryside. In 1876, he helped establish \\"La Chrysalide\\", a short-lived association that is considered a forerunner to \\"Les XX\\". Two years later he, François Musin, Louis Dubois, Amédée Lynen and others were invited by the architectural firm of Naert and Laureys to provide decorations for a new spa in Oostende. The hall he decorated is now known as the \\"Verwee-zaal\\". =Art and business in Knokke= Thunderstorm (date unknown) Around 1880, he became fascinated with the area surrounding Knokke, and an informal artists' colony slowly took root there. At the time, he began alternating between landscape and animal painting, doing the landscapes plein air and posing the animals in his studio. He is generally considered to be Belgium's first great animal painter. By 1887, he saw that Knokke could become a major tourist attraction, so he joined with two local businessmen to purchase a large tract of dunes and polders to subdivide for property developers. In 1888, he built a villa, the \\"Fleur des Dunes\\" and, in 1891, joined with his friend to create \\"Knokke-Attractions\\", a promotional firm. His health began to deteriorate in 1892. First, he suffered from rheumatism, then was diagnosed with throat cancer. In 1895, he travelled to Southern France, Algeria and Egypt in hopes of finding a warm, dry climate that would improve his health. A few weeks before his death, his friends brought him back to Knokke and he died at his home in Schaarbeek.

From the Lithuanian capital, the route continued towards Moscow, while Warsaw had road connections with most major cities of Central Europe. The route dates back to the 13th century, but its heyday was in the 18th century, when, during the reign of King Augustus II the Strong, when regular mail service was initiated. At that time, permanent postal stations were established along the Great Lithuanian Route. These stations were financed by towns located along the route. Several foreign travelers described the Great Lithuanian Route. Among them was Georg Forster, who crossed it in 1784 on his way to Vilnius University.

He taught philosophy and ancient languages as well as science and math at several Latter-day Saints (LDS) institutions including Brigham Young University in the early 20th century. He was one of four educators at Brigham Young University whose teaching of evolution and attempts to reconcile it with Mormon thought, although strongly popular with students, generated controversy among university officials and the LDS community. Chamberlin has been called \\"Mormonism's first professionally trained philosopher and theologian.\\"  Biography  =Early life= William Chamberlin was born in Salt Lake City, Utah on February 12, 1870 to parents William Henry Chamberlin and Eliza Frances Brown Chamberlin. William Jr. was the oldest of 12 children. He showed early interest in botany, geology, and mathematics. His brother Ralph Vary Chamberlin would go on to become a noted biologist and would later become embroiled with William in controversy regarding the teaching of evolution. On September 28, 1892, Chamberlin married Amelia Telle Cannon, a daughter of President George Q. Cannon, First Counselor in the First Presidency (LDS Church). William and Amelia had six children: Max Cannon, Hester, Martha, Paul, Frances, and Luke. =Mission and early career= Chamberlin's early career was divided between teaching, studying, and working to support his family. He taught in public schools from 1889-1891, and from 1891 to 1897 he taught math, geology, and astronomy at Latter-day Saint College. He finally completed a Bachelor of Arts in science with the University of Utah in 1896. From 1897 to 1900 he served a mission in the South Pacific Society Islands where as part of his proselytizing he translated the Book of Mormon into Tahitian, and became mission president, an ordained high priest of the Church. Around the turn of the century he donated a large collection of ferns from Utah and the South Pacific to the University of Utah's natural history museum. From 1900 to 1904 he taught science and theology at Brigham Young College, where he was Chair of Geology and Mineralogy. =Philosophy and Brigham Young years= In 1901, Chamberlin began studying philosophy at the University of Chicago. Over several years he studied philosophy with several prominent thinkers, including George Howison at U.C. Berkeley and Josiah Royce at Harvard. He earned an M.A. from the University of Chicago in 1906. In 1909, William Chamberlin was recruited to Brigham Young University (BYU) by president George H. Brimhall, as part of an effort to increase the academic quality of his university. Two years earlier, Brimhall had recruited brothers Joseph and Henry Peterson, professors of psychology and education, as well as Chamberlin's own brother Ralph, a biologist. William Chamberlin taught philosophy and ancient languages. The Chamberlin and Peterson brothers, while devout Mormons, actively sought to increase the intellectual atmosphere of the university and community, facilitating discussion and debates on evolution and the Bible, and sought to convey that evolutionary ideas and Mormon theology were not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. The four instructors' courses were popular among students and other faculty, but university and church officials accused the professors of promoting heretical views, and in 1911 offered the Petersons and Ralph Chamberlin a choice: alter their teachings or lose their jobs. This ignited a great deal of controversy in the school and surrounding community. The students of BYU overwhelmingly supported the professors, and a petition of support signed by at least 80% of the student body was submitted to BYU officials and reprinted in the Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City's largest secular newspaper. William Chamberlin was not given the same ultimatum, but soon after the accusations he published an essay entitled \\"The Theory of Evolution as an Aid to Faith in God and Belief in the Resurrection\\" in the BYU student newspaper, whose student editors wrote \\"the thoughtful reading of it will well repay any student\\". The Petersons and Ralph Chamberlin left the university in 1911, while William remained for another 5 years, resigning in 1916. =Later years= In 1917 Chamberlin began a PhD with Harvard philosopher Ralph Barton Perry, but left after one year due to poor health and financial troubles. He taught philosophy at the University of Utah from 1917 to 1920, and later at Utah State Agricultural College until his death. Chamberlin died in Logan, Utah, following a flu infection on May 9, 1921. He was fifty-one years old. Philosophy and theology Chamberlin's philosophical views have been termed \\"spiritual realism\\", and are rooted in the philosophical tradition of personalism. Mormon scholar James M. McLaughlin consolidated Chamberlin's philosophical views into five major statements: > #Persons are eternal, they are ontologically and metaphysically ultimate. > This personalism is tied to a pragmatic theory of knowledge in which truth > is determined in relation to its outcome and the interests and purposes of > persons. #Community and sociality is an essential feature of the being of > persons. The moral meaning of the world grows out of the relation of eternal > co-dependence of persons in community. At the head of this community is God. > #God is a person and is the ultimate example of personal existence. God is > dependent on the other members of the community of minds. #God's revelation > in the world is limited to the capacity of human truth; it must be stated in > human terms. #Evolution is a true and explanatory principle through which we > can come to understand the development of the \\"Kingdom of God.\\" Evolution > must be viewed as a teleology reflecting God's design and not as a string of > efficient causes. Chamberlin was the first LDS scholar to extensively apply higher criticism to the Bible. Religious scholar Anthony Hutchinson labeled Chamberlin's style of biblical criticism (the academic study of the Bible) as a \\"critical historical and philological hermeneutic\\" approach, broadly characterized by acceptance of mainstream (non-LDS) biblical criticism and fluency in ancient biblical languages. According to Hutchinson, relative strengths of this approach, as compared to other LDS approaches to biblical studies, include ease of communicating with scholars of Christianity and Judaism, while relative weaknesses include a highly intellectual approach which may preclude its application to popular religious practice, and promotion of views that may be interpreted as heretical. Other LDS scholars Hutchinson grouped into this approach include Lowell L. Bennion, Sterling McMurrin, and John L. Sorenson. In a survey of thirty-eight prominent LDS intellectuals conducted by Leonard J. Arrington in the late 1960s, Chamberlin was recognized as one of the top twelve figures in LDS intellectual history. However, Philip L. Barlow notes that Chamberlin is less well-known than other prominent LDS figures. Students of Chamberlin's included E. E. Ericksen, who later become chairman of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Utah and who is known as a leading figure in LDS intellectual history.

Career In high school, Jones was a contestant in Mississippi's Junior Miss. In 1998, she was crowned Miss Lake Wedowee and placed at Miss Alabama that year. While a senior at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, Jones won the title of Miss Samford 1999. The next year she was crowned Miss Jefferson County 2000. Jones was selected as Miss Homewood Area 2001 then, in early 2001, Jones was diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome, a potentially fatal illness caused by a bacterial toxin. The antibiotic treatment for this caused her most of her hair to fall out just two months before the Miss Alabama pageant in June. Jones' preliminary competition talent for Miss Alabama was playing classical piano. Her platform was \\"Boys and Girls Clubs: Be a Peer Role Model\\". Jones won the state competition on Saturday, June 16, 2001, when she received her crown from outgoing Miss Alabama titleholder Jana Sanderson. After winning, Jones announced she would use the scholarship money to pursue a graduate degree in music education. As Miss Alabama, her activities included public appearances across the state of Alabama. Jones was Alabama's representative at the Miss America 2002 pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Her competition talent was a classical piano performance of Frédéric Chopin's \\"Ballade No. 1 in G Minor\\". Jones was not one of the finalists for the Miss America title. Her reign as Miss Alabama continued until Scarlotte Deupree was crowned on June 15, 2002. Personal life Jones is a Birmingham, Alabama, native and spent part of her high school years at Mountain Brook High School. She is a 1995 graduate of Lamar High School in Meridian, Mississippi. Majoring in piano performance, Jones graduated from Samford University with a bachelor's degree in December 1999. While at Samford, she was inducted into the Kappa Chapter of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority. She then enrolled in a graduate program at The University of Alabama studying music education. Before becoming Miss Alabama in 2001, Jones worked as a fragrance model, a waitress, and a piano teacher. After graduating, she owned and operated a music academy in Augusta, Georgia. In 2008, she was hired as the administrator for the Gadsden Community School for the Arts in Gadsden, Alabama. Her parents are Jerry Wilson Jones and Cynthia Perkins Jones. During her reign as Miss Alabama, her father worked for a department store and her mother was a homemaker. She is an only child. Jones was raised Southern Baptist.

Eichholz played a key role in the successful establishment of the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Health Physics. The Department has been a constant source of well-educated and well trained graduates in the field of nuclear engineering, health physics and medical physics. Professor Eichholz was involved at all levels of the educational ladder including leadership roles and participation in doctoral and masters committees. Early life and times Eichholz was born on 29 June 1920 in Hamburg, Germany, to Max Eichholz and Adele \\"Daisy\\" née Elias. Dr. Max Eichholz was a lawyer and senior member of the Hamburg City Parliament and a well-known opponent of the Nazi party. As a result, after 1933, his father was severely persecuted and arrested multiple times. In 1943, Dr. Max Eichholz died at Auschwitz. At the age of 18 during Kristallnacht the Nazis expelled him from Berlin Technical University and he was forced to leave his home country. Relatives in England offered him a place to stay.Ryan, Michael T. (December 2004). 2004 Robley D. Evans Commemorative Medal. Health Physics. 87(6): 575-576. Education and training In 1938, Eichholz graduated from the Johanneum High School. He attended the Berlin Technical University for two partial semesters that ended on 9 November 1938 during Kristallnacht. He was expelled from the University and was fortunate to escape arrest after witnessing the destruction and burning of synagogues. Early in 1939 Eichholz was awarded a Refugee Scholarship from Harvard University effective in the following Fall semester. With this information, he was able to secure a transit visa to Great Britain where he could stay with relatives. In March 1939, Eichholz arrived in England without any money to his name. He obtained a position as an unpaid research assistant in the physics department at Bristol University. A distant relative, David Eichholz, Professor in Classics at the University of Bristol set young Eichholz up with a position as an unpaid researcher for Professor Arthur Mannering Tyndall, Department of Physics. Eichholz worked for Cecil F. Powell scanning photographic emulsions. He worked alongside another refugee, Harald Rossi. In 1950, Powell would go on to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of pi mesons in these very same photographic emulsions. In August 1939, war in Europe erupted, and Eichholz was called into duty as a firewatch on top of the Physics tower. He was formally recognized as a Victim of Nazi Oppression. Due to the outbreak of war, the U.S. Consulate General refused to grant Eichholz a student visa. At this point Professor Tyndall arranged for Eichholz to be admitted to Bristol as a first-year honours student with tuition and fees waived. Eichholz was formally matriculated by Chancellor Winston Churchill. At Bristol, as an undergraduate student Eichholz had on occasion interacted with noteworthy scientists including: Walter Heitler, Herbert Fröhlich, Kurt Hoselitz and Hans Heitler. Finally in February 1940, Eichholz was reunited with his mother, who had escaped from Germany one week before the war. In May 1940, after the Battle of Dunkirk, all male refugee enemy aliens were interned. Eichholz spent the summer under canvas and was eventually transferred to the Isle of Man. In December 1940, he was released and rejoined his mother, now in Bradford, Yorkshire. A recommendation from Tyndall and an interview with Professor Edmund Clifton Stoner at the University of Leeds garnered Eichholz admittance to Leeds as a second-year physics student in the midst of an accelerated wartime curriculum. In May 1942, he graduated with First-Class Honours in physics. James Chadwick was the external examiner. Eichholz was assigned to the Admiralty Signal Establishment, Witley, Surrey for work on radar development. The assignment involved work with microwaves and waveguides, state-of-the-art technology at the time. At the end of World War II, in January 1946, Eichholz returned to his studies at Leeds to complete his PhD. Professor Stoner suggested the topic of magnetic resonances at microwave frequencies. The thesis in physics was completed in September 1947, passed the oral examination and scrutiny by the external examiner in Sheffield and the oral presentation was completed just prior to departing via ship to Canada. Canada In early 1947, Eichholz had replied to an advertisement in Nature for a faculty position at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and was offered the position of assistant professor, contingent upon completion of his PhD and becoming a British citizen. The conditions were met, and so he began a long trip to Vancouver, with 5 days at sea, followed by 6 days by train across Canada. Eichholz experienced culture shock as he encountered the change from wartime England to the immensity of Canada. At UBC Eichholz was assigned teaching duties with returning veterans as his primary student group. He had to establish laboratories and initiate research projects in nuclear physics. He became involved with ionizing radiation and radiation detection. A productive summer was spent at the AECL Chalk River Laboratories, and he witnessed the startup of the NRX Reactor. During his time off, he enjoyed sailing on the Ottawa River with W.B. Lewis. Lewis was known as the father of the CANDU nuclear reactor. In 1951, Eichholz moved to Ottawa and accepted a position with the Canadian Bureau of Mines, as head of the Physics and Radiotracer Subdivision. The work focused on uranium assays of ores and minerals. Later projects involved development of novel radiation detectors and the utilization of radioisotopes in industry.Canada Centre for Mineral and Energy Technology, & Ignatieff, Alexis. (1982).

Georgia Institute of Technology In 1963, Eichholz was recruited by the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) for the position of professor in the newly established graduate program in the School of Nuclear Engineering. He remained there for 25 years. At the time the program did not offer an undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering. By the end of the 1960s, a significant program in health physics was added. Eichholz developed additional courses for these programs that added to the breadth and depth of these specialties. He published or coauthored several books for these courses and they include: Radioisotope Engineering, Environmental Aspects of Nuclear Power, Nuclear Radiation Detection, and Radon.Eichholz, G.G.

In 1975 Eichholz was named Regents’ Professor of Nuclear Engineering. While at Georgia Tech, Eichholz maintained an active research program that encompassed laboratories in 4 different building on campus. Research focus areas included radiotracer utilization, irradiation effects, radon, and dosimetry. He devoted a great deal of effort to studies on the migration of radioactive material and pollutants through unsaturated soils. In a somewhat unrelated field, he also taught a course on architectural acoustics in the College of Architecture for over 20 years. Leisure activities Pastimes include tennis, world affairs and historical genealogy. Lectured at Mercer Senior University on world affairs and historical genealogy.

Polish forces under Hetmans Stanislaw Zolkiewski and Stanislaw Koniecpolski faced Crimean Tatars from Budjak, commanded by Khan Temir. The battle took place near Orynin in Podolia: after one day of battle, the Tatars bypassed the Poles, taking advantage of internal divisions within the Polish camp, and headed northwards, ransacking the southeastern corner of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. As a result of their raid, a number of towns and villages in Podole Voivodeship, Ruthenian Voivodeship, Braclaw Voivodeship and Volhynia Voivodeship were burned to the ground, and their residents taken into slavery. History Skirmish with Tatars, by Maksymilian Gierymski, 1867 The Polish government was aware of Ottoman plans for an invasion into the Commonwealth. Apart from Crimean and Budjak Tatars, in spring 1618, the main Turkish forces concentrated along the border. To face the invaders, a Polish army consisting of pospolite ruszenie, wojsko kwarciane and private units of magnates (a total of 15,000 soldiers) moved into the Ukraine. The army camped in Orynin near Kamieniec Podolski. Internal divisions within the Polish forces at Orynin had a negative effect. Magnates, who arrived with their private armies, did not want to obey the orders of the hetmans. As a result, instead of one large camp, three smaller camps were created: * the hetmans’ camp in the center (5130 soldiers), * Zasławski, Zbaraski and Lubomirski families on the right wing (5200 soldiers), * Zamoyski, Tarnowski, Ostrogski families, plus Zaporozhian Cossacks on the left wing (4800 soldiers). In mid-September 1618 the first Tatar forces crossed the border: a 5,000-strong unit under Khan Temir, which, after crossing the Prut, entered Podolia. Next was a 10,000-strong unit under Canibek Giray, which entered Pokucie. On 28 September the Polish camp was attacked by both Tatar armies. At first, the Tatars concentrated their efforts on the camp of magnate Tomasz Zamoyski. Hetman Stanislaw Zolkiewski, whose dislike of Zamoyski was well known, refrained from helping, saying aloud “First, he has to obey the old hetman, instead of giving orders”. Finally, Zamoyski was saved by Janusz Ostrogski and Krzysztof Zbaraski, who sent several hundred well-trained riflemen. On the next day, expecting a major battle, Polish forces united under Zolkiewski, and awaited the Tatar assault. Soon it turned out that the Tatars had left Orynin, and scattered over vast territories of the southeastern corner of the Commonwealth.

It resulted in the defeat of the rebels. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the gorals of Podhale frequently opposed local authorities, high taxes and the rule of the nobility: the best known of these revolts was the Kostka-Napierski Uprising, which took place in 1651. In late September 1669, a heavy cavalry unit of Jan Wielopolski (see Towarzysz pancerny, Choragiew (military unit)) came to Podhale to winter in the region. By December, the cavalrymen had found their lodgings in the area of Nowy Targ: according to the legal regulations, local residents were obliged to provide food to the soldiers and their officers. Jan Wielopolski sent his envoys to the Podhale villages to collect the food and tax money. In response, the residents of Czarny Dunajec and Dzianisz attacked Wielopolski’s men, disarmed them, beat them up and robbed them. The envoys were then taken to Nowy Targ, where the locals tried to explain their actions to the officers of the unit. Wielopolski ordered the arrest of the peasants’ envoys, which resulted in widespread anger among the gorals. Several hundred peasants approached Nowy Targ, but no skirmish took place. When authorities in Krakow found out about the riots, they decided to pacify the rebellion, so that it would not spread over to other regions. On 6 April 1670 Crown Hetman Jan Sobieski sent seven units (total of 1000 men), consisting mostly of foreign soldiers, to end the rebellion. Meanwhile the rebels had made thorough preparations for the expected action. They even created their own artillery, and divided their forces into several subunits. Apart from military preparations, the gorals sent a letter to King Michal Korybut Wisniowiecki, in which they explained their reasons. In May 1670, Sobieski’s forces clashed with the rebels near Nowy Targ. The exact date of the battle is unknown, but it happened most likely between 1 and 3 May 1670. Rebel forces were located around the city, to protect local villages and their residents. The skirmish did not last long, as experienced and well-armed Crown units managed to destroy the rebels. Survivors fled to a nearby forest. The battle ended the rebellion.  See also  * Lesko uprising  Sources  * Jacek Pędzimąż: Rzeczpospolita Podhalańska 1669/1670 (pol.).

During World War II, he served as a military pilot in the Kriegsmarine and a paratrooper in the Luftwaffe. After the war, he joined the newly founded West German Bundesmarine in 1956.  Personal life  Günter Luther was born in Bestwig on 17 March 1922, the son of a teacher who came from a family of artisans. He completed his secondary education and took his Abitur in 1939. In 1947 he married his wife Christel, who died in 1995. He died on 31 May 1997 in Kiel from a heart condition, whilst returning from a reunion at the wheel of his car.  Career  = World War II = After taking his Abitur, Luther joined the Kriegsmarine as an officer candidate in December 1939. He completed his nautical training on the training ship Gorch Fock and the battleship , and his military schooling at Naval Academy Mürwik and the naval artillery school in Kiel. His training also included half a year on the frontline on the minesweeper M-1 in Norwegian waters. He planned to train as a naval aviator. Luther volunteered to be a forward observer. To complete this training he had to exchange his Kriegesmarine uniform for that of the Luftwaffe. Luther was commissioned as a lieutenant (Leutnant) on 1 April 1942. He served as a pilot in the Coastal Aviation Squadrons 1/906 and 1/706. He flew 160 missions over the North Sea and Arctic Ocean. In May 1944, he was shot down with his aircraft over the sea. By then a first lieutenant (Oberleutnant), he volunteered to join the Luftwaffe's parachute troops, the Fallschirmjäger. As company commander in the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment (part of the 3rd Parachute Division), he fought in the Ardennes Offensive, in the Ruhr Pocket, and at the battle of Hürtgenwald. Luther became an American prisoner on 28 April 1945, and was freed in December 1945. = After the war = Luther earned his living in the aftermath of the war as a construction worker. This was followed by studying English at a university, which enabled him to take jobs as an interpreter and personnel manager for the American armed forces. From 1952 to 1956, he worked for the Agfa camera company, as a clerk and export group leader. = Bundeswehr = On 1 March 1956 Luther joined the newly founded Navy of West Germany's new military, the Bundeswehr, as a Kapitänleutnant (captain lieutenant). Initially, he considered serving in the German Air Force instead. He trained as a jet pilot for the Hawker Sea Hawk in the United Kingdom, and in September 1958 assumed command of the 1st Multipurpose Squadron of Naval Air Group 1. In 1960, he joined the higher command of the Navy with responsibility for the operational planning for naval aviation. In 1962 he was promoted to Korvettenkapitän (lieutenant commander) and made commander of the Navy's Flying Group 1. He continued to lead the squadron until 1968, receiving promotions to Fregattenkapitän (commander) and Kapitän zur See (captain). He then served as the head of the department for naval aviation at the Ministry of Defence. Luther successfully lobbied for the Navy to switch directly from the Starfighter to the Tornado, without the intermediate introduction of the Phantom that occurred in the air force. He himself trained as a Starfighter pilot and flew this type of aircraft regularly. Juan Carlos during the king's 1977 visit to German naval units at Bremerhaven With his promotion to Flottillenadmiral (flotilla admiral) on 1 October 1970 he became the youngest admiral of the German Navy at 48 years old, and was given the command of the Flotilla of Naval Aviation in Kiel- Holtenau.

In October 1972 he was promoted to Konteradmiral (rear admiral) and took up the position of chief of the Marineamt in Wilhelmshaven. On 1 April 1975 he was promoted to Vizeadmiral (vice admiral) and made Inspector of the Navy, i.e. the commander- in-chief of the German Navy. On 1 April 1980, Luther was promoted to the rank of Admiral, and took up the NATO post of Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR) at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

He was a pastor at Dartmouth, Great Missenden, Bradford, and Oxford as well as a teacher of classics. He became involved in debates on the ethics of slavery and a schism in the Baptist missionary community.Healing the Breach Benjamin Godwin and the Serampore 'Schism', N.P.Hancock, pp. 121-133, Baptist Quarterly, retrieved 25 July 2014 Godwin's writing's are an interesting source as he wrote 58 letters to his son to record his autobiography. Godwin's son and his grandson were Mayors of Bradford. Life Godwin was born on 10 October in Bath in 1785. His mother was about forty, but he was given the biblical name Benjamin because his father was 70 and a keen Baptist. His father had been married before and Benjamin had two adult siblings. His family were poor but he was sent to a Dame school until his education and upkeep was undertaken by the charity that ran the Bluecoat School in Bath This school was free and included the supply of uniforms.Bluecoat House , Listing, retrieved 28 July 2014 When Godwin finished school he was apprenticed to a shoemaker. Sailor H.M.S. Généreux (before the ship joined the Royal Navy and Godwin was in the crew.) Godwin was unhappy during his apprenticeship and this resulted in the fifteen-year-old running away with a friend on a ship bound for the Mediterranean. During the journey Godwin reported that he gained a close relationship with his god. Godwin jumped ship in Palermo and he was able to find work as a cabin boy bound for London. However, in Menorca the whole crew of his ship was press- ganged to crew HMS Le Généreux on Godwin's 16th birthday. Godwin became a Royal Navy sailor during the Napoleonic Wars until peace was declared. Godwin and the rest of crew were dismissed at Spithead on 27 July 1802. Cobbler and evangelist Godwin renewed his religious interests attending his family's Baptist Church with his, much older, half-sister. He also lodged with his half sister and her husband. He initially tried his hand at building with his brother-in-law before realising that his poor skills as a cobbler were superior to his ability to be a builder. In line with the Baptist faith, Godwin confirmed his faith when he was baptised with five other adults. Through the church he met Elizabeth Hall, but she refused to marry him until he could support her. \\"Betsy\\" Hall was unimpressed by Godwin delivering a sermon, until he had given three successful sermons in Bath. Others were also impressed and Godwin was offered a part-time position as an evangelist at Aylburton in Gloucestershire. Betsy was satisfied and they were married on 14 August 1806 and they were given the use of a cottage in Aylburton. Here they set up a home and they established church meetings. Godwin was inspired by his wife who he regarded as \\"the name of a powerful spell\\". However, despite Godwin's efforts they were reduced to eating potatoes and drinking water and their evangelical mission came under active opposition. They had to contend with merciless persecution including eggs being thrown. Hearing that he had been mischievously drafted into the militia, Godwin left Aylburton in 1807. Godwin was sure now that he wanted to be a minister and he was given a probationary year looking after a Cornish congregation at Chacewater. Here he was mentored by the nearby minister at Redruth. Betsy had to remain in Bath as the money was poor, but Godwin's was helping at the local school and completing his own education. It was Godwin who decided to leave when the year was completed to join his wife; and to become a minister. Minister Chipping Sodbury Baptist Church Godwin and Betsy spent a year at Chipping Sodbury, but he modestly refused an offer of becoming their pastor and took up another offer in Dartmouth where he could not only preach but also learn and teach. His ordination as a minister for Dartmouth was in 1812. Within his new congregation were Calvinistic Baptists who debated with Godwin and his Particular Baptist views. Godwin was a Baptist but gave his support to the evangelical ideas of Andrew Fuller and his Baptist Missionary Society. In Dartmouth, the Godwin's daughter, Mary, died of whooping cough, but they also had a son on 23 December 1814 who they named John Venimore Godwin. Godwin was ready to move. Godwin became a minister at Great Missenden where he wrote the memoirs of the pastor he had replaced.Memoirs of Richard Morris, late pastor of the Baptist church, Amersham He worked well with his Anglican counterpart raising money for missionary work, but he was disappointed to find that he was gaining some of his diminishing congregation. Godwin was paid well but the money failed to arrive on time. Tutor in Bradford Godwin arrived at his new position in Bradford in 1822. Here he was employed as a teacher of classics by William Steadman who led the Horton Academy in Bradford. The academy was training Baptist ministers and Godwin had initially turned down an offer to join the staff. Steadman had persevered as he was impressed by Godwin's first published sermon. Horton Academy was teaching adults and Godwin was concerned that his education was not sufficient. This proved not to be the case and he enthusiastically introduced new classes in maths, physics and geography. Godwin was however not preaching. Minister and tutor in Bradford In 1824 a new Sion Chapel was built in Bradford and Godwin became its minister on 31 October 1824 when he had the honour of Robert Hall giving a sermon. Godwin was pleased with the autonomy that this new position allowed him. The Wool Exchange Building in Bradford Godwin had now achieved his ambition. In 1830 Godwin launched himself on what he, and his wife, believed was their next challenge and that was to oppose slavery. After consulting the leading abolitionist James Stephen, he gave a series of well-attended talks at the newly built Bradford Exchange buildings. The lectures were given with an entrance fee of a shilling, but these were more than just a series of four plain lectures. Godwin had not only prepared transparencies he had also hired an artist to prepare large paintings that could illustrate the results of slavery. The young artist was called Thomas Richmond (and he may be this one). Godwin believed that the truth would make its own argument and he just needed to make sure that the information was presented and that it was accessible. Godwin wanted minds to be persuaded so he had Thomas Richmond prepare a second series of panels that illustrated the benefits of an egalitarian and multi- racial world that result from the abolition of slavery.Historical Perspectives on the Transatlantic Slave Trade in Bradford, Yorkshire Abolitionist Activity 1787-1865, James Gregory, Plymouth University, History & Art History, Academia.edu, retrieved 30 July 2014 { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#e6ebe7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" NO SLAVERY!

The new building was encouraged by Godwin and the new facility was designed to assist in adult education. It opened in 1832. Meanwhile, Godwin's abolitionist talks attracted wider attention and Zachary Macaulay who edited the Anti-Slavery Reporter invited him to arrange a series of talks around the country. The proposal was too ambitious, but Godwin did deliver the four illustrated lectures in York and Scarborough and the texts were summarised in the local papers. They were also published as a 170-page booklet in London and in Boston, Massachusetts (in 1836). Godwin arranged for a grand petition to be assembled in Yorkshire to persuade the British Anti- Slavery movement to be more active. John Hustler helped with travel expenses in order that he could lobby the next meeting of the British and Foreign Anti- Slavery Society in London. This was not successful but he did get to set forth his case with Zachary Macauley who led the organisation. Godwin also offered active assistance to Henry Brougham who was standing for parliament with an abolitionist agenda. Godwin wanted to help and he devised and funded posters that appealed to Yorkshire. Godwin knew that voters had supported the famous abolitionist William Wilberforce and he appealed to them to repeat their choice (and Godwin's) with the new candidate, Henry Brougham. Godwin's four lectures had become a book that was rapidly out of print in London. Copies were sent to peers and members of parliament and speakers and agents for anti- slavery looked on Godwin's book as a standard work. Reader's included the international activists George Thompson and John Scoble. Scoble was the secretary of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. By 1833 parliament was more democratic following the Reform Bill and the abolitionists wanted to ensure that their elected Members of Parliament voted to outlaw slavery. Petitions were again organised across Bradford and Godwin was one of the delegates sent to Exeter Hall in London to attend a meeting to organise the lobbying of parliament. The Slavery Abolition Act 1833 was passed and this made slavery illegal throughout the empire. On 24 April 1834 Godwin was awarded a testimonial dinner for his leadership during the anti-slavery campaign. He was given thanks and presents including tea sets and silver plate at a celebration that was attended by members from both houses of parliament. In 1834 the Liberal Bradford Observer newspaper was formed by selling shares to ninety people. The idea for the newspaper had come from an informal book club that Godwin attended. Godwin was one of several people who led this initiative. He proposed that the newspaper needed to aim for a general appeal which meant that it should not exclusively champion the Liberal cause but should attempt to demonstrate the common interests of both employer and employees. The newspaper was a success and Godwin organised a local group to support parliamentary reform and another group against slavery. When Godwin became dissatisfied and he resigned his position in 1836 there was a campaign to raise money to keep him in Bradford. Godwin relented, but within a few months he again felt that he was not enjoying the support he deserved. He had given up his role at the Horton Academy to concentrate on his ministry but still he heard criticism. Godwin resigned again and despite having nowhere to go he did not give in to those who asked him to retract again. Peacemaker in Liverpool Godwin was at a loose end and he became involved in a schism between the Baptist Missionary Society and the missionaries in charge of the mission to Serampore in India. Godwin and his wife moved to Liverpool where he was given £150 a year to be secretary to the committee set up to solve the problem. The latter organisers were known as the \\"Serampore Three\\". The ten- year-long schism arose because the mission at Serampore had been set up with a degree of independence from the main society. Following the death of long- serving and successful missionary society secretary Andrew Fuller it was decided to formalise the ownership. The new missionary society secretary required everything to be explained and documented. By this time the elder missionaries had in their ownership a number of buildings which they held in safe-keeping. Some saw that this could be interpreted as personal profit although no one made this accusation. The problem arose because these missionaries saw the request to transfer the ownership as a slur on their character. Godwin's role was employed in Liverpool to talk his way around Britain explaining the misunderstandings that were in circulation and to try to arrange a visit to the splintered missionaries in India. Godwin acted outside his remit and he organised a difficult two-day meeting in November 1836 which agreed a merger between the two splintered groups. With no schism Godwin had no job. With a feeling of great success he was again out of work. Minister in Oxford In 1838 Godwin became the Baptist minister in New Street Church in Oxford. In the March of that year he started the first of 58 autobiographical letters which he would continue to write until December 1855. During the 1840 World Anti-Slavery convention he prepared a paper on the ethics of slavery.Paper presented to the General Anti-Slavery Convention, Rev. Benjamin Godwin, 1840 The convention unanimously accepted his paper which condemned not only slavery but the religious leaders and communities who had failed to condemn the practise. The convention resolved to write to every religious leader to share this view. The convention called on every religious communities to eject any supporters of slavery from their midst.The Baptist Magazine, page 374, retrieved 24 July 2014 Godwin was included in a large commemorative painting of the 1840 convention where he can just be seen behind the head of Joseph Sturge who organised the conference. The painting now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery.The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840, Benjamin Robert Haydon, 1841, National Portrait Gallery, London, NPG599, Given by British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1880 Godwin was meeting and mixing with the international anti-slavery activists. He was invited to meet French abolitionists in Paris the following year. Godwin resigned his Oxford position in 1845 due to his failing health and the following year he and his wife returned to Bradford. They lived in a house that his son had organised. In 1947 his son was married. Godwin continued to work for the Baptist Missionary Society as well as lecturing at Horton College again in 1850. One of his latter successes was to become President of Bradford's Ragged School which opened with seven pupils in 1854. Another late honour was to be president of a newly formed Bradford female Anti-Slavery Society with his wife as secretary in 1856 and a committee of 24 women. On 23 December 1855, on his son's birthday, Godwin presented to his son 58 autobiographic letters which he had agreed to write nearly twenty years before. These letters have been evaluated academically and they are considered to be a good source on Godwin's life and the debates and affairs that he was involved with. Godwin died in 1871.

She is recognized for her works where visual artifacts are used as the means for telling intricate, idiosyncratic, compelling stories. Her work has been on exhibit in the leading museums, including the National Centre for Contemporary Arts in her native Moscow, and deCordova Museum in Lincoln, Massacuhsetts. Rozenman lives in Boston and works in Somerville, Massachusetts. Early life and education Rozenman was born in Moscow, Russia (then Soviet Union). Her early influences included an art school for gifted child artists at the Pushkin Museum - at that time the only venue for Western art shows in Moscow, both ancient and modern. Nina N. Kofman, an art educator, ran an art school for very young children at the museum, actively using its collection as a study aide. Several of Rozenman's works from that period have been shown at the international shows of children's art (in Russia, Japan, India, and Finland, among others). Later on, Rozenman studied with several dissident artists who went on to become famous in the West, including Grisha Bruskin. When Rozenman's family emigrated from Russia to the US in 1989, she continued her art education there, participating in the Studio Semester in New York Program at SUNY Empire State College (she graduated in 1995), and proceeding to Boston, where she earned her MFA from the School of Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University in 1997.  Career  Rozenman worked in many places in the US, including the East Coast (Washington, New York City, and Boston), West Coast (Los Angeles), and Mid- West (East Lansing, Michigan, and Saint Paul, Minnesota), striving to capture her life experience, and developing a unique, highly personal way of expressing the American reality of today. She straddles the distinctly European world with recognizable Russian and Jewish influences (mostly of Marc Chagall, whose first wife, Bella Chagall, frequently depicted as a flying female figure in his early paintings, is Rozenman's great-aunt) and the uniquely American experience of freedom and thirst for deeper meaning of life interwoven with art. Today, Rozenman is a core member of the Fountain Street Gallery.  Paintings  Over three decades, starting as a child artist, Rozenman went through several periods, capturing life experiences in images. They reflect, on the one hand, her highly personal accounts of love, loss, and search for beauty, and on the other hand—the environments of Russia, California, New York City, Boston, Midwest, and Europe. In one of her recent series of paintings, called Transplanted, Rozenman superimposes her own images with iconic works of European and American artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, Breugel, Turner, Monet, Matisse and Diebenkorn. This series, a part of which has been on display in Boston in 2013, represents the artist's search for a personal place in the story of the world art.  Graphics  Rozenman started working on small graphics format in her teens, selling art from the sidewalks of Moscow busy Arbat Street thoroughfare. She returned to this form recently, partly for the purposes of book illustration.  Book illustration  Rozenman illustrated several books, including \\"Two Hands Clapping\\" a collaborative book of drawings with the British poet Grace Andreacchi (Andromache Books, London, 2009). Grace Andreacchi also published the video Two Hands Clapping on YouTube. She has recently finished illustrating \\"Sticky Leaves\\" by Mikhail Epstein, a Russian-American literary theorist and critical thinker.  Art school  Since 2012, Rozenman has been running a popular art school with classes for children and adults in Allston, and later in Somerville, Massachusetts, offering classes, seminars, and workshops in experimental and classical painting and drawing.

It was released on September 23, 2014, and features 20 new songs. The album is promoted by a new band touring under the Tweedy name. Background and recording After producing albums for Low, White Denim, and Mavis Staples, Jeff Tweedy set out to create a solo album. From the start, the album was intended to be more than simply acoustic guitar and vocals. While recording demos, Tweedy's son Spencer joined him to record drums and \\"[help] the songs take shape\\". Tweedy had most previously worked with his son when they both appeared on the split single for the \\"Songs For Slim\\" series in 2013. Sukierae was completed mostly by the two of them, but also features additional vocals by Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig of the band Lucius, as well as keyboards by Scott McCaughey. In an interview with The Atlantic, Tweedy spoke about the creative process of making the album and why he decided to release it as a solo album instead of a new Wilco album: \\"I like to include elements of early recordings on the finished records when I can. Almost every song on Sukierae has an original demo element somewhere in there. A lot of my iPhone acoustic demos became the basic tracks we overdubbed to, and they’re still there in the finished record. (That’s why we listed the iPhone as an instrument in the track notes.) The song “I’ll Sing It” includes a cassette recording from a \\"Being There\\" -era demo of that song. Stuff lies around forever, and for this record it was fun to make some use of it. \\"It’s a totally different process working with an ensemble. Wilco is a six-piece band, and its members have varying degrees of interest in the finishing touches. As a collective, we always gravitate towards something much more fully realized—and that’s the pleasure of it. Working on my own, I always hope to abandon something before I feel like I’ve made all of the choices that could be made. If I commit too much to one approach, I mourn all the choices that weren’t made when I get to that point. I think that’s one way Sukierae would have been different if it had been recorded by Wilco. I can still hear possible overdubs on every track, I can still hear things I could have done, and that’s the most enjoyable part for me. It’s the same thing I love about Daniel Johnston’s music—all that unrealized potential.\\" Jeff Tweedy had mentioned that he had 90 new songs that he had written, but not recorded, when interviewed in 2013 about the prospect of a new Wilco album. Material for a new album has since been recorded, but so far has not been released. In the meantime, all members of the band have released or appeared on numerous albums, from one-off collaborations, to their more closely related projects of The Autumn Defense and The Nels Cline Singers. In an interview with The Guardian Tweedy shared his thoughts on the Album as a format in 2014. He also elaborated on the creative process of sequencing Sukierae as a double album: \\"I’ve just made a double album, Sukierae, which has two distinct discs. I understand in this day and age there might not be many people who will listen to it that way, but it doesn’t matter – because I want to listen that way. I’m not a curmudgeon, a luddite or anti-modern technology doomsayer. I just want to listen to the album and have a feeling that one part, has ended, and now I can take a little breather before I listen to the second part. Or I can listen to the second part another time. It’s a double record on vinyl, so there are three breaks like that. I wanted it to have different identities artistically and the album format allows me to do that.\\" \\"Working toward Sukierae I must have written or recorded around 90 songs. I was pretty sold on the idea of two really good-sounding vinyl sides, but no matter how we tried to sequence the songs, we kept getting halfway into another record. Then, in the last couple of weeks of recording, I had this burst and recorded five new songs, which all started to feel like part of a whole other record. So, we sequenced it as disc one and disc two. The album gets simpler and softer and bolder at the same time. The idea is that as it winds down it gets clearer.\\" \\"These are key tracks but deliberately placed to be heard in the middle of the album. Listening to it all at once is a leap of faith, but I know that the idea of listening to a work all the way through and being taken along for the whole ride is becoming antiquated for a lot of people.\\" The album will be released through dBpm Records, a record label founded by the members of Wilco in 2011. This is the third album release by the label, following The Whole Love and its corresponding deluxe edition release. Touring band Jeff and Spencer Tweedy rounded out the project into a full band in order to tour, adding Jim Elkington as an additional guitarist, bassist Darin Gray, and keyboardist/guitarist Liam Cunningham. The band first played at the Detroit Masonic Temple on June 5, where they played 13 of the songs from the new album. During a Tweedy show, the first half features the full band playing many of the songs from Sukierae, exclusively. So far, the band has not played \\"I'll Sing It\\" the first single from the album. For the second half, Jeff Tweedy plays a solo acoustic set. At this point, he does not play additional material from Sukierae, but instead draws from songs from his careers in Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, along with covers and songs from other projects. These acoustic sets are effectively truncated versions of the solo acoustic performances that Jeff Tweedy has done concurrently throughout his tenure in Wilco. Promotion On May 18, 2014 it was announced that Jeff Tweedy would be releasing a solo album in September, and that he would also begin a solo tour. It was not until June 4 that the nature of the band was revealed, along with its name, number of songs, and a stream for the song \\"I'll Sing It\\". This song was named the first single from the forthcoming album. \\"Summer Noon\\" followed in the form of a music video, and on July 8, it was released as part of the soundtrack to the Richard Linklater film Boyhood. Third was \\"Wait For Love\\", previewed both in its album form, and as a video of a solo acoustic performance. The song \\"Diamond Light, Pt. 1\\" was premiered on Stereogum as a SoundCloud stream, and along with \\"Diamond Light, Pt. 2\\" was released on a 10\\" vinyl record on June 17. While \\"Diamond Light, Pt. 1\\" would go on to appear on Sukierae, \\"Diamond Light, Pt. 2\\" only appears on this release. This release was limited to 2,000 copies and was pressed on virgin \\"clear/smoke\\" vinyl. Both sides of the record end with a locked groove (uncommon for 10\\" records). Lastly, the song Fake Fur Coat was premiered on VH1 music on July 24. On July 24, Tweedy performed \\"Summer Noon\\" and \\"High As Hello\\" on The Tonight Show.

It is found in areas with polluted water sources, and is prevalent in places such as Malaysia, India, and Bangladesh, but more recently has made its way to Turkey, Australia, and North America. This amoeba is said to rarely infect humans, but recently this has changed. It is in question as to whether it is pathogenic or not. Despite some sources stating this is a free living amoeba, various studies worldwide have shown it contains the ability to infect humans, with some cases of pathogenic potential being reported. Some of the symptoms that often occur are diarrhea, weight loss, bloody stool, and abdominal pain. The first known human infection also known as the \\"Laredo strain\\" of Entamoebic mushkovskii was in Laredo, Texas in 1991, although it was first described by a man named Tshalaia in 1941 in Moscow, Russia. It is known to affect people of all ages and genders. Symptoms E. moshkovskii has been identified in occasionally causing diarrhea with similar severity, duration, and age of onset to diarrhea acquired from E. histolytica. In murine models of mice, E. moshkovskii caused diarrhea, weight loss, and colitis. When children in Bangladesh were tested for intestinal issues, E. moshkovskii infection was associated with diarrhea. Characteristics The exact characteristics of Entamoeba moshkovskii are \\"indistinguishable\\" from that of Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar unless a polymerase chain reaction test is done. This is the only circumstance in which you can distinguish between the three of them. Transmission Entamoeba moshkovskii is transmitted by contact or ingestion of any unclean water sources. It is known to be found in areas with polluted water such as brackish coastal pools, river line sediments, and originally sewage. Risk factors Risk factors include the use or ingestion of polluted sources of water. Swimming in any areas with polluted water is also a risk. Most of the cases reported are in rural areas. Diagnosis Diagnosis with Entamoeba moshkovskii is difficult to do until symptoms appear. The amoeba will form cysts and trophozoites in the gastrointestinal tract. This can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea. Once symptoms start to occur, the standard means of diagnosing are a series of stool sample examinations and serological testing, and, if necessary, a colonoscopy or a biopsy of intestinal amebic legions or draining of liver abscesses (if present). They are checking to see if there is any indication of the amoeba within the feces. In order to do this, several stool smears must be made and carefully observed under the microscope. At this point, if the tests are positive, it will usually come down to three choices for a diagnosis. The choices being Entamoeba moshkovskii, Entamoeba histolytica, or Entamoeba dispar. These three choices are, in the view of the microscope, \\"indistinguishable\\". This is the point where a doctor makes the call for what is most common (Entamoeba histolytica) or something more rare (Entamoeba mushkovskii). If they choose to go with what is common, they will treat with \\"entamoebic chemotherapy\\". If the decision to treat amoebiasis is made, symptomatic or not, successful results may be reached using luminal agents. If the choice is to further examine the diagnosis, they will have to do a polymerase chain reaction. This is the only way to differentiate between the three amoebas and effectively diagnose. Treatment Although treatments are still being researched, there are some ways to treat Entamoebic moshkovskii. Since this particular amoeba is resistant to emitin, they typically treat using an anti-protozoan or antiamoebic therapy. In tropical regions, anyone with cysts in their stool is treated with an anti-protozoan. According to health.harvard.edu, gastrointestinal amoebiasis is treated with nitroimidazole drugs, given orally or intravenously, to clear amoebas found within the blood, intestine, and liver. Luminal drugs are used to eliminate cysts found within the liver. Nitroimidazole and luminal drugs are paired together when gastrointestinal symptoms caused by amoebiasis are present.https://www.health.harvard.edu/digestive-health/gastrointestinal- amebiasis Prevention Preventive methods are to only utilize clean water sources – whether it be for ingestion, cleaning, or recreation – and good hygiene such as hand-washing.

Life His parents were merchants and he was originally destined for a career in business. The person he was apprenticed to, however, turned out to be the uncle of the landscape painter , who discovered Stallaert's true ambitions and arranged for him to take lessons in the workshop of François-Joseph Navez. After Stallaert's father died, he openly declared his intention to be a painter. In 1839, he enrolled at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts and, in 1841, officially became a student of Navez. In 1847, he was awarded the Prix de RomeRégion de Bruxelles-Capitale: Brief biographical sketch and stayed in Italy until 1852. While there, he became acquainted with Alexandre Cabanel and was influenced by Raphael. Upon his return, his mentor Navez exerted some influence to obtain a contract for him to do a painting for the Brussels Town Hall (\\"The Death of Everard 't Serclaes\\"). That same year, he became Director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Tournai. In 1865, he was selected to be the first teacher of \\"Drawing and Painting from Nature\\" at the Brussels Academy and held several important positions there over the next thirty years. In 1895, following the death of Jean-François Portaels, he became Acting Director. Three months later, on the basis of seniority, he became Director. His term of office expired in 1898and he was succeeded by the sculptor Charles van der Stappen. Due to an action by the City Council, setting seventy as a mandatory retirement age, Stallaert left the school and received a pension in 1900.

Flayderman's guide to antique American firearms-- and their values (9th ed.). Iola, WI: Gun Digest. p. 264John Walter, Rifles of the World, p. 516, 2006 They were one of the first rifles to use rimfire metallic cartridges. The rifles were initially made in .22, .32, .38, and .44 rimfire. Centerfire cartridges were added later, and some rifles were capable of firing rimfire or centerfire cartridges, by altering an adjustment on the hammer. History of the rifle By 1859, there were a number of single-shot breech-loading rifles available to the American military and public. These included the Sharps rifle (1848), the Smith carbine (1857), and others. Those most suitable for military use were loaded through the breech, but required a separate percussion cap to ignite the cartridge. Copper rimfire cartridges which contained their own primer were introduced just prior to the American Civil War. Only a few manufacturers came out with guns which could use this ammunition; these included the Henry repeating rifle (cartridge introduced in 1860), Spencer repeating rifle, Maynard carbine, Frank Wesson rifles, and Ballard rifles. The .44 caliber Frank Wesson and Ballard rifles could use the same cartridge as each other, and these cartridges were very close in size to the .44 Henry rimfire. The Frank Wesson rifle was the first breech-loading rifle designed for these metallic cartridges.American Artisan and Illustrated Journal of Popular Science, Nov 28, 1866, p. 52,53 Frank Wesson (1828-1899) and N.S.

The 1862 patent added the use of a slotted link to stop the barrel from pivoting too far, which made the gun much easier and quicker to load. The carbine with a 24-inch barrel weighed only 6 pounds, low weight being desirable in a weapon to be carried by cavalry. The 28 and 34 inch barrel models weighing 7 and 8 pounds respectively.D. Appleton and Company (1865). The American Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events of the Year 1864: Volume 4. New York. p. 639 By 1866, twenty thousand Frank Wesson rifles had been made, of which 8,000 were military. =Shooting Trials= On October 7, 1863, at the Missouri State Fair, in a contest between three infantry companies, shots fired from a Wesson rifle hit a man-sized target 45 times out of 100, at a distance of 300 yards.H.W.S. Cleveland, Hints to Riflemen, New York, (1864) pp. 151,152 In a trial at St. Louis, competing against other rifles, a man-sized target was hit 56 times out of 100, the second best rifle scoring 10 of 100. At the Massachusetts State trial of breech-loading weapons, at Readville, 20 shots in a row hit a target at 200 yards, and 50 shots were fired in 4 minutes.Cleveland, p. 152 A Dr. I.J. Wetherbee, of Boston, shot a string of 12 shots at 110 yards, with telescopic sights, with a 34-inch barreled breech-loading rifle. His target is shown here.Cleveland, p. 150 Target shot by I.J. Wetherbee, at 110 yards, with telescopic sights, using a Two-Trigger (tip-up) Frank Wesson rifle. The rifle was also tested at Leavenworth, Kansas, and by General P.F. Robinson, Kentucky.Parker Gillmore; Gun, Rod and Saddle: Personal Experiences, New York (1869), p. 285 Use during the American Civil War Between 3000 and 4000 of these carbines were used by the military during the war. Over 2000 Wesson rifles were sold to militia in the states of Kentucky and Illinois.Walter, John. Rifles of the World, 2006 44 caliber carbines were purchased by individuals and state governments during the Civil War. Many of these weapons were sold through a company called Kittredge & Co, of Cincinnati, Ohio, who have their name stamped on the barrel of these weapons. In July 1862, Brigadier-General J. T. Boyle of Kentucky complained about Gallagher guns, calling them 'worthless'. He stated that 'They snap often, the cartridge hangs in after firing; difficult to get the exploded cartridges out often with screw-driver; men throw them away and take musket or any other arm. They are unquestionably worthless.' He then requested 'Sharps, Wessons, Ballards, or any other kind of carbine.' He mentioned that Wesson carbines can be had for $25 or less from Cincinnati.Official Records, Vol. 16, p. 750 The Wesson carbine was used primarily by the Union armies, as the Confederacy did not manufacture rim fire cartridges. However, in November 1862, the Confederacy did arrange for the smuggling of 10 Wesson rifles, and 5,000 cartridges to Texas, via Cuba. These rifles were smuggled by Harris Hoyt, who was brought to trial in January 1865. The rifles at that time cost $25 each, the cartridges $11 per thousand.United States. Senate Documents, Otherwise Publ. as Public Documents and Executive ..., (1870-1871) pp. 49, 87 Wesson carbines were in use at battle of Gettysburg in 1863,Edward G. Longacre, The Cavalry at Gettysburg: A Tactical Study of Mounted Operations During the Civil War's Pivotal Campaign, 9 June-14 July 1863, Associated University Presses, (1986) p. 60 and at the battle of Westport in 1864. In January 1863, the state of Ohio had 150 Wesson carbines on hand. At that time, they also had 54,000 Wesson cartridges. The 11th Cavalry regiment was issued 100 Wesson carbines and 400 Spencer repeating rifles.Ohio, Executive Documents, Annual Reports made to the Governor of the State of Ohio for the year 1863, Part 2 (1864) pp. 603, 607 The states of Kentucky and Illinois purchased 2000 for their state militias. In July 1863, in a letter to Major S.B. Shaw, St. Louis, Mo, T.F. Robinson, Quartermaster- General of Kentucky reported that portions of two Kentucky regiments had been armed with the \\"Wesson Cartridge Rifle\\", were pleased with it, and would not exchange it for any other rifle.New York Times, July 11, 1863 Following the Lawrence Massacre on August 21, 1863, the surviving men formed a rifle company, using Wesson rifles. These weapons, along with their revolvers were carried at all times.Edward E. Leslie, Devil Knows How to Ride: The True Story of William Clarke Quantrill and His Confederate Raiders, Random House, Inc, New York (1996) Kentucky purchased 1366 Wesson carbines, Indiana purchased 760 for their cavalry, from B.

Terrell, Indiana in the War of the Rebellion, Indiana Adjutant General's Office (1869), p. 177, 436 and the numbers for Ohio, Kansas and Missouri are not known. Individual soldiers of Kansas and Missouri purchased an unknown number of these rifles. Missouri had over 690 in their regimental armories in 1864.McAulay, John D, Carbines of the US Cavalry 1861-1905, PIONEER PRESS, Union City, TN, 1997, pp. 119-122 In 1862, the 7th Kentucky Cavalry was issued 500 Wesson carbines at a price of $25 each.OFFICIAL RECORDS: Series 1, vol 16, Part 2 (Morgan's First Kentucky Raid, Perryville Campaign) p. 230 In the summer of 1863, individuals from the 11th Regiment, 1st Battalion, Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, purchased 200 Wesson rifles. Companies I and L were also issued Wesson rifles by the state.http://11thohiocavalry.com/Uniforms___Equipment.html At least 300 individuals from the 5th Missouri State Militia (MSM) Cavalry purchased this weapon during the war, some of which were used during Price's Raid.Annual Report of the Adjutant General of Missouri for the year ending December 31, 1865, Missouri Office of the Adjutant General, (1866), page 486 In that raid, the men of the 5th were placed on specific parts of the battlefield in order to take advantage of their more rapid rate of fire. Troopers from the 3rd MSM also carried Wesson carbines.Douglas L. Gifford, The Battle of Pilot Knob Staff Ride and Battlefield Tour Guide, Winfield, Missouri, (2003) p. 10 At that time, the cost of this carbine was $40 each.Charles G. Worman, Gunsmoke and Saddle Leather: Firearms in the Nineteenth-century American West (2005), University of New Mexico Press, p. 55 The 48th Illinois Infantry carried an unknown number of Wesson carbines, and ran out of ammunition for these rifles during the Battle of Ezra Church (part of the Atlanta campaign) on July 28, 1864. During that battle, some regiments expended 100 bullets per soldier.James B. Swan, Chicago's Irish Legion: The 90th Illinois Volunteers in the Civil War, Southern Illinois University (2009), p. 154The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1, vol 38, Part 3 (The Atlanta Campaign), p. 344 At the Battle of Westport, also during Price's Raid, some men of the 19th Kansas State Militia carried this rifle. =Advantages of rimfire breech-loading rifles= The primary advantages of rimfire breech-loading rifles during the American Civil War were that the rifle could be loaded easily, that the ammunition was self-contained, and that the ammunition was relatively weather-proof. Most rifles used during the American Civil War were muzzle loading rifles. To load these rifles, powder would be poured into the muzzle, a patch would be placed around the ball or Minie ball, the ball would be forced down the barrel using a ramrod, the ramrod would be replaced, a percussion cap would be pressed onto a nipple on the rifle, and the hammer would be drawn back. To load these rifles quickly, it was necessary for the soldier to stand. This made these rifles difficult to use for cavalry, which required that the cavalry typically be dismounted if using muzzle loading rifles.Lt. Col B. F. Lazear, Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Serial 83 p. 0361 Chapter LIII. Price's Missouri Expedition, 1891 Breech loading rifles, on the other hand, could be loaded while mounted on horseback. Most rifles, including some that were breech-loading, also used a percussion cap, which required that the soldier carry percussion caps in addition to other ammunition requirements. These requirements would have been powder, bullets, patches, and percussion caps. A soldier using a Frank Wesson or Henry rifle would have only needed to carry cartridges. For rifles which used separate ball and powder, the ball and powder would be contained in a paper cartridge. In wet weather, these cartridges were easily damaged. The copper cartridges used by Henry, Wesson, Ballard and others tolerated moisture better, and were more impervious to wet conditions. Sales and use following the American Civil War Frank Wesson rifles continued to be made until 1888. On November 21, 1877, Buffalo Bill, following one of his Wild West shows, competed with Lincoln C. Daniels, a marksman. Both competitors were using new Wesson rifles. Other members in his troupe also used Wesson rifles. The competition was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, where the Wesson factory was located.Sandra Sagala, Buffalo Bill on Stage, University of New Mexico Press In 1867, the War Department authorized sale of many weapons, including 19,551 weapons at the Leavenworth arsenal in Kansas. This sale included Wesson carbines, as well as many other revolvers, rifles and carbines of the period (29 different types).United States, Reports of Committees: 30th Congress, 1st Session - 48th Congress, 2nd Session, Washington Government Printing Office (1872), p. 64 In 1869, the War Department purchased far fewer weapons of all kinds than it had in the Civil War. Only three Frank Wesson carbines were purchased during the year, for $20 each. At the same time, it purchased, or had modified 13,098 Sharps carbines (listed as 'Sharps carbines, altered'), at approximately $4 each.United States, Senate Documents, Otherwise Published as Public Documents and Executive Documents, 14th Congress, 1st Session-48th Congress, 2nd Session and Special Session (1870). See p. 4 of Document 17 As late as 1873, Indiana still had 716 Kittredge marked Wesson carbines in their armory.Report Adjutant General the State of Indiana Year Ending December 31, 1873, Indianapolis (1874) p. 2 In June 1873, Kentucky had 314 of these carbines,Kentucky Public Documents, Volume 1 (1873) p. 27 and in August 1875, had 298 of these rifles in good condition, erroneously recorded as 'Smith & Wesson rifles, calibre .44', though they were Wesson carbines. These rifles were stored in their state arsenal.Annual Report of the Treasurer of the State of Kentucky from October 11th, 1874 to October 10th, 1875, p. 18 Bullets from a Frank Wesson rifle were found at the Hembrillo Battlefield (1880), New Mexico;Laumbach, Karl W, 'Hembrillo, an Apache battlefield of the Victorio war: the archaeology and history of the Hembrillo battlefield', 2000 and at the Battle of Little Big Horn (1876), Montana.Wagner, Frederic C.

The first Kulindadromeus fossil was found in Russia. Its feather- like integument is evidence for protofeathers being basal to Ornithischia and possibly Dinosauria as a whole, rather than just to Coelurosauria, as previously suspected. Description Reconstructed skeleton Like other early neornithischians, Kulindadromeus was a bipedal runner, approximately 1.5 meters in length. It had a short head, short forelimbs, long hindlimbs and a long tail. The describers of Kulindadromeus established some distinguishing traits. The front ascending branch of the maxilla is much lower than the rear ascending branch. The fenestra maxillaris is larger than the antorbital fenestra, the usually more extensive skull opening in the snout side. The branch of the jugal towards the postorbital is notched. The postorbital has a rear branch that is vertically expanded. The rear blade of the ilium is slender in side view. The second, third and fourth metatarsals have deep grooves for the tendons of the extensor muscles. Various specimens of Kulindadromeus show large parts of its integument. This includes imbricated rows of scales on top of its tail and also a covering of scales branching into feather-like structures, which until its discovery were thought to be exclusive to the Theropoda, of the saurischian line. The feather remains discovered are of three types, adding a level of complexity to the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs. The first type consists of hair-like filaments covering the trunk, neck and head. These are up to three centimetres long and resemble the stage 1 \\"dino-fuzz\\" already known from theropods like Sinosauropteryx. The second type is represented by groups of six or seven downwards-projecting filaments up to 1.5 centimetres long, originating from a base plate. These are present on the upper arm and thigh. They resemble the type 3 feathers of theropods. The base plates are ordered in a hexagonal pattern but do not touch each other. The third type is unique. It was found on the upper lower legs and consists of bundles of six or seven ribbon-like structures, up to two centimetres long. Each ribbon is constructed from about ten parallel filaments up to 0.1 millimetres wide. There are also three types of scales. Overlapping hexagonal scales, up to 3.5 millimetres in diameter, are present on the lower shins. Small round non-overlapping scales, less than one millimetre in cross-section, cover the hands, ankles and feet. The top of the tail is covered by five longitudinal rows of arched rectangular scales, measuring up to one by two centimetres. With these scales the trailing edge of each scale slightly overlaps the front edge of the scale behind it. In the middle, to the contrary, a small spur projects forward, covering the trailing edge of the preceding scale. This way an imbricated row is formed. The scale surface is smooth and the thickness is limited, less than 0.1 millimetres. The authors considered it unlikely these structures were ossified scutes or osteoderms. Towards the rear of the tail, the scales become smaller and more rounded; they then no longer overlap each other. Discovery and naming Fossil elements In 2014, the type species Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus was named and described by Pascal Godefroit, Sofia Sinitsa, Danielle Dhouailly, Yuri Bolotsky, Alexander Sizov, Maria McNamara, Michael Benton, and Paul Spagna. The generic name is derived from the Kulinda sites and Classical Greek δρομεύς, dromeus, \\"runner\\". The specific name refers to the Zabaykalsky Krai. The holotype, INREC K3/109, was found in a layer of the Ukureyskaya Formation dating from the Middle to Late Jurassic, Bajocian-Tithonian. It consists of a partial skull with lower jaws. The volcanic ash layers of the formation form a Konservat-Lagerstätte with an exceptional preservation. Since 2010, the area has brought forth considerable amounts of additional fossil material, including subadult and juvenile individuals. In 2014, based on fossils from this material, the genera Kulindapteryx and Daurosaurus were named. (in Russian; English translation published in ) According to Godefroit, this publication was based on stolen specimens, and should be ignored.Creisler, B. 2014. Re: Kulindapteryx and Daurosaurus, new hypsilophodont ornithopods from Upper Jurassic of Siberia, Russia. Message to the Dinosaur Mailing List, 5 Jul 2014. Accessed online 27 Jul 2016, http://dml.cmnh.org/2014Jul/msg00028.html The material consists of six skulls,Dan Vergano, 2014, \\"Siberian Discovery Suggests Almost All Dinosaurs Were Feathered\\", National Geographic Daily News http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/07/140724-feathered-siberia- dinosaur-scales-science/ and hundreds of disarticulated skeletons found in two bone beds. Each skeletal element shows a single morphotype and Godefroit et al. concluded, contrary to the earlier publication, that the bone beds are monospecific, containing but a single species. Classification Restoration According to a cladistic analysis performed by the describing authors, Kulindadromeus is a basal member of the Neornithischia, placed just above Hexinlusaurus in the evolutionary tree. It is the sister species of the Cerapoda. =Implications= Godefroit et al. concluded that the filaments earlier reported in Ornithischia, with Psittacosaurus and Tianyulong, could be homologous to the \\"protofeathers\\" found in non-avian theropods. With known feather-like structures in pterosaurs, there is evidence for it being basal to Ornithodira. An attempt to reconstruct the likely ancestral state of dinosaurs found it to be likely that both Ornithodira and Dinosauria were ancestrally scaly, however, this result was only obtained when assuming that early pterosaurs were scaly. Under the assumption that early pterosaurs had filamentous integument, it became much more likely that Ornithodira and Dinosauria were ancestrally filamentous.

Today this virus is studied in mice in an attempt to develop treatments for the highly pathogenic Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus. Characteristics The Hazara orthonairovirus is part of the genus Orthonairovirus of the Bunyavirales order of viruses, which are an order of enveloped negative-stranded RNA viruses with a genome split into three parts—Small (S), Middle (M) and Large (L). The L RNA segment encodes an RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), the M RNA segment encodes two surface glycoproteins (Gc and Gn), and the S RNA segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N). The three genomic RNA segments are encapsidated by copies of the N protein in the form of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. The N protein is the most abundant viral protein in Bunyaviridae virus particles and infected cells and, therefore, the main target in many serological and molecular diagnostics. Transmission Hazara orthonairovirus is spread by the Ixodes redikorzevi tick. The tick is commonly found on an alpine vole inhabiting the Hazara District of Pakistan. Signs and symptoms Hazara orthonairovirus does not cause disease or symptoms in humans. In laboratory mice, symptoms can mirror those of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus. Diagnosis Diagnosis in rodents is made by detecting Hazara orthonairovirus antibodies in the serum. Clinical importance Hazara virus is in the same Nairovirus serogroup as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV), and has similar disease progression to that seen in Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) infections in suckling mice and in the interferon receptor knockout mouse model This indicates that Hazara orthonairovirus could represent a valid model for CCHFV infection. This finding is particularly important because using the Hazara orthonairovirus (biosafety level 2) as a model allows scientists to investigate this serogroup of viruses for the development of antivirals, without having to work in a biosafety level 4 environment, which is the highest available level of biosecurity, and is mandatory when working with intact CCHFV. While CCHFV is the most important human pathogen in this serogroup, Hazara research is potentially useful in the development of antiviral medications for all viruses in the genus Nairovirus.

Characteristics L. collinoides is found in fermenting apple juice or cider. It is found more frequently in factories where sulfur dioxide is either used in small quantities or not at all.Carr, J. G., and Patricia A. Davies. \\"The ecology and classification of strains of Lactobacillus collinoides nov. spec.: a bacterium commonly found in fermenting apple juice.\\" Journal of Applied Bacteriology 35.3 (1972): 463-471. It is characterized by it ability to produce lactic acid as a by-product of glucose metabolism. Sugars are necessary for growth of L. collinoides and fructose is preferred to glucose. When L. collinoides was grown with fructose or glucose as the lone carbon- source, it produced lactic acid, acetic acid and ethanol. When glycerol was present, lactic acid production was lower than expected and production of acetic acid and ethanol was higher than expected.Claisse, Olivier, and Aline Lonvaud-Funel. \\"Assimilation of glycerol by a strain of Lactobacillus collinoides isolated from cider.\\" Food microbiology 17.5 (2000): 513-519. L. collinoides is also responsible for converting glycerol to 3-hydroxy- propionaldehyde (3 HPA) which is a precursor of acrolein, which spoils product quality by conferring a bitter taste. The presence of such complex acids in fruit may indicate that more preservatives are needed to prevent spoilage.Stead, D. \\"The effect of chlorogenic, gallic and quinic acids on the growth of spoilage strains of Lactobacillus collinoides and Lactobacillus brevis.\\" Letters in Applied Microbiology 18.2 (1994): 112-114.

This bacteria was originally discovered in 1905 by an Austrian biologist named Schardinger and thought to be a bacillus. Characteristics Paenibacillus macerans is a part of the family Paenibacillaceae which are facultative anaerobes. It is gram-variable, being gram-positive or gram-negative rods. Does not have a capsule and has peritrichous flagella for movement. It does form ellipsoidal, terminal, or subterminal spores which may last in the soil for many years. Growth conditions P. macerans can be grown in the lab on a nutrient agar with a slightly acidic pH around 5. Optimal growth temperature is 30 °C. No growth in 5% NaCl. Metabolic capabilities P. macerans has been shown to have some of the broadest metabolic capabilities of any of the genus Paenibacillus. It is able to ferment hexoses, deoxyhexoses, pentoses, cellulose, hemicellulose and glycerol under anaerobic conditions. The high fermentation rates of glycerol makes this an important organism in the study of fuel and chemical production. P. Macerans also produces a significant amount of histamines which may cause allergies in some individuals if ingested. This bacterium is a facultative anaerobe capable of nitrogen fixation so in the absence of oxygen it is able to convert nitrogen gas to ammonia which is more easily used by plants. Ecology P. macerans is usually found in soil and plant materials but has also been identified in blood cultures of infants with infection. The bacterium is not normally pathogenic in humans but could cause allergies as a result of its histamine producing properties.

Lancaster was one of three children of Edgar Sr. (1889–1983), and the former Willie Butler (1897–1983) of Madison Parish; the couple died a month apart. He graduated from Tallulah High School, now Madison High School. He played football on the Tallulah Class B winning state team in 1935. He then graduated from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston and Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. He was a United States Army soldier during World War II, which delayed his legal studies. Lancaster was engaged in his law practice from 1948 until the time of his death at the age of ninety-one. As a House member for four terms, he served under Governors Robert F. Kennon, Earl Kemp Long, Jimmie Davis, and John McKeithen. He was the chairman of the Judiciary A Committee. Outside the legislature, Lancaster was an organizer, member of the board of directors, and attorney of Southern National Bank at Tallulah. In 1986, he was named \\"Attorney of the Year\\" by the Louisiana Bar Foundation. A year later, he was inducted into the LSU Law Center Hall of Fame. From 1992 to 1993, Lancaster served as judge pro tempore of the Louisiana 6th Judicial District on appointment from the Louisiana Supreme Court. For fifty years, he was affiliated with the Louisiana Law Institute and was active as well in the Louisiana State Bar Association. For sixty-five years, Lancaster was married to the former Beverly Vedros (1921-2013), a native of Lutcher in St. James Parish in South Louisiana. The couple had three children, Judge Michael E. Lancaster and his wife, Becky, of Tallulah; Patricia Ann \\"Patsy\\" Clapp and her husband, Billy Clapp, of Ocala, Florida; and Edgar Hunter Lancaster III and his wife Terri of Monroe. The Lancasters' daughter, as Patsy Forcier, the wife of Ray Forcier, she was an employee of the city of Shreveport, an authority on sewer matters and the administrative assistant from 1977 to 1978 under then Public Utilities Commissioner Billy Guin. The Lancasters, both generations, are interred at Silver Cross Cemetery in Tallulah. Honorary pallbearers at Representative Lancaster's funeral included Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell, whom Lancaster swore into office in 2008; a former legislative colleague, L.D. \\"Buddy\\" Napper of Ruston, and Henry Sevier Jr., son of the legislator whom Lancaster succeeded in 1952. Caldwell called Lancaster, \\"the gold standard\\" for the legal profession, the legislature, the family and community, and as a judge and athlete.

The colonists called him Sagamore James. He was one of three sons of Nanepashemet, the sachem of the entire region occupied by tribes of the confederation. These were Abenaki peoples, part of the large Algonquian languages family. Early life Montowampate was born in 1609 to Nanepashemet, the Great Sachem of the Pawtucket Confederation, and his wife, identified in English records only as the Squaw Sachem of Mistick. Nanepashemet's territory was divided following his death in 1619, and Montowampate was given control over the area consisting of present-day Swampscott, Nahant, Lynn, Lynnfield, Marblehead, Reading, Saugus, and Wakefield. Montowampate resided on Sagamore Hill in Lynn, a high bluff located near the head of Long Beach. Personal life Montowampate was married to Wenunchus, daughter of Passaconaway. The two married about 1629 in Pennacook (now known as Concord, New Hampshire). Their marriage ceremony was followed by a large banquet. Not long after their marriage, Wenunchus, escorted by a number of Montowampate's men, returned to her father's territory for a visit. Once she arrived safely, Montowampate's men returned home. When Wenunchus was ready to return to Montowampate, Passaconaway sent messengers to Montowampate to tell him that his wife was ready to return and that he should send a convoy to get her. Montowampate felt that Passaconaway should sponsor the return party, as Montowampate's men had already escorted her to her father. He thought that sending a convoy would make him and his people appear subservient to Passaconaway. Passaconaway felt that he deserved more respect from the young Sachem and told Montowampate that if he wanted Wenunchus' company, he would have to send a party for her. Montowampate still refused, telling Passaconaway that he could either send her with his own convoy or keep his daughter. Wenunchus was known to eventually return to Montowampate, but it is not recorded how the dispute between him and her father was settled. Relationship with other tribes In 1631, Montowampate and his brother Wonohaquaham (also known as Sagamore John) met with Chief Masconomet in Agawam (present day Ipswich). Masconomet may have been seeking their assistance in his conflict with the Tarrantine. On the night of August 8, 1631, 100 Tarrantine warriors attacked Agawam. Masconomet, Montowampate, and Wonohaquaham, were all wounded and Montowampate's wife was taken captive. She was ransomed by Abraham Shurd, a colonist from Pemaquid (now Bristol, Maine), and returned to her husband on September 17, 1631. Relationship with colonists Montowampate was described by Governor Thomas Dudley as being \\"of a far worse disposition\\" than his brother Wonohaquaham. On March 26, 1631, Montowampate went to Governor John Winthrop for assistance after he was defrauded of twenty beaver pelts by a colonist named Watts, who soon returned to England. Winthrop gave the leader a letter of introduction to Emanuel Downing, a London attorney. It is believed that Montowampate may have traveled to England to claim remuneration. In 1632, Montowampate purchased muskets, powder, and shot from a settler named Richard Hopkins. By 1633, friction had emerged between the Pawtucket and colonists over the boundaries between the two. However, before the issue could be resolved, the tribe was hit by an outbreak of smallpox and suffered many deaths. Death In 1633, most of the Pawtucket died during a smallpox epidemic, as they did not have acquired immunity to the new infectious disease. Montowampate died of the disease in December 1633, around the same time as his brother Wonohaquaham. Their younger brother Wenepoykin, also known as Winnepurkett, Sagamore George, George Rumney Marsh, and George No Nose (because of disfigurement from smallpox), was among the relatively few survivors. He took over both his brothers' territories and became sachem of the surviving Pawtucket. Legacy An image of Montowampate was included on Saugus' town seal. He is depicted holding a bow and arrow in front of Round Hill and the rising sun. Montowampate's image is also included on the first floor of the new Saugus Middle High School. The image, along with some biographical data, was taken from The Saugus Centenary - One Hundredth Anniversary of the Incorporation of the Town of Saugus. 1815-1915. July 3,4,5 1915.

The film was released on September 9, 2016, by Momentum Pictures. Plot In 1942, Homer Macauley (Alex Neustaedter) is a boy determined to be the best and fastest bicycle telegraph messenger of the small fictional town of Ithaca, CA. His older brother, Marcus (Jack Quaid), along with most of the young men of the town, has gone to serve in World War II, leaving the families worried. His father (Tom Hanks) has died recently in the war and the boy has to take care of his widowed mother (Meg Ryan), his older sister and his 4-year-old brother. Homer delivers letters that bring messages of love, wishes, pain, and death, hoping that one of them announces the return of his brother.

On June 25, 2014, Tom Hanks joined the cast. Principal photography began on July 21, 2014, and ended on August 22, 2014. It was filmed in Petersburg, Virginia, and also some opening scenes of the film were shot on the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad. Release The film premiered on October 23, 2015, at the Middleburg Film Festival. The film was released on September 9, 2016, by Momentum Pictures. Music John Mellencamp, Ryan's boyfriend, wrote the entire score for the movie. \\"Not one note [in Ithaca] is anything other than Mellencamp. He did everything,\\" Ryan said. In a May 6, 2016 Q&A; after a screening of the movie at Geena Davis' Bentonville Film Festival, Ryan said: \\"The music is so beautiful. John Mellencamp wrote every note – everything – the tiny little needle drops you hear in the back. He wrote about half of it after I read him the script, and then the next half after he saw the movie. He's just incredible.\\" In addition to the score, Mellencamp wrote two original songs for Ithaca: \\"Sugar Hill Mountain\\" (sung by Carlene Carter) and \\"Seeing You Around\\" (sung by Leon Redbone). \\"Sugar Hill Mountain\\" is a fiddle-driven folk song that describes an idyllic location where there's \\"bubble gum and cigarette trees,\\" no clocks, every day is spring, and anything you need is \\"gratis.\\" Meanwhile, the piano-heavy \\"Seeing You Around\\" has the sound of a 1940s standard (the time period the movie takes place in) and is made all the more authentically '40s-sounding by Redbone's gruff, baritone vocals. Mellencamp's band provided the backing on both tracks and performed all the music that is in the movie. Said Carter in 2015: \\"The way John Mellencamp and I met was he invited me to come and sing this song he had written for the movie that Meg Ryan has coming out called Ithaca. That was when we became friends, when I went to Indiana and recorded with him and the guys this really cool song called 'Sugar Hill Mountain' that's in the movie. And the movie is wonderful. We got to see a rough cut of it and I was very impressed.\\" Critical reception The film has a 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on eighteen reviews.

It is found in Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Its natural habitat is miombo woodland. The cinnamon-breasted tit was described by the German ornithologist Anton Reichenow in 1885 based on a specimen collected at Kakoma in the Tabora Region of Tanzania. He coined the binomial name Parus pallidiventris. The specific epithet combines the Latin pallidus \\"pale\\" and venter, ventris \\"belly\\". It was formerly one of the many species placed in the genus Parus. It was moved to the resurrected genus Melaniparus based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013. The genus Melaniparus had been introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850. The cinnamon-breasted tit has sometimes been considered conspecific with the rufous-bellied tit, (Melaniparus rufiventris). It was formerly generally believed that rufous-bellied tits had pale eyes and the cinnamon-breasted tits dark eyes. A study published in 2015 found that in western Tanzania birds with dark eyes and pale eyes occurred in the same flocks. This suggests that it might be better to consider the cinnamon- breasted tit as a subspecies of the rufous-bellied tit. Two subspecies are recognised: * M. p. pallidiventris (Reichenow, 1885) – Tanzania, south Malawi and north Mozambique * M. p. stenotopicus (Clancey, 1989) – east Zimbabwe and west central Mozambique References cinnamon-breasted tit cinnamon-breasted tit ","title":"Cinnamon-breasted tit"},{"id":"43387869","text":"Saint Tysul was a 5th-century pre-canonical saint and patron saint of the churches of Llandysul in Cardiganshire and Llandyssil in Montgomeryshire.Bartrum P C “A Welsh Classical Dictionary: People in History and Legend up to about A.D. 1000”, National Library of Wales, 1993, 630.

The crossing is reached by Maine State Route 229 on the American side and by New Brunswick Route 375 on the Canadian side. The United States crossing facilities are the original facilities first built for this crossing in 1933, and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. South of the crossing, one hundred yards from the border, is a decommissioned Nike missile base that is now an auto repair shop. It was one of four that protected nearby Loring Air Force Base. Canadian facilities Canada Border Station at Gillespie Portage, NB as seen in 1998 The Canadian government first built a border station at this crossing sometime around 1930. The current facility was built in 1984. United States facilities US Border Inspection Station in Limestone, Maine as seen in 1936The United States border station originally included the main building and two residences, located to its rear. The residences have since been demolished. The main building is a wood frame structure, a single story in height, with a side gable roof and flanking wings, each of which house two garage bays for performing inspections, and is located quite close to the border. The building was divided inside to provide space for performing customs procedures by the USCS on one side and immigration procedures by the INS on the other. Prior to the construction of this station, customs and immigration formalities would have taken place in the nearest town. With the advent of increased automobile traffic in the 1920s, as well as the need to interdict the movement of contraband liquor due to Prohibition, the federal government realized the need for border stations where immigration formalities and vehicle inspections could be performed close to the border, and consequently planned the construction of a series of such stations. The Limestone station was authorized as part of a large authorization enacted in 1931. The federal government purchased land at the border from Walter and Hiram Phair in 1932, construction began in 1933, and the station was opened in January 1934. Although there were standardized building plans for the construction of these stations, the Limestone facilities are distinct in that they do not follow any of them. The station is similar to a \\"Type 2\\" facility, but uses less expensive construction materials.

The band formed on September 4, 2012, and in 2013 were signed to Fueled by Ramen. The band is made up of vocalist Kevin \\"Ghost\\" McCullough and keyboardist Evan Pearce, who left the band for a short period of time beginning in 2015, just a few weeks before the release of Evolution. He returned late 2016. From the group's foundation in 2012 until 2017 the band also included drummer MannYtheDrummer and guitarist/backing vocalist Alix Koochaki. Alister Dippner creates artwork for the band's releases and is closely associated with them. Ghost Town Tuesday, or GTT, is an event that lasts over the course of a few weeks each round, and the band releases songs every Tuesday. The band has released three albums, Party in the Graveyard, The After Party, and Evolution, as well as two acoustic EPs, Bare Bones and Tiny Pieces. The After Party charted at No. 135 on the Billboard 200 and reached No. 1 on Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. History =Formation and Party in the Graveyard (2012–2013)= Kevin McCullough, Alix Koochaki, and Alister Dippner all attended high school together in Palm Springs, California. Kevin moved to Hollywood, CA and started Ghost Town with Zachary LeCompte-Goble. They added producer Evan Pearce and drummer Manny Dominick after a few months. After high school, Alister moved to San Luis Obispo to follow his passion for painting. Still being friends, Kevin sent him rough cuts of Ghost Town's first songs. Alister listened to them and replied, \\"This is like my art as music. I want nothing more than to be a part of whatever you guys make.\\" On September 4, 2012, Alister Dippner uploaded a sped-up video of himself painting the artwork to \\"Game Freak\\" with the song playing in the background, and it went viral. They set up a PureVolume page shortly after and rose to the top of the site's charts. After the release of \\"Game Freak\\", the band decided to write, produce, and release a new song every week, dubbing them \\"Ghost Town Tuesdays\\". They released 12 songs over the course of 9 weeks. Using many of the songs released over the course of four months, along with five new songs, the band self-released their first album, Party in the Graveyard. The band uploaded a version of the album onto YouTube on December 21, 2012. The full album was available on iTunes on January 15, 2013. =Record deal, Party in the Graveyard re-release and The After Party (2013–2014)= On May 7, 2013, the band announced that they were being signed to Fueled By Ramen and joining a tour with Marianas Trench and Air Dubai. Following the success of the tour, Fueled By Ramen announced the re-release of their debut album. The re-release featured new artwork, remastered recordings, and the addition of four tracks. This was released on Fueled By Ramen on November 19, 2013. Their second album, The After Party, was announced by the band on May 6, 2014. It was released on June 10, 2014 on Fueled By Ramen. It featured 10 new songs and a new version of \\"You're So Creepy\\". Following the announcement, a music video for \\"You're So Creepy\\" was released. The After Party debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers charts and was featured in Rock Sound's 50 Best Albums of the Year for 2014. =Departure of Evan and Evolution (2015–2016)= In July 2015, Evan Pearce announced his departure from Ghost Town due to undisclosed health reasons. In the press release, the band announced they would continue as a trio. Evan Pearce is now back with Ghost Town as of 2017. The band's third album, Evolution (stylized as EVØLUTION) was announced on their Facebook page on September 10, 2015. The next day, they released a music video for the first single off the album, \\"Spark\\". \\"Spark\\" was later released as a single on October 16, 2015. The album was recorded at Pulse Studios in Spring of 2015 with Josh Abraham, Nico Stadi, Oligee, and Ryan Williams over a span of 6 weeks. The album, according to Kevin Ghost, has a different message than the band's previous works. The second single off of the album, \\"Mean Kids\\", focuses on the subject of bullying. On October 22, 2015, \\"Loner\\" was available for preview in an article on Billboard. The band called this song \\"the loner anthem for our generation.\\" A music video for \\"Loner\\" was released alongside the album on November 6, 2015. =Lineup change and \\"In The Flesh\\" (since 2016)= In 2016, the band opened for Simple Plan on their European tour and played on the entire Warped Tour. Throughout 2016 they released a few singles digitally. In August 2016 Ghost Town performed at Reading and Leeds Festival for the first time. To celebrate Halloween, they released a new song entitled \\"Tiny Pieces\\". In 2016, Ghost Town covered the My Chemical Romance song \\"Mama\\" for a Rock Sound tribute CD. On December 20, 2016, the band announced on their official Facebook account that Evan Pearce had returned to the band. Since his return, Ghost Town has released 5 new songs, four of which were released once per week on Ghost Town Tuesday during January 2017. In April 2017, guitarist Alix Koochaki left the band. Five months later, on September 19, drummer Manny Dominick (professionally known as MannYtheDrummer) posted a statement on his Instagram announcing his departure from Ghost Town. Dominick would later join Capture. On December 25, 2017 the song \\"Hell\\" was released as the first single for a new EP. Later on February 13, 2018 the second single \\"Modern Tragedy\\" was released. Finally, the new EP entitled \\"In The Flesh\\" was released on June 29, 2018. The band has not talked about new music since its release.

It was aired on July 24, 2014. The episode was written by Brian Allen Alexander and directed by Allan Arkush. Plot Viceroy Mercado (William Atherton) returns to Defiance to inform Niles (James Murray) about the coming Arkfall and that he wants him to go with a team, Nolan (Grant Bowler) included, to retrieve an energy source from the Ark. Nolan and Niles get ready to go with the team when Tommy (Dewshane Williams) comes to join them with Berlin (Anna Hopkins). When Nolan asks Tommy where Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) is, Tommy says that since Irisa and Berlin do not get along, Berlin will come with them while Irisa stays back. Nolan does not like the idea and tells Tommy that he is not going with them either, causing Tommy to quit his job. Berlin convinces Tommy to leave Defiance with her and sign up with the E-Rep in Texas. Nolan and Niles get to the fallen Ark along with Churchill (Rob Archer) and an E-Rep soldiers unit. The three of them go inside the Ark to search it and Nolan realizes that the Ark was never a refueling ship but a Gulanee transport vessel. One Gulanee has survived the crash, and the three of them rush out to return to the unit only to find all aboard dead. They return to the Ark, where they are trapped inside the ship while Nolan tries to create a weapon that will kill the Gulanee and save their lives. Nolan needs some extra time and asks Niles to distract the Gulanee. Niles sends Churchill outside on a suicide attack to give Nolan the extra time he needs. The Gulanee kills Churchill, but when it gets into the ship, Nolan's jury-rigged weapon kills it. Nolan and Niles return to Defiance, but Mercado is displeased with how the mission went and orders Niles to go to the Dakota Reach as a punishment, while the Viceroy will take over the town. Tommy wants to talk to Irisa about him leaving Defiance and he follows her while she skulks after a Castithan man. He sees her during the moment that Irzu takes over her body, and he believes that she has killed the Castithan. Irisa tells him that she did not and she convinces him to wait and see that the man will wake up and be fine. She tells him everything she knows about what is going on with her and he promises to keep her secret and try to help her. When Tommy tells Berlin that he can not leave because Irisa needs him, but not why, Berlin breaks up with him. Stahma (Jaime Murray) faces some problems with the holy man, Favi Kurr (Dominic Cuzzocrea), who tells her that her actions will cause problems to their community. Because of her, many Casti women might forget their place and start asking for more power or better treatment from their husbands. Stahma talks to Amanda about it, and Amanda advises her to talk to the other Castithan women. Stahma meets with some of them, but the other women make it clear that they will not support her in what she is trying to do. Since her attempt to convince the other women has failed, she realizes she cannot let them live to tell anyone what she is up to, so she poisons them and frames Favi Kurr for the crime. As a result, Kurr ends up on the shaming rack and is killed. At the end of the episode, Deirdre (Kristina Pesic) helps Christie (Nicole Muñoz) to get \\"into the skin\\" of the Castithans by putting makeup and a wig on her and dressing her like them. Mercado does the same at his home, and the two of them meet at a local Castithan club where Mercado starts flirting with Christie, not knowing who she is. Nolan and Berlin get together after her breakup with Tommy, since Amanda has ignored him to console Niles about his being sent to Dakota Reach.  Feature music  In the \\"This Woman's Work\\" we can hear the song \\"Lonely Nights\\" by Olivia Pucci. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"This Woman's Work\\" was watched by 1.61 million; slightly down by 0.03 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"This Woman's Work\\" received positive reviews. Michael Ahr from Den of Geek rated the episode with 4.5/5 saying that the episode was another roller coaster ride. \\"Defiance has been non-stop entertainment this year, and the deck just got another shuffle. Relationships shift, secrets are revealed, and new ones are glimpsed only by the viewers, giving us tantalizing morsels to keep us hungering for more.\\" Joe Winder of Geeked Out Nation rated the episode with 8.8/10 saying that it was a pretty good episode that moved things along. \\"In all it was a good episode and we learned interesting things about some of the characters. [...] Never thought Niles was so caring and he even was remorseful about what he did to Churchill. Never would have guessed that Viceroy was an Irathient wanna be. The most shocking thing in this episode is the conversation where Irisa spilled to Tommy that she had no clue what was happening.\\" Katelyn Barnes from Geeks Unleashed rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying that this was one of her favorite episodes of the show so far. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a B rating to the episode saying that the episode is not great \\"but it is a great example of how a science fiction show can take advantage of its setting in order to produce an entirely normal episode.\\" Kaiser also states that the main story of the episode with Nolan and Pottinger, gives the show the opportunity to delve into Pottinger’s character a little bit more. Billy Grifter from Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode saying that it was his favorite of the season so far and that the end of the episode was an unexpected turn of events. \\"[The end of the episode] is an odd direction to take the show, but anything unexpected is generally good, if it all makes sense.\\" Andrew Santos of With an Accent also gave a good review to the episode saying that it was another solid episode for the show. \\"This second season continues to surprise me. While the first season felt more like a fun and sometimes goofy science fiction series, this second season has really explored the characters, new and old, in ways I wouldn’t have thought. Hopefully Defiance keeps this momentum going.\\" References External links * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Defiance (season 2) episodes ","title":"This Woman's Work (Defiance)"},{"id":"43387936","text":"The Lastours Formation is a geologic formation in France.

Mustafazadeh integrated two different ways of musical thinking by conjoining mugham with rich jazz harmony, fusing familiar motifs with swing, using both jazz and mugham types of melodic elaboration Mustafazadeh learned the classical jazz repertoire from recordings by the help of the characteristics of the oral transmission of mugham.

Its areas of focus include study of infectious diseases, biodefense, military medicine, battlefield medicine, and bone marrow research. NMRC is under the United States Department of the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. History NMRC was originally the Naval Medical Research Institute, founded in 1942, and was located on the campus of the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Besides researching health and safety issues for shipboard environments, it was involved in early radiobiology research after the development of atomic weapons, astronaut training during the 1960s Space Race, as well as the establishment of the Navy Tissue Bank and the National Marrow Donor Program. The Navy Toxicology Unit, which had been founded in 1959 in response to air quality issues within USS Nautilus as well as toxicity concerns about replacements for flammable hydraulic fluids, was incorporated into NMRI in 1975 and moved the following year from Bethesda to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio so it could share resources with the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory's Toxic Hazards Division. The unit later became the Environmental Health Effects Laboratory at Naval Medical Research Unit Dayton. In 1998, NMRI was reorganized into the Naval Medical Research Center and became an umbrella organization for several other subordinate commands elsewhere in the nation and abroad. Since 1999, it has been located in the Forest Glen Annex in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Forest Glen Annex was originally an annex of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, but as a result of the Base Realignment and Closure process the facility was transferred to the command of Fort Detrick in 2008. NMRC occupies the Daniel K. Inouye Building, named for the late Senator Daniel Inouye, along with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Organization NMRC headquarters at the Daniel K.

Its main campus in Silver Spring is divided into seven directorates: * The Administration Directorate provides direction and support to the other directorates and sets the policy required to ensure a coordinated effort in support of command requirements. * The Biological Defense Research Directorate researches ways to protect military personnel in the event of a biological attack. * The Bone Marrow Research Directorate provides military contingency support for casualties with marrow toxic injury due to radiation or chemical warfare agents. * The Infectious Diseases Directorate conducts research on infectious diseases that are considered to be significant threats to our deployed sailors, marines, soldiers, and airmen. * The Operational and Undersea Medicine Directorate conducts medical research, development, testing, and evaluation to develop new information and technologies to enhance the health, safety, performance, and deployment readiness of Navy and Marine Corps personnel. * The Research Services Directorate acts as a bridge for the community's scientific investigators, and opens NMRC scientific endeavors to research applications and developments. * The Resource Management Directorate advises the Commanding Officer on financial functions within the command. The Naval Infectious Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory (NIDDL) is also located in the Silver Spring facility. NIDDL provides clinical diagnostic laboratory services for active military and their families worldwide, specializing in less-common diseases not covered by the standard military treatment facilities of the Military Health System.

He was engineer on the Hull Railway Dock, and Victoria Dock, and other works, and was instrumental in promoting the Birkenhead Docks on the Mersey. He retired in 1861 due to ill health and died in 1869. Biography John Bernard Hartley was born on 3 September in Dungarvan, Waterford, son of Jesse Hartley, engineer of the Liverpool docks. He was brought up in Pontefract Yorkshire and educated at Giggleswick school, after which he began training under his father on the Liverpool dock estate, and in 1835 placed under James Walker. In 1840 he began working independently, and in 1842 was appointed engineer of the Hull Dock Company. There he was engineer during the construction of the Railway Dock and Victoria Dock. He left the employment of the Dock company in 1858. He also worked on lighthouses on the river Lune, at the mouth near Morecambe bay, on the Hull and Barnsley Railway, The Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway, and on docks at Purton Pill, Silloth Bay, a graving dock at Grimsby and scheme for docks at Cardiff, and on the drainage of Port Madoc. He was also worked on the docks at Liverpool and Birkenhead, in association with his father. He was involved in prolonged attempts to obtain a bill enabling the construction of deep water docks at Birkenhead to the design of James Meadows Rendel, and later, in 1858, became engineer of the Birkenhead Docks. His health failed in 1860, and he had left for the warmer climate of the Mediterranean when he received news of his father's death. He was appointed to his father position on the Liverpool Docks estate, but retired due to poor health, being retained as a consulting engineer. He then lived at Letrualt House near Rhu, Dumbarton, also travelling to Spas in Switzerland – He died on 14 December 1869.

He is honoured in Wales and Brittany, and in Cornwall at St Maddern's Church in the village of Madron. He also has a Holy well, noted for its healing powers. Madron was born in Cornwall and was a disciple of Saint Ciarán of Saigir. Very little is known of him except that many miracles were attributed to him. He died c.545 AD near Land’s End, Cornwall, and is remembered in Madron Parish Church (Madron Village) and his Feast Day is 17 May. Identification John T. Koch has suggested that the saint was not a historical figure but rather a Christianisation of the Mythical Celtic Modron the mother goddess. Indeed, some aspects of the veneration at Madron's well do appear to derive from Pagan origins. Others have suggested that the saint's life is a retelling of the story of St. Madrun, a daughter of Vortimer, a king of Gwent.

It serves several purposes to include flood control, irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. The dam was constructed between 1991 and 1998. Background In 1981, Bili-Bili Dam was added to the Jeneberang River Comprehensive Development Project. Construction began in 1991 and the dam was completed in 1998. The weirs downstream of the dam and their accompanying irrigation canals were completed in December 2005. The dam's power station was commissioned in 2005 as well. The project was built with funding and cooperation from the Japan International Cooperation Agency. It has several purposes to include municipal water supply for the city of Makassar, about 30 km away, and to protect the city from historic flooding. It is designed prevent an estimated 50-year flood. Water from its reservoir also helps irrigate about of rice fields in Gowa and Takalar regencies. The power station has an installed capacity of 19.25 MW and generates about 69,000 MWh of electric power each year. Sedimentation in the reservoir has been a concern since at least 2004. The dam is downstream from Mount Bawakaraeng, which is \\"prone to landslides.\\" A large landslide in 2004 prompted a request for survey assistance to the Japanese government to determine the possible impact on the dam. An overflow of the dam in 2019 caused a major flooding. Design The Bili-Bili Dam is a long and tall rock-fill type. Its reservoir holds of water. Below the dam are three weirs, the Bili-Bili, Bissau and Kampili. They connect to of primary canals and of secondary canals. The Bili-Bili weir covers about of farmland while the Bissau covers and Kampili .
