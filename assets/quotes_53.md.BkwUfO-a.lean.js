Cold-traps can exist on the surfaces of airless bodies or in the upper layers of an adiabatic atmosphere. On airless bodies, the ices trapped inside cold-traps can potentially remain there for geologic time periods, allowing us a glimpse into the primordial solar system. In adiabatic atmospheres, cold-traps prevent volatiles (such as water) from escaping the atmosphere into space.  Cold-traps on airless planetary bodies  The obliquity of some airless planetary bodies in our solar system such as Mercury, the Moon and Ceres is very close to zero. Harold Urey first noted that depressions or craters located near the poles of these bodies will cast persistent shadows that can survive for geologic time periods (million-billion years). The absence of an atmosphere prevents mixing by convection, rendering these shadows extremely cold. If molecules of volatiles such as water ice travel into these permanent shadows, they will become trapped for geologic time periods. = Studying cold-traps on airless bodies = As these shadows receive no insolation, most of the heat they receive is scattered and emitted radiation from the surrounding topography. Usually, horizontal heat conduction from adjacent warmer areas can be neglected due to the high porosity and therefore low thermal conductivity of the uppermost layers of airless bodies. Consequently, the temperatures of these permanent shadows can be modeled using ray casting or ray tracing algorithms coupled with 1D vertical heat conduction models. In some cases, such as bowl-shaped craters, it is possible to obtain an expression for the equilibrium temperature of these shadows. Additionally, the temperatures (and therefore the stability) of cold-traps can be remotely sensed by an orbiter. The temperatures of lunar cold-traps have been extensively studied by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Diviner radiometer. On Mercury, evidence for ice deposits inside cold-traps has been obtained through radar, reflectance and visible imagery. On Ceres, cold-traps have been detected by the Dawn spacecraft.  Atmospheric Cold-traps  In atmospheric science, a cold-trap is a layer of the atmosphere that is substantially colder than both the deeper and higher layers. For example, for Earth's troposphere, the temperature of the air drops with increasing height reaching a low point (at about 20 kilometers height). This region is called a cold-trap, because it traps ascending gases with high melting points, forcing them to drop back into Earth. For humans, the most important gas to be kept in that way is water vapor. Without the presence of a cold-trap in the atmosphere, the water content would gradually escape into space, making life impossible. The cold trap retains one-tenth of a percent of the water in the atmosphere in the form of a vapor at high altitudes. Earth's cold-trap is also a layer which above ultraviolet intensity is strong, since higher up the amount of water vapor is negligible. Oxygen screens out ultraviolet intensity. Some astronomers believe that the lack of a cold trap is why the planets Venus and Mars both lost most of their liquid water early in their histories. Cold traps are thought to function for oxygen on Ganymede.

It aims to recognise the place of women in history, and particularly the role of women in Australia's development. It recognises \\"any woman who is a pioneer in her chosen field from settlement to present day\\". The museum was founded in 1993 by Molly Clark of Old Andado Station. It opened in September 1994 in the town's Old Courthouse building, which had been leased for a period of five years. By 2001, the premises had become too small and the former gaol was offered as a new location. In 2007 the museum was officially opened in its new location by Marion Scrymgour, Minister for Women's Policy and the first indigenous woman to be elected to the Parliament of the Northern Territory. The museum's permanent exhibitions include Ordinary Women/ Extraordinary Lives - Women First in Their Field, the Signature Quilt, Women at the Heart (Central Australia), What's Work Worth and the Aviatrix Tapestry.

Although four of the aircraft's six crew survived, 225-348 fatalities and around 253 serious injuries occurred on the ground. This is the largest number of ground fatalities caused by an aircraft accident.David Learmont, [ Kinshasa sees repeat of ground carnage after crash] Flight International 5 October 2007 Background After decades of conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, the air transport business is complex and often illegal. As Johan Peleman explained: It has been reported that this flight was carrying weapons to UNITA: Crash While attempting to take off fully fuelled and overloaded from N'Dolo Airport's short runway, the An-32B did not achieve sufficient speed to bring its nose up, yet began to lift. It crashed into the open-air Simbazikita produce market, full of shacks, pedestrians and cars, and its full fuel load ignited.

It was formed in 1999 by a group of multidisciplinary scientists, researchers, and software developers, led by Chris Langton. Langton was also the founder of the emerging field of research called artificial life. The initial, primary, role for the SDG was to house continued development of the Swarm simulation software after the software become independent of the SFI in 1999. The role of the Swarm Development Group, has since expanded to include the co-ordination of a long-running conference SwarmFestSwarmFest during May, June, or July each summer ‚Äì typically hosted by a different research university each year. Developers, users, and researchers gather to present research papers and discuss the state of Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms like RePast (University of Chicago) and AscapeAscape (Brookings). Typically, a wide range of academic, corporate, and government organizations are represented at SwarmFest. The first SwarmFest was in 1998 while Swarm was still sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute. From SwarmFest 2000 onwards, after the SDG was formed in late 1999, SwarmFests were organized directly by the SDG. Recent SwarmFests have been held at a variety of institutions.

George Villiers (1759‚Äì1827) Cranbourne Lodge (by John Gendall) in what is now Windsor Great Park, Villiers' home from 1805 to 1812 The Hon. George Villiers (23 November 1759 ‚Äì 21 March 1827) was a British courtier and politician from the Villiers family. The youngest son of the diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal Family and his father's influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers was more interested in the operation of the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his bookkeeping as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to the Crown by more than ¬£250,000. This exposure touched off a public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, and he was able to retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827. Upbringing and political career Villiers was the youngest son of Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon and Charlotte Capell. His maternal grandparents were William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex and Jane Hyde. George, like his brother, was educated at Eton College and then St John's College, Cambridge, graduating with an MA in 1779. It was presumably through the influence of his father, then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster under the first Pitt ministry, that he was appointed a Groom of the Bedchamber to George III on 13 January 1783, and Clerk of the Council and Registrar of the Duchy of Lancaster in August 1786. A polished courtier, Villiers earned the nickname \\"Tiger\\" among his party for his vehement support of the king; although as Fanny Burney observed, his \\"remarkably slim, slight and delicate person\\" did not match the nickname. In 1792, Villiers purchased the support of Lord Warwick, and was returned as Member of Parliament for Warwick in the by- election of 18 January 1792Gazette Issue 13382 published on the 24 January 1792. Page 3 Crown Office January 28, 1792 Members returned to serve in the present Parliament Borough of Warwick as a Tory. On 19 March 1792, shortly after his entry into Parliament, Villiers was appointed to the office of Paymaster of Marines, a sinecure which would ultimately prove his undoing. The salary of the post was fixed at ¬£600 p.a. after a reform in 1800. In 1794, Villiers became the captain commanding the newly raised Western Troop of the Hertfordshire Gentlemen and Yeomanry-Cavalry. He was elected unopposed in 1796, but did not stand for the borough in 1802. Though a friend of Pitt's government, he rarely attended the House; George Rose commented in a letter that Villiers's loss would have no impact on the Tories. While a member of parliament, in 1798, he married Lord Boringdon's daughter, Theresa, who would bear him ten children over the next two decades. After leaving Parliament, Villiers continued his presence at Court, and carried messages from the Princess Royal in Stuttgart to the king. In 1803, the duties of his office as paymaster were extended, and on 9 May, he was reappointed as Paymaster and Inspector-General of Marines, with a salary of ¬£1,000 p.a. In the same year, he was commissioned a captain in the Watford Volunteer Cavalry. Villiers was prepared to intercede with the king on behalf of Pitt to fulfill the latter's desire for a more comprehensive ministry, which, however, was frustrated; and to bring Pitt's friends into the Ministry of All the Talents in 1806. Villiers, indeed, enjoyed considerable favour with the king, who granted him a private bounty of ¬£400 p.a. in 1804 after being compelled to refuse him an office at Windsor Park. He was allowed to hold simultaneous office as a groom of the bedchamber and paymaster, and the king determined to place him in charge of his farms at Windsor as bailiff. Villiers and his family lived at Windsor Old Lodge until 1805, when he was appointed ranger of Cranbourne Chase and he moved into Cranbourne Lodge, newly renovated as his residence. Villiers and his wife were particularly intimate with Princess Amelia, the king's favourite daughter, accounting in part for the Royal favour shown him. With the fall of the Ministry of All the Talents in 1807 and the formation of Portland's government, the Duke of Cumberland vigorously lobbied Portland to grant Villiers the mastership of the Buckhounds or some other office, on the grounds of Villiers having rendered \\"very serious and important services\\" to the Royal Family, but was unsuccessful. In 1809, upon the death of John Fordyce, Surveyor General of the Land Revenues of the Crown, Portland proposed to replace that office and that of the Surveyor General of Woods, Forests, Parks, and Chases, then held by Lord Glenbervie, with a three-man commission (the Commissioners of Woods and Forests), and to make Villiers one of the junior commissioners. This reorganisation of the Crown Lands temporarily halted upon Portland's resignation and the formation of a new government under Spencer Perceval. This created an embarrassing difficulty for Villiers and his interest; George Canning did not choose to serve under Perceval, and Villiers' brother-in-law, the 2nd Lord Boringdon, was Canning's friend. Nor was the proposed appointment of Villiers universally popular; Lord Glenbervie, the proposed senior commissioner, vented his anger at Perceval's nomination of Villiers in his journal: Nonetheless, Villiers continued to press his claims to office on Perceval, in a letter of 18 October 1809. He had, he said, turned down a pension of ¬£1,200 p.a. for \\"reasons...which can never be publicly alluded to\\" and had received a promise from Portland to replace Fordyce as Surveyor General of the Land Revenues (a post worth ¬£2,000 p.a.); Villiers would, however, be satisfied with the commissionership and ¬£1,000 p.a. in addition, provided that he might retain his office of paymaster. In fact, that office was about to become the engine of Villiers' political destruction. He appears to have received the sinecure offices of registrar of the Vice- Admiralty Court of Gibraltar and marshal of the Vice-Admiralty Court of Antigua around this time.Thorne dates these appointments to 1811, but a letter of 27 January 1810 by \\"A.B.\\" in Cobbett's political register refers to \\"sinecures at Gibraltar, and in the West Indies,\\" presumably the same. Scandal and disgrace The value to the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay not so much in the official salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the official to retain large sums of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes had not yet been extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure. He appears to have taken little interest in his official duties both as paymaster and inspector-general, leaving affairs in the hands of Edmund Waters. Waters had been his private secretary, and when Villiers came to office as paymaster, Waters was appointed chief clerk in that department, rising to deputy paymaster in 1797. Waters and Villiers invested in real estate with some of the money passing through the office; unfortunately for Villiers, Waters was also diverting some of the funds to his own interest in the Opera House, and the accounts of the office were in a shambles. Well aware of the parlous state of the office's accounts, Waters retired from the Marine Pay Office in 1807 as an independently wealthy man (only to lose the fortune in his Opera House investments). The lax regime in the Pay Office rattled on, however, until 27 December 1809, when Perceval became aware of the state of Villiers' accounts. Villiers, to his credit, immediately resigned and took responsibility for his official debts. Perceval allowed him to proffer his resignation directly to the king, but Villiers could not face his master; Perceval informed the king of the state of affairs in a letter of 15 January 1810, laying the blame for the situation largely on Waters. Perceval's letter noted that \\"reports were circulating on the subject to such an extent as to make it impossible to hope that it would not become the subject of Parliamentary observation.\\" By this time, Villiers's accounts had been audited through the year 1804, revealing him to be in arrears by the staggering sum of ¬£280,000 through that point. On the advice of his brother-in-law Boringdon, Villiers offered up all his property to the Crown, although he could not hope to pay off the entire sum found wanting by this means. The episode left him in a condition of nervous prostration, the more so as he by now had five children to support. A letter by \\"A.B.\\" in Cobbett's Political Register of 27 January 1810 assailed Villiers for his delinquency and estimated that his debt, with interest, might run to ¬£500,000. Fortunately for Villiers, his case was not to be prosecuted with the utmost rigour. He was to some degree protected by the joint efforts of Boringdon's friends and the Whig George Tierney, as well as his own quick action in surrendering his property through writs of extent; and the delinquency of Joseph Hunt, Treasurer of the Ordnance attracted attention and saved Villiers from the full wrath of the finance committee. Their report on the matter noted that the writ of extent had been to the amount of ¬£264,000, but only ¬£91,000 had been raised from the sale of his property, and about ¬£30,000 from securities and the bond posted for him when he took office. The committee recommended the abolition of the office of Paymaster of Marines and the transfer of its duties to the Treasurer of the Navy, a recommendation which was not immediately acted upon. Villiers was left, in Boringdon's estimation, with a debt of ¬£1,500‚Äì2,000, an annual income of ¬£2,000‚Äì3,000, and the property in Cranbourne Lodge. However, his disgrace was not over. After his resignation, Villiers had been replaced by Lord Mulgrave's brother, Edmund Phipps, as paymaster and lost his prospective place as a commissioner of woods and forests. Then, he was informed on 4 May 1810, after the release of the finance committee's report, that the king had removed from him the supervision of the farms at Windsor (he also lost the rangership). The news threw him into a state of great mental distress; he wrote to the king begging him to suspend judgement on the points raised by the committee's report. The king replied that it was \\"indispensable\\" to remove Villiers from his office under the circumstances, but extended his sympathy and suspended judgement on him. The final disaster for Villiers occurred in November, when Princess Amelia died. After her death, Villiers and his wife attempted to blackmail the Royal Family by threatening (in a letter to her doctor, Sir Henry Halford) to release some of her correspondence, much to the shock of her sister, Princess Mary. The family finally moved out of Cranborne Lodge in 1812. The untangling of his accounts dragged on until 1819, prolonged by his enemies at the Navy Office and his own fiscal incapacity. At length a balance of ¬£220,000 was found against him, but by this time his career was hopelessly ruined. He left office as a groom of the bedchamber in 1815, but retained his vice-admiralty sinecures until his death. In 1824, he became heir presumptive to the Earldom of Clarendon but died in 1827 without inheriting it. Marriage and children Hon. Theresa Parker, wife of George Villiers On 17 April 1798, George married Theresa Parker. She was a daughter of John Parker, 1st Baron Boringdon and his second wife Hon. Theresa Robinson. Her maternal grandparents were Thomas Robinson, 1st Baron Grantham and Frances Worsley.

Nearly 40 years after the end of his career there, he recorded a hit record produced by Ben Fong-Torres. Biography Ching was born in Kauai, Hawaii and was raised by his grandparents. =First singing career, 1938-1962= Ching taught himself to sing by listening to records on board ship while he was in the Merchant Marines. Visiting the Chinese Village, a bar in Chinatown, at age 17 with his Merchant Marine friends, he convinced the pianist to play while he sang. The owner was so impressed he hired Ching on the spot as a singing bartender. In 1938, Charlie Low, who'd been a silent partner in the Chinese Village and had heard Ching, opened the Forbidden City, an Asian-themed burlesque and cabaret supper club in downtown San Francisco, and, soon after opening, asked Ching to join the ensemble of entertainers. By 1942, Ching was a featured performer, promoted in advertisements as the \\"Chinese Frank Sinatra,\\" in line with Low's marketing ploy, of nicknaming his performers after famous white celebrities. Ching did not approve of his nickname because he preferred Bing Crosby to Sinatra, and did not sound like Sinatra. He would have preferred to be known under his own name. However, the new name stuck, and Ching is still known by it (although Herb Caen, to set the record straight, referred to Frank Sinatra as \\"the Italian Larry Ching\\" Ching was an instant success, although his shyness initially got in the way. \\"To overcome his nervousness with the patrons,\\" says Jane Seid Ching, his widow, \\"someone taught him to open his eyes and look over their heads, instead of looking at them.\\" Or, as Ching himself joked: \\"Two drinks and open your eyes!\\" Hoagy Carmichael discovered Ching and invited him to work on Carmichael's weekly radio show in Hollywood, but Ching declined. While at the Forbidden City, Ching, along with other cast members, flirted with female patrons, and he got into fistfights with patrons who would make racial insults. He claimed Duke Ellington and Bing Crosby as fans, and met many other jazz and pop greats including Bob Hope and Lena Horne. Ching performed three shows a night, six nights a week at Forbidden City for more than twenty years. He left the club in 1961 after it was sold to a new owner, and retired from singing professionally. He raised a family, and took a job driving a delivery truck for local newspapers, where he was known to sing while making rounds. He retired from his truck route in 1985. Through the years, he continued to sing, at weddings, community events and occasional reunions of Forbidden City alumni. =Second career, June‚ÄìJuly 2003= In 1989 Ching was featured in Forbidden City U.S.A., a documentary film by Arthur Dong about the club. He sang at the premiere of the film at the Palace of Fine Arts, where he met Ben Fong-Torres, the former Rolling Stone writer and editor who was co-MCing the event, along with Ching's friend, TV anchor Emerald Yeh. Ching met Fong-Torres again several years later when both performed at Yeh's wedding reception. Fong-Torres was impressed with Ching's singing and wanted to produce an album with him. Because of Fong-Torres' other commitments as an author and broadcaster, the record was not recorded until 2003, when Ching was 82. The album, Till the End of Time, features twelve songs recorded with a jazz trio led by pianist George Yamasaki, and four remastered songs Ching had recorded as demos in the 1940s. Co-produced by John Barsotti at San Francisco State University's studios, and released in June, 2003, it was a critical and financial success. Ching's story‚Äîand music‚Äîdrew wide attention from local TV and radio stations, and the album made the charts of Amazon.com. Ching and family, along with Forbidden City alumni, celebrated his CD at the Chinese Historical Society of America museum, and mayor Willie Brown proclaimed June 28, 2003 \\"Larry Ching Day\\". A week later, July 5, Ching died suddenly of an aneurysm. Mr. Ching married twice, first to Vicki Ching, a dancer at Forbidden City who died in 1979, and second to Jane Seid Ching, whom he married in 1991. He had two sons and four stepsons. He is memorialized by a portrait on \\"Gold Mountain\\", a mural depicting Chinese contributions to American history on Romolo Place in North Beach.

These could be limiting temporarily access to the memorial to the victims of the violent resettlement of the Baltic peoples or reducing funding for taking care of certain halls within the Museum of Political Repression.

Situation at the Estonian embassy in Moscow In the days following the relocation, the Embassy of Estonia in Moscow was besieged by protesters, including pro-Kremlin youth organisations Nashi and the Young Guard of United Russia. On Monday, April 30, Estonia's foreign minister Urmas Paet reported that \\"the situation had become much worse in the previous night. The building is by now completely blocked.\\" Paet says that Estonia's foreign ministry had sent a note, also reported by Russian media: to Russia's foreign ministry, due to Russia's apparent unwillingness and impotency to defend the embassy building and its staff (which violates Diplomatic law, especially the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations). Estonia's foreign ministry claims that the life and health of the diplomats and their family members residing in Moscow have been directly threatened.http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/384003 Estonia's president Toomas Hendrik Ilves expressed his astonishment that Russia has ‚Äì despite the promises of foreign minister Lavrov ‚Äì not taken actions to protect the diplomatic personnel. In Ilves' opinion, the ostensible powerlessness of Russia's defense services (e.g. OMON) is especially surprising, given their quick work when dispersing meetings of Russian opposition forces.As images show, the protesters have entered into embassy territory. E.g. here '—Ñ–∞—à–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –∑–æ–Ω–∞' - 'fascist zone' has been scribbled on embassy wall. On the same day, members of the crowd protesting before the embassy declared that if Estonian authorities would not set a date for the restoration of the Bronze Soldier statue in its former prominent place, they would begin demolishing the Estonian embassy building on May 1 (traditionally also Labour Day, important in Russia and the former Soviet Union). The building itself was covered with graffiti and stones were thrown at it. During the night, protesters, both from pro-Putin and Communist parties, were playing and singing aloud famous Soviet war marches of the Red Army. They called the Estonians Fascists. On May 2, the protesters attacked the Estonian ambassador, Marina Kaljurand, during a press conference, however the assailants were dispersed by security guards using pepper spray. The vehicle of the Swedish ambassador was also attacked. Family members of the embassy staff have been evacuated. / During the night of May 2 ‚Äì May 3, the Estonian embassy in Moscow was stoned by unknown vandals; there were also protests around the embassy of Georgia (Georgia has expressed support for Estonia).http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/384405 ; On May 3, the ambassador Kaljurand left Moscow on a two-week vacation. The protesters ended their blockade the same day. There has been speculation that the vacation was suggested by Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (by means of behind-the-scenes realpolitik) to soothe Russian-Estonian tensions. On May 1, Estonian foreign minister Urmas Paet suggested to consider calling off the upcoming EU-Russia Summit that was due to take place on 18 May: \\"We consider it necessary that the European Union react in the toughest way to Russia's behavior. It might imply suspending or canceling various negotiations. Postponing the EU-Russia Summit should be seriously considered\\". Paet stated that \\"the EU is under attack, because Russia is attacking Estonia.\\" . Spokesperson for German Chancellor Angela Merkel told that the summit will not be postponed, but European Commission said that a decision to raise the issue at the EU-Russia Summit depends on the development of the current situation. Commission spokesperson Christiane Hohmann said: \\"We share the concerns about the increasing violence around the Estonian embassy in Moscow and we strongly urge the Russian authorities to implement their obligations under the Vienna Convention for diplomatic relations.\\" =Threatened and alleged sanctions= On May 3, 2007, Russia suddenly announced plans for repairs to railway lines to Estonia, disrupting oil and coal exports to Estonia. As a result, oil companies scurried to secure alternative export routes. Normally Estonia's ports handle about a quarter of such shipments from Russia to world markets. Although Russia denied it was imposing economic sanctions or taking politically inspired action against Estonia, it is suspected that the sudden railway repair plan is connected to the row over the war memorial.S.

For example, the clip labelled \\"eSStonia - Police car crushes pedestrians crowd\\" features no pedestrian-menacing cars.Eesti P√§evaleht: Vandaalide videod koguvad Youtube¬¥is vaatajaid Pro- rioter propaganda in Russia Distinctly, many participants in the blockade believe that what were characterised as \\"riots\\" by Estonian official sources were actually a peaceful political demonstration and that Dmitri (also spelt Dmitry) Ganin, the man that died in the riots died through police brutality while attempting to defend the monument.ITAR-TASS: Estonia (sic) metropolitan denounces violence in Tallinn ITAR-TASS: Meetings and rallies banned in Estonia EPL: Rahutustes pussitatud Dmitri r√º√ºstas poode He has been ceremonially declared a \\"hero of Russia\\" by activists involved in the blockade.Jaanus Piirsalu, Vene noorte uus eeskuju ‚Äî Dmitri, April 30, 2007 =Dmitri Linter= On May 4, Rambler-news reported that Mr. Linter had been taken by the Estonian law enforcement from the Mustam√§e hospital under an intravenous line, and that his health and whereabouts had been withheld from his family since.Wife of the Nochnoy Dozor's leader pleas to free her husband Rambler-news 4 May 2007 These claim were soon refuted by the State Procurature, whose official release declares that \\"[Linter] was taken to the hospital because he claimed to have \\"various ills\\", he was given a full medical and declared healthy\\". Law enforcement response The police are treating the riots as disorderly conduct (a misdemeanor under Estonian law) or severe disorderly conduct committed in a group (a felony under Estonian law), depending on the circumstances of any particular incident, and are proceeding accordingly. About 1,000 suspected rioters were arrested. Acts of vandalism and looting are treated separately, and processed as criminal incidents separate from the rioting. Three men (Dmitri Linter, Maksim Reva and an 18-year-old school boy Mark Sir√µk)have been detained under a court order for up to 6 months, pending investigation of the suspicion of organising riots (a felony under Estonian law punishable of imprisonment of up to 5 years).Postimees: Kohus v√µttis √ñise Vahtkonna liidri vahi alla Postimees: M√§ruli organiseerimises kahtlustatav vahistati teel kodaniku√µpetuse eksamile There were concerns about the health of Mark Sir√µ, who has Haemophilia, but his attorney stated that he had no complaints. Since the riots took place in the centre of the city, after hours of tension, many thousands of frames of photographic and video material of the events are available, both from journalists and security cameras and from witnesses among general public (who usually used cellphone cameras). The police have gathered a number of such photographs depicting unidentified suspects on a website at Identification of Persons (not available from outside Estonia while a foreign DDoS attack on Estonian government servers is underwayGovernment Communication Office Briefing Room: Malicious cyber attacks against Estonia come from abroad F-Secure Web log: Large attacks against websites run by the Estonian government) and asked the public to identify such unidentified people. The police have also called for rioters and looters to turn themselves in voluntarily.Postimees: Politsei kutsub m√§ratsenud noori end ise √ºles andma Aiding law enforcement in investigating one's own unlawful acts, including turning oneself in before an arrest warrant has been issued, is considered a meritorious deed and grounds for lessening punishment under Estonian law. 218 out of almost 300 vandals, who were arrested during events on 26.‚Äì28.

According to the Estonian laws regarding criminal proceedings, his case will now be reviewed by the prosecutor and investigators, and will likely go to a full trial afterwards. A vandal, Sergei Dolgov, who has no Estonian citizenship but had been convicted before, was convicted in the felony of violation of public order during rioting, over throwing rocks at policemen and vandalising lawn in front of Estonian National Library. He was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, suspended for 18 months.Postimees 27 August 2007: Pronks√∂√∂l politseinikele vastu hakanud mees sai tingimisi karistuse As of August 2007, the harshest sentence has been that of Vjat≈°eslav Zjunin, who was sentenced to a year of real imprisonment for looting and had an outstanding suspended sentence from an earlier conviction.

On 5 January 2009 the 4 activists, charged with organization of riots during Bronze Night, were found not guilty by the District Court of Harjumaa. The prosecutor has appealed the ruling, citing numerous legal deficiencies. The acquittal, however, was upheld.V. Pettai M. Molder Estonia p. 207// Nations in Transit. Freedom House 2010 =Statistics= In relation to the rioting, 1200 people were arrested and 491 declared suspects of particular crimes. As of 11 January 2009, 125 people have been convicted. For 283 suspects, the criminal cases were ended without charges. On most of the trials, the charges pressed were plundering during riots, vandalism during riots, arson during riots and disobedience of lawful police orders. 125 people so charged were convicted, one acquitted, and 10 are pending (including Linter, Reva, Sir≈ëk and Klenski). Most of the damages caused by rioting were compensated by the government's reserve fund. While the Ministry of Treasury undertook gathering and combining the debts so as to collect on them from the convicts, collection on many of them is unlikely due to the different focus of the investigations. In particular, the Ministry of Treasury has paid out 25.6 million crowns of compensation; so far, 66 convicts have been billed for a total of 2.1 million crowns of damages. As of mid- December 2008, less than 85 000 crowns of damages had been paid by the guilty.ERR Uudised 11 January 2009 21:43: Pronksi√∂√∂ m√§ssuga seoses on s√º√ºdi m√µistetud 125 inimest References Category:2007 in Estonia Category:2007 riots Category:2007 in politics Category:Estonia‚ÄìRussia relations Bronze Night ","title":"Aftermath of the Bronze Night"},{"id":"13674552","text":"Mental Circus is the debut album from Bloodpit, a Finnish rock band.

It was originally entitled Heroes 360 Experience but the name was changed for Season 2. Heroes Evolutions was activated on January 19, 2007, the day when episode 12, \\"Godsend,\\" was first aired in the United States. Viewers can investigate clues from the show on this official website, which incorporates aspects of an alternate reality game. Heroes Evolutions also incorporates the show's weekly graphic novels, which began being published on the show's website each Tuesday on September 26, 2006. In an interview at the 2007 Wizard World in Los Angeles, co-executive producer and writer Jesse Alexander said that all the stories in the experience \\"connect with the show\\" and provide participants with real spoilers. He went on to say that this current version is a dry run for an even bigger experience in the works for next year. Heroes Evolutions has had 48 million page views as of March 22, 2007, plus over 27 million video downloads. On May 14, 2007, the program was renewed for the second season. On September 13, 2008, Heroes Evolutions received a Creative Arts Emmy for Interactive Media Programming: Interactive Fiction.Creative Arts Emmy winners for 60th annual awards. Associated Press September 23, 2008 As of November 8, 2008, during the show's third season, Heroes Evolutions began releasing iStory content: interactive stories that sometimes allow the reader to shape what happens in the story. The first iStory volume, \\"Friend or Foe\\", allowed readers to participate in two sides of the same story that parallel Volume Three of Heroes. Two chapters were released simultaneously each week, with each chapter allowing readers to play as a character hired by one side of the story, choosing some of that character's actions. Chapters of subsequent volumes, \\"The Private\\" and \\"The Agent\\", have only been released a single chapter at a time. Channels of participation *Participants may call a special phone number for additional content, and also may use text messages to get updates, and clues to finding more content. *Participants may register their email addresses for additional interactive experiences, including emails 'from the characters'. *Additional information about the characters and storylines will be hidden on the website, and other websites have been established to expand the stories, including MySpace pages, and faked private sites. *Commentary from the cast will be added to the webisodes. *The phone number, 1-800-PRIMA-16, for the fictional company Primatech, where Mr. Bennet works in the show, was revealed in episode 12, \\"Godsend\\" when Bennet gives his business card to Mohinder Suresh, though Mr. Bennet's \\"access code\\" (written on the back of the card) was not.

By the time of Pope Innocent X (1644-55) the Secretary of State was always himself a Cardinal, and Pope Innocent XII (1691-1700) abolished the office of Cardinal Nephew in 1692. Biography Dandini was born in Cesena on 25 March 1509 to a patrician family, the son of Anselmo Dandini and Giovanna Muratini. He graduated from the University of Bologna with a degree utroque iuris in both canon and civil law. He went to Rome and became secretary to Pope Paul III, who appointed him Protonotary apostolic. He was sent as nuncio to the court of Fran√ßois I to negotiate peace and to agree on the celebration of a general council, June 1543 to May 1544. He was appointed bishop of Caserta, (14 November 1545), then bishop of Imola (17 May 1546), where he was abbot in commendam of San Firmino. He renounced the see in favour of his nephew, Anastasio Umberto Dandini, who died unexpectedly in 1558, whereupon Cesare Dandini took up the see once more and held it until his death the following year. in the meantime he was again nuncio in France, charged with opposing royal support of Protestantism at the court of the new king, Henri II, July 1546 to September 1547. As legate to Emperor Charles V he negotiated the continuation of the Council of Trent and obtained assistance for the war of Parma and Mirandola. He was named to the lucrative post of commissary general of the papal army. Dandini was created cardinal by Pope Julius III, in the consistory of 20 November 1551, and was made cardinal-secretary of state, to fill the post of the incompetent cardinal-nephew Innocenzo Ciocchi del Monte. He participated in the Conclaves of 1555; in the Conclave of 1559 he had to retire from the conclave of 1559 because of illness and died in his palazzo near the Church of San Marcello, where he is buried.

The Braeside campus is located in the up-market area of Lavington, Nairobi, near Lavington Green shopping centre along Muthangari Road. Braeside School has a music room; a library; a 25-metre swimming pool and a training pool; playing fields; a kitchen; a dining hall which also caters for indoor games; classrooms for each teaching group; an assembly hall able to fit 300 people seated and a sick bay. Text books and stationery are provided. The school is divided into the Early Years Unit, catering for children aged 2 ‚Äì 5 years, and the Primary School. Early Years Unit In the Early Years Unit, children aged 2 years may start school part- time and build up to staying for lunch and afternoon sessions, using school transport if required. Children encounter additional activities such as music; ICT; PE and Swimming; library time; pet-keeping; role play and cooking. Primary school In Braeside Primary School, lessons are divided into core subjects ‚Äì English, Mathematics and Science ‚Äì and foundation subjects ‚Äì History, Geography, Physical Education (PE), Art, Music, Foreign Languages, Information Communication Technology (ICT), Religious Education (RE) and Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE).

The love of God purifies human hearts and through it humans become transformed and self-sacrificing, as they reflect more the attributes and qualities of God.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son of the founder of the religion wrote: \\"There is nothing greater or more blessed than the Love of God! It gives healing to the sick, balm to the wounded, joy and consolation to the whole world, and through it alone can man attain Life Everlasting. The essence of all religions is the Love of God, and it is the foundation of all the sacred teachings.\\" Christianity The Old Testament uses a rich vocabulary to express the love of God, as a concept that appears in many instances.Theology of the Old Testament, Volume One by Walther Eichrodt 1961 pages 250‚Äì251 The Lord expresses his love through the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah and says, \\"I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with loving kindness\\" (Jeremiah 31:2). However, the exegesis of the love of God in the Old Testament has presented problems for modern scholars.Theologies in the Old Testament by Erhard Gerstenberger 2007 page 87 The love of God appears in a number of texts (e.g. Hosea 1‚Äì3, and then in Ezek 16 and Isa 62) but resolving the references to produce a consistent interpretation has been challenging and subject to debate. Emeritus Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in 'The Difficult Doctrine of Love, says both the love of God and the wrath of God are ratcheted up in the New Testamant over the Old. Also the concluding verses of several epistles emphasis love ( 1 Corinthians 16:22, Ephesians 6:24, 2 Thess 3:5). Many of the most stunning promises in the Bible are for those who love God, notably Romans 8:28 (all things working for good for those who love God) and Deuteronomy 7:9 part of the prelude to the 10 commandments (those loving God being blessed to a thousands generations, where many of the worst curses in the Old Testament where curses went to 4 or 10 generations). Jonathan Edwards said his chief obligation was to raise the affections of his congregation as high as he could toward God in volume 4 of the Yale edition of his works, entitled ‚ÄúThe Great Awakening.‚Äù https://byfaithweunderstand.com/2010/09/09/edwards-quote-success/] Both the terms love of God and love of Christ appear in the New Testament. In cases such as in Romans 8:35 and Romans 8:39 their use is related in the experience of the believer, without asserting their equality.The Epistle to the Romans by Douglas J. Moo 1996 page 547 In John 14:31 Jesus expresses his love for God the Father. This verse includes the only direct statement by Jesus in the New Testament about Jesus' love for God the Father.Preaching the Gospel of John: proclaiming the living Word by Lamar Williamson 2004 page 192 Greek polytheism In polytheism, that which is loved by the gods (œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÜŒπŒªŒ≠œÇ) was identified as the virtuous or pious. Socrates famously asked whether this identification is a tautology (see Euthyphro dilemma). =\\"Philotheos\\" and \\"theophilos\\"= In Greek, philotheos means \\"loving God, pious\\", as philosophos means a lover of wisdom (sophia). , using the word philotheos in the plural form, speaks of certain people as œÜŒπŒªŒÆŒ¥ŒøŒΩŒøŒπ Œº·æ∂ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ ·º¢ œÜŒπŒªœåŒ∏ŒµŒøŒπ (lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God). The word Theophilos was and is used as a proper name, but does not appear as an adjective or common noun in Greek,The word does not appear in the great Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon which uses instead the form theophil√™s, which means \\"dear to God\\" but also \\"loving God\\". However, Eric Voegelin used theophilos to mean \\"lover of God\\": \\"In the Phaedrus, Plato has Socrates describe the characteristics of the true thinker. When Phaedrus asks what one should call such a man, Socrates, following Heraclitus, replies that the term sophos, one who knows, would be excessive: this attribute may be applied to God alone: but one might well call him philosophos, a lover of wisdom. Thus in the classic sense and reference of 'philosophy', actual knowledge is reserved to God; finite man can only be the lover of knowledge, not himself the one who possesses knowledge. In the meaning of the passage, the lover of the knowledge that belongs only to the knowing God, the philosophos, becomes the theophilos, the lover of God.\\"Eric Voegelin, Science, Politics, and Gnosticism (ISI Books ), p. 41 Hinduism In Hinduism, in contrast to kƒÅma, which is selfish, or pleasurable love, prema ‚Äì or prem ‚Äì refers to elevated love. Karuna is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. Bhakti is a Sanskrit term, meaning \\"loving devotion to the supreme God\\". A person who practices bhakti is called a bhakta. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of bhakti, which can be found in the Bhagavata Purana and works by Tulsidas. The philosophical work Narada Bhakti Sutras, written by an unknown author (presumed to be Narada), distinguishes eleven forms of love. On the mystic side of Hinduism, one of the forms of Yoga includes Ishvarapranidhana, or self-surrender to God, and his worship. =Bhakti movements= Devotees of Krishna worship him in different emotional, transcendental raptures, known as rasas. Two major systems of Krishna worship developed, each with its own philosophical system. These two systems are aishwaryamaya bhakti and madhuryamaya bhakti. Aishwaryamaya bhakti is revealed in the abode of queens and kingdom of Krishna in Dwaraka. Madhuryamaya Bhakti is revealed in the abode of Braja. Thus Krishna is variously worshipped according to the development of devotee's taste in worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, as father, friend, master, beloved and many different varieties which are all extraordinary. Krishna is famous as Makhanchor, or butter thief. He loved to eat butter and is the beloved of his little village in Gokul. These are all transcendental descriptions. Thus they are revealed to the sincere devotees in proportion to the development in their love of Godhead. Vaishnavism is a form of monotheism, sometimes described as 'polymorphic monotheism', with implication that there are many forms of one original deity, defined as belief in a single unitary deity who takes many forms. In Krishnaism this deity is Krishna, sometimes referred as intimate deity ‚Äì as compared with the numerous four-armed forms of Narayana or Vishnu.Scheweig, (2004) pp. 13‚Äì17 It may refer to either of the interrelated concepts of the love of God towards creation, the love of creatures towards God or relationship between the two as in bhakti. Islam The love of God, and the fear of God, are two of the foundations of Islam. The highest spiritual attainment in Islam is related to the love of God. \\"Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides God, as equal (with God): They love them as they should love God. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for God.\\" (Quran 2:165)Another Islamic concept is that God's love leads towards good deeds \\"And feed with food the needy, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him (ie. God).\\" Islam, as Christianity, has numerous mystics and traditions about the love of God, as in: :\\"O lovers! The religion of the love of God is not found in Islam alone. :In the realm of love, there is neither belief, nor unbelief.\\" (Rumi)Rumi's Quatrain no. 768, translated by Gamard & Farhadi. Versions of this quatrain have been made by Shahram Shiva, \\"Hush: Don't Tell God\\", p. 17 and by Azima Kolin (based on Mafi), \\"Rumi: Whispers of the Beloved\\", p. 71. [\`√¢shiq to yaq√Æn d√¢n, ke musulm√¢n na-b√ªd dar maZhab-√© \`ishq, kufr-o √Æm√¢n na-b√ªd] The concept of Divine Love, known as Ishq-e-Haqeeqi (Persian), is elaborated by many great Muslim saints to date. Some Sufi writers and poets may have taken human love as a metaphor to define Divine Love but the prominent mystics explain the concept in its entirety and reveal its hardcore reality. Rabia Basri, the famous 7th century mystic, is known as the first female to have set the doctrine of Divine Love. In Islamic Sufism, Ishq means to love God selflessly and unconditionally. For Rumi, 'Sufism' itself is Ishq and not the path of asceticism (zuhd). According to Sultan Bahoo, Ishq means to serve God by devoting one's entire life to Him and asking no reward in return. Judaism The love of God has been called the \\"essence of Judaism\\". \\"And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.\\" () Other Goethe expresses the sentiment of love of God alongside the opposite sentiment of hatred of God in his two poems Ganymed and Prometheus, respectively.

Hvare-khshaetaSee also (', '; audio demonstration) is the Avestan language name of the Zoroastrian yazata (divinity) of the \\"Radiant Sun.\\" Avestan Hvar…ô-x≈°aƒìta is a compound in which hvar \\"sun\\" has x≈°aƒìta \\"radiant\\" as a stock epithet. Avestan hvar derives from Proto-Indo-Iranian *s√∫Har \\"sun\\", from which the Vedic Sanskrit theonym Surya also derives. In Middle Persian, Hvare-khshaeta was contracted to Khwarshƒìd, continuing in New Persian as Khurshƒìd/Khorshƒ´d (cf. a similar contraction of Avestan Yima-khshaeta as Jamshid). The short seven-verse 6th Yasht is dedicated to Hvare-khshaeta, as is also the Avesta's litany to the Sun. The 11th day of the Zoroastrian calendar is dedicated to and is under the protection of Hvare-khshaeta. Although in tradition Hvare-khshaeta would eventually be eclipsed by Mitra as the divinity of the Sun (this is attributed to \\"late\\" syncretic influences, perhaps to a conflation with Akkadian Shamash), in scripture the Sun is still unambiguously the domain of Hvare- khshaeta and remains distinct from the divinity of \\"Covenant.\\" The Slavic deity Hors has been generally considered to be etymologically related to Hvare-khshaeta, and possibly the result of Persian armies introducing their form of solar worship to Slavic peoples around the first millennium BC. However, this is not without criticism, as the etymological connection between both gods has been called into question.

The park comprises two attractions located from each other: Ash Hollow Cave and Windlass Hill. Ash Hollow Cave A spring in the vicinity of Ash Hollow Cave made it an attractive site for periodic human habitation. Archaeological explorations of the cave have revealed that at least four distinct indigenous cultures occupied this area, during a period of more than 1,500 years. These include the Apache from A.D. 1675-1725; the Central Plains Tradition from A.D. 900-1450; the Woodland Tradition from A.D. 0-1100; and the Late Archaic Tradition from 1000 B.C.-A.D. 500. The cave was used as a base camp for hunting and food collecting. From the early 18th century, this became an area predominately of Lakota Sioux occupation. The September 1855 Battle of Ash Hollow took place near here. The United States Army, with 600 troops, made a punitive attack on a Brule Sioux encampment, killing a total of 86 people, including women and children, and taking another 70 women and children as captives. The attack on the Lakota Sioux was launched as a result of The Grattan Massacre of 1854 near Ft Larmie, Wyoming. In 1962, the site was protected as part of a 312-acre Nebraska state park. Ash Hollow Cave was named as a National Historic Landmark in 1964, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The surrounding area was named the Ash Hollow Historic District in 1975. In 1978, a visitor center was built overlooking the canyon. Windlass Hill Windlass Hill is located along the Oregon-California Trail. The hill marked the entrance from the high table lands to the south into the Ash Hollow area and the North Platte River valley. Wagon ruts are visible on the hill. The name \\"Windlass Hill\\" was not used by the emigrants, and the source of the name is unknown. Emigrants had a hard time going down the hill at a 25-degree angle, going down for about 300 feet.

Javits. Rosenthal was murdered in a terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turkey. The Harold Rosenthal Fellowship in International Relations was established in his honor.  Career  Rosenthal graduated from Cambridge University and Harvard University graduate school, both on scholarships. After working for Congressman Hugh Carey (D-NY) he moved to the office of Senator Walter Mondale (D-MN) where he directed the senator's legislative agenda. After a stint at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Rosenthal returned to the Senate to work as a senior aide to Jacob K. Javits of New York.  Murder  On August 11, 1976, Rosenthal was one of four people murdered in a terrorist attack at the El Al gate in Istanbul, Turkey. Other victims included Yutaka Hirano, a tour guide from Japan, Ernest Eliash from Petach Tikvah and Shlomo Weisbachs along with over 20 injured. An American woman, Margaret Shearer was injured with a bullet in her ankle. Two captured attackers identified themselves to Turkish police as Mohamed Mehdi and Mohamed Husein al-Rashid of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. In 1977, the Harold Rosenthal Fellowship in International Relations was established in his memory. Each year, 9 to 13 qualified students are given the opportunity to spend the summer in professional fellowships with a members of Congress or in a government department. Applications are encouraged from graduate students interested in all branches of government.Rosenthal Fellowship Description  Interview theory  In 1978, a pamphlet entitled The Hidden Tyranny included an interview conducted by Walter White purportedly with Rosenthal that claimed Jewish Americans had implemented a Protocols of the Elders of Zion style plan to take over the world. The pamphlet was republished in the 1990s and distributed in Idaho by the 11th Hour Remnant Messenger, funded by wealthy entrepreneurs Vincent Bertollini and Carl E. Story. The Anti-Defamation League has called it \\"a fabricated document\\" and questioned why the author would \\"wait to first publish the booklet until 1978, years after he had 'spoken' with Rosenthal, who was killed by terrorists in 1976.\\" Tom Metzger reported in the White Aryan Resistance website \\"that interview never took place. Walter White operated free and loose on some subjects, like this one... that interview is bogus.\\" Daniel Levitas in his book The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right attributed the bogus interview to White's wife, Opal Tanner White, an aide to Gerald L.

Playing career White began his career in the non-league ranks whilst training as an electrician. In 1984 his talents were spotted by Lincoln City and he moved into the professional game. He spent two seasons with Lincoln, from where he was loaned to Maltese club Naxxar Lions, before dropping back into the non- league ranks with first Boston United and then Shepshed Charterhouse. At the beginning of the 1987‚Äì1988 season he appeared in a Lincolnshire Senior Cup tie for Grantham before surprisingly rejoining the pro ranks at Bristol Rovers. He also had a short stint at non league Oxhey jets, scoring one goal in five matches. The move occurred following the appointment of Gerry Francis as manager at Bristol Rovers. Francis was looking for a strong physical striker and remembered a performance White had given for Lincoln against Rovers and contacted Lincoln to enquire about signing White. He was somewhat surprised to discover White had drifted back into non-league football and it took some detective work to track him down. He grasped his second chance at the professional game and went on to enjoy a long career. Post-playing career At the culmination of his professional career, White returned to his initial trade as an electrician and now runs his own company in Nottingham. In December 2006, he returned to non-league football circuit as temporary first- team coach at Gedling Town, a role he occupied until the completion of the 2006‚Äì07 season.

Derek Jackson was one of the outstanding atomic physicists of his generation. Biography Son of a wealthy Welshman, Sir Charles Jackson, who was both a leading authority on antique silver and chairman of the News of the World, Jackson showed early promise in the field of spectroscopy under the guidance of Professor Lindemann, making the first quantitative determination of a nuclear magnetic spin using atomic spectroscopy to measure the hyperfine structure of caesium. His scientific research at Oxford did not, however, interfere with his other great passion ‚Äì steeplechase riding ‚Äì which led him from the foxhunting field to his first ride in the Grand National of 1935. A keen huntsman, he took up the sport again after the war, riding in two more Nationals after the war, the last time when he was 40 years old. In World War II, Jackson distinguished himself in the RAF, making an important scientific contribution to Britain's air defences and to the bomber offensive. He flew more than a thousand hours as a navigator, many of them in combat in night-fighters, with No. 604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron based at RAF Middle Wallop. He was decorated with the DFC, AFC and OBE. This war record stands in contrast to his stated desire at the war's inception to keep Britain out of fighting Germany, and his reported desire \\"that all Jews in England should be killed\\".Nancy Mitford spied on sisters For the rest of his life, Jackson, appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947, lived as a tax exile in Ireland, France and Switzerland. He continued his spectroscopic work in France at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, and was made a chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur. Jackson had what might be called a colourful personal life.

He has written a number of books, including The Singing Neanderthals and The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science. Education Mithen received a BA in prehistory and archaeology from Sheffield University, a MSc degree in biological computation from York University and a PhD in archaeology from Cambridge University. Cognitive fluidity Cognitive fluidity is a term first popularly applied by Mithen in his book The Prehistory of the Mind, a search for the origins of Art, Religion and Science. The term cognitive fluidity describes how a modular primate mind has evolved into the modern human mind by combining different ways of processing knowledge and using tools to create a modern civilization. By arriving at original thoughts, which are often highly creative and rely on metaphor and analogy modern humans differ from archaic humans. As such, cognitive fluidity is a key element of the human attentive consciousness. The term has been principally used to contrast the mind of modern humans, especially those after 50,000 B.P. (before present), with those of archaic humans such as Neanderthals and Homo erectus. The latter appear to have had a mentality that was originally domain-specific in structure; a series of largely isolated cognitive domains for operating in the social, material, and natural worlds. These are termed ‚ÄúSwiss penknife minds‚Äù with a set of special modules of intelligence for specific domains such as the Social, Natural history, Technical and Linguistic. With the advent of modern humans the barriers between these domains appear to have been largely removed in the attentive mode and hence cognition has become less compartmentalised and more fluid. Consciousness is of course attentive and self-reflective, and the role of the modular intelligences in neurological ‚ÄúDefault mode‚Äù is a topic for current research in self-reflective human consciousness. Mithen uses an appropriately interdisciplinary approach, combining observations from cognitive science, archaeology, and other fields, in an attempt to offer a plausible description of prehistoric intellectual evolution.

The shrine houses a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus. Though the statue's origins are unknown, church officials claim that it is 400 years old.Web site of the shrine The statue has been damaged, lost and recovered more than once, most recently during the 2004 tsunami in Asia, which damaged the shrine and killed 24 people attending Sunday Mass.'Miraculous Marian statue seen as living miracle' on UCAN News. The church celebrated its centenary year in 2007.  Claims regarding the statue of Mary  Church legend claims that a large wooden crate was hauled out of the sea by Weligama fishermen. When it was opened, the statue was found inside, untouched by seawater. The fishermen handed it over to the parish priest and the statue was placed in St. Mary's Church in Matara. At a later period, during a cholera epidemic which claimed hundreds of lives, Catholics prayed before the statue to be delivered from the disease. The statue was taken in a solemn procession through the streets of Matara. After a few days, the area was declared safe by the health authorities and there were no further officially reported deaths. Since then the Catholics of Matara have attributed miraculous powers to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the early 1900s, after over 300 years in the church of Matara, the statue looked faded and worn due to exposure and the thousands of devotees touching and kissing it. Arrangements were made with a sculptor in Ghent, Belgium, to renovate the statue. Renovations, loss and recovery When the renovations were complete, the statue was packed in a wooden crate and shipped in the cargo boat Beachy, which set sail from Antwerp. The ship was caught in a fierce storm in the North Sea. It was nearly wrecked but did manage to reach Middlesbrough, England, the next morning. Most of the cargo was found to have been destroyed or thrown overboard. When the ship reached Minicoy, India, it was discovered that the statue had gone missing. An investigation was initiated by the Bishop of Galle and Belgian priests in the Galle Diocese. These investigations traced the statue to a man in Middlesbrough. When confronted, he refused to hand over the statue unless his demands for money were met. When these demands were refused, he used a hammer to deface the statue, and then threw it away. The statue was recovered and sent back to the restorer in Ghent, who made repairs and repainted it. The Bishop of Galle, Rt. Rev. Dr. Joseph Van Reeth, took possession of the statue and set sail to Matara in the steamer Princess Alice. When he reached Colombo and looked for his luggage, the crate containing the statue could not be found. Three days later a Belgian cargo boat named the Uckermarck arrived in Colombo with the missing crate. The excess luggage of the Princess Alice had been loaded onto the Uckermarck, which set sail after the Princess Alice had left Antwerp harbor.

It was an annual tax nominally levied at 25% on revenue or produce, hence the name. It was levied on the lands which were under nominal Mughal rule. The sardeshmukhi was an additional 10% levy on top of the chauth. It is a tribute paid to the king. It was started by Koli Maharaja Som Shah of Ramnagar.S. A. A. Rizvi, p. 263 of A Cultural History of India (1975), edited by A. L. Basham Function Opinions on the function of the Chauth vary. According to M G Ranade, the chauth was charged to provide armed security for a state by the Marathas and is thus comparable to the system of subsidiary alliances that was used by Lord Wellesley to bring Indian states under British control. The historian Jadunath Sarkar has argued that the chauth was essentially a tax paid by those states that did not want the Marathas to enter into their realm. The chauth thus served as protection money against Maratha invasions against the chauth paying state. The tax was levied at the rate of one fourth the annual revenues of the state and was levied at the cost of the revenue paid by the state to the Mughals or the Deccan kingdoms. Shivaji first demanded chauth in 1665 and the Deccan sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda began to pay him a combined sum of 800,000 after he became a raja in 1674. In 1719, the Mughal emperor granted Shahu the chauth and sardeshmukhi rights over the six Deccan provinces in exchange for his maintaining a contingent of 15,000 troops for the emperor. The revenues from chauth were in turn divided into four parts that went to various functionaries of the Maratha empire. 25% of the levy, called babti, went to the chhatrapati and he also had discretionary grant making authority over the nadgaunda proceeds which amounted to 3% of the total collection. 6% of the chauth collections was granted to the pant sachiv, the officer in charge of the royal secretariat and was called the sahotra grant. Two-thirds of the collections however remained with the Maratha sardars who collected the taxes and they used it for maintaining their troops for the chhatrapati. This part of the levy was called mokasa. The chauth along with sardeshmukhi levies ensured a steady and large stream of income for the Marathas and helped them expand their beyond the swarajya territories of Shivaji. The right to assess and collect this tax was asserted first by Shivaji in the later 17th century, on grounds that his family were hereditary tax collectors in Maharashtra.

As in the case of radio halos, they do not have any obvious galaxy counterpart, but their shapes are much more elongated and irregular compared to those of radio halos. Their energy distribution is steep (much more energy at low radio frequency than at high radio frequency), with hints of a distribution of different ages for the emitting electrons across the whole dimension of the emitting region. Radio relics can be divided into two main groups: Cluster radio shocks or radio gischt are large elongated, often Mpc-sized, radio sources located in the periphery of merging clusters. They probably trace shock fronts in which particles are accelerated via the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. Among them are double-relics with the two relics located on both sides of a cluster center. Their integrated radio spectrum usually follows a single power-law. Radio phoenices are related to radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). Fossil radio plasma from a previous episode of AGN activity is thought to be compressed by a merger shock wave which boosts, both, the magnetic field inside the plasma as well as the momenta of the relativistic particles. As a result, the radio plasma brightens in synchrotron emission. In contrast to the radio gischt, the phoenices have a steep curved spectrum indicating an old population of electrons. The sizes of relics and the distance to the cluster centre vary significantly. Examples for radio relics with sizes of 1 Mpc or even larger have been observed in Coma (the prototype relic source 1253 + 275), Abell 2255 and Abell 2256, which contain both a relic and a halo (as do Abell 225, Abell 521, Abell 754, Abell 1300, Abell 2255 and Abell 2744). The cluster Abell 3667 contains two very luminous, almost symmetric relics with a separation of more than 5 Mpc, as does ZwCl 2341.1+0000, Abell 2345, Abell 1240, and ZwCl 0008.8+5215. The relic with the best evidence for shock acceleration found to date is located in the northern outskirts of the merging galaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301.

Bongho-Nouarra's government was named on September 7;IPU-PARLINE page on the 1992 parliamentary election.\\"Sep 1992 - New Prime Minister and Cabinet\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 38, September 1992, Congo, page 39,083. according to Bongho-Nouarra, his government was a \\"war cabinet\\", and he promised an \\"all-out assault\\" aimed at solving Congo's problems. He also said that the members of his government were selected for their expertise rather than their political experience. The PCT was unhappy with the small number of portfolios it received in Bongho- Nouarra's government.John F. Clark, \\"Congo: Transition and the Struggle to Consolidate\\", in Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, pages 71-72. It joined with the opposition Union for Democratic Renewal (URD) seven-party alliance to form a parliamentary majority against UPADS, and consequently Bongho-Nouarra's government was defeated in a no-confidence vote on October 31, 1992;\\"Nov 1992 - Government crisis\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 38, November 1992, Congo, page 39,179. the AND deputies were not present for the vote, and it was conducted by a show of hands. As a result of the vote, Bongho-Nouarra resigned on November 11 and Lissouba, rather than appoint a new prime minister from the opposition alliance, dissolved the National Assembly on November 17.\\"Dec 1992 - New government\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 38, December 1992, Congo, page 39,227. Although he wanted Bongho-Nouarra to remain in office until a new parliamentary election was held, the opposition demanded that the National Assembly be restored and that Bongho-Nouarra's government resign; in a protest on November 30, three people were killed by security forces.I.

Vogeli, \\"Prevention Gained and Prevention Lost: Collapse, Competition, and Coup in Congo\\", in Opportunities Missed, Opportunities Seized: Preventive Diplomacy in the Post-Cold War World (2000), ed. Bruce W. Jentleson, page 272. The army urged the appointment of a new government with a neutral prime minister and warned that it could stage a coup if the situation continued. An agreement was reached on December 3 to form a national unity government and Lissouba appointed Claude Antoine Dacosta to replace Bongho-Nouarra on December 6. After leaving office as Prime Minister, Bongho-Nouarra again acted as coordinator of the pro-Lissouba parties in campaigning for the May-June 1993 parliamentary election.Africa Research Bulletin (1993), page 10,847. He also continued to hold high-level posts during Lissouba's presidency, serving as Special Adviser to the President of the Republic, with the rank of Minister of State, as President of the Sociocultural Committee, and then as Minister of National Defense. He left Congo-Brazzaville at the time of the 1997 Civil War, but temporarily returned for a national dialogue in 1998. While in exile, he backed an exile group, the Patriotic Front for Dialogue and National Reconciliation (FPDRN), which called for peace and reconciliation and did not challenge the legitimacy of President Denis Sassou Nguesso. This group was founded in Paris in October 2000.Ousmane Sow, \\"Des exil√©s press√©s de rentrer au pays\\", Jeune Afrique, November 14, 2000 . Bongho-Nouarra lived in Brussels, Belgium in poor health for several years before he died there on October 7, 2007. On October 8, Sassou Nguesso called his death \\"a great loss\\". Bongho-Nouarra's body was returned to Congo- Brazzaville on October 22, and he was buried at a cemetery in Brazzaville on October 23.

He was the eldest son of Hendrick van Uylenburgh and took over the family art-dealing business after Hendrick's death and burial in the Westerkerk church in 1661. This business, then in a house on Lauriergracht, formerly owned by Govaert Flinck, played a key role in the art world of the Dutch Golden Age.  Life  According to Arnold Houbraken, he started off as a landscape painter and painted rooms in the house of a wealthy man in Amsterdam. He soon saw he could earn more money dealing in art than in painting himself.Gerard Uilenburg biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Like his father he took young promising painters into his service, such as Hendrick Fromantiou, Jurriaen Ovens and Gerard de Lairesse. He expanded the business internationally and sold many Italian masters and classical sculptures alongside Dutch art. The English painter Peter Lely and king John II Casimir of Poland both had Gerrit as their agent. In 1660 he advised the Cornelis and his younger brother Andries de Graeff, one of the heads of the States-General of the Netherlands on their lavish Dutch Gift to Charles II of England. In 1671 he organised the auction of Gerrit Reynst's collection and offered thirteen paintings and some sculptures from among those which had not sold at the auction to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. However, on Fromantiou's advice, Frederick accused them of being counterfeits and sent them back. Van Uylenburg then organized a counter-assessment, asking a total of 35 painters to pronounce on their authenticity, including Jan Lievens, Melchior de Hondecoeter, Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, Barend Graat and Johannes Vermeer. In 1675 van Uylenburgh hit financial problems, as a result of the war with France, falling art prices, and possibly due to the damage to his reputation from the Brandenburg affair. His business went bankrupt and Gerrit moved to London, where Lely exerted his influence at court and secured him the post of Surveyor of the King‚Äôs Pictures. He died in 1679. In 2006 the Rembrandt House Museum presented an exhibition about Hendrick and Gerrit. The exhibition was also shown at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London.  References  * Dudok van Heel, S.A.C.

The \\"wiki went public\\" in March 1995‚Äîthe date used in anniversary celebrations of the wiki's origins. c2.com is thus the first true wiki, or a website with pages and links that can be easily edited via the browser, with a reliable version history for each page. He chose \\"WikiWikiWeb\\" as the name based on his memories of the \\"Wiki Wiki Shuttle\\" at Honolulu International Airport, and because \\"wiki\\" is the Hawaiian word for \\"quick\\". Wiki software has some conceptual origins in the version control and hypertext systems used for documentation and software in the 1980s, and some actualized origins in the 1970s \\"Journal\\" feature of NLS. Its distant ancestors include Vannevar Bush's proposed \\"memex\\" system in 1945, the collaborative hypertext database ZOG in 1972, the NoteCards system from Xerox, the Apple hypertext system HyperCard. As was typical of these earlier systems, Cunningham's motive was technical: to facilitate communication between software developers. Many alternative wiki applications and websites appeared over the next five years. In the meantime, the first wiki, now known as \\"WardsWiki\\", evolved as features were added to the software and as the growing body of users developed a unique \\"wiki culture\\". By 2000, WardsWiki had developed a great deal of content outside its original stated purpose, which led to the spinoff of content into sister sites, most notably MeatballWiki. The website Wikipedia, a free content encyclopedia, was launched in January 2001, and quickly became the most popular wiki, which it remains to this day. Its meteoric rise in popularity (it entered the top ten most popular sites in 2007) played a large part in introducing wikis to the general public. There now exist at least hundreds of thousands of wiki websites, and they have become increasingly prevalent in corporations and other organizations. Hypertext editing pre-1994 A distant precursor of the wiki concept was Vannevar Bush's vision of the \\"memex,\\" a microfilm reader which would create automated links between documents. In a 1945 essay in Atlantic Monthly titled \\"As We May Think,\\" Bush described an imaginary future user interface: \\"Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions‚Ä¶ The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined‚Ä¶ Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn‚Ä¶\\" This vision, though it has been described as predicting the World Wide Web, resembles wikis more than the web in one important way: the system being described is self-contained, not a loose network. In 1972 Kristo Ivanov published a PhD dissertation on Quality-control of information,Ivanov, Kristo (1972). Quality-control of information. Stockholm: The Royal Institute of Technology KTH. (Doctoral diss. NTIS, # PB-219297.) containing a theoretical basis for what corresponds to the wiki- idea, in terms of systemic social interaction. Information turns into knowledge as a net of contributions and negotiations converge about a core concept, or entity. The emphasis is on a dynamically documented \\"agreement in the context of maximum possible disagreement,\\" akin to the discussions in talk pages and the results of view history of Wikipedia. =Pre-World-Wide-Web hypertext systems= An indirect precursor of the wiki concept was the ZOG multi-user database system, developed in 1972 by researchers at Carnegie- Mellon University. The ZOG interface consisted of text-only frames, each containing a title, a description, a line with standard ZOG commands, and a set of selections (hypertext links) leading to other frames. Two members of the ZOG team, Donald McCracken and Robert Akscyn, spun off a company from CMU in 1981 and developed an improved version of ZOG called Knowledge Management System (KMS). KMS was a collaborative tool based on direct manipulation, permitting users to modify the contents of frames, freely intermixing text, graphics and images, any of which could be linked to other frames. Because the database was distributed and accessible from any workstation on a network, changes became visible immediately to other users, enabling them to work concurrently on shared structures (documents, programs, ...). Three notable hypertext-based systems emerged in the 1980s, that may have been inspired by ZOG, KMS and/or one another: the NoteCards system, developed in 1984 and released by Xerox in 1985; Janet Walker's Symbolics Document Examiner, created in 1985 for the operation manuals of Symbolics computers; and Bill Atkinson's WildCard application, on which he began work in 1985, and which was released in 1987 as HyperCard. Ward Cunningham has stated, that the wiki idea was influenced by his experience using HyperCard: he was shown the software by fellow programmer Kent Beck, before its official release (it was still called \\"WildCard\\" at the time), and, in his words, was \\"blown away\\" by it. Cunningham used HyperCard to make a stack holding three kinds of information: ideas, people who hold ideas, and projects where people share ideas. (He would later use this same architecture for the Patterns, People and Projects listed on the front page of his original wiki, the WikiWikiWeb.) Cunningham made a single card that would serve for all uses. It had three fields: Name, Description and Links. Cunningham configured the system so that links could be created to cards that didn't exist yet; creating such a link would in turn create a new blank card. =The World Wide Web= In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee of CERN built the first hypertext client, which he called World Wide Web (it was also a Web editor), and the first hypertext server (info.cern.ch). In 1991 he posted a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the alt.hypertext newsgroup, marking the debut of the Web as a publicly available service on the Internet. Early adopters of the World Wide Web were primarily university-based scientific departments or physics laboratories. In May 1992 appeared ViolaWWW, a graphical browser providing features such as embedded graphics, scripting, and animation. However, the turning point for the World Wide Web was the introduction of the Mosaic graphical browser in 1993, which gained wide popularity due to its strong support of integrated multimedia. In April 1994, CERN agreed that anyone could use the Web protocol and code for free. WikiWikiWeb and the birth of wikis (1994-2001) =WikiWikiWeb, the first wiki= Ward Cunningham started developing the WikiWikiWeb in 1994 as a supplement to the Portland Pattern Repository, a website containing documentation about Design Patterns, a particular approach to object-oriented programming. The WikiWikiWeb was intended as a collaborative database, in order to make the exchange of ideas between programmers easier; it was dedicated to \\"People, Projects and Patterns.\\" Cunningham wrote the software to run it using the Perl programming language. He considered calling the software \\"quick-web,\\" but instead named it using the Hawaiian word \\"wiki-wiki,\\" which means \\"quick-quick\\" or \\"very quick,\\" based on his memory of the Wiki Wiki Shuttle at Honolulu International Airport. Cunningham installed a prototype of the software on his company Cunningham & Cunningham's website c2.com.http://c2.com/wiki/mail-history.txt On March 16, 1995, when the site was functioning, Cunningham sent to a colleague the following email: :Steve - I've put up a new database on my web server and I'd like you to take a look. It's a web of people, projects and patterns accessed through a cgi-bin script. It has a forms-based authoring capability that doesn't require familiarity with html. I'd be very pleased if you would get on and at least enter your name in RecentVisitors. I'm asking you because I think you might also add some interesting content. I'm going to advertise this a little more widely in a week or so. The URL is http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki. Thanks and best regards. ‚Äì Ward Cunningham dates the official start of WikiWikiWeb as March 25, 1995. On May 1, 1995 he sent an email about the website to a number of programmers, which caused an increase in participation. This note was posted to the \\"Patterns\\" listserv, a group of software developers gathered under the name \\"The Hillside Group\\" to develop Erich Gamma's use of object-oriented patterns. Cunningham had noticed that the older contents of the listserv tended to get buried under the more recent posts, and he proposed instead to collect ideas in a set of pages which would be collectively edited. Cunningham's post stated: \\"The plan is to have interested parties write web pages about the People, Projects and Patterns that have changed the way they program.\\" He added: \\"Think of it as a moderated list where anyone can be moderator and everything is archived. It's not quite a chat, still, conversation is possible.\\"Robert E. Cummings, What Was a Wiki, and Why Do I Care? A Short and Usable History of Wikis Website in the Internet Archive The site was immediately popular within the pattern community. =CamelCase and internal links= Among Cunningham's innovations in creating WikiWikiWeb was the ability to easily link internally between pages; something that was often cumbersome to do in previous intranet and document management systems. Cunningham's solution to this was to automatically link any text expressed in CamelCase; including text for which a corresponding page didn't yet exist. This CamelCase convention was used by most wiki software for the first few years of wikis' existence. In 2001, the software UseModWiki, which at the time was in use on Wikipedia, switched to allow internal links to be done using standard spelling and double square bracket instead, in order to improve Wikipedia's usability.Hello, \\"FreeLinks\\" work, and redirected pages., Clifford Adams, Wikipedia-l mailing list, January 27, 2001 This square bracket syntax has since become more of a default convention for internal links within wiki software in general. =Release of the Wiki Base software= Ward Cunningham wrote a version of his wiki software meant for public usage, called \\"Wiki Base\\". In his announcement, he wrote: \\"WikiWikiWeb is almost public. Actually, a pretty good clone of it is public at: https://web.archive.org/web/20030801073834/http://c2.com/cgi/wikibase. I've translated almost all of the actual wiki script into HyperPerl, a wiki- literate programming system that I think you will like.\\" Visitors were requested to register on the wiki before they took the Wiki Base code. Cunningham expected users to fold changes back into his editable version, but those who implemented changes generally chose to distribute the modified versions on their own sites. Alternate applications for wikis began to emerge, usually imitating the look-and-feel of WikiWikiWeb/Wiki Base; such applications were originally known as \\"WikiWikiClones.\\" The first one was most likely created by IBM programmer Patrick Mueller, who wrote his in the REXX language, even before Wiki Base was released. =Early wiki websites for software development= Inspired by the example of the WikiWikiWeb, programmers soon started several other wikis to build knowledge bases about programming topics. Wikis became popular in the free and open-source software (FOSS) community, where they were used for collaboratively discussing and documenting software. However, being used only by specialists, these early software-focused wikis failed to attract widespread public attention.Andy Szybalski, Why it‚Äôs not a wiki world (yet), 14 March 2005 =Growth and innovations in WikiWikiWeb from 1995 to 2000= The WikiWikiWeb website approximately doubled in size every year 1995 to 2000, with disk usage rising from around 2 megabytes in 1995 to around 60 megabytes at the end of 2000. During that time, various innovations were put in place, many suggested by users, to help with navigation and editing. These included: *1995 ‚Äì RecentVisitors, PeopleIndex: pages to help users know who was contributing *1995 ‚Äì NotSoRecentChanges: excess lines from the RecentChanges page were (manually) copied to a file of \\"ChangesIn\\" *1996 ‚Äì EditCopy: offers the possibility to edit the backup copy of a page (this was replaced in 2002 with Page History) *1996 ‚Äì ThreadMode: the form of a page where community members hold a discussion, each signing their own contribution *1996 ‚Äì WikiCategories: categories can be added as an automatic index to pages *1997 ‚Äì RoadMaps: proposed lists of pages to consult about specific topics, such as the Algorithms RoadMap or the Leadership RoadMap *1999 ‚Äì ChangeSummary: an aid to telling which changes added interesting new content and which were only minor *2000 ‚Äì UserName: the Wiki will accept a cookie that specifies a User Name to be used in place of the host name (IP identity) in the RecentChanges log \\"ThreadMode\\" was defined as \\"a form of discussion where our community holds a conversation.\\" It consists of a series of signed comments added down the page in chronological order. Ward Cunningham generally frowned on ThreadMode, writing: \\"Chronological is only one of many possible organizations of technical writing and rarely the best one at that.\\" Cunningham encouraged contributors to \\"refactor\\" (rewrite) the ThreadMode discussions into DocumentMode discourse. In practice many pages started out at the top in DocumentMode and degenerated into ThreadMode further down. When ThreadMode became incomprehensible the result was called \\"ThreadMess.\\" (In most modern wikis the conflict between these two modes has been resolved by putting all document text on the main page of an article, and all discussion text on a talk page.) The use of categories was proposed by user Stan Silver on August 27, 1996. His initial post suggested: \\"If everyone adds a category and topic to their page, then the category and topic pages themselves can be used as automatic indexes into the pages.\\" Initially Silver had proposed both categories and topics: categories denoted the specific nature of the page's subject (a book, a person, a pattern), while topics denoted the theme of the page (Java, extreme programming, Smalltalk). However, people ignored this separation, and topics were collapsed into the categories. The \\"ChangeSummary\\" option began as an aid to telling which changes added interesting new content, and which were just minor adjustments of spelling, punctuation, or correction of web links. It started when some users began taking the RecentChanges page, annotating each line with a brief description of each change, and posting the result to the ChangeSummary page. This practice was highly time-consuming and rapidly petered out, but was replaced by the \\"MinorEdit/RecentEdits\\" feature, designed to reduce the RecentChanges clutter. =Tensions within WikiWikiWeb and the creation of sister sites= Between early 1998 and the end of 2000 participation in WikiWikiWeb snowballed, and the disk space consumed by wiki pages more than quadrupled. With increased participation tensions began to appear. In 1998 proponents of Extreme Programming showed up on the site and started posting comments about Extreme Programming on most of the pages related to software development. This annoyed a number people who wanted to talk about patterns, leading to the tag \\"XpFreeZone,\\" which was put onto pages as a request not to talk about ExtremeProgramming on that page. Eventually most of the DesignPatterns people left to discuss patterns on their own wikis, and WikiWikiWeb began to be referred to as \\"WardsWiki\\" instead of the \\"PortlandPatternRepository.\\" Around the summer of 1999, user Sam Gentile posted the comment \\"I'm through here\\" on his user page, and began systematically removing his text from all pages on WikiWikiWeb that he had contributed to. Gentile worked at Microsoft and had been hurt by what he perceived as anti-Microsoft bias on WikiWikiWeb. His deletions led to controversy about whether he had the right to remove his own material, and whether others had the right to put it back in (which some began to do). This event became referred to as the \\"WikiMindWipe.\\" In April 2000, four WikiWikiWeb users independently tried to reduce the amount of text on the site via a large number of deletions. They mainly tried to delete material that was related to wikis and not software design patterns. They considered this material to be dead weight, and would have preferred to see it all replaced by concise guidance to newcomers. Contributors who disagreed with these deletions began copying all of the deleted text back in again. A vote was taken on the issue, and it was proposed that any major reductions should be pre-announced, with an opportunity for response before action was taken. The longer-term result of the deletions was the formation of WikiWikiWeb \\"sister sites\\" later in 2000. Sunir Shah created a wiki called MeatballWiki, intended strictly for wiki-based documentation and discussions. A few months later, Richard Drake created the WhyClublet (or \\"Why?\\") wiki to host discussion of Christian issues, and Peter Merel created GreenCheeseWiki and The Reform Society to host, respectively, whimsical and political pages. Earle Martin subsequently created a catch-all for C2 off-topic pages called TheAdjunct. Many pages were moved from WikiWikiWeb to these alternative sites, with a stub of the moved page left on the WikiWikiWeb, containing a link to the new page and the message \\"This page exists only on SisterSites.\\" In 2001, Cunningham and user Bo Leuf published a book, The Wiki Way, which distilled the lessons learned during the collective experience of the first wiki.Ward Cunningham and Bo Leuf, The Wiki Way, 2001 =Other wiki websites, 1999-2000= While many early wiki websites were devoted to the development of open source software, one early wiki was created by the FoxPro user community. The FoxPro Wiki was founded in 1999 by Steven Black and evolved into a popular site with many pages. World66 was a Dutch company which tried to transform the open content idea into a profitable business. The website was founded in 1999 by Richard and Douwe Osinga, and contains travel-related articles covering destinations around the world. A wiki forum was created in 1999 for discussion of the newly created PhpWiki software. This became one of the larger software-related wikis. Sensei's Library, a wiki dedicated to discussion of the game of Go, was created by Morten G. Pahle and Arno Hollosi in October 2000. For its first few years of operation, it was one of the largest and most active wikis outside Wikipedia. =Other wiki applications, 1997-2000= Clones of the WikiWikiWeb software began to be developed as soon as Ward Cunningham made the Wiki Base software available online. One of the early clones was CvWiki, developed in 1997 by Peter Merel, which was the first wiki application to have functioning transclusion, backlinks, and \\"WayBackMode.\\" JWikiJWiki page on c2.com (short for JavaWiki), released in 1997, was the first implementation of WikiWikiWeb in the Java language, and the first to be back-ended by a database. It was developed by Ricardo Clements, a former co-worker of Cunningham's. Another early wiki engine was JosWiki, developed by an international group of Java programmers who were trying to create a free and open \\"Java Operating System\\" (JOS). TWiki was created in Perl by Peter Thoeny in 1998, based on JosWiki. TWiki was aimed at large corporate intranets. It stored data in plain text files instead of in a database. PikiPiki was created by Martin Pool in 1999 as a rewrite of WikiWikiWeb in Python. It was made to be a small program, using flat files and doing away with versioning (Pool felt that a wiki is not meant to be a document-management system). PhpWiki, created by Steve Wainstead in 1999, was the first wiki software written in PHP. The initial version was a feature-for-feature reimplementation of the WikiWikiWeb software. Subsequent versions adopted many features from UseModWiki. Swiki was written in Squeak by Mark Guzdial and Jochen Rick in 1999. Zwiki, written in Python in 1999, is based on the Zope web application server (it can also co-exist with the Plone content management system). It was initially developed by Simon Michael and Joyful Systems. It uses a ZODB Object Database. Traction TeamPage was released in December 1999; it was the first proprietary wiki application aimed at enterprise customers. UseModWiki was developed from 1999 to 2000 by Clifford Adams. UseModWiki is a flat-file wiki written in Perl. It was based on Markus Denker's AtisWiki, which was in turn based on CvWiki. It introduced the square bracket syntax for linking words that was later adopted by many other wiki engines, such as MediaWiki. MoinMoin, created in Python by J√ºrgen Hermann and Thomas Waldmann in mid-2000, was initially based on PikiPiki. It is a flat- file wiki with a simple code base but many possible extensions. MoinMoin uses the idea of separating the parsers (for parsing the wiki syntax) from the formatters (for outputting HTML code), with an interface between them, so that new parsers and output formatters can be written. 2001-2003: Wikipedia's early years =The creation of Wikipedia= Until 2001, wikis were virtually unknown outside the restricted circles of computer programmers. Wikis were introduced to the general public by the success of Wikipedia, a free content encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone. Wikipedia was originally conceived as a complement to Nupedia, a free on-line encyclopedia founded by Jimmy Wales, with articles written by highly qualified contributors and evaluated by an elaborate peer review process. The writing of content for Nupedia proved to be extremely slow, with only 12 articles completed during the first year, despite a mailing-list of interested editors and the presence of a full-time editor-in-chief recruited by Wales, Larry Sanger. Learning of the wiki concept, Wales and Sanger decided to try creating a collaborative website to provide an additional source of rapidly produced draft articles that could be polished for use on Nupedia. Nupedia's editors and reviewers resisted the idea of associating Nupedia with a wiki-style website, so Wikipedia was launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on January 15, 2001. It initially ran on UseModWiki software, with the original text stored in flat-files rather than in a database, and with articles named using the CamelCase convention. UseModWiki was replaced by a PHP wiki engine in January 2002 and by MediaWiki in July 2002. Wikipedia attracted new participants after being mentioned on Slashdot as well as in an article on the community-edited website Kuro5hin. It quickly overtook Nupedia. In the first year of its existence, over 20,000 encyclopedia entries were created. =Wikimedia Foundation and first Wikipedia sister projects= Wales, and other members of the Wikipedia user community, founded Wikipedia's first \\"sister site,\\" \\"In Memoriam: September 11 Wiki,\\" in October 2002;First edit to the wiki In Memoriam: September 11 wiki (October 28, 2002), it detailed the September 11 attacks. (This project was closed in October 2006.) A second sister site, Wiktionary, was created in December 2002; the site was meant to be a collaboratively created dictionary. In June 2003, Wales founded the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization, to manage Wikipedia and all its sister projects going forward. Two additional Wikimedia projects were added soon thereafter: Wikiquote, a reference for notable quotations, and Wikibooks, for collaboratively creating textbooks, both in July 2003. Another project, Wikisource, was added in November 2003; it was originally named \\"Project Sourceberg\\" (a play on Project Gutenberg), then renamed \\"Wikisource\\" in December 2003. =Other wiki websites, 2001‚Äì2003= MeatballWiki rapidly became a popular wiki for discussions of wiki-related topics. The users of MeatballWiki came up with several ideas on the linking together of wikis, including:ProgressionOfWikiOrganization ‚Äì WikiNodes *InterWikiMap, a simple interwiki linking system (2000) *MetaWiki, the idea of a wiki that helps people find other wikis (not to be confused with the Wikimedia Meta-Wiki) *OneBigWiki (2002), the idea of having one wiki distributed across several servers *SwitchWiki (2003): the idea of having one site where one can switch between wikis *WikiNode, a way to link wikis via a standard \\"node\\" page on each Some of these ideas were later implemented. For example, WikiIndex, a wiki that lists other wikis, was created in 2006, in an attempt to implement the MetaWiki and SwitchWiki ideas. The site also includes a WikiNode of its own and catalogs sites which include their own WikiNodes. Disinfopedia was launched by Sheldon Rampton in March 2003. It aimed to produce a directory of public relations firms and industry-funded organizations that attempt to influence public opinion and public policy. It was later renamed SourceWatch, and is currently run by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD). Javapedia was a wiki inspired by Wikipedia. The project was launched in June 2003 during the JavaOne developer conference, and was intended to cover all aspects of the Java platform. Wikitravel was started in July 2003 by Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins. Memory Alpha is a wiki devoted to the Star Trek fictional universe. It was launched by Harry Doddema and Dan Carlson in December 2003. For its first several years, it was one of the largest wiki projects. This period also saw the creation of several other general wiki encyclopedias, created either independently of Wikipedia or meant to serve as an alternative to Wikipedia in order to fix some perceived weakness in it: *Susning.nu was a Swedish-language wiki, created in October 2001, meant to serve as an encyclopedia, dictionary, and discussion forum. *Enciclopedia Libre was created in February 2002 as a fork of the Spanish- language Wikipedia, by a group of contributors to the Spanish Wikipedia, who left because of fears of censorship and the possibility of the placement of advertising on Wikipedia. *Wikinfo was launched in July 2003 as \\"Internet- Encyclopedia\\". It was a fork of the English-language Wikipedia, meant to hold original research and multiple articles on subjects from different points of view, instead of Wikipedia's policy of a single neutral-point-of-view article.Jane E. Klobas, Angela Beesley. Wikis: tools for information work and collaboration, Chandos, 2006, p. 46 In 2013, after a period of downtime, the content was removed and a new version of Wikinfo was started at Wikia; however, as of June 2017, Wikinfo had been restored on wikinfo.org and a search for \\"Wikinfo\\" on Wikia returned no results. *WikiZnanie is a Russian- language wiki encyclopedia created in 2003; it took most of its content from the Russian Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary of 1906. =Development of wiki software, 2001-2003= JSPWiki, created by Janne Jalkanen in 2001, is flat-file wiki software built around JavaServer Pages (JSP). JSPWiki adapted and extended the PhpWiki markup. It is primarily used for company and university intranets as a project wiki or a knowledge management application. It has also been used as a personal information manager (PIM). MediaWiki was written for Wikipedia in 2002 by Lee Daniel Crocker, based on the user interface design of an earlier PHP wiki engine developed by Magnus Manske. Manske's PHP-based software suffered load problems due to increased use, so Crocker re-wrote the software with a more scalable MySQL database backend. As Wikipedia grew, achieving scalability through multiple layers of caching and database replication became a major concern for the developers. Internationalization was also a major concern (the user interface has been translated into more than 70 languages). One of the earliest differences between MediaWiki and other wiki engines was the use of freely formatted links instead of links in CamelCase. MediaWiki provides specialized syntax to support rich content, such as rendering mathematical formulas using LaTeX, graphical plotting, image galleries and thumbnails, and Exif metadata. MediaWiki lacks native WYSIWYG support, but comes with a graphical toolbar to simplify editing. One MediaWiki innovation for structuring content is \\"namespaces.\\" Namespaces allow each article to contain multiple sheets with different standard names: one sheet presents the encyclopedic content, another contains the discussions surrounding it, and so on. PmWiki was created in PHP by Patrick Michaud in 2002. It is a flat-file wiki engine that was designed to be easy to install and customize. PmWiki offers a template scheme that makes it possible to change the look and feel of the wiki. Customization is made easy through a wide selection of custom extensions, known as \\"recipes\\" available from the PmWiki Cookbook. TikiWiki was created in PHP by Luis Argerich in 2002. It was later renamed \\"Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware\\", or simply \\"Tiki\\", as it gained additional CMS and groupware features. TikiWiki is modular with components that can be individually enabled and customized by the administrator, and extends customization to the user with selectable skins and themes. Socialtext launched in 2002; it was the second proprietary enterprise-focused wiki application, after Traction TeamPage. XWiki is an open-source Java wiki application that was created by Ludovic Dubost in January 2003. Dubost set up hosting of XWiki-based wikis on the domain xwiki.com in April 2003‚Äîxwiki.com thus became an early (and possibly the first) wiki hosting service, or \\"wiki farm.\\" As they developed, wikis incorporated many of the features used on other websites and blogs, including: *support for various wiki markup styles *editing of pages with a GUI editor, WYSIWYG, ad specific applications such as LaTeX *optional use of external editors *support for plugins and custom extensions *use of RSS feeds *integrated email discussion *precise access control *spam protection 2004-2006: an explosion in interest The period from 2004 to 2006 saw an explosion in interest in both wikis generally and Wikipedia in particular, and both started to become household terms. Corporations, organizations and other communities began to make increasing use of wikis. Many of the wiki-based sites, technologies and events that dominate today were started during that period. In October 2004, the wiki hosting service Wikicities launched, co- founded by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and Wikimedia Foundation board member Angela Beesley. In March 2006, it changed its name to Wikia. Wikia remains one of the largest and most popular wiki farms. A large number of other notable wiki farms were released soon afterward, including Wikispaces (launched March 2005), PBwiki (launched June 2005, later renamed PBworks), and Wetpaint (launched October 2005). Wikidot was launched in August 2006. 2005 marked the beginning of large-scale wiki-related meetings and conferences. August 2005 saw the first-ever Wikimania, an annual conference organized around Wikimedia Foundation projects, in Frankfurt, Germany. WikiSym, a more academic annual symposium about wikis in general, was first held a few months later, in October 2005, in San Diego, California. RecentChangesCamp, an unconference dedicated to wikis, was first held in February 2006 in Portland, Oregon. Wikimania and WikiSym remain the two largest wiki-related gatherings. Around 2005 wikis began to be massively confronted with \\"wiki spam,\\" produced by spammers who enter website addresses onto wikis in order to improve the ranking of the displayed websites by search engines. Various strategies have been developed to counter wiki spam. =Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects= Wikipedia experienced exponential growth in usage and readership during the period from 2004 to 2006, rising in Alexa rankings from the top 1000 websites into the top 15.Wikipedia's Alexa ranking milestones (3 month average), Wikimedia Meta It was named one of the top 5 global brands of 2006 in the Brandchannel Readers' Choice Awards.Similar Search Results: Google Wins , Anthony Zumpano, Brandchannel, January 29, 2007 In 2004 the Wikimedia Foundation launched three new sites: Wikispecies, for cataloging species, in August 2004, Wikimedia Commons, to hold images and other media used by the Wikimedia projects, in September 2004, and Wikinews, for publishing collaborative news articles, in December 2004. Wikiversity, intended for tutorials and other courseware, was later launched in August 2006. In November 2005, journalist John Seigenthaler wrote a much-publicized article in USA Today about Wikipedia's article about him, which for over four months had contained a false statement about him, inserted as a joke, stating that he had been a suspect in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. The USA Today article generated a subsequent controversy that both caused Wikipedia to tighten its standards for creating articles, especially articles about living people, and highlighted the growing importance of Wikipedia as a source of information. During this period, Wikipedia also began to enter the popular culture. A prominent example was the Weird Al Yankovic parody song \\"White & Nerdy,\\" which peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 2006, and contained the lyric \\"I edit Wikipedia.\\" In December 2006, Time magazine chose \\"You\\" as their Person of the Year, referring to the rise of Web 2.0 and web technologies that allow for user-contributed content, and cited Wikipedia as one of the key websites that allow for \\"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before.\\" =Other wiki websites, 2004-2006= In July 2004, OpenStreetMap, a website to create an open-source street map of the world using wiki functionality, was launched. Most of the major parody-based wikis launched at around this time. Encyclopedia Dramatica, which mocked internet culture, was founded in December 2004 (it was shut down in April 2011). Stupidedia, a German-language wiki intended as a direct spoof of Wikipedia, was also founded in December 2004, a week later. Uncyclopedia, an English- language wiki also intended to parody Wikipedia, was founded the next month, in January 2005; it was later extended to dozens of other languages, and merged in other wikis, including Stupidedia. La Frikipedia, a Spanish-language parody of Wikipedia, was founded in October 2005. In January 2005, the wiki wikiHow was created as a component of the how-to website eHow. In April 2006, its creators sold off eHow and focused full-time on wikiHow, which was launched at its own domain. Both sites receive tens of millions of hits a month. In April 2006, the company Internet Brands bought the sites WikiTravel and World66. The purchase of WikiTravel by a commercial entity led to the creation of the non-commercial travel wiki Wikivoyage by some former WikiTravel authors and administrators in December 2006. Wikivoyage originally held content in German and Italian, and started as a fork of WikiTravel content; in 2013 it would become a WMF site. Two major Chinese wiki encyclopedias began in 2006: Baidu Baike in April and Hudong in November. Both currently hold millions of articles, and exceed the popularity of the Chinese Wikipedia within China. Both are for-profit wikis, that, unlike Wikipedia, hold the copyright to their own content. =Development of wiki software, 2004-2006= This period saw the launch of many wiki applications geared toward corporate/enterprise users. Such software was usually proprietary, and it usually included additional functionality, such as blogs and project management tools. Notable wiki software launched during this time includes: * Trac (February 2004), created by Edgewall Software. Trac is an open source bug tracking and project management application, with wiki functionality. * Confluence (March 2004), created by Atlassian. * DokuWiki (July 2004), an open-source application intended for small companies' documentation needs. * JotSpot (October 2004), created by JotSpot, Inc. JotSpot was bought by Google in 2006 for an undisclosed amount; Google would later release the technology, in modified form, as Google Sites in 2008. * SamePage (April 2006), created by eTouch Systems. * Redmine (June 2006), an open source application similar to Trac. * DekiWiki (July 2006), an open source application created by MindTouch, Inc. It had started as a fork of MediaWiki, but was then significantly rewritten before its release. DekiWiki was later renamed to \\"Deki,\\" then \\"MindTouch Core\\". * Clearspace (December 2006), created by Jive Software. Clearspace was later renamed \\"Jive SBS,\\" then \\"Jive Engage\\" and then Jive. wikiCalc, a wiki-based spreadsheet application, was launched in November 2005 by spreadsheet pioneer Dan Bricklin. In this period a number of semantic wiki applications were launched, including the currently most popular one, Semantic MediaWiki (which was first announced at Wikimania 2005). FlexWiki In September 2004 Microsoft released its FlexWiki, making its source code available on SourceForge. The code was written primarily by David Ornstein, and the engine is open source, licensed under IBM's Common Public License. FlexWiki was the third Microsoft project to be distributed via SourceForge.net, after Windows Installer XML (WiX) and Windows Template Library (WTL). FlexWiki uses .NET technology and has an integrated scripting language called WikiTalk. WikiTalk is based on the Smalltalk programming language (hence its name). It is a simple object oriented language that allows users to add dynamic behaviors to their topics. While most wiki software systems use a DBMS to store their content, FlexWiki started out with a textual storage system. Content was stored in text files, reducing some of the administrative overhead of maintaining a wiki site. With the release of v1.8.01653, it became possible to store FlexWiki's content in an SQL Server database. It was generally not necessary to scale FlexWiki due to the advanced caching, but scaling was possible using SQL Server, providing that caching is turned off. One of the primary developers of FlexWiki, Craig Andera, left the project in 2008. The internal Microsoft discussion forum Channel 9 used FlexWiki for a period of time, but no longer does. Though it was generally well received, it failed to become popular and was discontinued in December 2008. In November 2006 Microsoft released Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, with wiki and blog functionality added, which subsequently replaced FlexWiki as Microsoft's wiki product. 2007-present: wikis enter the mainstream A milestone in public acceptance of wikis was reached in March 2007 when the word \\"wiki\\" entered the Oxford English Dictionary.Wiki elevated to Oxford English Dictionary, Lester Haines, The Register, March 16, 2007 In January 2007, Amazon.com released Amapedia, a product-review wiki on its own website; it was shut down in June 2010. In 2007, ShoutWiki, a wiki farm, was founded as an alternative to Wikia. In February 2007, Penguin Books launched a wiki to create the planned novel A Million Penguins, in a well-publicized experiment at creating a crowd-generated novel. The wiki was shut down a month later, not having created a coherent work. In March 2007, Larry Sanger, co- founder of Wikipedia, launched Citizendium, an \\"expert-guided\\" encyclopedia wiki requiring participants to use their real names. In 2010, the site WikiLeaks (which had been founded in 2006) gained a great deal of both fame and notoriety as a result of a set of leaked documents the site published of classified materials from the United States government, notably footage of the July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike, the Afghan War documents leak and the United States diplomatic cables leak. The site runs on the MediaWiki application, and began as a wiki editable by anyone, but in 2010 had its permissions changed so that only its administrators could edit pages. =Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects, 2007-present= In 2007, Wikipedia entered the top 10 most popular websites in the world.Wikipedia Now Among Top 10 Most Popular Sites, Chris Sabga, infopackets, February 23, 2007 Wikipedia began to be heavily referenced in television and other media during 2007; see Wikipedia in culture. In August 2008, then-U.S. presidential candidate John McCain was accused of plagiarizing Wikipedia in a speech about Georgia.McCain faces accusations of Wikipedia plagiarism , The Calgary Herald, August 19, 2008 In June 2009, journalist Chris Anderson admitted to plagiarizing a series of Wikipedia articles in his book Free: The Future of a Radical Price. Anderson called it a \\"screwup,\\" based on lack of clarity on how to cite a specific version of a Wikipedia article. January 2011 saw the 10th anniversary of the creation of Wikipedia, with a large round of coverage in the international media, most of it positive, including a cover story in German newspaper Die Zeit with the headline, \\"The greatest work of mankind.\\"Photo of January 12, 2011 Die Zeit cover, TwitPic In March 2012, a proposal was made to have the Wikimedia Foundation host a wiki containing travel advice,Earliest edit to page now called \\"Wikivoyage\\", Wikimedia Meta-Wiki which led to a discussion and vote lasting several months. In August 2012 the company Internet Brands, owners of the Wikitravel site, sued two of its contributors who had spoken out in favor of the proposal.Travel Site Built on Wiki Ethos Now Bedevils Its Owner, Noam Cohen, The New York Times, September 9, 2012 That lawsuit in turn led the Wikimedia Foundation to sue Internet Brands in September 2012 to not \\"impede, disrupt or block the creation of\\" such a site.Wikimedia Foundation seeks declaratory relief in response to legal threats from Internet Brands, Kelly Kay, Wikimedia Blog, September 5, 2012 The community proposal to host a travel guide wiki was successful, and the decision was made to incorporate Wikivoyage, a Wikitravel spinoff site, as a project. The Wikidata project, which had been discussed in various guises for some time, was officially launched on October 30, 2012. Wikidata is a collaborative data repository meant to provide data that can be used by Wikipedia across all its languages. January 14, 2013 saw the first official use of Wikidata: to enable the automatic display of \\"interlanguage links\\" within articles on the Hungarian Wikipedia. January 15, 2013, the 12th anniversary of Wikipedia's founding, saw the launch of the new, Wikimedia-hosted Wikivoyage. The lawsuits regarding Wikivoyage between Wikimedia and Internet Brands were settled out of court the next month. Reuse of Wikipedia data Several applications were developed during this time to make use of Wikipedia's data in order to improve both structured querying and natural-language searching. These included: * DBpedia, launched in January 2007; a project to publish structured data from Wikipedia in machine-readable, queriable form. By 2008, it became a major component of the Linked Data initiative.Sir Tim Berners-Lee Talks with Talis about the Semantic Web . Transcript of an interview recorded on 7 February 2008. * Freebase, launched by the company Metaweb in May 2007. Freebase stores information from Wikipedia and other sources in a structured, queriable format. Metaweb and Freebase were bought by Google in July 2010. The software later provided part of the technology behind the Google Knowledge Graph, launched in May 2012. * Powerset, a company founded in 2005, in May 2008 released a search engine that used data from the English Wikipedia to answer natural-language queries. It was bought by Microsoft in July 2008, with the goal of improving results for the Bing search engine. The Wikimedia Foundation project Wikidata is meant to provide a collaborative set of data that can make such querying easier, and available across all languages. =Wiki software, 2007-present= This period saw consolidation in the set of wiki software being used. A large number of wiki engines ended development during this time, including FlexWiki, MojoMojo, PhpWiki, UseModWiki and Zwiki. In October 2008, most developers of TWiki left the project to work on a fork of the code, Foswiki, after creator Peter Thoeny took control of the TWiki code and trademark via his company, TWiki.net.TWiki's hunt for cash fractures its community, Matt Asay, CNET News, October 29, 2008 In May 2009, Google announced its Google Wave platform (and its associated Federation protocol), which would combine the functionality of wikis with e-mail, instant messaging and social networking in order to provide a collaborative, real-time, server- hosted communication platform. Google Wave was released to the general public in May 2010, but development on it was ended several months later, in August 2010. In December 2010, Google transferred control of the software's development to the Apache Foundation, and it was renamed \\"Apache Wave.\\" In December 2010, wiki functionality was added to the SAP NetWeaver Portal application.SAP Netweaver Portal 7.3 ramp-up released , Ameya's Blog, December 3, 2010 In 2011, a wiki application, named Phriction, was added to the open- source collaboration suite Phabricator. In April 2013, MindTouch Inc. abandoned its open-source product and moved to MindTouch being only a proprietary, hosted service. In July 2013, Wetpaint sold off its wiki service to WikiFoundry, having changed its business model to the hosting of professionally generated content.

Signed by Jimmy Dunne from junior side Clontarf, he was associated with Shamrock Rovers from 1948 to 1973, firstly as a player and then as a coach. He made his debut against Transport in Bray on 28 August 1949 in a Dublin City Cup game. He was one of the club's best ever strikers. During his career at Rovers he scored 109 League goals which is a club record . He was the leading scorer at the club in 1953‚Äì54, 1954‚Äì55, 1955‚Äì56 (20 goals) and 1960‚Äì61. When Rovers won the title in 1953‚Äì54, their first title for fifteen years, Paddy scored 13 goals. Paddy won a League medal with Shamrock Rovers four times, in 1953‚Äì54, 1956‚Äì57, 1958‚Äì59 and 1963‚Äì64. He played in six FAI Cup finals plus one replay and won four winner's medals in the following years, 1955, 1956, 1962 and 1964. Paddy made 6 appearances in European competition for Rovers. The man who became famous for wearing the green and white hooped number nine shirt was capped by Ireland five times, scoring once, also earning two B caps and one amateur international cap for the Republic of Ireland national football team. Paddy shared a testimonial with Gerry Mackey in May 1959. The great service of Paddy Ambrose to Rovers was marked by the presentation of a gold medal by the directors.

Plot summary A group of European tourists are enjoying their trip to Egypt in the year 1895. They are sailing up the River Nile in \\"a turtle-bottomed, round-bowed stern-wheeler\\", the Korosko. They intend to travel to Abousir at the southern frontier of Egypt, after which the Dervish country starts. They are attacked and abducted by a marauding band of Dervish warriors. The novel contains a strong defence of British Imperialism and in particular the Imperial project in North Africa. It also reveals the very great suspicion of Islam felt by many Europeans at the time.  Fires of Fate  Doyle later adapted his novel into a 1909 play Fires of Fate.

This station played a vital role in liberation struggle, broadcasting the Declaration of Independence and increasing mental state of Bangladeshis during the war. In 1971, radio was the only media reaching to the far ends of Bangladesh. It ran a propaganda campaign through the war. Mr Sufi barkat-e-khoda was one of the artist in this show. Background Belal Muhammad, one of the founders of Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra, at a conference in Sandwip, 2008 The end of British rule in India in August 1947, accompanied by the Partition of India, gave birth to a new country named Pakistan which constituted Muslim-majority areas in the far east and far west of the Indian subcontinent. The Western zone was popularly (and for a period of time, also officially) termed West Pakistan and the Eastern zone (modern-day Bangladesh) was initially termed East Bengal and later, East Pakistan. The two zones were separated by over thousand miles of Indian territory in the middle, and had vastly different culture. It was widely perceived that the west zone dominated the country, leading to the effective marginalization of the east zone. Growing disenchantment among the people of East Pakistan finally led to civil disobedience followed by Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. During the period of Liberation War of Bangladesh, media supported mass sentiments. They aired patriotic songs and talk shows. In the process of achieving our independence by trouncing the atrocities of the Pakistani military forces, the war-time broadcasting station \\"Shadheen Bangla Betar Kendra\\" played a vital role- in increasing the mental state of the whole Bangali nation by informing us how well we are advancing towards the victory. Shadheen Bangla Betar Kendra reached its pinnacle during the liberation war being acclaimed as the stool pigeon of war news updates through 'Chorom Potro'. In those days when radio was the only media reaching to the far ends of Bangladesh, Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra eventually turned as the orator of the Bangladesh government in exile. It ran the nationalist campaign throughout the war in gearing up our freedom fighters moral and also mobilizing world opinion in favor of Bangladesh. Formation On 26 March 1971, just the day after the Operation Searchlight crackdown, when the brutal mass carnage by the Pakistani invaders plunged the nation into gloom and despair, at that critical juncture of history a voice was heard over Radio saying \\"SWADHIN BANGLA BIPLOBI BETAR KENDRA THEKE AMI MAJOR ZIA BALCHHI\\". With that broadcast the entire nation got back its confidence, courage of conviction and strong optimism. It was all possible because of the galant initiative taken by three young individuals Dr. Syed Anwar Ali, Engineer Ashikul Islam and Engineer Dilip Chandra Das to start with 10 KW transmitter. Since then, during the whole period of Liberation War, Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra successfully carried out its intellectual war like an organized front and aired patriotic songs which greatly inspired the freedom fighters in their relentless fight against the Pakistan-led occupation forces, war news and talk shows to boost up people's spirits. In the afternoon of 26 March 1971 a telegram containing the message of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman reached to one Syed Anwar Ali through some students in Chittagong. The message was translated to Bengali by Dr. Syed Anwar Ali's wife Dr. Manjula Anwar. She along with Syed Anwar Ali, Kazi Hosne Ara and two WAPDA engineers Mr. Ashikul Islam and Mr. Dilip Chandra Das in order to broadcast that message decided to cross over the Kalurghat Bridge to reach the local transmission centre controlled by the Bengali soldiers of the 8th East Bengal Regiment under Major Ziaur Rahman. Bengali soldiers guarded the station as engineers prepared for transmission. As contact could not be established between the political leaders Major Ziaur Rahman was requested to broadcast the message. At 7:45pm on 27 March 1971, Major Ziaur Rahman broadcast the message which became historic as the declaration of independence on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The Kalurghat Radio Station's transmission capability was limited. The message was picked up by a Japanese ship in Bay of Bengal. It was then re- transmitted by Radio Australia and later by the BBC. It ran for 5 days as Pakistan Air Force bombed and damaged it on 30 March. Ten founding members broke up into two groups and went to Agartala and Tripura with a 1 kilowatt transmitter. On 3 April they restarted the broadcasting from Bagapha of Tripura and later moved to Agartala. The name was changed to Bangladesh Betar on 6 December 1971 after India gave recognition to Bangladesh as a sovereign country. Bangladesh Betar started broadcasting in independent country on 22 December 1971. With profound appreciation the nation will always remember the services of those ten individuals who included Belal Muhammad, Syed Abdus Shaker, Mustafa Monwar, Abdullah Al Faruque, Abul Quasem Shandeep, Aminur Rahman, Rashedul Hossain, A.M. Sharfuzzaman, Kazi Habib Uddin Moni and Rezaul Karim Chowdhury. Declaration of Independence In his message Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called upon the people to resist the occupation forces.The Daily Star, 26 March 2005 Article not specified Mujib was arrested on the night of 25‚Äì26 March 1971 at about 1:30am (as per Radio Pakistan's news on 29 March 1971). A telegram containing the message of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was sent from Dhaka EPR wireless to Silimpur wireless station around 11am 25 March 1971. The asst Eng Golam Rabbani received the message and transmitted the message to different places, including journalist and political leaders in Chittagong. Then he tried to send the message to the foreign ships anchored at the bay of Bengal. But none of them dare to receive the message. Pakistan Navy trace the message and tried to create Jam on the transmission and finally threat to the foreign ships not to receive it. However, The world press reports from late March 1971 also make clear that Bangladesh's declaration of independence by Bangabandhu was widely reported throughout the world. The telegram message reached to MR Siddiquee and Johur Ahmed Chy of AL. Early morning of 26 March, an instant decision made by some locals in Agrabad, M A Hannan have decided to broadcast the message from Sheikh Mujib. In the afternoon they went to Kalurghat Radio Transmission to address the declaration. Some radio Engineers was accompanied with him. First historical declaration was made at 2:10pm 26 March 1971. This session was lasted only for 5‚Äì7 minutes and due to lower transmission quality not clearly heard. In the late afternoon Syed Anwar Ali and others with the help from transmission engineers took initiative to broadcast that message. Thus the declaration by Major Ziaur Rahman came at 7:45pm 27 March 1971. > This is Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra. I, Major Ziaur Rahman, at the direction > of Bangobondhu Mujibur Rahman, hereby declare that Independent People's > Republic of Bangladesh has been established. At his direction, I have taken > the command as the temporary Head of the Republic. In the name of Sheikh > Mujibur Rahman, I call upon all Bengalees to rise against the attack by the > West Pakistani Army. We shall fight to the last to free our motherland. > Victory is, by the Grace of Allah, ours. Joy Bangla. This was the story (described to then Press Trust of India-PTI's East Pakistan correspondent journalist Jyoti Sen Gupta in 1971 by Prof. Md. Khaled, Awami League Vice-President of Chittagong, Belal Muhammad, Pakistan Radio rebel and others who took part in Chittagong revolution in March 1971) of the birth of independent Bangladesh in a small room in the radio transmitter centre at the industrial township, Kalurghat skirting Chittagong where Surya Sen with a handful of revolutionaries had 40 years ago challenged the mighty British Government by armed attack on its armoury. Major Zia's message was heard by a few sub-editors and reporters in news offices in Dacca while tuning in different stations for news of their own country. Those days they were cut off from free news circulation and were forced to bring out their papers with press notes and hand-outs given by the Martial Law Authorities. Newspapers had no authority to use any news broadcast by radio systems of countries other than Pakistan. Major Zia's message was picked up by a Japanese ship anchored mid-stream in Chittagong harbour. When the news of this declaration was broadcast by Radio Australia, the rest of the world came to know of it. Inside Bangladesh those who heard Radio Australia passed on the news of the historic declaration in whispers to friends, neighbours and strangers. Major Zia's call had immediate response; the EBR, EPR and the regular police forces rose in revolt in every town and border outpost. The Pakistan Government authorities made futile attempts to tell the people that the broadcast was made by a clandestine radio from a ship in the mouth of river Hooghly in India. Islamabad even sent a note of protest also to New Delhi. The strength of the Bengali revolutionary forces at Kalurghat went on swelling as people fleeing from the besieged city of Chittagong collected there. The greatest contribution towards increasing the strength came from the student community who drafted many for joining up and fought. M A Hannan, an Awami League leader from Chittagong, is said to have made the first announcement of the declaration of independence over the radio on 26 March 1971.Virtual Bangladesh There is controversy now as to when Major Zia gave his speech. BNP sources maintain that it was 26 March, and there was no message regarding declaration of independence from Mujibur Rahman. Pakistani sources, like Maj. Gen. Fazal Muqeem Khan in his book Pakistan's Crisis in Leadership, Brigadier Zahir Alam Khan in his book The Way It Was and Lt. Gen. Kamal Matinuddin in his book Tragedy of Errors: East Pakistan Crisis, 1968-1971 had written that they heard Major Zia's speech on 26 March 1971, but Maj. Gen. Hakeem A. Qureshi in his book The 1971 Indo-Pak War: A Soldier's Narrative gives the date of Major Zia's speech as 27 March 1971. Regular features Chorompotro was the most popular program hosted by M. R. Akhtar Mukul. Here, he used to describe the uncomfortable position of Pak army in a funny voice and made his dialogues in Old Dhaka dialect. Chorompotro was planned by Abdul Mannan. Another popular program \\"Jallader Darbar\\" was run by Kalyan Mitra where approaches of Yahya Khan, known in the program as \\"Kella Fateh Khan\\" were described in a funny manner. \\"Bojro Kontho\\" was the program where speech of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were presented. A group of young singers used to sing inspiring songs. Many poems and songs were written for this broadcasting. One of those songs Joy Bangla Banglar Joy (Victory of Bengal) was the signature tune of the radio. Many songs of Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra like Purbo Digante Surjo Uthechhe, Ekti Phoolke Bachabo Bole, Salam Salam Hajar Salam of Gobinda Haldar, became immensely popular. Singers of the station raised funds singing their songs in different parts of West Bengal. News broadcasts were made in Bengali, English and Urdu. Secretary of the Swadhin Bangla Betar Convener Committee Kamal Lohani recalled, For us at the radio, it was a psychological warfare so we could say things to boost up people's morale.

Langan won his first cap against Turkey in April 1978 and was a regular in the squad until he sustained a knee injury in a 3‚Äì2 victory over France. For four years he was in the international wilderness until his move to Oxford regenerated the form that earned him his first caps. He remained an ever-present throughout the course of the qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 1988 in which he played four games. Despite public outcry, Langan was dropped for the adventure in the summer of 1988 in Germany and there ended his international career. Langan played youth football with the Cherry Orchard club and was a youth international before going to England to join Derby County, for whom he made his debut in 1977 as a 19-year-old and went on to make over 150 senior appearances. Jim Smith then paid a club record ¬£350,000 to take him to Birmingham City, for whom he played over 100 games and was Player of the Year in 1982, but when his career was disrupted by injury such that he missed a full 18 months, he was released by manager Ron Saunders. Jim Smith, by then managing Oxford United, signed him. He played 136 games for Oxford, winning the Second Division championship in 1984‚Äì85 and the League Cup the following year. He later played for A.F.C. Bournemouth and Peterborough United, but his knee and back injuries put an early end to his career. He is now registered disabled. On 14 June 1999, a benefit night was held in Ballyfermot for Langan in which his old teammate Paul McGrath showed up.. In late 2006, an interview with Langan entitled \\"I Was Just Unlucky\\" hit the press. This article inspired Ireland fans, many remembering that Langan \\"would have run through a wall for Ireland,\\" to start campaigning to get Langan a testimonial. This campaign picked up speed in early 2008 when some of the people at its forefront went on RT√â radio and started an online petition. This petition had over 1,000 signatures at the time this was written. Oxford United held a joint testimonial for Langan and Joey Beauchamp in 2011. In 2012 Langan's autobiography Running through Walls was released.

When [the gods] Anu and Enlil [...]), abbreviated EAE, is a major series of 68 or 70 tablets (depending on the recension) dealing with Babylonian astrology. The bulk of the work is a substantial collection of omens, estimated to number between 6500 and 7000, which interpret a wide variety of celestial and atmospheric phenomena in terms relevant to the king and state. Overview Enuma Anu Enlil is the principal source of omens used in the regular astrological reports that were sent to the Neo-Assyrian king by his entourage of scholars. There are well over 500 such reports published in volume 8 of the State Archives of Assyria. A majority of these reports simply list the relevant omens that best describe recent celestial events and many add brief explanatory comments concerning the interpretation of the omens for the benefit of the king. A typical report dealing with the first appearance of the moon on the first day of the month is exemplified by Report 10 from volume 8 of the State Archives: The series was probably compiled in its canonical form during the Kassite period (1595‚Äì1157 BCE) but there was certainly some form of prototype Enuma Anu Enlil current in the Old Babylonian period (1950‚Äì1595 BCE). It continued in use well into the 1st millennium, the latest datable copy being written in 194 BCE. It is believed that the first 49 tablets were transmitted to India in the 4th or 3rd centuries BCE and that the final tablets dealing with the stars had also arrived in India just before the start of the common era. Contents The whole series has yet to be fully reconstructed and many gaps in the text are still evident. The matter is complicated by the fact that copies of the same tablet often differ in their contents or are organised differently‚Äîa fact that has led some scholars to believe that there were up to five different recensions of the text current in different parts of the Ancient Near East. The subject matter of the Enuma Anu Enlil tablets unfold in a pattern that reveals the behaviour of the moon first, then solar phenomena, followed by other weather activities, and finally the behaviour of various stars and planets. The first 13 tablets deal with the first appearances of the moon on various days of the month, its relation to planets and stars, and such phenomena as lunar haloes and crowns.'Crown' may refer to the phenomenon of earthlight, see The omens from this section, like those quoted above, are the most frequently used in the whole corpus. This section is framed by tablet 14, which details a basic mathematical scheme for predicting the visibility of the moon. Tablets 15 to 22 are dedicated to lunar eclipses. It uses many forms of encoding, such as the date, watches of the night and quadrants of the moon, to predict which regions and cities the eclipse was believed to affect. Tablets 23 to 29 deal with the appearances of the sun, its colour, markings and its relation to cloudbanks and storm clouds when it rises. Solar eclipses are explored in tablets 30 to 39. Tablets 40 to 49 concern weather phenomena and earthquakes, special attention being devoted to the occurrence of thunder. The final 20 tablets are dedicated to the stars and planets. These tablets in particular use a form of encoding in which the names of the planets are replaced by the names of fixed stars and constellations.The most extensive list of planet to constellation correspondences can be found in Publication of the series At the present time less than half of the series has been published in modern English editions. The lunar eclipse tablets (tablets 15‚Äì22) were transliterated and translated in Aspects of Babylonian Celestial Divination, by F. Rochberg-Halton, 1989. The solar omens (tablets 23‚Äì29) were published as The Solar Omens of Enuma Anu Enlil edited by W. Van Soldt, 1995. And several tablets concerning planetary omens were published by E. Reiner and H. Hunger under the title Babylonian Planetary Omens volumes 1‚Äì4. The first part of the lunar omens (tablets 1‚Äì6) has been published in Italian by L.

It was re-built by the 1st Duke of Northumberland, a great patron of the arts, , mostly to his own designs. The duke's principal seat was Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, thus Stanwick Park was always a secondary residence. The 1st Duke furnished the interior of the house with many works of art, including paintings by Canaletto. As a secondary seat, the house was often allocated to a dowager duchess of Northumberland. During the First World War, the house served as a military hospital. Following the end of the war, it remained empty. In 1918, on the death of 7th Duke of Northumberland, his heirs became liable for large death duties, and as a consequence in 1922 the 8th Duke of Northumberland sold the estate.Worsley, p.9 The house was demolished in 1923. For many years, before the First World War, the house had been the residence of Eleanor Percy, Duchess of Northumberland. The duchess lived at the house for 40 years until her death in 1911. She became so attached to the estate that she chose to be buried in the village church, which she had rebuilt by Salvin, rather than in the Northumberland vault in Westminster Abbey.The Lost Stanwick Hall During her occupancy of the house, the gardens were expanded and developed, these included an Italian garden also designed by Salvin. During this period, the gardens were renowned for their glasshouses producing what at the time were considered rare and exotic fruits such as bananas, peaches, grapes, figs and nectarines; some varieties such as the \\"Stanwick nectarine\\" were propagated and bred on the estate.Lloyd The \\"Stanwick nectarine\\" was introduced to the United Kingdom by the diplomat John Barker. The interior of the house contained many fine 18th-century features; before the demolition, some of the decorations and motifs were removed. Three of the rooms were removed completely and are today believed by some to be those in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Comparisons with the extant photographs of the house interiors cast doubt upon this, and the links are doubtful; the director of the institute visited Alnwick in the 1930s to check on the provenance, but no record seems to exist of his ultimate findings. A firm called Robersons in London were in this relocation business. It seems possible that since there were 22 rooms from different houses being traded, of which only three were offered from Stanwick, there may have been an error. Museums in Roslyn, New York, and Toronto, as well as the collection of William Randolph Hearst are also alleged to have Stanwick rooms.The lost Stanwick Hall  Notes   References   External links * Category:Former buildings and structures in England Category:Country houses in North Yorkshire Category:British country houses destroyed in the 20th century ","title":"Stanwick Park"},{"id":"13675625","text":"NZR A class may refer to: * NZR A class (1873); 14 tank locomotives * NZR A class (1906); 57 tender locomotives ","title":"NZR A class"},{"id":"13675628","text":"Methedrone (para-methoxymethcathinone, 4-methoxymethcathinone, bk-PMMA, PMMC, methoxyphedrine, 4-MeOMC) is a recreational drug of the cathinone chemical class. Chemically, methedrone is closely related to para- methoxymethamphetamine (PMMA), methylone and mephedrone. Methedrone received media attention in 2009 after the death of two young Swedish men. In both cases toxicology analysis showed methedrone was the only drug present in both men during the time of their overdose and subsequent deaths. Discovery The synthesis of methedrone was first reported in 1933. Structure and reactivity = Structure = Methedrone is a synthetic cathinone. It is related to the parent compound cathinone. Methedrone belongs to the phenethylamine family due to the presence of the cyclic group of atoms C6H5 in which six carbons bind to form a hexagonal ring with five hydrogens each bonding to a carbon and the remaining carbon bonded to an atom or group of atoms other than hydrogen. =Reactivity= There are no articles found about the reactivity of methedrone. =Synthesis= Figure 1: Synthesis of methedrone The synthesis of methedrone is described in figure 1. and can be written as the following steps. # Bromination of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-1-one to 2-bromo-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-1-one. # A reaction with methylamine in which the 2-bromo-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-1-one becomes 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)propan-1-ol. # The final step is a reaction with potassium permanganate. The synthesis of mephedrone, a structurally similar compound with only one less ether group than methedrone, is well documented. Availability Methedrone can be purchased legally in Europe (excluding Sweden) and in most states in the US on the Internet, but also it can also be found at head shops and other retailers.DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency). Synthetic cathinones ‚Äì DEA request for information posted 3/31/11; 2011 [retrieved 28.07.11]. It is, along with other new or unregulated synthetic drugs and research chemicals, commonly labeled as a \\"bath salt\\".Psychonaut Research Web Mapping Project, MDPV report, London, UK: Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London; 2009. =Administration= Methedrone is a research chemical and its euphoric and stimulant properties can be abused. Similarly to MDMA it can be administered through insufflation, ingestion, smoking, rectal, and intravenous routes; however, it differs greatly in both duration and toxicity and great care should be taken when used due to the lack of medical literature available common among designer drugs. Mechanism of action Methedrone has been found to be a potent serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibitor, but a weak dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitor. Clinically, the DAT/SERT ratio of methedrone is less than one. Other analog compounds commonly have a DAT/SERT ratio less than half, meaning unlike other MDMA-like compounds methedrone does not prefer inhibition of the NET and DAT over the SERT. The resulting lack of inhibition despite its proclivity to release DAT can lead to a life- threatening adrenergic storm. Methedrone's high selectivity for SERT places it among the highest selectivity when compared to structurally similar compounds. Methedrone induces the transportation mediated release of NE, DA and 5-HT from cells preloaded with monoamines making it a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine (SNDRA) releasing agent, also known as triple releasing agent (TRA), which is a common characteristic among drugs of abuse. It has been found that methedrone is similar to MDMA in terms of the monoamine transporter interactions but an in vivo study of the drug resulted in a stronger hyperthermic reaction than what is normally reported in studies of MDMAs. Methedrone's affects on the serotonin transporter, SERT, can interfere and cause complications in individuals co-administrating with serotonin altering medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Metabolism To consider how methedrone (4-MeOMC) acts in a biological system, it is necessary to study the stability in an aqueous solution. Because, when tested directly in blood or urine, it is not known whether the compound will be degraded by enzymes available in the biological solutions or cause the chemical mechanisms, such as pH or dissolved oxygen. The length of the half-life of the compound has been examined and the percent remaining after 12 hours in buffers with various pHs. The tested pHs were 4, 7, 10 and 12. The conclusions are that methedrone, just as most analogs, is stable in acid solutions. However, in neutral and basic solutions it is decomposed, where a stronger decomposing takes place as the solution turns more basic. When comparing methdrone with its analogs, it has been found that there are several factors which affect their stability: * The substituted group on the benzene ring. * The groups attached at the nitrogen atom, but this is not applicable for methedrone. Methedrone and four other analogs have their groups substituted in the meta- or para-positions. For these compounds the rate constant, k, has been determined and a Hammett plot was constructed by plotting the decomposition rate constant (0.693/half-life) in the pH of 12 against their Hammett constants, taken from literature. This again shows that methedrone is a relatively stable compound even in basic solution. Another conclusion based on the results from the literature is that there is negative charge built up in the transition state during the rate determining step. This reasoning is based on the good linear correlation (r=0.9805) and the positive slope (determined as 1.76). There are two possible metabolites known for methedrone: * The carbon between the nitrogen group and R1, an H-atom in case of methedrone, will be replaced. This will lead to a smaller compound. * The methylgroup bound to the oxygen at the benzene group will be replaced by an H-atom. This metabolite will lose the epoxide and turn into a hydroxy- compound. Dosage and side effects =Dosage= There is little information available about how Methedrone is dosed. According to users, a single dose of Methedrone varies from 50 to 500 mg with effects lasting 45 minutes to two hours. There are at least two cases known of fatal intoxications with Methedrone. In the first case, the postmortem femoral blood sample of the patient contained a concentration of 8.4 ¬µg/g Methedrone, the patient died 16 hours after consumption (with polysubstance use detected). In the second body the concentration in the femoral blood sample was 9.6 ¬µg/g, with Methedrone being the only toxic compound detected. The scientific investigation of these cases suggests that the Methedrone alone was responsible for these deaths and that the concentrations in the femoral blood represent the fatal levels of methedrone. These studies show that the therapeutic index (or safety ratio) is low compared to other illegal drugs like Amphetamine. A fatal dose is likely to be around 8 ¬µg/g whereas the dose among users varies from 0.1 to 4.8 ¬µg/g blood according to studies. =Side effects= Anecdotal and case reports of human use of \\"bath salts\\", such as methedrone, suggest that these substances produce powerful psychological effects. These psychological effects include psychotic behavior, paranoia, delusions, hallucinations and also self-injury. There is very little known of the physical effects of methedrone in humans, but there have been some studies to the effects of methedrone in animals, so we focused on the effects in mice. Studies to the effects of Methedrone in mice show that Methedrone produces a significant increase in circling, beam breaks and hyperactivity. Furthermore, the mice also showed a significant increase in salivation, head weaving and stimulation. Methedrone is currently a legal drug in many jurisdictions, however studies show that it shares major pharmacological properties with drugs that have been banned, such as mephedrone and methylone. Also, the effects of Methedrone are very similar to the effects of banned drugs in mice. This suggests that Methedrone may be just as harmful as most commonly found Illicit drugs. Toxicity =Acute toxicity= There is little research regarding the toxicity of methedrone. Research has been done by animal-testing on mice once. Also, the lethal doses found in the two Swedish methedrone-victims have been compared to the methedrone concentrations in the blood of two other males dying in similar conditions. The mean of the methedrone concentrations in the blood of the two deceased was 1.3 Œºg/g blood. One of these victims had a very high concentration of Methedrone in the blood, approximately 4.8 Œºg/g blood. The mean of the concentrations found in the blood of the deceased victims was 8.0 Œºg/g blood. None of the non-lethal doses or lethal doses is known, suggesting that the safety gap between a lethal and non-lethal dose of methedrone is probably very small, thus making use of this drug dangerous because poisonings, and simultaneously death, are accidental. In a study of the effects of synthetic cathiones in ‚Äòbath salts‚Äô the effects of methedrone on mice were tested, these effects were compared to the effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. Different tests were performed to get insight into motor coordination, balance and overall behavioral effects. The mice did not show any difference in motor coordination or balance (doses administered were 10.0 mg/kg and 30.0 mg/kg). However significant changes were shown in overall behavioral effects. Administration of methedrone led to: * Increase of repeated movement of the mouse in a circular manner * Hyperactivity * Excessive salivation * Increase of head weaving * Increase of stimulation, tense body These effects are related with addiction potential. Excessive salivation is not an effect that is typically reported in humans. It is suggested that methedrone increases salivation via brain systems that primarily regulate autonomic responses. Compared with mephedrone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and 4-fluoromethcathinone (4-FMC), methedrone has a relatively slow onset. Thereby increasing the risk; because effects are not immediately shown, this could lead to an accidental overdose. It could also make the drug less popular, because humans tend to favor drugs that cause large, rapid initial increases in locomotor activity. =Chronic toxicity= Even in comparison with acute toxicity, chronic toxicity is poorly researched. Only the post-mortem study did little investigation on this subject. The findings of this study only showed that hair of the deceased victims contained methedrone, however, no conclusions were made regarding these findings. No studies have examined the effect of methedrone-use during or before pregnancy by a pregnant female on the embryo, nor is the carcinogenicity researched.  Health risks  The health risks associated with methedrone are mostly unknown, but are expected to be similar to other cathinones. Methedrone was almost immediately withdrawn from sale by initial vendors after reports of adverse health effects. Some amphetamine analogs containing a para-methoxy group are known to cause severe hyperthermia and even death due to concurrent MAOI and monoamine releasing action. =Overdose= The deaths of two young men in southeast Sweden in 2009 were attributed to methedrone overdose. Both were comatose when found. One suffered cardiorespiratory arrest on the way to the hospital, while the second survived for 16 hours in the emergency department. Effects on animals =Mice= Methedrone has been found to have an effect on the overall behavior of mice which includes: * Excessive salivation * Hyperactivity * Increase of head weaving * Increase of repeated movement of the mouse in a circular manner * Increase of stimulation, tense body Legality Its sale has been banned in Sweden since December 9, 2009. It is a controlled substance in China since October 1, 2015.

Team Manager Alvin Singfield created Panic Skateboards brand in 1995. Blueprint was formed by him and Dan Magee the following year as a sister brand to Panic. Blueprint was distributed through Faze 7 Distribution in the UK. Faze-7 also owned MI-7 Distribution, a company based in Huntington Beach, California, which handled U.S. distribution of the Blueprint, Panic, and Octagon wheel brands. The original sponsored team riders were : Rob Selley, Mark Baines, Flynn Trotman, Dan Magee, Ewan Bowman and Mike De Geus for Blueprint and Colin Kennedy, Paul Shier, Matt Prichard, Jon Weatherall, Pieter Janssen, Louis Slater and John Cattle for Panic.  Videography  =PNC/Blueprint: A Mixed Media= Released 1996. Available on VHS cassette in the UK only. A joint venture with the now defunct Panic Skateboards. The video is considered an important part of UK skateboarding history and documents some of the earliest footage in existence of some of the UK's most historically important skateboard spots. Spots which include Central Milton Keynes Bus Station and the South Bank Under-croft in Central London. A Mixed Media sold several thousand copies. =PNC/Blueprint: Anthems= Released 1997. Anthems sold worldwide in both PAL (European format) and NTSC (United States Format). This release also saw the combining of Blueprint Skateboards with the now defunct Panic Skateboards. =Build and Destroy Promo= Released 1999. Promo video included at the end of 'Through the Eyes of Ruby'. This was originally meant to be Blueprint's 411 Industry section. =Waiting For The World= Released 2000. Available on VHS cassette only. Waiting For The World really defined Blueprint as a team and opened everyone's eyes to the talent of the riders and what the UK has to offer. =First Broadcast= Released 2001. Available on VHS cassette only, this release further displayed the skills and diversity of the team. This release also featured sections from Unabomber Skateboards and Organic Skateboards (Now Landscape Skateboards) as well as many of the companies friends. =The Belong Tour= Released 2002. Available on VHS cassette only. This release covers the UK tour of the entire Blueprint team and is perhaps the least fondly remembered of their productions. The soundtrack includes tracks by Elliott Smith. The highlight of this video are the offcut clips of the team and friends street skating at the end of the tape. =Lost and Found= Released 2005. Available in DVD format. The team travelled virtually non-stop over the length and breath of Europe over two years in order to film their video parts. Lost And Found was then premiered to nearly 1000 skaters in London on March 12, 2005. The following 2-disc DVD set was released shortly after to worldwide acclaim. It was also premiered in virtually every country in Europe, the United States and many other parts of the world. The release has further pushed Blueprint on to new level and coming directly from our strong amateur program and their breakthrough video parts in Lost And Found, both Danny Brady and Nick Jensen were turned pro after the DVD release. This DVD features the following riders: Danny Brady, Neil Smith, Scott Palmer, Ben Grove, Paul Shier, Vaughan Baker, Michael Wright, Colin Kennedy, Chewy Cannon, Mark Baines and Nick Jensen. Stephan Morgan, Tuukka Korhonen, Ste Thompson and Conhuir Lynn are featured in the credits. Paul Carter, John Fisher and John Rattray have easter egg sections. =Make Friends With Marty= Released 2010. Online promotional clip, welcoming US pro rider Marty Murawski to the team and showcasing clips from the rest of the team. This clip acted as a teaser to the next full-length Blueprint DVD release, 'Make Friends With The Colour Blue'. Already-filmed footage of Marty couldn't be used in the forthcoming DVD due to camera compatibility issues, so this was a useful outlet for the footage. =Make Friends With The Colour Blue= Released 2010. Available in DVD format. With the addition of two US riders (Marty Murawski and Kevin Coakley) introduced the brand officially to a new US audience. The resulting DVD, 'Make Friends With The Colour Blue' (commonly abbreviated to 'MFWTCB'), features a truly international line-up of team riders and is perhaps the most polished Blueprint production yet.

Husserl's noema In Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology (1913), Husserl introduced the terms \\"noema\\" and \\"noesis\\" to designate correlated elements of the structure of any intentional act‚Äîfor example, an act of perceiving, or judging, or remembering: \\"Corresponding to all points to the manifold data of the real (reelle) noetic content, there is a variety of data displayable in really pure (wirklicher reiner) intuition, and in a correlative 'noematic content,' or briefly 'noema'‚Äîterms which we shall henceforth be continually using.\\"Edmund Husserl, Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology (also known as Ideas I), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238 Every intentional act has noetic content (or a noesis‚Äîfrom the Greek nous, \\"mind\\"). This noetic content, to which the noema corresponds, is that mental act‚Äìprocess (e.g., an act of liking, of judging, of meaning, etc.) which becomes directed towards the intentionally held object (e.g., the liked as liked, judged as judged, or meant as meant).Dermot Moran, Edmund Husserl: founder of phenomenology Polity, 2005, p133 That is to say, every act has, as part of its formation, a noematic correlate, which is the object of the act‚Äîthat which is intended by it.Edmund Husserl, Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology (also known as Ideas I), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p229 In other words, every intentional act has an \\"I-pole (the origin of the noesis)\\" and an \\"object-pole (or noema).\\"Jean- Francois Lyotard, Phenomenology, trans. Brian Beakley, SUNY Press, 1991, p55 Husserl also refers to the noema as the Sinn or sense (meaning) of the act, and sometimes appears to use the terms interchangeably. Nevertheless, the Sinn does not represent what Husserl calls the \\"full noema\\": Sinn belongs to the noema, but the full noema is the object of the act as meant in the act, the perceived object as perceived, the judged object as judged, and so on.Dermot Moran, Edmund Husserl: founder of phenomenology Polity, 2005, p135; see also Edmund Husserl, Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology (also known as Ideas I), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238 In other words, the noema seems to be whatever is intended by acts of perception or judgement in general, whether it be \\"a material object, a picture, a word, a mathematical entity, another person\\" precisely as being perceived, judged or otherwise thought about.Robert Sokolowski, Introduction to Phenomenology, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 59 Interpreting Husserl In fact, commentators have been unable to achieve consensus on exactly what a noema is. In a recent survey, David Woodruff Smith distinguished four different schools of thought. On one view, to say that the noema is the intentional object of an act of consciousness is to mean that it quite literally is an object. Husserl's student Roman Ingarden, for example, held that both ordinary objects, like chairs and trees, and intentional objects, like a chair precisely as it appears to me, or even a fictional tree, actually exist, but have different \\"modes\\" of existence.David Woodruff Smith, Husserl, Routledge, 2007, pp. 304-305 An alternative view, developed primarily by Aron Gurwitsch, emphasizes the noema of perceptual experience. Most ordinary objects can be perceived in different ways and from different perspectives (consider looking at a tree from several different positions). For Gurwitsch, what is perceived in each such act is a noema, and the object itself‚Äîthe tree, say‚Äîis to be understood as the collection or system of noemata associated with it. This view has similarities with phenomenalism.David Woodruff Smith, Husserl, Routledge, 2007, pp. 305-306 Robert Sokolowski, alternatively, holds that a noema is just the actual object of perception or judgment itself, considered phenomenologically. In other words, the noema of the judgment that \\"this chair is uncomfortable\\" is neither an entity (the chair considered as uncomfortable) which exists in addition to the chair itself (but with a different mode of existence)‚Äîthe Ingarden view; nor is the noema of such a judgment identified with a particular tactile perception of the chair‚Äîwhich along with other perceptions constitutes the chair as such‚Äîthe Gurwitsch view. For Sokolowski, the noema is not a separate entity at all, but the chair itself as in this instance perceived or judged. This seems consistent with Husserl's emphasis on the noema as the \\"perceived as such‚Ä¶remembered as such...judged as such...\\"Edmund Husserl, Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology (also known as Ideas I), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238 Analytic philosopher Dagfinn F√∏llesdal, in an influential 1969 paper,Dagfinn F√∏llesdal, \\"Husserl's Notion of Noema\\" Journal of Philosophy LXVI:20, 1969, pp. 680-687 proposed a Fregean interpretation of the noema, which has been developed extensively by Ronald McIntyre and David Woodruff Smith.David Woodruff Smith and Ronald McIntyre, \\"Intentionality via Intensions\\" Journal of Philosophy LXVIII:18, 1971, pp541-561; Ronald McIntyre and David Woodruff Smith, \\"Theory of Intentionality\\" in J.N. Mohanty and William R. McKenna (eds) Husserl's Phenomenology: a Textbook, Center for Advanced Research in Phenomenology and University Press of America, 1989, pp. 147-179; see also David Woodruff Smith, Husserl, Routledge, 2007, especially chapter six. This school of thought agrees that the noema is not a separate entity, but rather than identifying it with the actual object of the act (of perceiving, judging, etc.), phenomenologically understood, this view suggests that it is a mediating component of the act itself. It is what gives the act the sense it has.David Woodruff Smith, Husserl, Routledge, 2007, pp. 306-307 Indeed, F√∏llesdal and his followers suggest that the noema is a generalized version of Gottlob Frege's account of linguistic meaning, and in particular of his concept of sense (Sinn). Just as Frege held that a linguistic expression picks out its reference by means of its sense, so Husserl believed that conscious acts generally‚Äînot merely acts of meaning but also acts of perception, judgment, etc.‚Äîare intentionally directed toward objects by means of their noemata. On this view, the noema is not an object, but an abstract component of certain types of acts.David Woodruff Smith and Ronald McIntyre, \\"Intentionality via Intensions\\" Journal of Philosophy LXVIII:18, 1971, pp. 541-542 Sokolowski has continued to reject this approach, arguing that \\"(t)o equate sense and noema would be to equate propositional and phenomenological reflection. It would take philosophy simply as the critical reflection on our meanings or senses; it would equate philosophy with linguistic analysis.\\"Robert Sokolowski, Introduction to Phenomenology, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 194 Robert C. Solomon attempted to reconcile the perception-based interpretation of the Gurwitsch school with the Fregean interpretation of noema as sense, suggesting that while \\"(i)t has now become virtually axiomatic among phenomenologists that the Sinne [senses] of experience stand independent of the Bedeutungen [meanings] of linguistic expressions. It has become all but axiomatic among analytic philosophers that there is no meaning apart from language. It is the concept of the noema that provides the link between them. The noema embodies both the changing phases of experience and the organizing sense of our experience. But these two 'components' are not separable, for all experience requires meaning, not as an after-the-fact luxury in reflective judgements but in order for it to be experience of anything.\\"Robert C. Solomon, \\"Husserl's Concept of the Noema\\" in Frederick Elliston and Peter McCormick (eds) Husserl: Expositions and Appraisals University of Notre Dame Press, 1977, pp. 168-181; see p. 179 Other uses Noema is in the OED, which has shown its use for more than three centuries. It first was used in English in the field of rhetoric to denote \\"a figure of speech whereby something stated obscurely is nevertheless intended to be understood or worked out.\\" In other words, a noema in rhetoric is obscure speech or speech that only yields meaning upon detailed reflection. Peacham's 1577 Garden of EloquencePeacham's 1577 Garden of Eloquence ‚Äì Publications from Stockholm University used it this way, > \\"Noema, when we doe signify some thing so privily that the hearers must be > fayne to seeke out the meaning by long consideration.\\" See also * Intentionality * Noetics * Phenomenology References Category:Phenomenology Category:Philosophical concepts ","title":"Noema"},{"id":"13675682","text":"Panmure Gordon & Co. is a British corporate and institutional investment bank.

Capital punishment‚Äôs origin in Armenia is unknown, yet it remained present in the Armenia Criminal Code of 1961, which was enforced and applied until 1999. Capital punishment was incorporated in Armenian legislation and effectuated for capital crimes, which were crimes that were classified to be punishable by death, this included: treason, espionage, first-degree murder, acts of terrorism and grave military crimes. The last publicly known use of capital punishment in Armenia was in 1991, of which it was enacted through a single bullet shot to the head. After this, the death penalty was put on a moratorium and came under heavy criticism from both nations and international organisations.  History  Armenia‚Äôs application of capital punishment in the modern era dated back to their Criminal Code of 1961, of which was implemented while the country was under a republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Armenia‚Äôs Criminal Code of 1961 enforced the death penalty for 16 war-time crimes and 18 peace-time criminal offences. After their declaration of independence from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Armenia suspended the use of capital punishment, yet they continued to use the Criminal Code of 1961, which enabled courts to legally sentence individuals who they believe had violated capital crimes to death. In February 1991, an unknown individual was charged with committing first-degree murder and was executed through a single gun shot to the head. This would be the last time Armenia used their 1961 Criminal Code to sentence an individual to death and have that sentence successfully pass, and it would mark the last time the death penalty was used as a form of punishment. However, Armenia‚Äôs courts would continue sentencing criminals to death, pending execution. Since 1990, there had been 13 death sentences that were imposed by courts before capital punishment was abolished. = Reform = 1992 saw reform for Armenia‚Äôs Criminal Code of 1961. The democratic government decided to remove two of the peace-time criminal offences, speculation and mass theft, bringing the total amount of criminal offences punishable by death down to 32. In 1995, the revised Armenian Constitution was implemented, however, capital punishment was still implemented within the constitution. Under Chapter 2, Article 17 of the new Constitution, it states ‚ÄúEveryone has the right to life. Until such time as it is abolished, the death penalty may be prescribed by law for particular capital crimes, as an exceptional punishment‚Äù. Moreover, Armenia‚Äôs current Criminal Code experienced the removal of another capital crime; desertion. The continued implementation of the death penalty within their constitution, even after revision, brought criticism from Amnesty International, a Human Rights- focused organisation. Armenia‚Äôs acceptance to the Council of Europe in early 2001 illustrated a push towards the complete eradication of the death penalty with an official suspension of the death penalty being enforced shortly after joining the union. The Council of Europe has made the termination of the death penalty a necessity for membership hence, upon gaining membership status, Armenia had to sign Protocol No. 6. The European Convention on Human Rights which was enforced and used by the Council of Europe stated that, under Section I, Article 2, ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs right to life shall be protected by law‚Äù and that, under Protocol No. 6, Article 1 ‚ÄúThe death penalty shall be abolished‚Äù. Nevertheless, Armenia‚Äôs loyalty was tested when five criminals shot up parliament, killing the current prime minister and other governmental officials. = Removal = 2003 came with an overhaul to the outdated Criminal Code and introduced Armenia‚Äôs new Criminal Code of 2003 on 1 August. This change effectively saw the termination of the death penalty as a means of punishment for individuals charged after its incorporation (criminals convicted prior to this were legally able to be sentenced to death). Under Article 16(4), The Constitution also prohibited extradition if the individual being extradited will be sentenced to death. On top of this, on 29 September, Armenia also ratified (and later put into force on 1 October) Protocol No. 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights which banned the death penalty from being used in peace-times, restricting to only grave war-time criminal offences. Armenia replaced crimes that had capital punishment as the sentence with life imprisonment. This resulted in the current 38 active cases of individuals being sentenced to death row to have their punishment changed to life imprisonment. The new Armenia Criminal Code of 2003 illustrated the circumstances surrounding individuals who had been sentenced to life imprisonment. Under Article 60, (1) of the Criminal Code, it states that life sentence is ‚Äúisolation of the convict in a form of keeping him imprisoned in a corrective institution without time-limit‚Äù. As of 2003, individuals can only be sentenced to life imprisonment pending that they break one of the following six criminal offences: murder, genocide, application of prohibited methods of war, terrorism against the representative of a foreign country or international organisation, international terrorism and crimes against human security. 2005 was the death penalty‚Äôs final year in Armenian Constitution. The updated Constitution illustrated the complete removal of capital punishment, stating, under Chapter 2 (Fundamental Human and Citizen‚Äôs Rights and Freedoms), Article 15, ‚ÄúEveryone shall have the right to life. No one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed‚Äù. On 19 May 2006, Armenia signed Protocol No. 13 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Under Protocol No. 13, no derogation would be made for the application of the death penalty, even during times of emergency and war. However, as of May 2020, Armenia has yet to ratify or put the Protocol into force. Under Article 6 of the Armenian Constitution, international treaties do not enter legal force until they are ratified, illustrating they have yet to implement it.  Capital Crimes  In Armenia, from 1961 to 2003, capital crimes were considered serious criminal offences that had the possibility of being punishable by the death penalty. Armenia‚Äôs Criminal Code of 1961 divided these crimes into two sections: peacetime and wartime (including military) crimes. = Peace-time crimes = Before revision of Armenia‚Äôs Criminal Code in 1992, there were 18 peacetime crimes that had the ability to be punishable by death. They were: treason, espionage, acts of terrorism, acts of terrorism against representatives of foreign states, the creation and distribution of counterfeit cash, mass theft of state or social property, sabotage, organisational acts towards the commitment of grave crimes against the state, grave crimes against another workers‚Äô state, aggravated rape, speculation, activities causing disruption to the work of corrective labour institutions, bribe-taking, hijacking, banditry, the infringement of the life of a police officer or people‚Äôs guard, premeditated murder under aggravated circumstances and evasion of mobilisation. In 1991, speculation and mass theft were rejected as capital crimes. As of the implementation of the Armenian Criminal Code of 2003, these peacetime crimes no longer have the possibility of carrying a death penalty if committed. = War-time crimes = Before the amendment of Armenia‚Äôs Criminal Code in 1992, there were 16 wartime crimes that, if committed, could include the death penalty as a form of punishment. These war- times crimes primarily could only be committed by an individual in the military. They were: desertion, insubordination, forcible actions against a superior officer, intentionally destroying or damaging military property, offering resistance to a superior or forcing him to violate official duties, abuse of authority, exceeding authority, and neglectful attitude towards duty, pillage, voluntary surrender into captivity, abandonment of a sinking ship, unwarranted abandonment of battlefield or refusal to use a weapon, violation of rules for performing combat lookout, violation of service regulations for guard duty, surrendering or abandoning to the enemy as a means of waging war, evasion of military service by maiming or any other method and the unwarranted abandonment of unit in a combat situation. In 1995, desertion was rejected as a capital crime. As of the implementation of the Armenian Criminal Code of 2003, these wartime crimes no longer have the ability to have death penalty as a punishment if committed.  Public Opinion and Debate  The debate for removal began to take serious form with the election of the first president, Levon Hakobi Ter-Petrosyan, who was recognisably anti-capital-punishment through his refusal to sign any death warrants, and the amended Armenia Constitution of 1995, which illustrated the move away from its application in the criminal justice system through Article 16. = Amnesty International = Amnesty International, a humans right focused organisation, wrote an academic article criticising Armenia‚Äôs continued incorporation of the death penalty in their Constitution and criminal justice system, in 1997. The article, titled, ‚ÄúArmenia: Time to abolish the death penalty‚Äù, argued that capital punishment was based on a poorly designed system that resulted in anonymity regarding the circumstances surrounding certain criminals. Moreover, the article expressed Amnesty‚Äôs concerns over the obtainment of confessions through physical and mental duress, the lack of appeal and the continued use of sentencing individuals to death regardless of the moratorium in place. Amnesty International also commented on the mysterious circumstances surrounding Armenia‚Äôs last execution. The execution was held in Saratov, in the Russian Federation, with only the Armenian Minister of the Interior (at the time) knowing that the prisoner would be transferred, but not about the fate or execution. This raised flags concerning Armenia‚Äôs control over their enforcement of capital punishment. Moreover, Amnesty revealed the nature of Armenia‚Äôs execution procedures. Upon the prisoner‚Äôs plea for clemency being denied, they would be taken from their cell and their denied appeal for clemency would be read, right after which they would have immediately been taken to another cell and be executed by a sole executioner with a revolver. = The Council of Europe and their Impact = The movement towards attaining membership in the Council of Europe saw standards being set for Armenia by the Council. In 1999, five gunmen shot up parliament, murdering the current prime minister, parliament speaker and six government officials. Some Armenians and high-ranking government officials demanded the gunmen be executed under the retained death penalty. However, due to the moratorium set in place post-1991, the execution of the gunmen was turned away, and instead they were sentenced to life imprisonment. A postal card depicting Karen Demirchyan and Vazgen Sargsyan, the defence minister and a politician of Armenia at the time. Both were victims in the Armenia Parliament Shooting. Following the aftermath, Vardan Ayvazayan, the leader of the Stability parliamentary group at the time stated that ‚ÄúArmenia, as a country, should develop a system of principles based on European values. From this point of view, the abolishment of capital punishments is necessary‚Äù. Others disagreed with this opinion, Semyon Bagdasaryan, head of Stability Group, stated ‚ÄúIn my opinion the verdict on the people involved in the 27 October case should be capital punishment‚Äù, this argument was supported by the new Prime Minister, Andranik Margaryan , who called for the execution of the five gunmen. A representative of the Council of Europe stated that sentencing the gunmen to death ‚Äúcould bring the Parliamentary Assembly to suspend the participation of Armenia‚Äù, the representative continued, stating ‚ÄúAbolition of capital punishment is a hard- core human rights principle and therefore non-negotiable for the Council of Europe.‚Äù. Ultimately, the Armenian courts decided to sentence the five gunmen to life imprisonment, abiding by the wishes of the Council of Europe and retaining their membership status.  Other Information  Ashot Manukyan was an Armenian citizen who experienced the many changes capital punishment went through in Armenia during his imprisonment. In 1996, Ashot Manukyan was sentenced to capital punishment for first-degree murder changes of three Armenian servicemen. However, following capital punishment‚Äôs removal in 2003, all death sentences were abolished, this saw his initial punishment of being sentenced to death be substituted for life imprisonment. On 24 January 2020, Ashot Manukyan was released from prison and placed on parole after serving 24 years from his life sentence, following a decision made by the Criminal Court of Appeal of Armenia, which was based on a negative conclusion given from the Penitentiary Service of the Ministry of Justice and positive conclusion from the Probation Service.

It was also a term used in the United States Army Air Forces, where they were commonly called flying sergeants. After World War II, non-commissioned pilots began to be phased out and today all air force pilots are commissioned officers. United Kingdom and Commonwealth In Commonwealth air forces, a sergeant pilot (pilot IV, III or II from 1946 to 1950) could be promoted to flight sergeant pilot (pilot I from 1946 to 1950) and warrant officer pilot (renamed master pilot in 1946). Many went on to be commissioned. There were still master pilots flying helicopters with the Royal Air Force at least into the early 1970s. Corporals, sergeants, staff sergeants, and warrant officers may still qualify and operate as pilots in the British Army Air Corps. United States The United States Army Air Forces originally favoured officer pilots and the few enlisted pilots were usually civilian-qualified. The adoption of transport and strategic bombing missions meant that a larger number of pilots were needed to perform monotonous and gruelling jobs. Officer pilots were usually assigned to fly fighters and fighter-bombers and commanded units. Enlisted pilots usually were assigned to fly light reconnaissance and artillery-spotter aircraft, cargo aircraft, and medium- and heavy-weight bombers. The Flight Officer Act of 1942 created the warrant officer rank of flight officer. All enlisted pilots were promoted to that rank and the rank of flight sergeant was discontinued. The flight officer rank was cancelled in 1945 due to there being adequate numbers of commissioned pilots. The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps had several programmes to train civilian pilots and enlisted personnel to become naval aviators. There were also programmes to train enlisted men to serve as enlisted pilots to fly torpedo and dive bombers, transport and reconnaissance planes, and airships. On 17 December 2015, the United States Air Force announced that it would begin training enlisted airmen to fly Remotely Piloted Aircraft, specifically the RQ-4 Global Hawk. The first two enlisted pilots since 1961 soloed on 3 November 2016 at Pueblo Municipal Airport in a Diamond DA20. The first-ever female enlisted pilot completed RPA training at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph on 3 August 2017.http://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1269330/air-force- graduates-first-female-enlisted-pilot/ Footnotes External links * Category:Military ranks of the Commonwealth Category:Military ranks of Australia Category:Military ranks of Canada Category:Military ranks of the Royal Air Force ","title":"Sergeant pilot"},{"id":"13675707","text":"Lee Tze-fan (; 5 June 1907 Shinchiku-cho (modern-day Hsinchu), Japanese Taiwan - 10 July 1989) was a Taiwanese painter and art teacher.

Art in Scotland. Edinburgh & London, 1889, pp. 92-93. Life The house pf John Scougal (left) at the foot of Advocates Close He was a cousin to Patrick Scougal (died 1682), Bishop of Aberdeen and to Patrick's brother John Scougal, Lord Whitekirk. John Scougal is said to have been born at Leith, where his father David had a residence, and where several of his works were still in the Town Hall in the nineteenth century. In the latter part of the seventeenth century, one of the resorts of the fashion and beauty in Edinburgh was on the east side of the Advocates' Close, where John Scougal the painter rented or owned a house, to which he had added an upper story arranged as a studio. It stood opposite the house of Sir James Stewart.Cassell's Old and New Edinburgh vol. II p.222 Scougal had a very extensive practice, which latterly led him into some hasty work, said to be observable in the portrait of George Heriot, which he copied in 1698 from the now lost original by Paul van Somer. In the City of Glasgow collection are three full-lengths of William III, Queen Mary, and Queen Anne. Of these, Queen Mary is by far the best - well drawn, good in colour, and suggestive of the influence of Van Dyke's work. From the Glasgow Town Council Minutes of 12 March 1708, it is ascertained that the purchase by the Provost of the William and Mary from \\"Mr Scougal, limner (painter) in Edinburgh,\\" for ¬£27 sterling, was approved. Payment for the Queen Anne was ordered to be made on 2 August 1712, to \\"John Scougal, elder, painter, fifteen pounds sterling.\\" The Glasgow Council entries indicate he had a son of the same name; Andrew Bell, the engraver, who had several of Scougal's works in his possession, married his granddaughter.

Although very similar to Sillago sihama, the species is characterised by an unusually large head which accounts for 33% of the total body length. Taxonomy and naming The large-headed whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt- whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidei. The only specimen of the species ever recorded was taken from Paoping Harbour in Hainan, China in 1933. Lin recorded the new species, designating the only sample to be the holotype of the species. In preparation of a 1985 review of the sillaginids, Roland McKay was unable to locate the holotype and has presumed it to be lost. McKay noted that based on its description, all features except an unusually large head where characteristic of the common species Sillago sihama, suggesting the S. megacephalus is actually a junior synonym of S. sihama. The common name of 'large-headed whiting' is a straight translation from its binomial name, signifying the diagnostic head length. Description As already noted, the large-headed whiting is very similar to Sillago sihama, but has a head length which is 33% of the body length, compared to the 27-30% observed in S. sihama. The first dorsal fin has 11 spines, while the second dorsal fin has a single spine and 22 soft rays. The anal fin is similar with two spines and 23 soft rays. There are about 70 lateral line scales. The colour is uniform all over the body, with only the tip of the spinous dorsal fins black. Little else is known, including swimbladder morphology and vertebrae numbers. The specimen described was 158 mm in length. Distribution and habitat The only known specimen of large-headed whiting was taken from Taiwanese waters, with no other records known of, and no information of the habitat or depth the species lives at available. Aspects of the species biology and importance to fisheries are completely unknown at the present.

He began collecting art, a common pastime for the elite of the period. Instead of traveling to the Mediterranean he used his fortune to buy antiquities from other collectors at auctions. In this way Papenbroek gathered a part of the Reynst Collection and pieces from many other famous and lesser known collectors, including some Roman antiquities that had belonged to the Flemish painter Rubens.Halbertsma, R.

He attempted to have the collection published, but this would not be done until after his death. When Papenbroek died in October 1743 his will stipulated that his collection of antiquities should go to Leiden University and was to be put on public display.Halbertsma, R. B. (2003).

The variety show given by a Pierrot troupe was called a Pierrot show. Concert parties were travelling shows of songs and comedy, often put on at the seaside and opening with a Pierrot number. History In 1891, the singer and banjoist Clifford Essex, inspired by Michel Carr√© fils' pantomime L'Enfant prodigue (1890), which he had seen at the Prince of Wales' Theatre (of the latter known as the Scala Theatre) in London,\\"Pierrot Hero: The Memoirs of Clifford Essex.\\" resolved to create a troupe of English Pierrot entertainers. Thus began the tradition of seaside Pierrots in pointed hats and black or coloured costumes who sang, danced, juggled, and joked on the piers of Brighton, Margate and Blackpool from the 1890s until the 1950s.See Pertwee. The style of performance attracted artists from music hall and variety theatre. Some performers, such as Neville Kennard, were known as specialists in the field. Immensely popular in Great Britain from the 1920s to the 1940s, concert parties were also formed by several countries' armed forces during the First and Second World Wars. During the Second World War, the British Armed Forces' concert party became known as the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), later succeeded by the Combined Services Entertainment (CSE). As other forms of entertainment (particularly television) replaced variety shows in general, concert parties largely died out during the 1950s. This form of entertainment has been described by Roy Hudd as long-gone and much lamented.Roy Hudd, Philip Hindin, Roy Hudd's cavalcade of variety acts: a who was who of light entertainment, 1945-60, 1997, p94 The most famous fictitious concert party outside the armed forces was The Good Companions in J.

The Seal of the Confessional is a Christian doctrine which affirms the special protection and privilege of the words spoken during confession between a penitent (church member) and his or her pastor. A form of this principle exists in the doctrine and practice of many modern Lutheran churches. History The Roman Catholic priest and Reformer Martin Luther initially proclaimed in his teaching that three sacraments should be preserved in the reformed church, namely baptism, the eucharist and confession; Lutheran Christians today, do not all agree on the number of sacraments, but many include confession as a sacramental act.The Apology of the Augsburg Confession XIII, 3, 4 reads: \\"If we define the sacraments as rites, which have the command of God and to which the promise of grace has been added, it is easy to determine what the sacraments are, properly speaking. For humanly instituted rites are not sacraments, properly speaking, because human beings do not have the authority to promise grace. Therefore signs instituted without the command of God are not sure signs of grace, even though they perhaps serve to teach or admonish the common folk. Therefore, the sacraments are actually baptism, the Lord‚Äôs Supper, and absolution (the sacrament of repentance). Some of the Nordic churches at the time of the Reformation maintained virtually all aspects of their catholic faith and order, whilst breaking their links with the Pope. Later, these churches formally constituted themselves as Lutheran, the Church of Sweden doing so, for example, at The Convocation of Uppsala in 1593. There was a continuing de facto respect for principles such as the Seal of the Confessional, not least because it took the Nordic people a long time to promulgate any ecclesiastical law of their own. The first post-reformation ecclesiastical laws in the Kingdom of Sweden were not promulgated until 1686.See here for details. Contemporary practice In a manner very similar to the Anglican Communion, the practice of private confession in the Nordic and Baltic Lutheran churches is an important part of their faith for some church members, and totally ignored by others. There is a huge range of attitudes towards the practice. However, where it is practiced, there is an understanding among the clergy that there is an inviolable confidence between the individual priest and the penitent. In continental Lutheran practice private confession is less common, but still present. Although the Lutheran Confessions do not make explicit mention of the seal of the confessional, later texts do address this doctrine. An Explanation of Luther's Small Catechism, an expansion of this primary source of Lutheran doctrine widely used for teaching in the Lutheran Church- Missouri Synod, says the following in regards to the Seal of the Confessional: In regard to individual confession and forgiveness, Evangelical Lutheran Worship, the current service book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America states, \\"There is a confidential nature to this order, in keeping with the discipline and practice of the Lutheran church.\\" References See also *Seal of the Confessional (Catholic Church) *Seal of the Confessional (Anglican Church) *Lay confession Category:Confession (Lutheran Church) Category:Lutheran liturgy and worship Lutheran ","title":"Seal of the Confessional (Lutheran Church)"},{"id":"13675943","text":"Nathaniel Gubbins (1893-1976), born Norman Gubbins, was a British journalist and humorist.

From 1930 onwards he wrote a highly popular column in the Beaverbrook-owned Sunday Express called Sitting on the Fence. The column was particularly successful during the Second World War, and is associated with London's spirit during the Blitz by many.

He is Professor of Sociology in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine (previously Social Science, Health & Medicine) at King's College London, having joined King's in January 2012 to found this new Department. Previously he was the James Martin White Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics, director and founder of LSE's BIOS Centre for the Study of Bioscience, Biomedicine, Biotechnology and Society from 2002 to 2011, and Head of the LSE Department of Sociology (2002‚Äì2006). He was previously Professor of Sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he had been Head of the Department of Sociology, Pro-Warden for Research and Head of the Goldsmiths Centre for Urban and Community Research and Director of a major evaluation of urban regeneration in South East London. Biography Originally trained as a biologist, Nikolas Rose has done extensive work on the history and sociology of psychiatry, on mental health policy and risk, and on the social implications of recent developments in psychopharmacology. He has also published widely on the genealogy of subjectivity, on the history of empirical thought in sociology, and on changing rationalities of political power. He is particularly known for his interpretation of the work of the French historian and philosopher Michel Foucault and the revival of the literature on governmentality in the Anglo-American world. His book, Governing the Soul: the shaping of the private self, is widely recognised as one of the founding texts in a new way of understanding and analysing the links between expertise, subjectivity and political power. He argues that the proliferation of the 'psy' disciplines has been intrinsically linked with transformations in governmentality, in the rationalities and technologies of political power in 'advanced and liberal democracies'. (See also governmentality for a description of Rose's interpretations of Foucault's writings). For six years he was managing editor of the journal Economy & Society, one of the UK's leading interdisciplinary journal of social science, and he is now co-editor of BioSocieties: An interdisciplinary journal for social studies of life sciences. In 1989, he founded the History of the Present Research Network, an international network of researchers whose work was influenced by the writings of Michel Foucault. Together with Paul Rabinow, he edited the Fourth Volume of Michel Foucault's Essential Works. In December 2001, he was listed by The Guardian newspaper as one of the top five UK based social scientists, on the basis of a twenty-year analysis of citations to research papers, and the most cited UK based sociologist. He was awarded in 2007 an ESRC Professorial Research Fellowship ‚Äì a three-year project entitled 'Brain, Self and Society in the 21st Century'. In 2013, writing with Joelle Abi-Rached, he published Neuro: the new brain sciences and the management of the mind. Throughout his academic career he has been a critical analyst of psychiatry. His first book on this topic was published in 1986 - The Power of Psychiatry, a collection edited together with Peter Miller His most recent book Our Psychiatric Future: the politics of mental health was published by Polity Press in October 2018. Nikolas Rose is the Chair of the Neuroscience and Society Network, an international network to encourage critical collaboration between social scientists and neuroscientists. He is a member of the Social and Ethical Division of the Human Brain Project, where he leads the Foresight Lab, which is based at the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at King's College London. He was previously a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. He was a member of the Council's Working Party on Medical profiling and online medicine: the ethics of 'personalised healthcare' in a consumer age (2008‚Äì2010) and was a member of the Council's Working Party on Novel Neurotechnologies. He has also served as a member of the Royal Society's Science Policy Committee. He was also Co-Director of the first publicly funded UK centre dedicated to synthetic biology based at Imperial College. where he led a team examining the social, ethical, legal and political dimensions of this emerging practice. At King's he leads a team of researchers exploring the social implications of new developments in biotechnology, and committed to the democratisation of scientific research and technological development.

A succession of auditoria had occupied the site since 1832, serving a variety of functions, including religious and leisure activities. The theatre at its largest, after reconstruction in 1881‚Äì82, had a capacity of between 650 and 700. As the Charing Cross Theatre (1869‚Äì1876) the house became known for bills offering a mixture of drama, burlesque and operetta. Among the authors of its burlesques were W. S. Gilbert and H. B. Farnie. Its stars included Lydia Thompson, Lionel Brough and Willie Edouin. In 1876 Thompson and her husband, Alexander Henderson, became lessees of the theatre and renamed it the Folly Theatre. They continued the theatre's customary mix of operetta and burlesque. Their greatest successes were with English adaptations of French op√©ras bouffes and op√©ras comiques, most conspicuously Les cloches de Corneville, which began its record-breaking run (705 performances) at the Folly in 1878. In 1879 the comic actor J. L. Toole took over the lease. In 1881 he changed the name to Toole's Theatre and had the building substantially reconstructed. He continued the policy of staging burlesques, but introduced more non-musical comedies and farces. Among the authors who wrote for the theatre were John Maddison Morton, F. C. Burnand and Henry Pottinger Stephens; composers included George Grossmith and Edward Solomon. The theatre was important for beginning the professional careers of many actors, writers and actor-managers. Among the playwrights whose early works were presented at Toole's were Arthur Wing Pinero and J. M. Barrie. Future stars who were members of the company as beginners included Kate Cutler, Florence Farr, Seymour Hicks, Irene and Violet Vanbrugh and Lewis Waller. The lease of the theatre expired in 1895, and the lessor, the Charing Cross Hospital, did not renew it. The theatre was demolished in 1896.

W. S. Woodin in his Olio of Oddities, 1856 The premises were acquired by the entertainer William S. Woodin, who converted them, reopening as the Polygraphic Hall on 12 May 1855. Woodin gave one-man comic shows, beginning with The Olio of Oddities.\\"Woodin's Olio of Oddities\\", The Morning Chronicle, 14 May 1855, p. 5 He remained in possession of the hall for more than ten years, giving performances there between his provincial tours. When he was not in residence the hall was used for other one-man shows, lectures, amateur dramatic productions, and minstrel shows.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 224 The building was sold to a partnership, E. W. Bradwell and W. R. Field, who acquired the adjoining houses and reconstructed the premises as a small playhouse called the Charing Cross Theatre. The Times reported that they converted the building \\"into a regular playhouse, of light and elegant appearance, with two tiers of boxes, abundant stalls, a limited pit and no gallery ‚Äì altogether an edifice satisfactorily answering to the favourite word 'bijou', and well worth seeing\\".\\"Charing Cross Theatre\\", The Times, 24 June 1869, p. 6 Its capacity was 600.\\"Capacity of London Theatres\\", The Orchestra, 17 June 1870, p. 199 The theatre opened on 19 June 1869 with a triple bill consisting of an operetta, a three-act drama and a burlesque, the last being W.

Clarke, became proprietor. Under his management the theatre was variously advertised as the Charing Cross Theatre and the Theatre Royal, Charing Cross. He renovated the interior, receiving praise from The Sunday Times: Among Clarke's productions was a revival of Sheridan's The Rivals, featuring Mrs Stirling as Mrs Malaprop and Clarke as Bob Acres; it ran for more than 50 performances, an unheard-of run at the time for an old classic. In 1874 Lydia Thompson starred in H. B. Farnie's burlesque Blue Beard, in which she had played in the US nearly 500 times;\\"Charing-Cross Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 21 September 1874, p. 6 her co-stars were Lionel Brough and Willie Edouin. The following year the theatre featured Kate Santley in a series of comic operas, and later Virginie D√©jazet in a French season. John Hollingshead then presented burlesque, and in 1876 Thompson and her husband, Alexander Henderson (1828‚Äì1886) returned from a \\"farewell tour\\" of the US and became proprietors of the theatre. =Folly Theatre, 1876‚Äì1881= alt=moderately buxom white woman standing, holding a rifle and wearing a costume intended to suggest a castaway Henderson renamed the house the Folly Theatre.

In his Dickens's Dictionary of London (1879), Charles Dickens Jr. described the Folly as \\"A little bandbox of a place, very prettily fitted up, and with a decided specialty for burlesque and opera bouffe\\".Dickens, p. 103 It reopened on 16 October 1876, with a revival of Blue Beard. At Christmas that year another Farnie burlesque was presented: Robinson Crusoe; it did well at the box- office, and Henderson continued to present op√©ra bouffe and burlesque.

Byron's three-act A Fool and His Money, and Ici on parle fran√ßais, described by The Era as \\"the most successful farce of modern times\\", in which Toole played one of his most popular characters, Spriggins.\\"The Theatres\\", The Pall Mall Gazette, 17 November 1879, p. 11 This was a financial success, and Toole followed it with Byron's comedy The Upper Crust, which remained in his repertoire for the rest of his career. After presenting a revival of Dion Boucicault's Dickens adaption, Dot, based on The Cricket on the Hearth, and Hester's Mystery, an early play by Arthur Wing Pinero, as well as what the theatre historians Mander and Mitchenson describe as \\"some now forgotten pieces\\", Toole went on tour. In his absence R. C. Carton presented a summer season in 1881 that included Imprudence, Pinero's first three-act comedy.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 228Dawick, p. 404 When the season ended, Toole closed the theatre for substantial rebuilding; in December, while work was in progress, he announced a new name for the house: the Folly became Toole's Theatre,\\"Toole's\\", The Times, 27 December 1881, p. 6 the first in London to follow the common American practice of calling a theatre after its actor-manager or owner. =Toole's Theatre, 1881‚Äì1896= Toole's Theatre, 1882 Toole said that the rebuilding had cost him more than ¬£10,000.Toole, p. 274 The capacity of the house was much enlarged: Toole's held between 650 and 700 people.

Monster Hunter Tri was released on April 20, 2010, in North America, April 23 in Europe, and April 29 in Australia. The game was originally planned to be a PlayStation 3 title, but was cancelled due to high development costs for that console. Capcom instead decided to develop it for the Wii. Prior to its debut, a demo of Monster Hunter Tri was included with Japanese copies of Monster Hunter G. A special bundle was also released on August 1 featuring the game packaged with a black Wii console and a Classic Controller Pro. On August 3, 2009, Capcom issued a press release confirming the game would be localized for North American and European markets. On February 24, 2010, Capcom announced that online play would be provided free of charge. Although now, online play is no longer supported. In America and Europe, separate servers are used and Wii Speak is supported, making the first game in the franchise to include native VoIP capability. It was a critical and commercial success. An enhanced port called Monster Hunter 3 (tri-) G in Japan and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate in other territories was released for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in December 2011 and in North America and Europe in March 2013. The online servers for the Wii version of the game have been shut down as of May 1, 2013. Gameplay Players of Monster Hunter Tri take on the role of a monster slayer from the Guild, assigned to help revitalize Moga Village, a small fishing community that is under threat of monsters from a nearby deserted island. The player does this by completing free hunts on the island, where they collect materials and slay or capture monsters which are converted into resources that can be used to improve the village, and by completing time-limited quests for the Guild, typically slaying or capturing a monster in a specific region, for in-game money and material resources that can be used to improve their equipment that allows them to take on more difficult monsters. Improving the village gives the player access to a farming area and a fishing fleet, from which raw resources can be harvested, companions that can help while on the field, and access to a trader that can provide rare items to the player. The player's character does not have any innate statistics but instead gains these from the equipment they outfit the character in. In particular, the player selects from one of ten weapon classes, primarily divided into melee weapons like swords and hammers, and ranged weapons like bows and bowguns. Each weapon type has a unique style of play when used in the field; sword users need to build up consecutive attacks to increase a combo meter to inflict larger damage on their foes but must keep an eye on their blade's sharpness, while bowmen can perform weak but fast ranged attacks including applying special coatings to their arrows to inflict debuffs on enemies. The player can also equip different sets of armor, which impart attack and defensive bonuses. Some weapons and armor include slots that gem decorations can be slotted into which boosts the item's statistics. Various armor pieces give special skill boosts, and if the player can equip a set that boosts a skill past set thresholds, they can gain additional passive bonuses such as full resistance to fire or poison attacks. The player can swap weapons and armor outside of adventuring. To progress in the game, the player is typically required to collect parts of the larger monsters that they are assigned to kill, and using those to forge or upgrade weapons and armor. By being able to take on higher-ranked Guild quests with improved equipment, the player will gain access to a larger array of monster parts and world resources that lead to better equipment they can then craft. In the field, the player has a health and stamina meter, as well as an item pouch with limited space where resources like healing potions, bombs, and materials picked up in the field are stored. Certain materials can be combined to make more potent items, such as stronger healing potions. However, once the item pouch is full, the player must choose to discard or swap out items with new ones. As the player hunts, they will take damage from monsters; if their health drops to zero, they are rescued to a base camp where they can set off again, but after falling for a third time, they are returned to the village without any gains made while they were adventuring. The stamina meter drops after performing most intensive actions like running, dodging, or attacking, but restores when the player otherwise is walking around. When the player's stamina is depleted, the character will be forced to stop for a brief period to catch their breath before they can move, leaving them vulnerable to attack. In addition, the maximum stamina that the player has will drop over time while in the field, though certain items can restore the maximum stamina level. While on free hunts, the player can leave the field and return to the village at any time, keeping any items they have collected; on Quest hunts, failure to complete the mission in time or abandoning the quest foregoes any reward items. Players with both the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U versions are able to transfer their character data back and forth between these units, allowing them to continue to build their character while on either system. =Online play= Monster Hunter on the Wii and Wii U offer an online component where up to 4 players can venture on new quests together, represented by the character traveling to a nearby city harbor port. The game uses the same character data as the single-player offering, letting players continue to build up better equipment from quest rewards within either mode. Quests in this mode featured more difficult monsters than the single player game due to the added players available to fight. Quests are broken out into a number of ranks, requiring players to individual completely all quests in a rank before moving to a new tier. A limited selection of the items that the player can collect can be traded with other players here or while on a quest, typically limited to healing and restorative items, preventing the trading of equipment, monster parts, or resources necessary to make better equipment. The Wii version of online has since been shut down, but the Wii U version continues to offer these network servers. Development The ecosystems in Monster Hunter Tri have been expanded to include underwater environments. Director Kaname Fujioka, in a 2017 interview, said that they wanted to include underwater sections and combat in Monster Hunter, both to try something different from what other games have done with this, and trying to see how underwater combat would work. While it was included in Tri, Fujioka said that the amount of effort they needed to program these sections took too much time away from what other parts they could develop, and generally have left underwater combat out of future Monster Hunter games, but would like to come back to it sometime in the future. Eighteen new monsters were developed for the game, and while there were only 3 of the same boss monsters from the previous games (Rathalos, Rathian and Diablos), their interactive AI was completely redesigned. Each weapon class has been updated with new moves and innovations. Weapon classes included are Sword and Shield, Dual Blades, Great Sword, Hammer, Bowguns (Light and Heavy), Bow, Gun Lance, Lance, Longsword, Hunting Horn, and the new Switch Axe, which can switch between Axe and Sword forms. According to producer Tsujimoto Ryozo, \\"[Capcom] love the idea of voice chat and know that it is a minimum for western players,\\" which suggested Western releases of Monster Hunter Tri may feature support for the Wii Speak microphone peripheral, which was later confirmed. Two special bundles of the game were announced. One bundle for North America and Europe includes a black Classic Controller Pro. A European-exclusive bundle includes a Wii Speak device and Classic Controller Pro. GameStop has offered a demo disc of the game free of charge in North America. GAME has officially confirmed a European Monster Hunter Tri: Exclusive Edition bundle containing the game, Wii Speak, a black Classic Controller Pro and one other item which appears to be an ornamental head of the monster which appears on the game's cover art, the Lagiacrus.  Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate  Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is a game for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The game is similar to Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. The 3DS version was released on December 10, 2011 in Japan as and features local wireless play. In Japan, Famitsu announced that Monster Hunter Tri G was confirmed as an expanded Monster Hunter Tri. It is the first game to support the Circle Pad Pro add-on.C-Stick and ZL/ZR Trigger Button Function Compatible When Use With New 3DS and New 3DS XL and New 2DS XL Systems. The game was also released in two bundles, one containing the special edition 3DS and the other one containing the add-on. It was also released on Wii U which features revised HD graphics, full online, local multiplayer, and the ability to import the game progress to the player's Nintendo 3DS. The Wii U port is known in Japan as Monster Hunter 3G HD Ver., and was released on December 8, 2012 when the Wii U launched in Japan, while the Nintendo 3DS version was re-released as a Nintendo eShop downloadable two days prior, featuring a slightly lower price than the retail re-release. It was announced that Tri G would be released in North America and Europe as Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, and would be released in March 2013 together for both the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U. Monster Hunter 4 for the 3DS was also announced, which originally scheduled to be released in Japan in the same month as Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate in North America and Europe, but later pushed back to Summer 2013. It was later announced that the North American and European releases would be on March 19 and 22 respectively. A demo of the game was released on February 21, 2013. = Gameplay = Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate re-introduces the underwater combat that was left out of the Japanese-only sequel to Tri, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. This is the first time that the gunlance, bow, hunting horn and dual swords have been featured in underwater combat. The game also reintroduces G rank, a level above high rank that features a new set of quests, harder monsters and improved weapons and armor. It was the first time G rank was present in a Monster Hunter game since Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, and the first time ever for a third generation Monster Hunter title. Reception The game and the Ultimate versions received \\"favorable reviews\\" on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Weekly Famitsu certified the Wii version with a score of 40/40, making it the eleventh game to receive a perfect rating from the magazine in its 20-year history, as well as the third title for the Wii. 411Mania gave the Wii version a score of 8.8 out of 10 and called it \\"a meaty experience, with the same addictive reward system that forms the core of many MMORPGs. If you have a few friends who also enjoy the game, you'll enjoy hours and hours of hunting together. Even if you prefer to play offline, there's a ton to do. Unfortunately, while fans of the series will probably love Monster Hunter Tri, Capcom has a lot of kinks to iron out if they want to appeal to the Western masses.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a B+ and stated that \\"The underlying complexities of crafting nifty new gear from their bones is the reason to put roots in Monster Hunter Tri‚Äôs wooly world.\\" The Escapist gave it a score of four stars out of five and stated, \\"For some reason, there is something uniquely satisfying about felling a great beast and wearing his skin in triumph.\\" The Digital Fix gave the Wii U version a score of nine out of ten and said it \\"could very well be the best reason to own a Wii U at this early stage in the console‚Äôs life. The reduced difficulty in the single player mode helps with easing in new players into the core game systems while the higher rank missions will keep veteran monster slayers satisfied. Beyond the addition of new monsters and one new location to hunt in the central game mechanics remain largely unchanged from Tri or indeed the rest of the series.\\" National Post gave the same version of Ultimate a score of 8.5 out of 10 and stated that \\"The bigger screen and 1080p HD graphics do add to the flair of the game ‚Äî the textures are redone for the more powerful Wii U, while most of the game models are the same ‚Äî but no one would mistake them for something that wasn‚Äôt also designed to be played on a handheld. The framerate is much better and, most importantly, you can play online with other players.\\" However, the newspaper also gave the 3DS version a score of 7 out of 10, saying, \\"On the 3DS, your only option is local play. This means that every player needs to have a 3DS, a copy of the game and be in the same room with one another, or be in the same room as someone with the Wii U version of the game. [...] This very limited multiplayer, the lack of a second camera- controlling analog stick (without the circle-pad-pro add-on) and small almost illegible text is why the 3DS version of the game has a lower score than the Wii U version.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave the Wii U version a score of four stars out of five and stated, \\"The Monster Hunter series continues to be brilliant but a little impenetrable, despite efforts to remedy that very issue. How much you‚Äôll get out of the game really depends on what you‚Äôre willing to put in - if you‚Äôre short on spare time or patience, maybe give it a miss. But if you like the sound of really learning a game for once instead of just drifting through it, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is essential.\\" Digital Spy gave the same version a score of four stars out of five and said, \\"With some truly breathtaking battles, great online play and the promise of free challenges to come, Monster Hunter 3: Ultimate is just what Nintendo's fledgling console needs.\\" The Escapist also gave it four stars out of five, saying, \\"While grinding and idiosyncrasies will get to some, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is a great game. It shines particularly bright when played [in] multiplayer.\\" Monster Hunter Tri shipped over one million units prior to its Japanese release date. It was the top-selling game in Japan for the week ending August 2, 2009, at 520,000 copies sold. As of December 12, 2009, Monster Hunter Tri is the best-selling third-party video game for the Wii in Japan, at 960,000 copies sold.

The only named species is Eotriceratops xerinsularis. Discovery and naming In early August 1910, Barnum Brown during an American Museum of Natural History expedition discovered a large dinosaur skeleton in the Dry Island site, on the west bank of the Red Deer River in southern Alberta, Canada. Brown however, neglected this find as he was more interested in the many Albertosaurus specimens present in the location. Unaware of Brown's prospect, in 2001 a team of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology and the Canadian Museum of Nature mounted an expedition to the Dry Island. The expedition's cook, Glen Guthrie, that year by accident rediscovered the skeleton. Restoration Eotriceratops was named and described by Xiao-Chun Wu, Donald B. Brinkman, David A. Eberth and Dennis R. Braman in 2007. The type species is Eotriceratops xerinsularis. The generic name combines a Greek ·º†œéœÇ, √®os, \\"dawn\\", with the name of the genus Triceratops, in reference to an older age relative to that form. The specific name xerinsularis, means \\"of the dry island\\", from Greek ŒæŒ∑œÅœåœÇ, x√®ros, \\"dry\\", and Latin insula, \\"island\\" and is a reference to the Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park where its remains were found. The holotype specimen, RTMP 2002.57.5, has been found in a layer of the uppermost Horseshoe Canyon Formation, dated to the early Maastrichtian, about 68.8 million years ago. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull, lacking the lower jaws. It contains a partial skull including parts of the frill sides, large horns above the eyes, and a small horn above the nose, similar to the closely related Triceratops. At least seven neck and five back vertebrae, as well as several ribs and ossified tendons, were also recovered. The bones were largely found disarticulated. Because the specimen was found in weakly bedded shale, many of the bones were badly crushed. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul renamed the species to Triceratops xerinsularis,Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 265 but this was not followed by other researchers. Possible additional specimens, which have been variously classified in the species Ojoceratops fowleri and Torosaurus utahensis, are known from the same time period in New Mexico and may also belong to Eotriceratops. Description Estimated size of Eotriceratops (green) beside a Triceratops (blue) and a human The holotype skull has been estimated to have had an original length of around . It has been estimated that this specimen had a total length of about . In 2010, Paul estimated its length at 8.5 metres, while its weight estimated at ten tonnes. This qualifies Eotriceratops as one of the largest ceratopsians, rivalled only by Triceratops horridus at 8 m (26 ft) and 9‚Äì13.5 t (9.9‚Äì14.9 short tons), and the ichnogenus Ceratopsipes, thought to be as large as 12 m (39.4 ft) and 18 tons Eotriceratops differs from other chasmosaurine ceratopsians in unique features of the skull bones. In 2007, several autapomorphies, unique derived traits, were established. The process of the praemaxilla, obliquely protruding to above and behind in the bony nostril, does not have a groove or depression on its outer side contrary to the situation with Triceratops; this process is exceptionally wide in side view; it also reaches above the level of the lower border of the fenestra interpraemaxillaris. The episquamosals, the epoccipitals of the squamosal, thus the skin ossifications lining and often protruding from the edge of the frill, have an extremely elongated base, and are flattened and spindly, touching each other as with Torosaurus utahensis. Near the lower edge of the squamosal a clearly demarcated groove or depression is present. On the lower front of the nasal horn core, a vertical, slightly obliquely running, vein groove meets second vein groove, running horizontally. The epijugal forms an unusually pronounced sharp jugal horn. At its rear upper side the epijugal bears a pronounced process, pointing to behind. A depression on the top of the epijugal forms a contact facet with the jugal; a depression at its inner side forms a separate facet contacting the quadratojugal. The snout of Eotriceratops was relatively flat and elongated. The depressions on the sides of the praemaxillae were connected through an oval fenestra interpraemaxillaris; small rounded processes pointed to above and behind into this opening, originating from the front lower edges. The strut between this opening and the nostril was narrow in side view and transversely thickened with a straight rear edge. The processes jutting into the nostrils had hollow outer sides but were far less excavated and much higher than with Triceratops or Torosaurus. The maxilla bore at least thirty-five tooth positions. The nasal horn was low, situated above the nostril and slightly recurved. It had a narrow rear edge and a transversely flattened point. The horns above the eyes were forward-curving and have been estimated at about long. The lower base of these horns was narrow and vertically directed, which with Triceratops is a juvenile trait. Three bite marks can be observed above the eye, near the base of the left horn, which were interpreted as traces of scavenging. The squamosal shows at least five episquamosals. Little has been preserved of the parietal bones forming the centre of the neck shield. Phylogeny Eotriceratops was in 2007 placed in the Chasmosaurinae. In a cladistic analysis, it was recovered as a close relative of Triceratops, Nedoceratops and Torosaurus. It would have been the sister species of Triceratops. In view of its greater age, the describing authors considered it more likely that Eotriceratops was in fact basal to, lower in the evolutionary tree than, the other three genera.

The Black Sheep from a 1901 edition of Mother Goose by William Wallace Denslow In the English language, black sheep is an idiom used to describe an odd or disreputable member of a group, especially within a family. The term stems from sheep whose fleece is colored black rather than the more common white; these sheep stand out in the flock and their wool was traditionally considered less valuable as it was not able to be dyed. The term has typically been given negative implications, implying waywardness. In psychology, the black sheep effect refers to the tendency of group members to judge likeable ingroup members more positively and deviant ingroup members more negatively than comparable outgroup members. Origin In most sheep, a white fleece is not caused by albinism but by a common dominant gene that switches color production off, thus obscuring any other color that may be present. A black fleece is caused by a recessive gene, so if a white ram and a white ewe are each heterozygous for black, in about 25 percent of cases they will produce a black lamb. In fact in most white sheep breeds, only a few white sheep are heterozygous for black, so black lambs are usually much rarer than this. Idiomatic usage The term originated from the occasional black sheep which are born into a flock of white sheep. Black wool was considered commercially undesirable because it could not be dyed. In 18th and 19th century England, the black color of the sheep was seen as the mark of the devil. In modern usage, the expression has lost some of its negative connotations, though the term is usually given to the member of a group who has certain characteristics or lack thereof deemed undesirable by that group. Jessica Mitford described herself as \\"the red sheep of the family\\", a communist in a family of aristocratic fascists.\\"Red Sheep: How Jessica Mitford found her voice\\" by Thomas Mallon 16 Oct 2007 New Yorker . The idiom is also found in other languages, e.g. German, French, Serbian, Bulgarian, Hebrew, Portuguese, Bosnian, Greek, Turkish, Hungarian, Dutch, Afrikaans, Swedish, Danish, Spanish, Catalan, Czech, Slovak, Romanian and Polish. During the Second Spanish Republic a weekly magazine named El Be Negre, meaning 'The Black Sheep', was published in Barcelona.El be negre (1931-1936) - La Ciberniz The same concept is illustrated in some other languages by the phrase \\"white crow\\": for example belaya vorona (–±–µ–ª–∞—è –≤–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞) in Russian and kalƒÅg-e sefƒ´d (⁄©ŸÑÿßÿ∫ ÿ≥ŸÅ€åÿØ) in Persian. In psychology In 1988, Marques, Yzerbyt and Leyens conducted an experiment where Belgian students rated the following groups according to trait-descriptors (e.g. sociable, polite, violent, cold): unlikeable Belgian students, unlikeable North African students, likeable Belgian students, and likeable North African students. The results indicated that favorability is considered highest for likeable ingroup members and lowest for unlikeable ingroup members, with the favorability of unlikeable and likeable outgroup members lying between the two ingroup members. These extreme judgements of likeable and unlikeable (i.e., deviant) ingroup members, relatively to comparable outgroup members is called \\"black sheep effect\\". This effect has been shown in various intergroup contexts and under a variety of conditions, and in many experiments manipulating likeability and norm deviance. =Explanations= Black Pope and Black Sheep, a sculpture by Miros≈Çaw Ba≈Çka, 1987 A prominent explanation of the black sheep effect derives from the social identity approach (social identity theory and self- categorization theory). Group members are motivated to sustain a positive and distinctive social identity and, as a consequence, group members emphasize likeable members and evaluate them more positive than outgroup members, bolstering the positive image of their ingroup (ingroup bias). Furthermore, the positive social identity may be threatened by group members who deviate from a relevant group norm. To protect the positive group image, ingroup members derogate ingroup deviants more harshly than deviants of an outgroup (Marques, Abrams, P√°ez, & Hogg, 2001). In addition, Eidelman and Biernat showed in 2003 that personal identities are also threatened through deviant ingroup members. They argue that devaluation of deviant members is an individual response of interpersonal differentiation. Khan and Lambert suggested in 1998 that cognitive processes such as assimilation and contrast, which may underline the effect, should be examined. =Limitations= Even though there is wide support for the black sheep effect, the opposite pattern has been found, for example, that White participants judge unqualified Black targets more negatively than comparable White targets (e.g. Feldman, 1972; Linville & Jones, 1980). Consequently, there are several factors which influence the black sheep effect. For instance, the higher the identification with the ingroup, and the higher the entitativity of the ingroup, the more the black sheep effect emerges. Even situational factors explaining the deviance have an influence whether the black sheep effect occurs.

The name is originally derived from the old French word ‚Äúbarre‚Äù; this had two meanings in the ancient language. Firstly, ‚Äúbarre‚Äù signified ‚Äúa pole‚Äù and may have been applied to an individual who made or sold such objects; on the other hand, the word also meant ‚Äúthe bar at a toll-house‚Äù and contemporaries of men who worked in such places may have referred to them in this manner. Thus it is clear that the name has an occupational origin, that is, it is based on the type of work the original bearer once did. It was not until the early Middle Ages that surnames were first used to distinguish between numbers of people bearing the same personal name. With the growth of documentation in the later Middle Ages, such names became essential, and a person, whose distinguishing name described his trade, his place of residence, his father‚Äôs name, or some personal characteristic, passed that name on to his children, and the surname became hereditary. Variants of the name in modern France include Barre, Delabarre and Desbarres. Notable bearers of the name have included Pierre la Barre, also called Barriere.

It was founded in 2003 by Louise Burfitt-Dons. The charity's purpose is to help bullied children - by providing them with confidential advice ‚Äì and to campaign to raise public awareness of the problem. The AAB website offers supportive messages and information on all forms of systematic bullying, in particular psychological bullying. The site also features advice on forms of bullying such as exclusion bullying and cyberbullying. The charity uses an all-volunteer staff. It has helped in situations where children and their parents had previously worked alone through their anti-bullying experiences. The ethos of the charity is motivational and upbeat. It aims to eliminate suicides and homicides that result from bullying. It actively promotes the virtues of kindness as the antithesis of bullying actions. History In 2000, playwright Louise Burfitt-Dons (born Louise Byres), published in 2001 40 anti-bullying monologues called Act Against Bullying for teachers to use in the classroom, because her daughter had been bullied at school. Burfitt-Dons was concerned that the advice given to victims to simply report the abuse could lead to further abuse. The monologues reported the insidiousness of the newer forms of bullying and offered an insight into what they could do. 'I didn't realise what I had started,' said Burfitt-Dons. The voluntary organisation Act Against Bullying formed in 2002. The group began to issue advisory leaflets that profiled \\"exclusion to cause distress\\" based on deliberate isolation from a community. The group targets children/people that have the mental capacity to carry out abusive actions toward others but do not realise the long-term impact of those actions. The organisation provided coping tips for teenage victims. The organisation began attracting funds and registered with the Charity Commission in October 2003. The Act Against Bullying Polo Cup started in June 2005 at the Guards Polo Club as part of the semi-final of the Queens Cup Tournament. Burfitt-Dons presented the Cup to the Dubai Polo Team in 2005 and 2006. In 2007 it went to the Ellerston White polo team. The charity launched the poster campaign Grade Not Degrade in November 2006. She was guest speaker at a House of Commons cyberbullying forum in June 2007 that was chaired by Shadow Minister for Children Tim Loughton. AAB was shortlisted for The Guardian Charity Award 2008. The Cyberkind campaign was launched at the House of Lords on Armistice Day 2009 by Baroness Hayman and Lord Grocott. It was a core member of the UK's Anti-Bullying Alliance until 2010.  Programs  =Wristband= A two colour silicone wristband adopts red as a symbol for strength and white for peace. = Cool to be Kind campaign = Cool To Be Kind is the major campaign of the charity and started in 2001 as a round of school talks on bullying. The motto was 'Don't be Rude, Don't Exclude, Don't Push In, Don't Hurt To Win, It's Cool to be Kind'. The campaign has since 2005 been celebrated in November during Anti-Bullying Week. To participate in this annual event, schools download resources from the AAB website, such as assembly notices and posters, AAB kindness certificates for presentations to reward anti-bullying behaviour. = CyberKind = Cyber- bullying can be done anonymously. Encouraging and rewarding 'niceness on the net' is their approach to eliminate the practice as an acceptable activity. = Act Against Bullying Polo Cup = This Cup was presented annually from 2005‚Äì2007 to the winner of the group's polo tournament. = Public education = Burfitt-Dons gives speeches to raise awareness of the rising statistics and varying forms of bullying and its adverse effect on youth culture, female aggression, and trends like happy slapping. = Grade Not Degrade campaign = The group wrote to all TV channels and OFCOM calling for a reduction in gratuitous aggression in TV programmes and in the media believing it to be a fundamental and pervasive source of copycat bullying abuse and violence in schools and society. There were posters.  Public profile  Act Against Bullying maintains a strong media presence which stimulated controversy owing to its glamorous profile. It recruited notable voluntary advisors including Hamish Brown MBE, the UK's leading authority on the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and ex-Fire Commissioner Brian Robinson. Many celebrities appeared in support at its fundraising events including Hayley Westenra and Duaine Ladejo. Big Brother participant Jade Goody helped after she was brought as a guest to the Act Against Bullying Cup in 2005. The group ended its association with Goody in January 2007 after Goody's alleged racist bullying behaviour towards another Celebrity Big Brother contestant. The charity removed a photograph of Goody and published a statement on their website that criticised the confrontational format of the Channel 4 show which gave the impression that Goody's behaviour was condoned. The statement was posted on the Digital Spy Forum by a viewer including the allegation that Goody was the charity's patron. On 16 January 2007, the national media published the story and AAB was inundated with angry and abusive emails. On the same day, Burfitt-Dons appeared on UK television to explain that Goody was ever a spokesperson or officially linked with the organisation. She claimed that Goody had been brought along as a guest at a function where she had bid for polo lessons with Jack Kidd (see Jodie Kidd) who was a supporter. Other celebrities attending that day were Nick Knowles and Julian Bennett. She made a further donation to AAB in 2006 following Goody's mother Jackiey Budden's appearance on a homemaker TV show. Burfitt-Dons published a further statement expressing admiration for the way in which the victim Shilpa Shetty had dealt with the bullying. Shilpa Shetty's management contacted AAB to offer Shilpa's support for the charity. Other media personalities linked with AAB are Jen Hunter who was publicly humiliated on a TV show over her height. Big Brother contestant Liza Jeynes contacted AAB for support over her suicide attempts from cyberbullying. AAB has a young following. Joseph McManners was photographed for them when he attended a function with Hugo Boss model Nicholas Joyce. They worked with Britain's Got Talent 2008 finalists martial arts duo Strike. In 2008 Fashion Showcase Wales sponsored by L'Oreal was held in support of the charity at the Sophia Gardens in Cardiff in AAB campaign posters and messages featured in The Inbetweeners Movie.

This is because migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system. In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status. Migrant workers are not necessarily rural workers; they can simply be people living in urban areas with rural household registration. In 2015 a total of 277.5 million migrant workers (36% of the total workforce of 770 million) existed in China. Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63 million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15 million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010).National Bureau of Statistics of China (2012): \\"Statistical Communiqu√© on the 2011 National Economic and Social Development\\", http://www.stats.gov.cn/was40/gjtjj_en_detail.jsp?searchword=migrants&channelid;=9528&record;=3. (accessed 06.08.2012). (beneath figure 3) The balance of gender for migrant workers was two-thirds male to one-third female in 2015. Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people. This population of migrants would represent \\"almost 40 percent of the total urban population,\\" a number which is almost three times the current level. While it is often difficult to collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. \\"In China's largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.\\" China's government influences the pattern of urbanization through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land- sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are more employment, education, and business opportunities, and higher standard of living. History and origins =Qing dynasty= Northeast In 1668 during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, the Qing government decreed a prohibition of non-Eight Banner people getting into Northeast China Manchuria of their origin. Han Chinese were banned from settling in this region but the rule was openly violated and Han Chinese became a majority in urban areas by the early 19th century. However Qing rule saw a massively increasing amount of Han Chinese both illegally and legally streaming into Manchuria and settling down to cultivate land as Manchu landlords desired Han Chinese peasants to rent on their land and grow grain, most Han Chinese migrants were not evicted as they went over the Great Wall and Willow Palisade, during the eighteenth century Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares of privately owned land in Manchuria and 203,583 hectares of lands which were part of courtier stations, noble estates, and Banner lands, in garrisons and towns in Manchuria Han Chinese made up 80% of the population.Richards 2003, p. 141. Han Chinese farmers were resettled from north China by the Qing to the area along the Liao River in order to restore the land to cultivation.Reardon-Anderson 2000, p. 504. Wasteland was reclaimed by Han Chinese squatters in addition to other Han who rented land from Manchu landlords.Reardon-Anderson 2000, p. 505. Despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s.Reardon-Anderson 2000, p. 506. The Qianlong Emperor allowed Han Chinese peasants suffering from drought to move into Manchuria despite him issuing edicts in favor of banning them from 1740-1776.Scharping 1998, p. 18. Chinese tenant farmers rented or even claimed title to land from the \\"imperial estates\\" and Manchu Bannerlands in the area.Reardon-Anderson 2000, p. 507. Besides moving into the Liao area in southern Manchuria, the path linking Jinzhou, Fengtian, Tieling, Changchun, Hulun, and Ningguta was settled by Han Chinese during the Qianlong Emperor's reign, and Han Chinese were the majority in urban areas of Manchuria by 1800.Reardon-Anderson 2000, p. 508. To increase the Imperial Treasury's revenue, the Qing sold formerly Manchu only lands along the Sungari to Han Chinese at the beginning of the Daoguang Emperor's reign, and Han Chinese filled up most of Manchuria's towns by the 1840s according to Abbe Huc.Reardon-Anderson 2000, p. 509. Inner Mongolia Han Chinese were officially forbidden to settle in Inner and Outer Mongolia. Mongols were forbidden from crossing into the Han Chinese 18 provinces (neidi) without permission and were given punishments if they did. Mongols were forbidden from crossing into another Mongol leagues. Han Chinese settlers violated the rule and crossed into and settled in Inner Mongolia. Despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s. Ordinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden by the Qing from crossing the borders of their banners, even into other Mongol Banners and from crossing into neidi (the Han Chinese 18 provinces) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the Mongols divided against each other to benefit the Qing.Bulag 2012, p. 41. During the eighteenth century, growing numbers of Han Chinese settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791 there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the Front Gorlos Banner that the yasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalize the status of the peasants who had already settled there. Xinjiang The Qing implemented two different policies for Dzungaria (Northern Xinjiang) and the Tarim Basin (Altishahr, Southern Xinjiang). The Manchus had wiped out the native Buddhist Oirat Dzungars in their land of Dzungaria. Then the Qing implemented a large scale settlement in Dzungaria to colonize the newly empty grasslands. Han Chinese were encouraged by the Qing to permanently settle and colonize Dzungaria while permanent Han settlers were banned from the Tarim with only Han merchants allowed. The ban was lifted in the 1820s after the invasion of Jahangir Khoja and Han Chinese were allowed to permanently settle in the Tarim. Hans were around one third of Xinjiang's population in 1800, during the time of the Qing Dynasty. Professor of Chinese and Central Asian History at Georgetown University, James A. Millward wrote that foreigners often mistakenly think that Urumqi was originally a Uyghur city and that the Chinese destroyed its Uyghur character and culture, however, √úr√ºmqi was founded as a Chinese city by Han and Hui (Tungans), and it is the Uyghurs who are new to the city.Millward 1998, p. 133.Millward 1998, p. 134. While a few people try to give a misportrayal of the historical Qing situation in light of the contemporary situation in Xinjiang with Han migration, and claim that the Qing settlements and state farms were an anti-Uyghur plot to replace them in their land, Professor James A. Millward pointed out that the Qing agricultural colonies in reality had nothing to do with Uyghur and their land, since the Qing banned settlement of Han in the Uyghur Tarim Basin and in fact directed the Han settlers instead to settle in the non-Uyghur Dzungaria and the new city of √úr√ºmqi, so that the state farms which were settled with 155,000 Han Chinese from 1760-1830 were all in Dzungaria and √úr√ºmqi, where there was only an insignificant amount of Uyghurs, instead of the Tarim Basin oases.Millward 2007, p. 104. At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang.Millward, James A. (2007). Eurasian crossroads: A history of Xinjiang. . p. 306 A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% Han and 60% Turkic, while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han has been restored as of 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur. Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation is similar to that of the early Qing period in Xinjiang. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern are, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.ed. Starr 2004, p. 243. √úr√ºmqi was settled with troops while Green Standard troops and Altishari Turkic peoples settled in Ili after being ordered to by Qianlong in 1757.https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/761498/Gregory_georgetown_0076D_13086.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y p. 492. √úr√ºmqi was used as a place for exiles.https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/761498/Gregory_georgetown_0076D_13086.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y pp. 382, 330. The genocide victim Dzungars were the natives of northern Xinjiang. Han, Manchu, and Southern Xinjiang's Turkic Taranchi Muslims were all colonizers in Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria). Han soldiers of the Green Standard Army were settled in the 1770s in Ili and √úr√ºmqi by the Qing. √úr√ºmqi had very little Uyghurs while it had many Hui and Han in 1787. There were 76,496 Uyghurs and 477,321 Han in 1960 √úr√ºmqi. Tibet The Qing stationed both Manchu Bannermen and Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers in Tibet. A community descended from Han Chinese soldiers and officials grew in Lhasa. At multiple places such as Lhasa, Batang, Dartsendo, Lhari, Chamdo, and Litang, Green Standard troops were garrisoned throughout the Dzungar war.Wang 2011, p. 30. Green Standard Army troops and Manchu Bannermen were both part of the Qing force who fought in Tibet in the war against the Dzungars.Dai 2009, p. 81. It was said that the Sichuan commander Yue Zhongqi entered Lhasa first when the 2,000 Green Standard soldiers and 1,000 Manchu soldiers of the \\"Sichuan route\\" seized Lhasa.Dai 2009, pp. 81-2. According to Mark C. Elliott, after 1728 the Qing used Green Standard Army troops to man the garrison in Lhasa rather than Bannermen.Elliott 2001, p. 412. According to Evelyn S. Rawski both Green Standard Army and Bannermen made up the Qing garrison in Tibet. Rawski 1998, p. 251. According to Sabine Dabringhaus, Green Standard Chinese soldiers numbering more than 1,300 were stationed by the Qing in Tibet to support the 3,000 strong Tibetan army.Dabringhaus 2014, p. 123. In the mid 19th century, arriving with an Amban, a community of Chinese troops from Sichuan who married Tibetan women settled down in the Lubu neighborhood of Lhasa, where their descendants established a community and assimilated into Tibetan culture.Yeh 2009, p. 60. Hebalin was the location of where Chinese Muslim troops and their offspring lived, resulting in the Hebalin Khache community, while Lubu was the place where Han Chinese troops and their offspring lived.Yeh 2013, p. 283. Sichuan and Guizhou Migration to Sichuan and Guizhou happened during the Qing dynasty as a continuation of migration that started in the Yuan dynasty. That is why most people in Sichuan who speak a Han dialect speak Mandarin, while regions at the same latitude such as Guangdong, have their own dialects. Many people from areas such as Hunan moved there in search of space. They consisted of various ethnicities ranging from Han, Hui and Mongol to Yao and Miao. Many cultures already existed in Sichuan, such as the Yi, and some of the emigrants integrated into these ethnic backgrounds, even to the point of forgetting the Han language. During the Qing dynasty, people started defining themselves as locals or immigrants and there was static between the two groups.https://www.persee.fr/doc/adh_0066-2062_1982_num_1982_1_1543 =People's Republic of China= The unique hukou system of China distinguishes Chinese internal migration from migration in other developing countries. In 1958, China established the universal hukou system that restricted the mobility of the population. It aimed to tie farmers to land, secure agricultural supply as well as to support industrial sector in cities after the Great Leap Forward and Great Chinese Famine which caused at least 30 million deaths. The government allocated housing, jobs, food and other necessities based on the hukou system, which made it almost impossible for people without local hukou status to live in urban areas. In addition to Hukou system, the people's commune system was another tool to control labor mobility. Under the people's commune system, the earnings of farmers were closely related to their daily participation in the collective farming. In 1978, during Chinese economic reform, this system was replaced by the household-responsibility system, which loosened the restriction of people's mobility. Huang and Pieke divide the migration policy evolution after Chinese economic reform into four periods. The first period is from 1979 to 1983, during which the government still prohibited migration. The second period is from 1984 to 1988 when farmers were allowed to enter urban areas on the condition that they provided their own food. The third period is from 1989 to 1991 when migration became much more popular and had attracted much attention from the government. The fourth period is from 1992 to 2000, during which the government in some degree encouraged migration, while urban local governments controlled migration more strictly because of high unemployment rates in cities. From 1949 to 1985, the net migration rate for China was 0.24, compared with world average of 1.84 from 1950 to 1990. Since the mid-1980s, rural to urban migration became a constant social phenomenon. Zhao and Sicular report that the number of rural-urban migration doubled between the late 1980s and the mid 1990s. In 1989, there were 8.9 million migrants and in 1994 the number increased to 23.0 million. In 2006 it was estimated that China was experiencing a ‚Äì0.39 per 1,000 population net migration rate. According to National Bureau of Statistics, there were 252.78 million migrant workers in China in 2011.  Occupational profile Rural-urban migrant workers have a significant presence in China's labor force. By 2006, migrant workers comprised 40% of the total urban labor force. According to data from National Bureau of Statistics, in 2009 nearly 39.1% of them worked in manufacturing, about 17.3% in construction and more than 7.8% in wholesale and retail. In addition, the number of the migrants who were employed in the tertiary sector of the economy was increasing, which indicated a new trend of employment choice. A report from International Labour Organization in 2006 states that there were also 80 million workers working in the informal sector and it was estimated that between two-thirds and three-quarters of all new employment is in the informal economy. In the informal economy, many rural migrants are engaged in low-paying and temporary jobs such as sanitation workers and porters. Zhu addresses that they are not \\"employed\\" in the informal sector, but they \\"have access only\\" to the informal sector. Scholars agree that there is a sharp occupational segregation between migrants and the local population. A study that compared employment situations of urban residents and migrant labors in 2005 reports that around 52% of migrants were self-employed, while 12% of the local residents were self-employed; 12% of migrant workers were employed in the public sector, compared with 68% of the local workforce. The degree of segregation varies from province to province. A series of field studies by China Center for Economic Research demonstrate that the labor market in Sichuan province is relatively integrated, while in Guangdong province and Shanghai the labor market is quite segregated with \\"rural migratory-worker urban-resident-worker dualism\\". In addition to inadequate social protection, the primary reason of the occupational segregation is the migrant workers‚Äô lack of skills and education, which keeps them in manual labor. Migrant workers have less human capital since they have less schooling, shorter job tenure and less training compared with the local residents. Moreover, because of the high rate of job mobility among rural migrant workers, employers have little incentive to train them and thereby prevent them from increasing their social capital.  Causes  The causes of migration can originate from various factors within Chinese societies. Migration in some contexts can refer to the search for self-identity and self- transformation which pushed many young workers to migrate to more urbanized areas of China. This search for self-identity and self transformation was consequence of recent globalization. \\"Mobility and modernity have become inextricably linked in the contemporary era of globalization\\". Secondly, migration to distant cities for work was not an option for most rural workers of previous generations. Migration created many opportunities for both women and men to extricate themselves from their current rural status and create a new name for themselves and their family. Thirdly, migration enabled the rural youth to become wage earners, consumers and city-dwellers which allowed them to become more globalized and mobile than they would have within their own respective villages. While the urbanization of Chinese workers provides them with more opportunity, it also can constrain them, as migrant workers, specifically females, typically make lower wages and are viewed as replaceable labor. A population density map. The eastern, coastal provinces are much more densely populated than the western interior because of the opportunities available to migrants. =Surplus labor= Labor surplus in rural areas is often regarded as one of the factors of internal migration in China. Central to this theory is that surplus rural labor provides a needed work force for industrial growth in urban areas On one hand, the Household-responsibility system (HRS) established during Chinese economic reform was productive and generated surplus labor in rural areas. On the other hand, in urban areas the development of the special economic zones and industries created demand for labor force. Some scholars state that, while the surplus rural labor is viewed as the main \\"push factor\\", demand for labor can be regarded as the main \\"pull factor\\". Others contend that high unemployment rates in urban areas rejected this paradigm. =Income gap= Early in 1970, the Harris-Todaro model recognized that the persistent wage differential between urban and rural sectors is a main \\"pull\\" factor of migration in developing countries. In Zhu's study conducted in 2002, he presents a model of migration in his study and confirms the significance of the urban-rural income gap for migration decisions. Studies of Dr. Cai, Director of Institute of Population and Labor Economics, demonstrate that an increase of the ratio of local rural income to the average national rural income will reduce migration. Besides the huge rural-urban income gap, the regional income gap also drives internal migration in China. As noted by Zhao whose research interest mainly lies in labor economics, many migrants flow from the western region with low incomes to the eastern region with higher incomes. =Migrant networks= Migrant networks have a significant role in labor migration. Migrant networks are \\"sets of interpersonal ties that connect migrants, former migrants, and non-immigrants\\" through the ties of family members, friendships, and the overall community. The role is \\"particularly prominent in situations in which migration involves large informational or psychic costs, such as when moving to a completely different culture or environment or if the destination labor market is hostile to immigrants\\". China's migrants are heavily dependent on their migrant networks to assist them in finding jobs and houses, while also making sure they are financially stable. Migrant networks can reduce the cost of labor migration by providing job information and supportive relationships to the immigrants, as well as job search assistance. These networks can be described by the Chinese term Guanxi which \\"describes the basic dynamic in personalized networks of influence.\\" Migrant workers can potentially find jobs at a restaurant or within the garment industry run by migrants from the same origins. In a study conducted by Liang and Morroka, whose research focuses on migration in China, they reported that female migrants are more likely to rely on the developed migration networks, while younger migrants and those with higher level of education are less likely to depend on the networks.  Benefits and costs  =Benefits= How do transient individuals experience migration in China, and what are the cultural, social, and even political ramifications of their migration experience? Through these experiences, many migrants come to expect certain benefits. Gaetano explains that China ‚Äúunderstands that a woman should have a life outside of the fields and the kitchen. This awareness will surely help improve the quality of life for women in the rural areas.‚Äù This quote suggests that rural women in particular who were exposed to modern globalization of gender and cultural roles lived improved lives. Labor in China was greatly segregated by gender. Where typically young, beautiful women found jobs in the beauty industry and often found better wages and living quarters. Gaetano further explains that ‚Äúwomen have had a virtual monopoly in urban domestic service and hotel and restaurant hospitality‚Äù. While females took the hospitality industry, males found themselves in the low-skill, low-wage industrial jobs which includes construction-like jobs. Though the jobs held grueling hours, being paid and establishing an identity separate from their household was a huge benefit for many transient workers. Generally speaking, the difference in living standards between rural and urban workers was apparent where urban workers tended to live a more lavish lifestyle. This lavish lifestyle included better living quarters, nutrition, guanxi (social connections), and access to education. Education especially was a huge factor for the migration of families. Rural women were seeking to better educate their offspring in the hopes of better economic success for their children. =Costs= With the benefits of migration comes the cost of migration for many transient workers. Even though traveling to a larger city with more opportunities appeared beneficial, in many instances migrants were treated harshly and viewed as second class citizens. Gao Yu, the China country director for the Landesa Rural Development Institute in Seattle stated that ‚ÄúMigrants who move with their children face a host of other challenges, including enrolling their children in school. Many schools regard prior education background as an important criterion and will not admit children educated in rural schools ‚Äì often considered inferior.‚Äù This quote suggests that many migrants and their children were seen as inferior in schools, as well as in many other public areas in China. Because many rural Chinese workers were making about $2 a day, they were forced to move to the city, causing an influx of migrant workers who were seeking better opportunities. In response, In the mid 1980s in China, in order to control migration rates, transient workers were required to carry personal identity cards, employment registration card, and a certificate of good health which often had high fees due to corruption and were many times denied by the Hukou system At the time, migrants were seen as a nuisance to society and needed to be kept in check. However, in the mid-2000s attitudes towards migration drastically changed. In the novel Out to work, Migration, Gender, and the Changing Lives of Rural Women in Contemporary China, Gaetano explained how ‚ÄúMigrants were finally recognized to be critical in narrowing the rural-urban income gap, as they redistribute wealth through remittances and apply new knowledge and skills to develop rural areas‚Äù. Even though China recognized the importance of migrant workers, their ‚Äúlow levels of education, skills, and work experience, and their dearth of urban social connections, combined with the hukou-based job distribution‚Äù still created many disadvantages for rural migrants.  Social impacts  = Labor supply = In general, the current system of circular migration of floating populations in China offers greater labor resources to coastal areas of high economic activity, but \\"although labor productivity in migrant activities is higher than it is in local nonfarm sectors, the current economic cost of migration in China is so high as to significantly limit such reallocation. The current system therefore works to reduce the overall productivity of labor and causes a tremendous loss of social resources.\\" In other words, research done by Yaohui Zhao at Beijing University indicates that while economic theory demonstrates labor migration to increase efficiency due to the reallocation of labor, the economic cost of migration actually mitigates gains in efficiency enough that internal migration under the Hukou system results in financial and social losses instead of gains. = Violations of labor standards = Violations of labor standards involve labor contracts, working conditions, wage payments and social insurance. The problems in terms of labor standards violations are rooted in institutional discrimination against migrant workers as well as inadequate law enforcement. Low incidents of labor contracts are a main form of labor standards violations, which allows employers to further violate labor rights in many other aspects. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Urban and Rural Development, Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in 2004, only between 10% and 37.5% of the migrants working in the construction industry signed labor contracts. A recent research by the Jinan Daily demonstrates that eight out of ten migrant workers did not know what the labor contract was. Many employers thus take advantage of migrant workers‚Äô unawareness and do not fulfill their obligations to sign labor contracts. The working condition is one manifest aspect of labor standards violations.The majority of migrants work more hours per day and more days per week than what is limited by labor law. The Chinese Household Income Project Survey of 2002 show that over 80% of migrants worked seven days per week, and only 7% workers‚Äô working time was in accordance with what law regulated. It also showed that around 33.3% of migrant workers worked 9 to 10 hours per day, about 25% 11 to 12 hours and 12% 13 or more hours per day. Safety is another concern regarding the working condition. The prevalence of migrant workers in dangerous jobs results in a high number of work-related illnesses, injuries and deaths. Migrant workers make up 80% of the deaths in mining, construction, and chemical factories. And about 90% of those suffering from work-related diseases are migrant workers. In terms of wage payment, although labor law regulates a minimum wage, many employers either ignore the regulation or consider it to be the maximum wage. According to an article in China Daily in 2006, nearly 30% of migrant workers earned RMB 300 and 500 on average per month, nearly 40% between RMB 500 and 800 and about 28% more than RMB 800. Moreover, it is common for migrant workers not to receive their wage on time, due to the lack of protection of labor rights. The government has realized the seriousness of wage arrears and taken many measures to deal with this issue. The situation has been improved a lot, but overall the problem of wage arrears still exists. In 2006, around 10% of rural-urban migrant workers received their wages on average seven months late. The limited access of migrant workers to social insurance highlights their vulnerability. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2005 reports that only 13% of rural-urban migrant workers had insurance coverage for occupational injuries and diseases, only 10% for medical insurance and 15% for pension scheme. Another survey reports that migrant workers‚Äô participation in pension schemes was as high as 33.7%; medical care, 21.6%; unemployment insurance, 10.3%; employment injury insurance, 31.8%. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that less than 5% got pension insurance and less than 3% of rural migrant laborers enjoyed unemployment insurance. = Class and inequality = At a group expert meeting of the United Nations in January 2008, a number of class-based implications of Chinese urban growth due to migration were identified, including \\"wage arrears, unfair compensation for land expropriated, urban poverty,\\" issues of \\"public safety and social stability,\\" and the potential creation of a \\"permanent urban underclass\\" of 200 million or more workers. Class inequality is commonly reflected in income differentials; \\"in urban China, urban resident annual earnings are 1.3 times larger than long-term rural migrant earnings as observed in a nationally represented sample in 2002.\\" Additionally, migrant workers in China are generally excluded from the social services their local neighbors enjoy; \\"migrant workers‚Äô basic needs for housing, social security, and education for their children are not protected by the local government.\\" = Health = The floating population of Chinese migrant workers \\"presents major public health challenges, especially in the provision of reproductive health care for migrant women and the need to address the increased risk to both sexes of infection with sexually transmitted diseases and HIV.\\" A survey of migrant workers published in the journal \\"Public Health Reports\\" indicated that \\"forty-seven percent of the migrants were unwilling to make contributions to health insurance,\\" and \\"poor living conditions and inattention to health may make migrants vulnerable to poor long-term health.\\" Despite these health issues presented by the floating population, certain factors mitigate the health impact of internal migration in China. In a questionnaire administered to a variety of rural, urban, and migrant workers in Zhejing Province, Eastern China, 2004, indicated that \\"Migrants had the best self-rated health and reported the least acute illness, chronic disease, and disability, after controlling for age and education.\\" In light of this data, the researchers concluded that the migrants had zero HIV infections, and the migrant workers examined demonstrated the \\"healthy migrant effect.\\" Despite this, migration still creates a negative effect on public health due to the lack of affordable health care.  Mental health  Historically, \\"migration has been associated with increased vulnerability to mental health problems,\\" and this has prompted some research into the mental health status of China's hundreds of millions of rural-urban migrants. Research by scholars from Zhejiang University and the UCL Centre for International Health and Development has however revealed that \\"rural-urban migrant workers in this part of China are not especially vulnerable to poor mental health.\\" They believe that this \\"may result from a sense of well being associated with upward economic mobility and improved opportunities, and the relatively high social capital in migrant communities.\\" Thus, the \\"healthy migrant effect\\" also exhibits itself in the mental health of rural-urban migrants in China. = Gender = Migration in China has produced a number of important impacts with regard to gender and gender equality in modern China. This process, usually known as a 'transition', \\"has gendered consequences and differential implications for men and women.\\" The men and women who partake in rural-urban labor migration are \\"channeled into gender-segregated jobs and that gender division of labor is increasingly becoming a dominant mode of household production in the countryside.\\" According to research conducted by Youqin Huang and published in the journal Environment and Planning A, \\"the constraints of human capital, the patriarchal culture and the Household Registration (Hukou). After the migration process, females \\"are at a disadvantage in the labour market not only because of their gender, but also because of their rural identities and outsider status.\\" One way in which this may be seen is in the fact that women migrants \\"can only attain jobs with lower prestige than their male counterparts, such as agricultural work and a few gender-stereotyped, family-related urban jobs.\\" Despite the disadvantages faced by female migrants in China, some research such as that conducted with data from Hubei Province demonstrates that \\"migration has enabled women to benefit from economic opportunities and provided them with a degree of freedom that was not possible at their places of origin.\\" Currently, there is some scholarly agreement on the net effect of migration in China on women in particular, \\"female migrant workers are doubly disadvantaged in China‚Äôs urban labor market because of their doubly marginalized identities as both women and rural residents.\\" = Education = school for migrant students in Beijing (Dongba district). According to a research conducted by Zai Liang and Yiu Por Chen and published in the journal \\"Social Science Research\\", \\"migration usually has negative consequences for children's schooling because of the loss of social capital in schools, neighborhood, and community of origin.\\" In theory, migrant children can study in urban public schools, but access is usually limited. The main reason is that the education budget for compulsory education is allocated through local governments and strictly based on local hukou population. Many of the urban public schools with a limited education budget are consequently reluctant to accept migrant children. One usual way for migrant children to study in urban public schools, which is distinct from usual admission procedure, is to pay \\"sponsorship\\" fees (zanzhu fei). The amount of such fees can be prohibitive for poor migrant parents, which impedes many migrant children to get enrolled in public schools. Up to now, there are some improvements in terms of access to urban public schools and some cities have banned \\"sponsorship\\" fees, but specific policy varies from city to city. A large portion of migrant children are still excluded from the urban public education system. In response to the lack of access to public educational resources, migrants in some big cities began to set their own schools since the 1990s. These schools are known as migrant-sponsored schools (nongmingong zidi xuexiao). At the beginning, urban authorities refused to grant licenses and even closed down the schools. Although local governments did not need to be responsible for migrants‚Äô welfare, they should still be responsible for any accident such as the collapse of buildings or food poisoning that happened in the schools. These schools are usually less expensive with average tuition fees around 300 RMB per semester. According to Lu and Zhang's research conducted in Beijing in 2001, migrant-sponsored schools usually did not have licenses, high education quality, and adequate facilities. They, however, conclude that despite such disadvantages, these schools at least provided migrant children with basic education. In addition to the issue of access to education, migrant children have to return to their places of their hukou origin to take The National College Entrance Examination. The entire school enrollment system in China is place-based and they can only pass certain examinations in their places of hukou origin. This leads to discrepancies between what migrant students have studied in urban areas and what they will be examined as textbooks in different cities and provinces can be quite different. Since 2016, Guangdong has relaxed its policies. A child of migrants can take Entrance Exam in Guangdong if he or she has attended 3 years of highschool in the province, and if the parent(s) have legal jobs and have paid for 3 years of social insurance in the province. =Left-behind children= Left-behind children in China refer to the children who live with one parent (usually mother) or extended family (usually grandparents) when their parent(s) is (are) absent from home as migrant workers in urban areas. They are left behind partly because of little access to basic welfare in cities without local hukou status and partly because of high living expenses in cities. According to Ministry of Education, in 2012 there were more than 12.6 million migrant children and 58 million left-behind children from 7 years old to 16 years old. Left-behind children will have more health, emotional and behavior issues than those who grow up with their parents. Left-behind children are generally less healthy, but the difference is very marginal. A study conducted by several professors from Chinese University of Hong Kong reports that left-behind children are more likely to have a less healthy diet and lower rates of physical activity. In terms of nutrition, left-behind children face more nutrition problems such as low intake of some nutrients and poor physical development related to nutrition. Further, many studies find that left-behind children are more likely to have a smoking habit, compared to children with no migrant parents. Primary causes include insufficient public awareness and lack of health education programs. Weak implementation of related regulations in rural areas such as prohibition to sell cigarettes to children under 18 may also contribute to this unsatisfying situation. Left- behind children are also prone to undergo emotional and psychological problems. Liang's study of 250 left-behind junior high school students suggests that 16.6% of them felt abandoned, 12.3% had problems expressing difficulties, and 6.5% felt \\"anguished\\" when being left behind. In addition, the earlier those children are separated from parents, more symptoms of depression and anxiety will be reported. Moreover, various studies indicate that left-behind children are more likely to have behavioral problems. Qualitative observations indicate that left-behind children often behavior extremely, either withdrawn or excessively aggressive. It has also been reported that left-behind children tend to be \\"indifferent, introverted, inferior\\" and \\"selfish\\". The problems noted above are mainly due to the fact that the grandparents either spoil the children or fail to give them enough emotional support. Physical weakness and low education levels of grandparents who take care of left-behind children also contribute to the problems. Comparative studies show that left-behind children's situation is not much worse than that of those living with parents in the same area. On the one hand, the institutions (e.g. the hukou system) that maintain the urban-rural inequality should be modified so that more migrants can settle down in cities with families. On the other hand, public resources in rural communities should be improved and regional inequality should be further reduced. Policy theories Scholars from a wide variety of fields have recommended policy changes in order to deal with the social issues created by floating populations of migrant workers in China. Some scholars believe that \\"public policies reducing the cost (including the opportunity cost) of education for rural people could help filling the endowment gap between rural migrants and urban residents in the labor market.\\" Additionally, scholars have recommended that \\"new policy initiatives concerning the issue of education and migrant children are sorely needed.\\" Public health scholars recommend that \\"because health insurance schemes will remain limited for the foreseeable future, attention should focus on providing affordable health care to both uninsured migrants and the urban poor.\\" In light of the migrant worker Foxconn suicides, labor scholars have recommended that \\"the government should redistribute income and guarantee benefits to rural residents and migrant workers to improve living standards.\\" Those studying labor mobility believe that \\"the artificial restrictions under which rural-urban migrants work in the cities, i.e. the prohibition on or impediments to urban settlement, restricted access to skilled jobs, and the system of short-term contracts, may have generated an excessively high migrant mobility rate.\\" = Health policy = family planning publicity event for migrant population (ÊµÅÂä®‰∫∫Âè£ËÆ°ÂàíÁîüËÇ≤ÂÆ£‰º†ÊúçÂä°Ê¥ªÂä®) at the Wuchang Railway Station. January 2011. The issue of internal migration and health in China is intricately linked with the health policies national and local level governments enforce. \\"Policy toward rural-urban migration in China has undergone a significant shift in the last decade, and improving the working and living conditions and access to health care of migrant workers in cities is now clearly on the agenda of national and local governments. Nonetheless, migrants‚Äô mobility and their concentration in hazardous industries continue to make it difficult to reduce their exposure to environmental and occupational health risks and to ensure their access to affordable care.\\" In order to further improve the \\"living conditions and acces to health care of migrant workers in cities,\\" a number of scholars have recently provided policy recommendations. In general, public health scholars recommend that \\"because health insurance schemes will remain limited for the foreseeable future, attention should focus on providing affordable health care to both uninsured migrants and the urban poor.\\" In light of this recommendation, further research has been conducted in order to assess the status of internal migration and health in China, as well as to provide more specific policy recommendations in order to address any issues. Research conducted by a team from Beijing Normal University and the Institute of Development Studies has provided a number of specific recommendations for policy makers. In a journal article published in The Lancet, this team voiced three primary concerns regarding the health of migrants in China. These concerns consisted of the spread of communicable and infectious disease, migrant maternal health, and occupational disease and injuries such as silicosis, chemical poisoning, and industrial machinery accidents. Beyond these three primary concerns, the researchers advise policy makers and public health officials to pay more attention to two additional issues. The first of these is mental and behavioural health, which is a \\"domain that is understudied in China.\\" The second issue they discuss is that of risk perception. Little is known about how migrants perceive the \\"various possibilities for health care: self- medication, informal healers, traditional medicine, private clinics with varied levels of care, and more formal hospital treatment.\\" Research into risk perception will \\"be crucial to prevention, intervention, and other health- related measures for the migrant population in China. =Labor policy= The government collected defaulted salaries from employers and paid the salaries to migrant workers in Liaoning Province in 2010. Two landmark policy documents regarding migrant workers were issued in 2002 and 2003, named Document Number 2 of 2002 and Document Number 1 of 2003.These two documents initialized the process of elimination of labor market discrimination against migrant workers and legitimization of them. In addition, the 2002 Work Safety Law and the Law on the Prevention and Cure of Occupational Diseases demanded that all employers must guarantee a safe working environment for all employees. In 2004, employers in high-risk industries such as mining and construction were required to cover injury insurance for migrant workers. In the 2005 Government Work Report, Premier Wen Jiabao noted that the payment of migrant workers should not be delayed. In March 2006, the State Council called for the establishment of a system that monitored wage delivery to migrant workers. In June 2006, the State Council passed a series of measures to protect migrant workers‚Äô labor rights, following up Circular No. 36. The measures include the restriction of minimum wages, solutions to wage defaults, enforcement of labor contacts and enlargement of migrant workers‚Äô social security coverage. With the government's continuous efforts, the situation of migrant workers have been improved, though still varying from province to province. In 2005, 80% of migrant workers had been fully paid. In Shanghai, more than two million migrant workers are in a special social security program. =Education policy= Early in 2003, China has issued an announcement on migration management and pays much attention on migrant children's education. The government mainly focused on possible financial reform, encouraged public schools to admit more migrant children, forbade extra fees and sponsored migrant-sponsored schools. The announcement noted equal access to education, elimination of sponsorship fees and the government funding for migrant- sponsored schools. In September 2003, a joint directive declared that urban governments and public schools should be responsible for migrant children's equal access to education. Although there are various policies related to migrant children's education, in Hu's doctoral thesis, he addresses that the policy is partially implemented and the situation varies from province to province. Policy regarding funding is not being effectively implemented. Public schools do not have enough funding and subsequently school access is still limited. In addition, migrant parents need to present a series of certificates showing that they have stable jobs and accommodation in cities in order to get their children admitted in public schools. = Hukou reform= The Chinese government has committed to eliminating institutional discrimination of migrant workers on the grounds of hukou system. But the reform is complicated since it involves restructuring political and social systems, which will impact every aspect including employment, social security and property rights. The objective of the reform is to merge urban and rural hukou systems into one in which migrant workers can have equal access to public resources as urban residents do. At the beginning of the New Millennium, Fujian, Liaoning and Shandong Provinces abolished the dual-type hukou system and issued identical hukou status to both urban and rural residents. Up to 2008, twelve provinces had abolished the dual urban-rural hukou system. Due to the complication of this issue, however, it is still very difficult for migrant workers to gain access to social welfare in urban areas, though with a hukou reform. For example, some cities such as Zhengzhou once opened public schools to rural migrant children in 2002, but these cities soon realized that there were not enough schools for the large number of migrant children. According to China Daily, Huang Ming, vice-minister of public security, addressed that the national hukou reform would be done by 2020. He said in the interview that the new hukou system would gradually extend pension, education and health care services to qualified residents, both urban and rural. China's hukou system is a social management system. This system links every Chinese resident with their birthplace. One can only access their health care, pension and education for their children in their birth city. Cai Fang, director of the Institute of Population Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, stated that migrant workers do not have the same benefits as the urban residents. As a result of unequal benefits the migrant workers have limited participation in the labor market. Mr Cai estimates that more than 200 million migrant workers can't participate fully in the labor market due to the limitations from the Chinese hukou system. Sources and destinations =Internal Migration= Map showing the various administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China.According to the International Labour Organization, internal migration in China is defined by two essential features. The first of these is that migrants generally move from farmlands and agricultural areas into more urban areas and developed cities. The second defining feature of Chinese internal migration is that \\"labour flows are basically directed from the interior to coastal areas, and/or from central and western regions to eastern areas.\\" These are not independent characteristics; \\"These two features overlap, and are closely interrelated with the macro socio-economic structure. Migrants leaving Badong in mostly rural western Hubei for the provincial capital Wuhan with an overnight bus have to brave the rigors of Highway G209. The Fifth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China in 2000 counted 42.4 million people living outside of their home provinces (i.e., outside of the province where they were legally domiciled). These would include e.g. migrant workers, students on campuses away from home, but not the military (who, generally, are counted separately from the provinces' and municipalities' populations). The largest migrant population was found in Guangdong (15.0 mln). The rest of China's southeastern seaboard attracted plenty of migrants as well (Shanghai (3.1 mln), Jiangsu (2.5 mln), Zhejiang (2.0 mln), Fujian (2.1 mln)); Beijing had 2.5 million. The coastal Liaoning and Shandong, as well as the inland Yunnan and Xinjiang had over a million migrants each. http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/renkoupucha/2000pucha/html/t0106.htm Á¨¨‰∫îÊ¨°‰∫∫Âè£ÊôÆÊü•Êï∞ÊçÆ(2000Âπ¥). Ë°®7‚Äî2 ÂÖ®ÂõΩÊåâÁé∞‰ΩèÂú∞„ÄÅÊà∑Âè£ÁôªËÆ∞Âú∞Âú®Â§ñÁúÅÂàÜÁöÑ‰∫∫Âè£ (Fifth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China (2000). Table 7-2: Population residing outside of the province of household registration.) Migrants originated mostly in the inland provinces, such as Anhui (4.3 mln), Jiangxi (3.7 mln), Henan (3.1 mln), Hunan (4.3 mln), Hubei (2.8 mln), Guangxi (2.4 mln), Sichuan (6.9 mln). Much of the interprovincial migration was toward the neighboring wealthier provinces or municipalities if there was one. E.g., over 90% of the Guangxi migrants went to the nearby Guangdong, while over 60% of Hebei migrants went to the Beijing and Tianjin municipalities (which both are surrounded by Hebei's territory). On the other hand, among the Hubei migrants about one half went to Guangdong, and the rest mostly to various other coastal destinations, from Beijing to Fujian. It is of interest to the Chinese government to control the flow of internal migration in China. However, the flow of migration is large and widespread enough to be difficult for the government to manage. \\"Despite the Chinese government's policy of encouraging the development of western regions of the country, China's coastal regions, and especially the province of Guangdong, experienced the largest increase in the size of the floating population. With less than 7 percent of China's population, Guangdong has 27 percent of China's floating population. The size of the floating population in Guangdong nearly tripled between the 1990 and the 2000 censuses.\\" Such uneven migration can hamper the government's policy to encourage the development of non-coastal regions, which exacerbates the geographic inequality in the country. =Migration from neighboring countries= Vietnam China accepted 260,000 Vietnamese through the Orderly Departure Program although this participation is less well known than that of other countries. The Chinese government accorded the Vietnamese protection by providing them refugee status. Most refugees settled in southern China. During the time of the refugees‚Äô integration, the Chinese government charged various agencies with examining the refugees‚Äô background and labor skills to facilitate job placement. Following the end of the Orderly Departure Program in 1997, China continued to receive refugees although in much fewer numbers. Prior to the end of the Program and after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Vietnamese refugees to China had already been decreasing in number. North Korea UNHCR has declared all North Koreans in China to be 'persons of concern', although China does not recognize North Koreans' claims to asylum as valid. China refuses to accept people who the country views as defectors from other Communist countries. As a result, China identifies North Koreans within its borders as ‚Äúeconomic migrants.‚Äù Because of the Government of China does not provide assistance to migrants, the UNHCR established an office in Beijing in 1995 to provide direct assistance including food, shelter, health, education, and social services. Later, China banned the UNHCR direct access to North Koreans, claiming that the issue was an internal matter and should be treated as such. Today, advocates for North Korean defectors lobby to government officials to reverse legal jargon.

Professional career Schwaen studied piano, organ and composition under Fritz Lubrich. From 1929 to 1933 he studied at the universities of Berlin and Breslau, where his teachers included Curt Sachs and Arnold Schering. In 1930 he met Hanns Eisler who had a profound impact on his compositional style. After becoming active in an anti-fascist student group, he joined the Communist Party of Germany; from 1935 to 1938 he was imprisoned because of his political views. After the war he returned to Berlin and spent much of his time working to rebuild the musical culture of that city by writing compositions for amateur music groups, choirs, music schools and chamber ensembles, publishing and serving as a musical advisor. Between 1953 and 1956 he worked with Bertolt Brecht who had a profound impact on his future compositions. He also worked with Ernst Busch. He composed in several genres, producing a cantata for children entitled King Midas. In 1961 he became a member of the DDR Akademie der K√ºnste, where he was head of the music department from 1965 to 1970. From 1962 to 1978 he was president of the East German National Folk Music committee. Between 1973 and 1981 he directed the children‚Äôs musical theatre in Leipzig. His awards include an honorary doctorate from Leipzig University (1983) and several state awards. Schwaen‚Äôs extensive oeuvre comprises over 620 titles. A number of works, such as the Piano Concerto no.2 (1987), show the influence of his several visits to Vietnam. Later works include the collaborative musical poem Potsdamer Platz (1998).

It is bounded by Clerkenwell Road to the north, Gray's Inn Road to the west, Leather Lane to the east and Baldwins Gardens to the south. It is also intersected by Portpool Lane, which forms part of the estate itself. The estate is built in a free Classical style, with Arts and Crafts touches, developing the idiom established by the London County Council with the Boundary Estate and Millbank Estate in a formal direction. The estate consists of a number of residential blocks which enclose a number of quiet shady courtyards containing mature trees, mostly London Plane trees. The buildings are constructed in dusky red and yellow bricks and the design incorporates classical pediments and stucco pilasters as well as arts and crafts details such as gabled walls, and casement windows on the inner courtyards and decorative mouldings to the large arches on the access ways. In 2013 planning permission was granted for a ¬£14 million regeneration of the Bourne Estate. Matthew Lloyd Architects‚Äô scheme, developed with Camden Council and Tibbalds Planning and Urban Design, provides 75 new homes across two mixed tenure blocks. Landscaping is to be improved across the southern half of the estate with re-ordered public realm, sports and playspaces by Dally Henderson Landscape Architects. History Constructed from 1905‚Äì1909, it is regarded as one of London's best examples of tenement housing and the majority of the housing blocks within the Estate have been Grade II listed. The Estate was designed by the London County Council Architect's Department, by E. H. Parkes under W. E. Riley. The Bourne Estate is the third of the three key estates built by the London County Council in the years of its greatest innovation. In Britain the Bourne Estate is the least known, but it has an international significance as the model for the much admired and highly influential public housing erected in Vienna immediately after the First World War. The Viennese model was subsequently brought back to England, as can be seen in the Ossulton Estate, Camden, listed some years ago, and in some private mansion blocks in central London of the 1930s. The surrounding streets were laid out in the 17th century on an intersecting grid pattern from north to south, east to west. Portpool Lane is part of the estate itself and derives its name from the old manor of Portpool which was held by Grays of Wilton, also for Gray's Inn. The estate was originally bounded at its southern edge by factories and industrial buildings that were damaged during the Second World War and demolished. To the southwest of the estate was Thanksgiving Model Buildings, built in 1850 for the 'Society for Improving the Conditions of the Labouring Classes', this block consisted of two four-storey buildings providing accommodation for 20 families and 128 single women. Also badly bomb-damaged in 1943 during the Blitz, the buildings were subsequently demolished. Two post-war residential blocks and sports and play facilities were added to this land, with Mawson Building to the South and Gooch Building to the southwest on the former site of Thanksgiving Model Building. A major redevelopment of this part of the estate is planned by Camden Council to take place 2013‚Äì16, including the demolition of the unlisted Mawson Building and addition of new blocks in- keeping with the original Edwardian architecture. These new blocks will be mixed private and social housing. Higgins Construction have been appointed to carry out this scheme. The works started in May 2014 and they are scheduled to be completed in August 2016. A number of the buildings in the Bourne Estate appear to have been named after former Bishops of Ely, perhaps a reference to nearby Ely Place, as follows: Shene, Ledham, Skipwith, Denys, Frewell, Scrope, Radcliffe, Redman, Nigel, Laney, Buckridge, Kirkby, Mawson and Gooch Transport The nearest London underground stations are Chancery Lane and Farringdon, with overground trains running from Farringdon.

He started playing guitar at eight years old, then quit and took up the saxophone for a few years before deciding he preferred guitar. Originally from Newcastle, Lloyd went to London via Rugby where he played football at school with Jimmy Cratchley. Cratchley started playing guitar with Lloyd when they were about 15. He moved to London to study photography at Camberwell Arts College. When Lloyd was looking for people to join the band he asked Cratchley. As Lloyd and Alex Kaines were both playing guitar, and they needed someone on bass guitar, Cratchley took up the role. Kaines was introduced to Lloyd by a mutual friend in a caf√© in south London, and the basis for Operahouse was formed. Aged 18, Ben Niblett who had been playing drums for five years, was also recruited. Dan White, the most recent member of the band (being the only member who joined after the band formed), was recruited to play the synthesizer and keyboard, and also played the xylophone beat in \\"Change In Nature\\". He appeared in the videos for \\"Change In Nature\\" and \\"Genius Child\\". In 2007, the band's first single attracted the attention of Dominic Hardisty, who signed The Killers.

Early life Thomas Fergus was born in Ayr Scotland on 6 April 1850. There is some question as to his date of birth as the New Zealand Government records are two years different from this birth record, and his newspaper obituary gives 1851 as the birth year. His father was also Thomas Fergus. It is uncertain when his father was born as there is no birth certificate to coincide with the date of 1815, however there is record of him in both 1851 and 1861 census for Scotland, and the age in those suggest that his birth was in 1807. His mother Annie McGechin is also found in census records but no birth certificate has been found to verify her date of birth, although the census suggests her date of birth to be in 1810. In the 1851 census for Scotland the household included his paternal grandmother Elizabeth Fergus. The family is registered as living in Gordon Place, St Quivox, Ayr at the time of the 1861 Census for Scotland and included seven surviving children (Elizabeth, Thomas, Martha Grange, Robert, John, Ann, Margaret). He was the second to eldest and the eldest son. He initially travelled to Melbourne on the Esmerelda in the early 1860s. It is thought that he may have travelled with two sisters and a brother, although this needs to be verified. He later travelled on to New Zealand in 1869. He was educated in both Melbourne and at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand from 1872 to 1876 and worked as a civil engineer. Family and personal life On 8 July 1874 he married Letticia Mckay at Hampden, North Otago, at the house of her father.Marriage certificate No 49,Page1576,Marriages in the district of Hampden They had one daughter, Margaret Annie, born in 1875 at Cromwell, Otago.

Originally an importer and manufacturer of piano materials he later founded his own factory, manufacturing felt products at Brockett's Bridge, Fulton County, New York, which in 1887 was renamed to Dolgeville. Biography Dolgeville, New York Alfred Dolge was born December 22, 1848, in Chemnitz, Saxony. He attended public school in Leipzig until he was 17 when he entered his father's business, the A. Dolge and Co., Piano Manufacturers, as an apprentice. He pursued high school studies in a night school conducted by the Free Masons in Leipzig and received his diploma from them. He first came to the United States in 1865, when he was 17. He remained permanently in 1868 and worked in piano making and importing in New York City. In 1874 Dolge went to Brockett's Bridge, Fulton County, New York, prospecting for spruce wood to be used for piano sounding boards. He purchased the old Brockett building and in April 1875, he began manufacturing felt in it, later known as the Dolge Company Factory Complex. Within a few years Brockett's Bridge grew from 325 to over 2,000 inhabitants, many of whom were German immigrants, whom he had interested in the area by advertisements and agents. Eventually, Dolge built felt mills, made felt shoes, autoharps, piano cases, piano sounding boards, piano hammers, ran lumber yards, and contributed to the local physical infrastructure and educational needs. In 1887 the citizens unanimously petitioned the authorities at Washington to change the name of the place from Brockett's Bridge to Dolgeville, New York. Dolge failed financially and left Dolgeville in May 1899. He lived in California and started a business there. He died in Milan, Italy on January 5, 1922, on a round the world tour. He is buried in the Dolgeville cemetery. In late 2014, Alfred Dolge's 1895 mansion, which stood behind the historic factory complex was destroyed by fire. The mansion was owned by Charles Soukup, who had recently purchased and converted the Dolge Company Factory Complex. As of July 2016, the cause of the fire had not been determined. Philosophy Inspired by his early readings of Liebknecht, Marx, Mill, and Adam Smith, Dolge instituted at Dolgeville a form of what we now call social security in his attempt to create an idealistic socialistic utopia. About 1876, when the factory was first well established, Dolge began to set up his Pension Plan which remained almost exactly the same throughout his tenure. It was extremely generous, ranging from 50 percent of wages for disability after 10 years service up to 100 percent after 25 years. Later he added a system of life insurance paid for by the firm. He also instituted a program of Earning-Sharing whereby an employee received a portion of the earnings according to his contribution in brains or the value of his work. This was not to be turned over until retirement, but was to be reinvested. The Pension Plan was non-contributory by the employee. The employer paid all. When Dolge's business failed in 1899, few of the benefits which he had envisioned had been paid, but the ideas which he pioneered proved to be very lasting. His ideas gained worldwide attention. The government of Germany officially requested details of his Plan and adopted it with some changes. In 1889, the government of France asked for a detailed account. The insurance, pension and endowment plans instituted by Dolgeville were also copied and adapted by railroads and many other corporations in America. Books In 1896, he printed a 243-page paperbound book entitled The Practical Applications of Economic Theories in the Factories of Alfred Dolge and Son. In 1911 he published a book on the development of the piano in Europe, America, Russia and Japan.

Millen emigrated to Australia from England around 1880 and established himself as a journalist, subsequently serving in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1894 to 1898, during which time he fiercely opposed the proposed Federation despite supporting the principle. He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1899 until his election to the Australian Senate as a Free Trader from New South Wales at the first federal election in 1901. Millen led the conservative parties in the Senate from 1907 until shortly before his death in 1923. He served as Vice-President of the Executive Council (1909‚Äì10) and Minister for Defence (1913‚Äì14) in two short-lived Liberal governments before his appointment as the first Minister for Repatriation in 1917. He organised the new department and co-ordinated Australia's repatriation effort, and was briefly acting Prime Minister in 1919, when he settled a seamen's strike. Millen resigned from the ministry in February 1923 and died later that year, his illness attributed to his heavy workload in the post-war years. Early life Millen was born in Deal, Kent in 1860 to John Bullock Millen, who was a pilot of the Cinque Ports, and Charlotte (n√©e Davis). He migrated to New South Wales in 1880, having been educated in England and employed in the marine insurance business. On 19 February 1883, he married Constance Evelyn Flanagan at Bourke; they settled as graziers in Brewarrina. Millen, who had worked as a journalist in Bourke and Walgett and wrote for the Central Australian and Bourke Telegraph (of which he reputedly became part-owner), became editor of the Western Herald and Darling River Advocate around 1889, part-owning the business together with Philip Chapman until 1901. During this period he also worked as a land agent, acquiring an office in O'Connell Street in Sydney and a house in Burwood by 1902. Millen stood for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Free Trade candidate for Bourke in 1891, but was defeated; he contested the seat again in 1894 and won. He became known as a strong advocate for land reform, urging changed pastoral conditions and suggesting additional government assistance to deal with Australia's dry climate, particularly during the 1890s drought. State politics Millen was a foundation member of the New South Wales Australasian Federation League in 1893, formed to campaign for the unification of the six Australian colonies into a single Commonwealth, and in 1896 was active at the Bathurst People's Federation Council. His distrust of Edmund Barton's leadership led to his defeat as a candidate for the Australian Federal Convention in 1897. In the Legislative Assembly, he objected strenuously to the proposed nature of the Senate, calling equal representation for all states \\"objectionable and dangerous\\", and claimed that the New South Wales conventional delegates were elected because of their proficiency at \\"political business\\", absolving New South Wales of the obligation of endorsing their decisions. As a result, Millen opposed the 1898 Federation referendum, becoming a founding member of the Anti-Convention Bill League in April. At the 1898 election, Millen was defeated by nine votes by a National Federal candidate. Having overcome his opposition to Federation, he was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 8 April 1899 as one of Premier George Reid's twelve appointments to guarantee the passage of legislation for the 1899 referendum. At the first federal election in March 1901, Millen stood for the Senate as a Free Trade candidate and was elected as the second of six senators for New South Wales. He resigned his Legislative Council seat in May of that year. Early Senate career Millen was an early leader in the Senate, serving as deputy to Josiah Symon's unofficial leadership of the Free Trade Senators in 1901. He advocated against high tariffs and bounties, claiming that industries that could not withstand free trade were \\"not entitled to much consideration at [the Senate's] hands\\". He was also a vigorous supporter of the White Australia policy, advocating the cessation of Kanaka immigration and the gradual deportation of those who had already arrived in Queensland; his opposition was based on a concern that \\"inferior labour would ... tend to degrade labour throughout the Commonwealth\\", as well as concerns about racial purity. Millen succeeded Symon as leader of the Free Traders in the Senate in 1907, and following the Fusion with the Protectionists in 1909 became Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice- President of the Executive Council under Prime Minister Alfred Deakin; he would lead the various conservative parties in the Senate continuously until his death. In 1913, following Joseph Cook's one-seat victory in the election, Millen became Minister for Defence, a position he held at the outbreak of World War I. In April 1914 he refused Winston Churchill's suggestion that Australia need not maintain a fleet in its own territorial waters, and expressed \\"the sharpest criticism of the British\\" in a memorandum tabled in the Senate. He continued to privately criticise Britain's management of the war, but the Cook Government ultimately placed the navy under the control of the British Admiralty in August 1914. He oversaw the initial recruitment of 20,000 men for the Australian Imperial Force and initialised the defence proposals for the war, but following the Labor Party's victory at the 1914 election he returned to leading the Opposition in the Senate, although he did become a member of the parliamentary war committee. Minister for Repatriation Undated photo Following the 1916 Labor split over conscription, Millen was included in Billy Hughes's Nationalist ministry in February 1917, initially as Vice-President of the Executive Council but by September as Australia's first Minister for Repatriation, dealing largely with veterans' affairs. Together with Major Nicholas Lockyer, the controller of repatriation, Millen had responsibility for the creation of a new governmental department. The many returned servicemen in the department's staff, most of whom had little administrative experience, caused problems; Charles Bean wrote in 1918 that soldiers had \\"a dread of Millen as a politician first, last and all the time\\". Millen organised the passage of the War Service Homes Act 1918‚Äì19, which established the War Service Homes Commission, but the administration of the scheme by Commissioner J. T. Walker led to a series of parliamentary inquiries by the joint committee of public accounts. Walker's appointment by Millen came into question, and the resulting investigation into the Commissioner's accountability to the Minister and to Parliament has been described as \\"one of the fullest examinations of ... ministerial responsibility for the actions of an autonomous public corporation in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament\\". In Marchant (2000), Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate. Millen introduced the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill, which provided for a paid repatriation commission and higher pensions for servicemen, into the Senate in March 1920. In response to the bill, and vigorous lobbying of Hughes by the veterans' movement, the bill faced difficulty in its passage and Senator Josiah Thomas successfully moved a resolution that a minister in one house might appear on the floor of the other. This bill would have allowed Millen to address the House of Representatives, where he was facing fierce criticism from the Country Party, although ultimately neither house acted on the resolution. During Hughes's absence in Europe in mid-1919, the acting Prime Minister was the Treasurer, William Watt; Millen served as acting Prime Minister when Watt fell ill during July. Millen and Watt brought a successful resolution to the seamen's strike. In 1920 he was sent to Geneva as Australia's delegate to the first meeting of the General Assembly of the League of Nations, where he secured mandated Pacific protectorates for Australia despite opposition from Japan. He returned to Australia in 1921, having arranged for the funding of Australia's debts and reorganised Australia House. Millen's heavy workload had begun to affect his health and he considered retirement, but he ultimately decided to continue and was re-elected to the Senate at the 1922 election. He retired from the ministry in February 1923, and in March was granted leave of absence because of his deteriorating health. He died aged 63 from chronic nephritis on 14 September 1923 at Caulfield in Melbourne, survived by his wife and two daughters. Presbyterian services were held at Parliament House in Melbourne and St Stephen's Church in Sydney, and Millen was given a state funeral. He is buried at Rookwood Cemetery. Legacy Millen experienced fierce criticism from both the press and parliament during his time as Minister for Repatriation, but he is remembered as an important figure in Australia's war effort and subsequent recovery. He has been described as the \\"most significant\\" contributor to the development of repatriation in Australia, which he as inaugural minister largely defined. After his death, Billy Hughes described him as unequalled in Senate leadership, and George Pearce remembered him as \\"one of the ablest and most destructive critics the Federal Parliament ever had\\".

This is called the entity concept. The business stands apart from other organizations as a separate economic unit. It is necessary to record the business's transactions separately, to distinguish them from the owners' personal transactions. This helps to give a correct determination of the true financial condition of the business. This concept can be extended to accounting separately for the various divisions of a business in order to ascertain the financial results for each division. Under the business entity concept, a business holds separate entity and distinct from its owners. \\"The entity view holds the business 'enterprise to be an institution in its own right separate and distinct from the parties who furnish the funds\\"\\"The Entity Concept in Accounting\\" by Professor George R. Husband, Wayne State University An example is a sole trader or proprietorship. The sole trader takes money from the business by way of 'drawings', money for their own personal use. Despite it being the sole trader's business and technically their money, there are still two aspects to the transaction: the business is 'giving' money and the individual is 'receiving' money. Even though there is no other legal distinction between the sole trader and the business, and the sole trader is liable for all of the debts of the business, business transactions may be taxed separately from personal transactions, and the proprietor of the business may also find it useful to see the financial results of the business. For these reasons, the affairs of the individuals behind a business are kept separate from the affairs of the business itself.

Candidates are required to collect signatures from 3% of the total number of voters who voted in the previous gubernatorial election in order to gain ballot access. Ordinarily, such candidates would gather signatures at the polling place at the party primary, but Alabama made it more difficult by moving the deadline for signature turn-in to the date of the primary. Alabama ranks third nationally in disenfranchising formerly incarcerated persons. One out of every 14 Alabama residents is disenfranchised. To regain the right to vote, individuals convicted of crimes of ‚Äúmoral turpitude‚Äù who have completed a felony sentence must apply to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles for a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote. As soon as you apply for a Pardon you automatically receive the right to vote back.

Independent candidates are granted ballot access through a petition process and minor political party candidates are nominated by convention along with a petition process; one must collect 3% of the total votes cast in the last election for the specific race or 3% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election for state-wide ballot access. The figure for 2006 state wide ballot access was 41,012 good signatures. The validity of signatures generally means that 20-30% more signatures will need to be collected to ensure that the goal is achieved. To retain ballot access a third party has to poll 20% in a state wide race and it will retain statewide ballot access through to the next election. Many third party reformers, such as Bill Redpath, would like to see the ballot access laws loosened.

His research focused on the tectonics of the continental crust, geochronology, geochemistry, palaeomagnetism, structural geology, and petrology. He was especially interested in the Precambrian and Palaeozoic evolution of the continental crust. Alfred Kroner on the Mabujina Complex, Cuba, 2007 Career He studied geology at the Technical University in Clausthal- Zellerfeld, Germany, the University of Vienna, Austria, and the Technical University in Munich, Germany, graduating with a Diploma (M.Sc.) in 1965. After 18 months of military service in Germany he continued his studies as a Ph.D. student in the Precambrian Research Unit, University of Cape Town, South Africa, beginning in 1966; he obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1968. After 6 months as exploration geologist in Namibia he returned to Cape Town as a Senior Research Fellow of the Precambrian Research Unit, undertaking research projects in Namaqualand and Namibia and supervising research students. From 1974 to 1976 He was Acting Director of the Precambrian Research Unit at the University of Cape Town. In 1977 he moved back to Germany to take over the Chair of General and Regional Geology at the University of Mainz.

Dharmatala Street has been renamed after Lenin as Lenin Sarani but the neighbourhood up to Wellington Square continues to be referred as Dharmatala. It is a busy commercial area that had come up with the growth of Calcutta during the British Raj and is thus one of the repositories of history in the city. Etymology Dharmatala means Holy Street. It is commonly held to derive its name from a large mosque which stood at the site of Cook and Company's livery stables. Some discern the name as a reference to dharma, one of the units of the Buddhist Trinity. There was a Buddhist temple at Janbazar, nearby. Tipu Sultan Mosque at the corner of Chowringhee Road and Dharmatala, was built in 1842, by Prince Gholam Mohammad, a son of Tipu Sultan.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, 1909/1980, pp. 248-50, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd. Binoy Ghosh feels that the name Dharmatala is because of the preeminence of Dharmathakur in olden days.

It is bounded to the north by Bowbazar, the south by Janbazar, the east by Taltala and the west by Maidan. The neighbourhood is spread over 2 wards: 46 and 47 of Kolkata Municipal Corporation.Map nos. 29, 30, and 32, Detail Maps of 141 Wards of Kolkata, D.R.Publication and Sales Concern, 66 College Street, Kolkata ‚Äì 700073 History In the 18th century, Dharmatala is described as ‚Äòa well raised causeway, raised by deepening the ditch on both sides‚Äô. It was shaded with trees on both sides. Just north of Dharmatala a creek formerly ran from Chandpal Ghat to Beliaghata (or Baliaghata, as it was then known). The creek passed through what was later Wellington Square (renamed Subodh Chandra Mallick Square) and Creek Row. The earlier name of Creek Row was Dhinga Bhanga, as a ship broke there during the cyclone of 1737. The creek was navigable for large boats. Wellington Square was a tank made on the bed of this creek. Both Wellington Square and Creek Row were developed by the Lottery Committee. Calcutta Gazette of 9 August 1821 refers to Wellington Square as ‚Äòthe new square in Dhurrumtollah.‚Äô While the English quarter was then restricted to around the old fort (present B.B.D. Bagh), the area south of Dharmatala was a jungle. The native quarters to the north consisted of a number of straggling villages.Nair, P. Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 11, Oxford University Press, . After their victory in the Battle of Plassey, the English decided to build new Fort William, in 1758. For this purpose, the native population shifted from Gobindapur mostly to Sutanuti. The European inhabitants of Kalikata gradually forsook the narrow limits of the old palisades and moved to around the Maidan.Cotton, H.E.A., p. 72 Civilians were not allowed to live within the new fort. Gradually the areas to the south of the Great Tank and to the east along Chowringhee Road were emerging as preferred haunts for the Englishmen. While Sutanuti developed as the Black Town, the Esplanade and Chowringhee emerged as the White Town. However, the areas around Writers' building, Baitakkhana (Bowbazar), Dharmatala and Janbazar went down in estimation and were gradually taken over by ‚Äòthe rest‚Äô, which included half-castes, Portuguese, Armenians and so on, 'to become grey areas between Black and White Towns of old Calcutta'.Lahiri Choudhury, Dhriti Kanta, Trends in Calcutta Architecture, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, pp.159-160 The district lying between Dharmatala and Bowbazar and bounded on the west by Bentinck Street was in the 19th and 20th century inhabited by a variety of people that included Portuguese, other Europeans of poorer classes and Indians. The area was full of ‚Äòtortuous and narrow lanes, badly drained and reeking with foul odours, thickly populated and miserably housed.‚Äô In this district on the northern side of Dharmatala is a bazaar called Chandney Chowk. ‚ÄòIt is a labyrinth of ill-kept passages, lined with shops, in which may be found a wonderful collection of sundries, from a door nail to a silk dress.‚Äô Cotton, H.E.A., p. 219 Dharmatala Bazar was established in 1794 at the corner of Dharmatala and Chowringhee. Rudyard Kipling in the last chapter of his Kolkata sketches published under the title of The City of Dreadful Nights, has given a lively description of the market and its frequenters.Cotton, H.E.A., p. 771 It was formerly called Shakespeare's Bazar. In the earliest list of police stations in Kolkata made in 1785, both Dharmatala and Dingabhanga were included. However, when the police stations were reorganised in 1888-89, the number of police stations were reduced and no mention is there of either.Nair, P. Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, p. 15. Transport A three-horse omnibus plied briefly between Dharmatala and Barrackpore in November 1830 but the truly successful horse-drawn public transport was the tramcar. These were introduced in Dharmatala in March 1882. In 1899, the Calcutta Tramways Company started electrifying the entire system.Nair, P.Thankappan, Civic and Public Services in Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, pp. 234-6 Dharmatala has always been a major traffic hub. Today, Dharmatala is the busiest bus terminus of West Bengal. Kolkata trams route no. 5, 25 and 36 also start their journey from Dharmatala.Google maps During rush hours some 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles pass through Dharmatala. Experts say 50‚Äì60 percent of air pollution in Kolkata is due to vehicle emission. Increase in number of vehicles may have added to the problem. In the Dharmatala area, the noise levels are 75‚Äì84 dB.Chakraborti, Dipankar, Calcutta's Environment, p.185, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol II According to transport department officials, over 2,000 long-distance buses operate from the city. Most of the state and private buses originate from here. Eden Gardens railway station on Kolkata Circular Railway line is the nearest railway station. Sealdah Station, one of the five major railway- terminals of Kolkata Metropolitan Area, is also located nearby. The Esplanade Metro Station of Kolkata Metro opened on October 24 1984 with the opening of the Esplanade Bhawanipur Section of Line 1. 10 years later, the line was extended North wards upto Chandni Chowk. Both these stations in the Dharmatala Area are among the busiest in the network. Just below the existing Metro station of Line 1, another station is under construction for Line 2 of Kolkata Metro.

The station from then to its sale was known as \\"High Country 100.7\\" and was one of the most popular radio stations in Northwestern NC. Both stations broadcast from a building on Blowing Rock Road in Boone, adjacent to the Appalachian State University campus, with a transmitter located near Banner Elk. In September 2003 Highland sold both stations to Aisling Broadcasting (Jonathon Hoffman, managing member) for a price of $2.2 million, This added to Aisling's holdings in the High Country, as they had already purchased WECR, WECR-FM, WXIT (from Rondinaro Broadcasting) for $2.2 million in 2003, and WMMY(from Dale Hendrix) in 2004 for $1.58 million. The station then switched to a Contemporary Christian format, while WMMY became the area's new country station under the moniker, \\"My Country 106\\".

As a film director, he began to write his own orchestral compositions for silent films in 1917, and co-created modern production techniques where film scoring serves an integral part of the action. Riesenfeld composed about 100 film scores in his career. His most successful compositions were for Cecil B. DeMille's Joan the Woman (1917), The Ten Commandments (1923) and The King of Kings (1927); D. W. Griffith's Abraham Lincoln (1930); and the original scores to F. W. Murnau's Sunrise (1927) and Tabu (1931).  Life and work  Born in Vienna, Riesenfeld's musical career began at the age of seven with a violin study at the Conservatory of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in his city of birth, where he graduated at the age of 17 in piano, violin and composition degrees. He briefly played in the Vienna Philharmonic. By the end of the 19th century, he was playing with Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Arthur Bodanzky, and Edward Falck in a local string quartet. In 1907, Riesenfeld emigrated to New York City, where he worked until 1911 as concert-master for Oscar Hammerstein's Manhattan Opera Company. He served three seasons as bandleader of the musical company, Klaw & Erlanger, followed by a stint as concertmaster and conductor at the Century Opera. He did his first work in film when he conducted the accompaniment for Jesse L. Lasky's production of Carmen (1915). Succeeding Samuel Lionel Rothafel‚Äîlater known as \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel‚Äîas conductor of the Broadway theatres the Rivoli, the Rialto, and the Criterion, he conducted from 1917 to 1925, introducing the practice of long-run resident film musicians. The cinemas were among the first, where runs of longer than a week. In 1923, an article about Riesenfeld stated, \\"occasionally ten weeks the same piece with undiminished force ‚Äì so knows he his audience\\" in a New York City article wrote the Viennese magazines about Riesenfeld. \\"He says, know the audience and know what you must show him, ever the secret of success at the theater and cinema.\\" [...] \\"just customize and know what's there and what 'draws'.\\" Phonofilm and Red Seal Pictures On 15 April 1923, with inventor Lee de Forest, Riesenfeld co-presented a show at the Rivoli Theater in New York City of 18 short films made in the Phonofilm sound- on-film process. In 1923, Riesenfeld formed The Red Seal Pictures Corporation, partnered with Edwin Miles Fadiman, Dr. Lee deForest, and Max Fleischer to distribute American and foreign films through their chain of 36 theaters that extended as far as Cleveland, Ohio. In May 1926, Max Fleischer began producing a series of sound versions of their popular \\"Bouncing Ball\\" Song Car-Tunes, using the Lee de Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film process. The corporation filed for bankruptcy in late 1926, shortly after De Forest Phonofilm filed for bankruptcy in September 1927. Movie theaters and live orchestras Most large movie theaters in the U.S. had their own orchestras for silent film accompaniment, with smaller theaters having just a theatre organ, photoplayer or piano. The musicians often relied on an already existing repertoire of opera and excerpts from other compositions. Riesenfeld began as one of the first to write original compositions for films. As an example, the \\"Brother's Theme\\" was a mainstay of the 1926 release of Beau Geste (published by Robbins- Engel Inc.). Next to Albert William Ket√®lbey and Ern√∂ Rap√©e, Riesenfeld was a pioneer of modern, high-quality production of music. He also co-founded the cinema library music‚Äîtopical collections of music for silent film orchestra and musicians also. \\"Mr. Riesenfeld puts much emphasis on the music in the movies\\", in an article about Riesenfeld and film music. \\"Orchestra with organ varies in its two large theatres. His organist gets $250 a week, 70 orchestra musicians are well-paid because the lowest wage is 70 dollars a week. [...] Of course, the business costs in America are quite different than ours. Mr. Riesenfeld explains that he must have a dose of 50,000 dollars per week to reach its expenses and to this purpose otherwise it zahle weekly 120,000 spectators as he. [...] News always appear in the first week in its theatres. [...] \\"Mr. Riesenfeld paid up to 6000 dollars a week for the presentation rights for a good movie.\\" When he wrote the music for the Western movie The Covered Wagon (1923), Riesenfeld was one of the most frequently employed film composers in Hollywood. From 1928 to 1930, he was General Music Director of United Artists. After that time, Riesenfeld worked mostly for independent productions. Away from the film industry, he was orchestra conductor of the Los Angeles Symphony and as a composer in the classical sector. He composed the ballet Chopin's Dances (1905), the comic opera Merry Martyr (1913), the musical Betty Be Good (1921), Children's Suite (1928) and overtures, orchestral music, and songs.  Illness and death  Riesenfeld died in 1939 in Los Angeles after a severe illness. His daughter Janet starred in some Mexican movies as a dancer and actress under the pseudonym Raquel Rojas and Janet Alcorzia and later became a screenwriter.

The last 3 of the 28 lines of the text deal with a separate campaign in Canaan. It mentions a victory over Israel by the lines: \\"The Canaan has been plundered into every sort of woe: Ashkelon has been overcome; Gezer has been captured; Yano'am is made non-existent.

Mesha tells how Kemosh, the God of Moab, had been angry with his people and had allowed them to be subjugated to Israel, but at length Kemosh returned and assisted Mesha to throw off the yoke of Israel and restore the lands of Moab. Tel Dan Stele Tel Dan Stele was discovered in 1993-94 and was created in 870‚Äì750 BCE. It consists of several fragments making up part of a triumphal inscription in Aramaic, left most probably by Hazael of Aram-Damascus, an important regional figure in the late 9th-century BCE.

Sennacherib's campaign in Judah was a military conflict in 701 BCE between Kingdom of Judah and the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the conflict is part of the greater conflict of Sennacherib's campaigns. The conflict is considered one of the greatest victories of Judah at that time, from being a vassal state of Assyria, to beating the Assyrian empire and being completely independent.  Battle of Qarqar  The Battle of Qarqar took place in 853 BCE, and was fought by Shalmaneser III, king of Assyria, and a coalition of 11 kings including Ahab, king of Israel. In the Kurkh Monoliths, it is mentioned that the Israelite forces constituted 10,000 troops and 2,000 chariots.Battle of Qarqar, at livius.org Siege of Jerusalem In 721 BCE, the Assyrian army captured the Israelite capital at Samaria and carried away the citizens of the northern kingdom into captivity. The virtual destruction of Israel left the southern kingdom, Judah, to fend for itself among warring Near Eastern kingdoms. The siege took place in approximately 701 BCE by Sennacherib, king of Assyria. The siege failed and Jerusalem survived until its eventual destruction by the Neo- Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar. Siege of Lachish The siege of Lachish occurred in 701 BCE, by the Neo-Assyrian empire, and ended with the conquest of the town. The towns inhabitants led into captivity and the leaders of Lachish tortured to death. The town was abandoned, but resettled after the return from Babylonia. =Battle of Megiddo= The Battle of Megiddo is recorded as having taken place in 609 BCE with Necho II of Egypt leading his army to Carchemish to fight with his allies the Assyrians against the Babylonians at Carchemish in northern Syria. This required passing through territory controlled by the Kingdom of Judah and Necho requested permission from its king, Josiah. Josiah refused to let the Egyptians pass and a battle took place in which Josiah was killed. The battle is recorded in the Bible, 1 Esdras, and the writings of Josephus. =Jewish‚ÄìBabylonian war= Nebuchadnezzar, from Petrus Comestor's \\"Bible Historiale,\\" 1670 The Jewish‚ÄìBabylonian war was a military conflict between the Kingdom of Judah and Babylonia that lasted from 601 to 586 BCE. The conflict marked the end of the Kingdom of Judah and Jewish independence until the Hasmonean revolt. After Babylonia invaded Jerusalem it destroyed the First Temple, and started the Babylonian exile. First siege of Jerusalem In 605 BCE Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon defeated Pharaoh Neco at the Battle of Carchemish, and subsequently invaded Judah. To avoid the destruction of Jerusalem, King Jehoiakim of Jerusalem, in his third year, changed allegiances from Egypt to Babylon. He paid tribute from the treasury in Jerusalem, some temple artifacts, and some of the royal family and nobility as hostages. In 601 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar failed to invade Egypt, the failure led to rebellions among states in the Levant including Judah. Nebuchadnezzar sieged Jerusalem in 597 BCE, and managed to get in and capture king Jehoiachin,2 Kings 242 Chronicles 36Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle and all of the Aristocracy of Jerusalem. The siege resulted with fall of Jerusalem and destruction of the First Temple. Then Nebuchadnezzar exiled 10,000 of the officers, and the craftsmen, and 7,000 soldiers. Second Siege of Jerusalem In July 587 BCE, Zedekiah rebelled against Babylonia, making an alliance with Egypt, and Nebuchadnezzar sieged Jerusalem again, starving the people. The siege resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the fall of the Kingdom of Judah. Classic era =Maccabees= The Maccabees (Hebrew: ◊û◊õ◊ë◊ô◊ù or ◊û◊ß◊ë◊ô◊ù, Makabim) were a Jewish warrior community who spearheaded a national liberation movement that fought for and won independence from Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Hellenistic Seleucid dynasty, who was succeeded by his infant son Antiochus V Eupator. The Maccabees founded the Hasmonean royal dynasty and established Jewish independence in the Land of Israel for about one hundred years, from 164 BCE to 63 BCE. =Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars= The Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars followed the Roman annexation of Iudaea, taking place from 66 to 135 CE. Those were the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War, Kitos War and finally Bar Kokhba revolt. =Himyarite Kingdom= In modern day Yemen, the Ancient Himyarite Kingdom appears to have abandoned polytheism and converted to Judaism around the year 380. Accompanied with a strong military prowess, they proved to be a matching force to the Christian empires of Byzantium and Axum for 200 years. After having conquered a major part of the Arabic peninsula, the Himyarite Empire has been annexed by the Kingdom of Axum. =Revolt against Gallus= In mid-4th century Jews of Galilee launched the Revolt against Gallus, aiming to defeat Roman troops across Galilee. =Exilarch revolt in Persia= Mar Zutra II, who came into Exilarch office at the age of fifteen, took advantage of the confusion into which Mazdak's communistic attempts had plunged Sasanian Persia, to obtain by force of arms for a short time a sort of political independence for the Jews of Babylon. King Kobad, however, punished him by crucifying him on the bridge of Mahuza c. 502. =Byzantine period= In early 7th century Near Eastern Jews launched Jewish revolt against Heraclius, in hopes of gaining an autonomy in Jerusalem with Persian Sasanian support. =Khazar Khaganate= The Khazars were a Turkic nomadic people who around the 7th century converted to judaism. They built a prosperous empire, and maintained it for a few hundred years, until their defeat by the Kievan Rus in the 9th century. Later communities According to a number of accounts various Middle Eastern and Asian Jewish communities, who were either known for their fighting prowess, =Samuel ibn 'Adiya Arabian warrior poet= Poet and warrior; lived in Arabia in the first half of the 6th century CE. His mother was of the royal tribe of Ghassan, while his father, according to some, was descended from Aaron, or, according to others, from Kahin, son of Harun and progenitor of the Jewish tribes of Kuraitza and Nathir. Samuel owned a castle near Taima (eight hours north of Medina), built by his grandfather 'Adiya and called, from its mixed color, Al- Ablak. It was situated on a high hill and was a halting-place for travelers to and from Syria. More than for his poetic talents Samuel ibn 'Adiya is famous for his connection with the warrior-poet and prince Amru al-Kais, which won for him the epithet \\"faithful\\", and gave rise to the saying, still common among the Arabs, \\"more faithful than Samuel.\\" Samuel ibn 'Adiya's reputation as a poet rests upon one of the first poems in the collection called the \\"Hamasa.\\" It is full of warlike vigor and courage, and manifests a high ideal of honor. Another poem attributed to him has been published in Arabic and Hebrew, with an English translation, by H. Hirschfeld (\\"J. Q. R.\\" xvii. 431‚Äì440).Samuel ibn 'Adiya, Jewish Encyclopedia, 1901‚Äì1906 edition, p. 14 =Jews of China= There are many theories surrounding when Jews first settled in China. Despite trading in China since at least the 9th century,Xu, Xin. The Jews of Kaifeng, China: History, Culture, and Religion. Ktav Publishing House, Inc., 2004 (), p. 9 many modern scholars ‚Äúunanimously‚Äù believe an actual community was founded in Kaifeng City, Henan province during the early years of the Northern Song Dynasty.Xu: p. 19 However, one of the three stelae (stone edicts) left by the community claims ‚Äúthey entered and settled in China during the Han Dynasty\\", almost 800 years earlier.Weisz, Tiberiu. The Kaifeng Stone Inscriptions: The Legacy of the Jewish Community in Ancient China. New York: iUniverse, 2006 (), p. 74 The stele dating 1489 states that Song Dynasty founder Emperor Taizu (mistakenly referred to as Ming Taizu) went on military campaigns to ‚Äúpacify the Under Heaven‚Äù during the early years of his reign.Weisz: p. 11, see footnotes 50‚Äì53 on p. 13 When the armies successfully gained control of China and solidified the power of the Song Dynasty, Emperor Taizu bestowed the ‚Äúsinicized‚Äù Jewish soldiers with land ‚Äúto settle and enjoy their occupation in the villages‚Äù. Jewish soldiers continued to serve in the Chinese military through the Southern Song Dynasty. The stele dating 1512 states ‚Äúthose who subdued the enemy and resisted aggression and were ‚Äòboundlessly loyal to the country‚Äô‚Äù were successful in their endeavors.Weisz: p. 26 The term ‚Äúboundlessly loyal to the country‚Äù refers to the famous tattoo on the back of General Yue Fei, a noted patriot and martyr.Weisz: footnote # 111 on p. 26 So the loyalty of the Jewish soldiers was compared to that of Yue Fei. The same source even claims that \\"Israelites\\" served in Yue Fei's armies and helped to combat the Jurchen armies invading China during that time.Weisz: footnote # 76 on p. 18 Modern scholars that translate the 1489 stele mention how a physician named Ancheng received a sizable amount of money from ‚ÄúPrince Ding of Zhou prefecture‚Äù to rebuild the community‚Äôs destroyed synagogue in 1421.Weisz: p. 12 In 1423, Ancheng was given the surname ‚ÄúChao‚Äù by the emperor himself, received the ‚Äúrank of Military Commissioner in the Embroidered Uniform Guard‚Äù and was promoted to ‚ÄúAssistant Military Commissioner of Zhejiang.\\"Weisz: p. 13 However, a journal entry from 1965 formally corrected a translation error that proceeding authors still make today. The physician Ancheng was ‚Äúapparently a romantic fabrication‚Äù and the actual person was ‚Äúa common soldier named An San, who belonged to the Honan Central Bodyguard Division‚Äù.White, William Charles. Chinese Jews. New York: Paragon Book Reprint Corporation, 1966 (2nd Edition), p. 17 He had warned the Yongle Emperor of a plot against him by Prince Zhou, An‚Äôs military commander and benefactor of the Jewish community, and was subsequently promoted (as mentioned above) and given the ‚Äúproperly Chinese name Chao Ch‚Äôeng (Chao the Honest), and in due course became a notable leader of the community and ancestor of the principal Jewish clan.‚Äù =Habbani Jews of Southern Yemen= In 1912 Zionist emissary Shmuel Yavnieli came into contact with Habbani Jews who ransomed him when he was captured and robbed by eight Bedouin in southern Yemen. Yavnieli wrote about the Jews of Habban describing them in the following way. > The Jews in these parts are held in high esteem by everyone in Yemen and > Aden. They are said to be courageous, always with their weapons and wild > long hair, and the names of their towns are mentioned by the Jews of Yemen > with great admiration.The Jews of Habban South Yemen, Jewish Communities in > Exotic Places, by Ken Blady, Jason Aronson, Inc, Northvale, New Jersey, > Jerusalem, 2000, p. 32 There are a number of legends about the origins of the Jews of Habban. The most prominent is that they descend from Judean soldiers who were stationed in southern Arabia by King Herod of Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period. Herod dispatched a unit of Jews in the region to assist the Romans with fighting wars in the area. Unlike the Jews of northern Yemen the Habbani Jews wore: Jambiyya (curved knife), Matznaph (turban) and Avne\`t (sash). Benjamin of Tudela (twelfth century) found an independent Jewish warrior tribe living in the highlands of Khorasan near Nisapur, numbering many thousand families, regarding themselves as descendants of Dan, Zebulun, Asher, and Naphtali, under a Jewish prince of the name of Joseph Amarkala ha-Levi.Benjamin of Tudela, ed. Asher, pp. 83 et seq. Another independent Jewish tribe bent upon warlike expeditions is mentioned by Benjamin as living in the district of Tehama in Yemen.ibid. p. 70 =Mountain Jews of Daghestan= Armed Mountain Jewish men, c. 1900 (1905‚Äì06 Jewish Encyclopedia) > :And we, the Tats :We, Samson warriors, :Bar Kochba's heirs... :we went into > battles :and bitterly, heroically :struggled for our freedom :The Song of > the Mountain JewsThe Mountain Jews of Daghestan, Jewish Communities in > Exotic Places by Ken Blady (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson Inc., 2000), p. 158 The Jews of Daghestan lived isolated and in one of the most remote, impenetrable areas in the world for many centuries. They have been historically known for their fierce and war-like nature. In dress and custom they were hardly distinguishable from other Caucasian fighting people in the region. Though they are considered dhimmi by their surrounding Muslim population, the Mountain Jews owned land and were known to be fierce, not hesitating to defend, by sword or the rifle, their family, religion, or personal dignity. > The Jews of Daghestan greatly resemble the other warlike inhabitants of this > mountainous region; and they have acquired the virtues as well as the faults > of the latter. There is a tradition among the Jews of Daghestan that they > are the descendants of the Lost Ten Tribes; but the history of their > wanderings is now forgotten, the written documents which they once possessed > having in the course of time been either lost or destroyed.

The record suggests that their presence in the area preceded the rise of Islam.Tarikh el-Fettash, by Mahmoud Kati ben El-Hajj El Motaoukkal Kati, 1657, pp. 62‚Äì63 =Jewish soldiers of Islamic Spain= Jewish soldiers assisted Childeric in his war against Wamba.

Under Alfonso VIII of Castile. (1166‚Äì1214) there were many warriors among the wealthy and cultured Jews of Toledo that fought bravely against the Moors.Graetz, \\"History of the Jews\\", iii. 386; German ed., vi. 229 Alfonso X., called \\"the Wise\\", while infante, had many Jews in his army; and in the capture of Seville (1298) the Jewish warriors distinguished themselves so highly that, in compensation for their services, Alfonso allotted to them certain lands for the formation of a Jewish village. He also transferred to them three mosques which they turned into synagogues. The cruel fanaticism of the Moors had alienated the Jews, who were now won over to the Christians by the tolerant rule of the latter.Graetz, ib. iii. 592; German ed., vii. 136 Jews fought bravely at the side of Pedro the Cruel in defense of the cities of Toledo, Briviesca, and Burgos, against Henry de Trastamara, his brother, and had to pay for their loyalty to their king either with their lives and the lives of their undefended wives and children, or, as the Jews of Burgos had to do, with a heavy ransom to the relentless victor.Graetz, ib. iv. 123 et seq.; German ed., vii. 424 =Jewish defenders during the First Crusade= Jews fought side-by-side with Egyptian Fatimid soldiers to defend Jerusalem against the Crusaders during the First Crusade.Brown, Michael L.

Thirty thousand were decorated for valor in battle. Among them was the fighter pilot Wilhelm Frankl (who converted to Catholicism in 1917), and the future mayor of Hamburg, Herbert Weichmann. =Jewish Legion (British)= The Jewish Legion was the name for five battalions of Jewish volunteers established as the British Army's 38th through 42nd (Service) Battalions of the Royal Fusiliers. The initial unit, known as the Zion Mule Corps, was formed in 1914‚Äì1915 during World War I, when Britain was at war against the Ottoman Turks, as Zionists around the world saw an opportunity to promote the idea of a Jewish National Homeland. =Jewish regiment (Russian Civil War)= The Jewish regiment was an infantry regiment formed in February 1919 during the Russian Civil War 1917‚Äì1922 as a part of the forces of ataman Grigory Semyonov which acted in the Transbaikal region. In the early 20th century, Russian Jews were active in a variety of political movements. Many joined revolutionary movements such as Esers, Mensheviks and Bolsheviks. Many Jews served in Makhno's \\"Black\\" Army. Others turned to counter-revolution. The regiment was formed by the Chita Jewish community. The staffers and soldiers of the regiment were Jews from various social classes, from craftsmen to traders' sons. Some Jews were reluctant to accept the Soviet regime after being eyewitness to the Red Terror, instability, and upsurge of crime of 1918. Soldiers and staffers celebrated all Jewish holidays and fought on Shabbat. There were 170 soldiers, 7 sergeants, 4 low rank officers, and 2 captains. Most of the soldiers were from Chita and Nerchinsk. The Jewish regiment took part in many actions against local partisans. The most significant achievement of the regiment was participation in the defeat of the internationalist partisan battalion (150 strong) camped on the northeastern village of Tupik‚Ä¶. The partisans, mostly Hungarians, were former prisoners of war (POW) who were sent to the Transbaikal region during World War I. World War II =Jewish Military Union (Polish)= the ≈ªydowski ZwiƒÖzek Wojskowy (≈ªZW), Polish for Jewish Military Union was an underground resistance organization operating during World War II in the area of the Warsaw Ghetto and fighting during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. It was formed primarily of former officers of the Polish Army in late 1939, soon after the start of the German occupation of Poland. =Anti-Fascist Military Organisation (Polish)= The Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa Polish for Anti-Fascist Military Organisation was an underground organization formed in 1942 in the Ghetto in Bia≈Çystok by former officers of the Polish Land Forces. It took part in the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto Uprising. =Jewish Combat Organization (Polish)= The ≈ªydowska Organizacja Bojowa (≈ªOB), Polish for the Jewish Combat Organization; called in Yiddish ◊ô◊ô◊ì◊ô◊©◊¢ ◊ß◊ê◊û◊£ ◊ê◊®◊í◊ê◊†◊ô◊ñ◊ê◊¶◊ô◊¢) ‚Äì a World War II resistance movement, which was instrumental in engineering the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (although the ≈ªZW Jewish resistance organization claimed otherwise). The organization also took part in other resistance activities. =Jewish Brigade (British)= The Jewish Infantry Brigade Group was a military formation of the British Army that served in Europe during the Second World War. Although the brigade was formed in 1944, some of its experienced personnel had been employed against the Axis powers in Greece, the Middle East and East Africa. More than 30,000 Palestinian Jews volunteered to serve in the British Armed Forces, 734 of whom died during the war. =Special Interrogation Group (British)= The Special Interrogation Group (SIG) (some sources interpret this acronym as Special Identification Group or Special Intelligence Group) was a British Army unit organized from German-speaking Jewish volunteers from the British Mandate of Palestine. The SIG performed commando and sabotage operations against the Nazis behind front lines in the Western Desert Campaign during World War II. Palestine Yishuv =The Jewish Resistance Movement= The Jewish Resistance Movement (, Tnu'at HaMeri HaIvri, literally Hebrew Rebellion Movement) was an umbrella group for militant Jewish underground movements in the British Mandate of Palestine. The group existed between the years 1945 and 1946, and coordinated armed attacks against the British military. The group was founded after World War II, disappointed in British policies towards the movement. =Haganah= The Haganah (Hebrew: \\"The Defense\\", ◊î◊î◊í◊†◊î) was a Jewish paramilitary organization in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine from 1920 to 1948. The predecessor of Haganah was Ha-Shomer (◊î◊©◊ï◊û◊®, The Guild of Watchman) established in 1909 (formed out of Bar-Giora which started two years before). It was a small group of Jewish immigrants who guarded settlements for an annual fee. At no time did the group have more than 100 members. After the 1920 Arab riots and 1921 Jaffa riots, the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British (whom the League of Nations had given a mandate over Palestine in 1920 for the purpose of establishing a Jewish national home) had no desire to confront local Arab gangs over their attacks on Palestinian Jews. Realizing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs, the Jewish leadership created the Haganah to protect their farms and Kibbutzim. In addition to guarding Jewish communities, the role of the Haganah was to warn the residents of and repel attacks by Palestinian Arabs. In the period between 1920‚Äì1929, the Haganah lacked a strong central authority or coordination. Haganah \\"units\\" were very localized and poorly armed: they consisted mainly of Jewish farmers who took turns guarding their farms or their kibbutzim. Following the Arab massacres of 1929, the Haganah's role changed dramatically. It became a much larger organization encompassing nearly all the youth and adults in the Jewish settlements, as well as thousands of members from the cities. It also acquired foreign arms and began to develop workshops to create hand grenades and simple military equipment, transforming from an untrained militia to a capable underground army. =Palmach= The Palmach (Hebrew: ◊§◊ú◊û\\"◊ó, an acronym for Plugot Mahatz (Hebrew: ◊§◊ú◊ï◊í◊ï◊™ ◊û◊ó◊•), Strike Companies) was the regular fighting force of the Haganah, the unofficial army of the Yishuv (Jewish community) during the British Mandate of Palestine. It was established on May 15, 1941 and by the war of 1948 had grown to three fighting brigades and auxiliary aerial, naval and intelligence units. Being a Palmachnik (Palmach member) was considered not only as performing military duties, but also as a way of life. Significant leaders of the Palmach include Moshe Dayan, Yitzhak Sadeh, Yigal Allon and future prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. The Palmach contributed significantly to Israeli culture and ethos, well beyond its undoubtedly military contribution. Its members formed the backbone of the Israel Defense Forces high command for many years, and were prominent in Israeli politics, literature and culture. The Palmach was established by the British military and Haganah on May 15, 1941 to help the British protect Palestine from the Nazi German threat. They were also to assist Allied forces with the planned invasion of Syria and Lebanon, then held by Vichy French forces. British experts trained the Palmach special soldiers and equipped them with small arms and explosives. However, after the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1943, the British ordered the dismantling of Palmach. Instead the whole organisation went underground. =Lehi= Lehi (, an acronym for Lohamei Herut Israel, \\"Fighters for the Freedom of Israel\\", ◊ú◊ó\\"◊ô ‚Äì ◊ú◊ï◊ó◊û◊ô ◊ó◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú), also known as the \\"Stern Group\\" or \\"Stern Gang\\", was an armed underground Zionist faction in Mandatory Palestine that had as its goal the eviction of the British from Palestine to allow unrestricted immigration of Jews and the formation of a Jewish state. The name of the group became \\"Lehi\\" only after the death of its founder, Avraham Stern. =Irgun= Irgun (; shorthand for Ha'Irgun Ha'Tsvai Ha'Leumi B'Eretz Yisrael, , \\"National Military Organization in the Land of Israel\\") was a clandestine Zionist group that operated in Palestine from 1931 to 1948, as a militant offshoot of the earlier and larger Haganah (Hebrew: \\"The Defense\\", ◊î◊î◊í◊†◊î) Jewish paramilitary organization. In Israel, Irgun is commonly referred to as Etzel (), an acronym of the Hebrew initials. For secrecy reasons, people often referred to the Irgun, in the time in which it operated, as Haganah Bet (Hebrew: literally \\"Defense 'B' \\" or \\"Second Defense\\" ), Haganah Ha'leumit () or Ha'ma'amad (). The group made attacks against Arab and Palestinian groups a central part of their initial efforts. It was armed expression of the nascent ideology of Revisionist Zionism, expressed by Ze'ev Jabotinsky as that \\"every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arabs and the British; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state\\".Howard Sachar: A History of the State of Israel, pp. 265‚Äì266 The organization was a political predecessor movement to Israel's right-wing Herut (or \\"Freedom\\") party, which led to today's Likud party. The most well-known attack by Irgun was the bombing of King David Hotel in Jerusalem on 22 July 1946. British authorities condemned Irgun as terrorists already in the 1930s.ww2peopleswar Israel =Israeli Security Forces= Israeli Security Forces is used to describe a group of organizations which are charged with the preservation of Israel's territory and civilian public.

Background Roberts was the daughter of Pastor Frank Roberts, a minister with the Church of Christ and an Aboriginal activist, and Muriel Roberts. She was the twin sister of the arts administrator and broadcaster Rhoda Roberts AO, and the sister of Philip and Mark. Brought up and educated in the Lismore region in northern New South Wales, Roberts trained as a hairdresser until, at age 20, she was seriously injured in a car accident sustaining permanent brain damage. She was rehabilitated sufficiently to care for herself and went to live on her own near Lismore. Subsequently, she had two children who were raised by her mother and twin sister. Disappearance Roberts was last seen outside Nimbin Police Station on 31 July 1998. It would appear that she was abducted while hitch-hiking between Nimbin and Lismore and then tortured and abused before being killed. Her badly mutilated body was found about six months after her disappearance in January 1999. A bushwalker found the remains in Whian Whian State Forest, near Dunoon, deep in thick bush some way off a fire trail. Investigation and aftermath The perpetrator or perpetrators of the crime have never been identified. An inquest was held in June 2002.

During the Second World War, the regiment was deployed to Egypt and Cyrenaica, but most of their work consisted of guard duty. Some Palestine Regiment members were killed in Benghazi, where they fought heavy battles against the Germans. The Palestine Regiment consisted of Jews and Arabs, conscripted in Mandatory Palestine, until its reformation in 1944. From 1944, the Jewish military subunits of Palestine Regiment became the basis to form the larger Jewish Brigade, which took part in World War II effort of the Allies in Europe.  Background  Marching Jewish troops in the British army In 1940, Jews and Arabs living under the British Mandate for Palestine were allowed to form separate companies, known as Palestine Infantry Companies, as part of the Royal East Kent Regiment, known as the \\"Buffs\\". The establishment of the first Jewish Infantry Company was completed in September 1940, within the framework of the \\"Buffs\\" and 14 more Jewish Companies were raised, in which about 5,300 men served. Their mission included security, guarding installations and escorting convoys in Palestine. Their training exercises were extremely limited and they were equipped with First World War-era surplus. The declared intent of the British to recruit an equal number of Jews and Arabs did not occur. In the fall of 1939, the British War Cabinet decided to form a new regiment called the Palestine Regiment. At the time the British garrison in Palestine consisted of no fewer than eleven infantry battalions and two cavalry regiments. While in the early phase of World War II, the British had sufficient manpower to meet this demand, as the war progressed, they began to experience a manpower shortage, as well as shortages of weapons, artillery and supplies. These circumstances mandated the British government to use new reserves for duties that required limited training or logistic support. Under Sir Charles Tegart police training projects had been initiated after the 1936 Arab revolt, and these were nearly complete by 1939. British recruiters in Palestine had enjoyed at least moderate success in forming the units of the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps (AMPC), which they hoped would be expanded once the equipment and supplies became available. In response, the War Cabinet ordered a study of the Palestine manpower situation. Almost simultaneously, Dr. Chaim Weizmann offered to help recruit an entire Jewish division for the services in the British Army.  Formation and Service  The Palestine Regiment was formed in 1942 with the Palestine Infantry Companies that were attached to the Buffs forming the bulk of the new formation. The regiment was divided into separate Jewish and Arab battalions. According to historian Ashley Jackson the regiment consisted of 1,600 Jews and 1,200 Arabs, but according to writer Howard Blum, Jews outnumbered Arabs by a more than three to one ratio. The Jewish companies were then formed into three battalions, which became the new Palestine Regiment. Personnel of the Palestine Regiment later formed the core of the Jewish Brigade.

(Left) Dual fluidized bed design, the Darmstadt chemical looping combustion pilot plant and (Right) interconnected moving bed-fluidized bed design, the Ohio State University Coal Direct Chemical Looping pilot plant Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a technological process typically employing a dual fluidized bed system. CLC operated with an interconnected moving bed with a fluidized bed system, has also been employed as a technology process. In CLC, a metal oxide is employed as a bed material providing the oxygen for combustion in the fuel reactor. The reduced metal is then transferred to the second bed (air reactor) and re- oxidized before being reintroduced back to the fuel reactor completing the loop. Fig 1 shows a simplified diagram of the CLC process. Fig 2 shows an example of a dual fluidized bed circulating reactor system and a moving bed- fluidized bed circulating reactor system. Isolation of the fuel from air simplifies the number of chemical reactions in combustion. Employing oxygen without nitrogen and the trace gases found in air eliminates the primary source for the formation of nitrogen oxide (), produces a flue gas composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor; other trace pollutants depend on the fuel selected.  Description  Chemical looping combustion (CLC) uses two or more reactions to perform the oxidation of hydrocarbon-based fuels. In its simplest form, an oxygen-carrying species (normally a metal) is first oxidized in the air forming an oxide. This oxide is then reduced using a hydrocarbon as a reducer in a second reaction. As an example, an iron based system burning pure carbon would involve the two redox reactions: If () and () are added together, the reaction set reduces to straight carbon oxidation i.e.: CLC was first studied as a way to produce from fossil fuels, using two interconnected fluidized beds. Later it was proposed as a system for increasing power station efficiency. The gain in efficiency is possible due to the enhanced reversibility of the two redox reactions; in traditional single stage combustion, the release of a fuel's energy occurs in a highly irreversible manner - departing considerably from equilibrium. In CLC, if an appropriate oxygen carrier is chosen, both redox reactions can be made to occur almost reversibly and at relatively low temperatures. Theoretically, this allows a power station using CLC to approach the ideal work output for an internal combustion engine without exposing components to excessive working temperatures. = Thermodynamics = Fig 3. Sankey diagram of energy fluxes in a reversible CLC system.Fig 3 illustrates the energy exchanges in a CLC system graphically and shows a Sankey diagram of the energy fluxes occurring in a reversible CLC based engine. Studying Fig 1, a heat engine is arranged to receive heat at high temperatures from the exothermic oxidation reaction. After converting part of this energy to work, the heat engine rejects the remaining energy as heat. Almost all of this heat rejection can be absorbed by the endothermic reduction reaction occurring in the reducer. This arrangement requires the redox reactions to be exothermic and endothermic respectively, but this is normally the case for most metals. Some additional heat exchange with the environment is required to satisfy the second law; theoretically, for a reversible process, the heat exchange is related to the standard state entropy change, ŒîSo, of the primary hydrocarbon oxidation reaction as follows: :Qo = ToŒîSo However, for most hydrocarbons, ŒîSo is a small value and, as a result, an engine of high overall efficiency is theoretically possible. = CO2 capture = Although proposed as a means of increasing efficiency, in recent years, interest has been shown in CLC as a carbon capture technique. Carbon capture is facilitated by CLC because the two redox reactions generate two intrinsically separated flue gas streams: a stream from the air reactor, consisting of atmospheric and residual , but sensibly free of ; and a stream from the fuel reactor predominately containing and with very little diluent nitrogen. The air reactor flue gas can be discharged to the atmosphere causing minimal pollution. The reducer exit gas contains almost all of the generated by the system and CLC therefore can be said to exhibit 'inherent carbon capture', as water vapor can easily be removed from the second flue gas via condensation, leading to a stream of almost pure . This gives CLC clear benefits when compared with competing carbon capture technologies, as the latter generally involve a significant energy penalty associated with either post combustion scrubbing systems or the work input required for air separation plants. This has led to CLC being proposed as an energy efficient carbon capture technology, able to capture nearly all of the CO2, for example, from a Coal Direct Chemical Looping (CDCL) plant. A continuous 200-hour demonstration results of a 25 kWth CDCL sub-pilot unit indicated nearly 100% coal conversion to CO2 with no carbon carryover to the air reactor. = Technology development = First operation of chemical-looping combustion with gaseous fuels was demonstrated in 2003, and later with solid fuels in 2006. Total operational experience in 34 pilots of 0.3 to 3 MW is more than 9000 h. Oxygen carrier materials used in operation include monometallic oxides of nickel, copper, manganese and iron, as well as various combined oxides including manganese oxides.combined with calcium, iron and silica. Also natural ores have been in use, especially for solid fuels, including iron ores, manganese ores and ilmenite. = Cost and energy penalty = A detailed technology assessment of chemical-looping combustion of solid fuel, i.e. coal, for a 1000 MWth power plant shows that the added CLC reactor costs as compared to a normal circulating fluidized bed boiler are small, because of the similarities of the technologies. Major costs are instead CO2 compression, needed in all CO2 capture technologies, and oxygen production. Molecular oxygen production may also be needed in certain CLC configuration for polishing the product gas from the fuel reactor. In all the added costs were estimated to 20 ‚Ç¨/tonne of CO2 whereas the energy penalty was 4%. = Variants and related technologies = A variant of CLC is Chemical-Looping Combustion with Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU) where an oxygen carrier is used that releases gas-phase oxygen in the fuel reactor, e.g. CuO/O. This is helpful for achieving high gas conversion, and especially when using solid fuels, where slow steam gasification of char can be avoided. CLOU operation with solid fuels shows high performance Chemical Looping can also be used to produce hydrogen in Chemical-Looping Reforming (CLR) processes. In one configuration of the CLR process, hydrogen is produced from coal and/or natural gas using a moving bed fuel reactor integrated with a steam reactor and a fluidized bed air reactor. This configuration of CLR can produce greater than 99% purity H2 without the need for CO2 separation. Comprehensive overviews of the field are given in recent reviews on chemical looping technologies.Lyngfelt, A. and Mattisson, T. (2011) ‚ÄùMaterials for chemical-looping combustion‚Äù, in D. Stolten and V. Scherer, Efficient Carbon Capture for Coal Power Plants, Weinheim, WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.. KGaA, 475-504. In summary, CLC can achieve both an increase in power station efficiency simultaneously with low energy penalty carbon capture. Challenges with CLC include the operation of dual fluidized bed (maintaining carrier fluidization while avoiding crushing and attrition), and maintaining carrier stability over many cycles.

Manduyog Hill serenely stands at the eastern side of the Aklan State University in the municipality of Banga. Covered with lush green vegetation that turns to varied hues in summer, the hill occupies a segment in Aklan's history. Although disputed by some sceptics as mere legends, Banganhons still believe that in 1437, Datu Manduyog, a descendant of the Borneo Datu during his reign as the ruler of Aklan transferred the seat of government from Batan to Bakan in Banga at the foot of the hill now named after the valiant Datu. The hill then served as a watch tower to warn the natives against invading Moro pirates. (This historical vignette has no historical record as basis, but has been manufactured in such a way as to acquire a hint of historical veracity, primarily through yearly programs or shows supposedly commemorating that historical event. Nonetheless, it has found no support among the established and respected historians of the Philippines, and is thus relegated as folklore of no historical provenance or significance.) The Hispanization of Panay brought Miguel Lopez de Legaspi the shores of Batan in 1565. Eventually, Christianization began and the new religion left as an indelible mark a Cross at the summit of the hill which vanished with the passing years. In later years, a concrete cross was erected through the initiative of the late Mr. Jose A. Urquiola but, it too, succumbed to the harsh elements of time. Imbued with a deep sense of religiosity, the Banganhons nurture the idea of rebuilding the cross at the hill, a dream shared by Knights of Columbus of Banga. But that dream gave no form for nobody took on such responsibility. The enthusiasm to develop Manduyog hill into a religious shrine was revived anew during the last few months of the superintendence of Mr. Tranguilino V. San Pedro at Aklan Agricultural College. It was that simple prodding of constructing a cross in Manduyog Hill from the retired librarian of ASCA Mrs. Patria Q. Aguilar, wife of Dr. Helmar E. Aguilar, then College department head who eventually the University President together with Griselda S. Sayon, former faculty member, which renewed the interest to get the work in Manduyog Hill, started. With the imminent transfer of Supt. San Pedro, the work of planning and coordinating with concerned sectors fell upon Dr. Helmar E. Aguilar, who was assisted by Mrs. Constancia G. Legaspi, an instructor of this college. With their combined efforts, the support of the AAC faculty, staff and students, and the guidance of Rev. Fr. Leopoldo D. Lauron, Parish Priest of Banga, the Manduyog Development Project was started. Initially, the hill was cleared with the help of Dr. Renato Z. Gepty, then farm manager and the late Dr. Ramon D. Duena, then a faculty member, Mr. Ricardo C. Villaruel,a farm mechanics teacher, assisted by the supervising the college students undergoing the YCAP. The giant cross was finally erected on March 11, 1975. Engr. Pedro R. Sayon, a college instructor who also supervised the work, drafted the plan of the huge steel cross. After its completion Mr.Susano Israel installed electric bulbs on it and when the bulbs lighted on the night of March 25, people saw it in the distance were awe struck, for it shone like a divine phenomenon, glittering against the dark velvet firmament. The cross was blessed on March 26, 1975. It was preceded by via crusis followed by a field Mass officiated by Rev. Fr. Lauron. With the cross at the Manduyog now overlooking at Banga, the religious ardor and feeling of pride surged in every Banganhon's heart. Thus came the idea of constructing life size statues depicting the way of the cross along the winding road. Spearheaded by the college and strongly supported by the Knight of Columbus of Banga in 5362, the parish the community, and other devotes Catholics donors for station were identified. These responded with enthusiasm. On March 23, 1975, Palm Sunday, 14 wooden crosses marking the exact site of the stations were blessed. Mr. Pio G. Pabelico from Jumarap,Banga, Aklan, a local sculptor, was commissioned to do the statues for the 14 stations. The first celebration of the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross was held on September 14, 1975. Three priests officiated the Eucharistic celebration at 6:00 that morning: Rev. Fr. Leopoldo D. Lauron as the main celebrant assisted by Rev. Fr. Honre Magallanes and Rev. Fr. Antonio Doro√±o. A crowd estimated at more than 2,000 braved the September drizzle. Thereafter, a ground demonstration was held in front of the Gabaldon Building by Mr. Jorge C. Icotanim and Miss Diana Jean R. Irader. In the afternoon, a stage presentation was given at the Amphitheater spearheaded by Dr. Liberarto M. Yerro, Mrs. Constancia G. Legaspi, Mrs. Laura Ruis-Isturis and the late Dr. Ninfa R. O√±as. Dr. Aguilar, who had now become the Superintendent of AAC, and Mrs. Contancia Gomez-Legaspi, continued to work hard on this collaborative project, now gaining strong support from different sectors. Through the generosity of the couples Mr. Jun Lazo and Mrs. Emma Guevarra-Lazo, a chapel was also built at the southern peak of the hill where masses are celebrated. The provincial government also extended support. Then Governor Roberto Garcia lent heavy equipment to the college to wider and level the roads uphill. The former Department (DLGCD) gave some construction materials for the concrete walks and steps starting from the back of the science building up to the ninth station. The students undergoing Civic Action Program (YCAP) provided the manpower. In addition to the fourteen stations, another sculpture, the Agony in the Garden, was constructed near the welcome marker of the hill. This was donated by the late Judge and Mrs. Diosdado Y. Reloj, Sr. and Mr. and Mrs. Bienvenido Navarra, who were longtime friends. Sixteen years later, in June 1991, the 27-foot (8.3m) steel cross at the summit of Manduyog Hill was replaced by a 40-foot concrete one. Engr. Loreto P. Indelible drafted the design and supervised the construction. Nearly three decades after its completion, the problem of keeping the Manduoyg project in top shape rose. But the commitment of Doctor Aguilar was intact. With the help of Msgr. Raul Gonzales, now the Parish priest of Banga, a meeting was held on March 9, 2000 at the Banga Parish between the station donors and the college, represented by Dr. Aguilar. There, it was decided to give the College full responsibilities in maintaining and improving the project. The following years, Pres. Aguilar decided to do repairs at Manduyog Hill. With the assist. of Mr. Theodore Rowan and some suggestion from Mr. Edelberto Solidum, plans were laid out. Thus on March 12, 2001 the work began under the able supervision of engr. Edsel Elarde and Mr. Nelson Pastrana. The work included the rehabilitation of the damage statues by Mr. Ricardo Cajigal Today, Manduyog Hill attracts visitors not only within the province but even from other provinces in the country. During fiesta day every September 14 and the Lenten season, throngs of multitudes go up the Hill not only the religious fervor, but also by the captivating spell of its magical tranquility.

The holotype was shot by H. A. Cluff at Colonia Garcia, Chihuahua in 1899. The extinct California grizzly bear extended slightly south into Baja California. The bears in Durango, Chihuahua, Sonora and central Mexico were likely more related to the bears of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas than to those of California. Description Known in the Opatas language as the , the grizzly was one of the heaviest and largest mammals in Mexico. It reached a length up to and an average weight of . Due to its silver fur, it was often named in Spanish as el oso plateado (the silvery bear). The Mexican grizzly was smaller than the grizzlies in the United States and Canada. The general color was pale buffy yellow varying to grayish-white, grizzled from the darker color of the underfur. Specimens in worn pelage varied to yellowish-brown and reddish. The longest fur hairs were on the throat and the flanks. The belly was sparsely haired, lacking the thick underfur of the back and the flanks. Range and habitat The bear inhabited the northern territories of Mexico, in particular the temperate grasslands and mountainous pine forests. Its previous range reached from across Aridoamerica, from Arizona to New Mexico, Texas and Mexico. It seems unlikely that the bears would have hibernated although they may have spent some time in winter dens. Biology Like all brown bears, Mexican grizzlies were omnivores. Their diet mainly consisted of plants, fruits and insects, and it is reported that it was very fond of ants, like most brown bears. Occasionally it fed also on small mammals and carrion. Females produced one to three cubs every three years or so. Extinction The first Europeans to come in contact with the Mexican grizzly were the conquistadors in the 16th century, when Francisco V√°squez de Coronado went on an expedition to find the Seven Cities of Gold. His expedition began in Mexico City in 1540, and went north to New Mexico and the Buffalo Plains in the modern-day U.S. states of Texas and Kansas. Because the bears hunted the cattle from time to time, they were considered as pests by farmers. Grizzlies were trapped, shot and poisoned, and had already become scarce by the 1930s. Its former range decreased to the three isolated mountains Cerro Campana, Cerro Santa Clara, and Sierra del Nido north of Chihuahua, within the State of Chihuahua. By 1960, only 30 of them were left. Despite its protected status, the hunting continued. By 1964, the Mexican grizzly was regarded as being extinct. After rumours of some surviving individuals on a ranch at the headwaters of the Yaqui River in the state of Sonora in 1968, American biologist Dr. Carl B. Koford went on a three-month survey but without success. A grizzly was shot in 1976 in Sonora, the fourth confirmed in Sonora, and the first in many decades. The Mexican grizzly is now presumed to be extinct, or perhaps only extirpated.

In its classic sense it is a closed upper-level low which has become completely displaced (cut off) from basic westerly current, and moves independently of that current. Cold drops may remain nearly stationary for days, or on occasion may move westward opposite to the prevailing flow aloft (i.e., retrogression). The term is also used to describe the meteorological phenomenon associated. In Spain, it appears when a front of very cold polar air, a jet stream, advances slowly over Western Europe, at high altitude (normally 5‚Äì9 km or 3‚Äì5.5 mi). In modern usage the term is used to refer to any high impact rainfall event during the Autumn along the Mediterranean coast of Spain and can be analogous to the French \\"Episode Cevenol\\", or Mediterranean Episode. Spanish case If a sudden cut off in the stream takes place, caused by various reasons, like the effect of the high pressures, a pocket of cold air detaches from the main jet stream, penetrating to the south over the Pyrenees into the warm air in Spain, causing its most dramatic effects in the Southeast of Spain, particularly along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, especially in the Valencian Community. This phenomenon is associated with extremely violent downpours and storms, with wind speeds of 100‚Äì200 km (60‚Äì120 mi)/hour, but not always accompanied by significant rainfall. For this it is necessary that the high atmospheric torrential rain instability in the lower air layers to combine with a significant amount of water vapors. Such a combination causes the masses of cold air to quickly discharge up to 500 liters per square meter in extremely rapid rain episodes. This phenomenon usually lasts a very short time, (from a few hours to a maximum of four days) as it exhausts its water reserves without receiving a new supply. The clouds are formed in the Atlantic Ocean. The more extreme the difference in temperature, the more water is stored in the clouds. The Cold Drop can produce snow or hail. This way a great mass of cold air rotates and floats like a drop over a warm area. The torrential rain caused by cold drop can result in devastation caused by torrents and flash floods. For instance, the great Valencia flood of 1957 was the result of a 3-day-long cold drop. =Cold Drops in other localities= The Cold drop (Gota fria) is equally apparent near the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in the Colombian Caribbean, with peaks surpassing 5 km in altitude in close proximity to a warm sea. =In fiction= A sudden rain over Valencia is a plot element in the 2016 Spanish thriller Cien a√±os de perd√≥n. The term gives name to a hit song by Colombian singer Carlos Vives, written by composer Emiliano Zuleta Baquero. The song, \\"La gota fr√≠a\\" (The Cold Drop), describes a rivalry while alluding to the weather phenomenon metaphorically.

He kept his place as first choice goalkeeper, despite competition from promising youngster Tony Coton, and played more than 100 games before a difference of views with new manager Ron Saunders saw him out of contention. He joined Manchester United as cover for Gary Bailey, initially on loan, in 1983, and was an unused substitute in the 1983 FA Charity Shield, but a recurring back injury restricted his chances. Periods on loan at Oldham Athletic and Preston North End preceded his leaving the Football League altogether to join Altrincham in the Alliance Premier League (soon to be renamed the Football Conference). Wealands' first season at Altrincham brought considerable success, culminating in a trip to Wembley where the club beat Runcorn 1‚Äì0 to win the 1985‚Äì86 FA Trophy. In that season's FA Cup, Altrincham reached the Third Round and were drawn away to Birmingham City, still in the First Division and still managed by Saunders. Wealands helped his new club become only the second non-league team to eliminate top-flight opponents on their own ground when they won 2‚Äì1, a result which gave the player considerable personal satisfaction, and which was followed two days later by Saunders' resignation.Matthews, p. 44. The next season Wealands helped the club reach the final of the Cheshire Senior Cup. He then had a spell at Barrow before returning to Altrincham in 1988. The last of his 273 games in all competitions for the club was in 1992, by which time he was 41 years old. After finally retiring from playing, he served briefly on the board of Altrincham, and has coached goalkeepers at Bury. In his early days with Altrincham he worked in insurance, and later was involved with a property development company.

Its population averages at 585 (2011 census) but increases in the summer months. Glynado's inhabitants mainly subside of farming in the fertile plain below the village, known as Leivadia, but have also ventured into hospitality services given its picturesque location sprawled out on a hill top 8 kilometres from the Island's capital Chora. It belongs to the municipality of Naxos. Landscape around Glynado (left) and Galanado (right) Sanctuary of Dionysos at Yria View of the sanctuary The temple was located on a marsh below the current village of Glynado, and about three kilometers from Naxos town. After excavations were made on the site in the late 1990s, it was revealed that there were, not one, but five temples, overlapped at least since the 9th century B.C. The first temple consisted of a simple square building, measuring 5 per 10 meters, with an entrance to the Southeast. There were three wood columns in the interior of the building, supporting the wooden structure that was covered by mud bricks. In the middle of the building there was an eschara, an altar of Mycenaean characteristics, which indicates that the worship could be older than this first known building. The second occupation phase dates from the middle of the 8th century B.C. This building is similar, in appearance, to the first building. The area occupied is larger, about 11 per 15 meters, and the interior has 3 lines of columns, each line containing five columns, all with marble bases. The eschara wasn't moved but interior benches, that ran along the walls, were added. In the beginning of the 7th century B.C. there came a new building, with considerable development from the anterior phases. This temple partially uses the exterior walls of the building of the second phase, but it will be longer, 11 per 17 meters. There are two lines of columns in the interior, with three columns each. The bases are still in marble and the space in the middle of the temple is more important. The exterior entrance has now a peristyle, one of the first known in the ancient Greek world, decorated with a terracotta frise. The roof would have marble pipes for water draining and the eschara, in the interior, would have a lantern on top. The fourth phase of the building, in the middle of the 6th century B.C., would consist of a building that completely covered the other temples, with an area of 13 per 25 meters. The longitudinal and back walls are now in granite and the roofing system is in wood. The rest of the building is in marble: the prostasis, with Ionian columns; the front wall, with cycladic doors; the interior columns and the roof tiles. The final phase of occupation is a church, built in the 5th century A.D.

Kamal Nath was a landmark case in Indian environmental law. In the case, the Supreme Court of India held that the public trust doctrine applied in India. Facts of the case The Indian Express published an article reporting that Span Motels Private Limited, which owns Span Resorts, had floated another ambitious venture, Span Club. The family of Indian politician Kamal Nath has direct links with this company. The club was built after encroaching upon 27.12 bighas of land, including substantial forestland, in 1990. The land was later regularised and leased out to the company on 11 April 1994. The regularisation was done when Nath was Minister of Environment and Forests. This encroachment led to the swelling of the Beas River, and the swollen river changed its course and engulfed the Span Club and the adjoining lawns, washing it away. For almost five months now, the Span Resorts management has been moving bulldozers and earth movers to turn the course of the Beas for a second time. A worrying thought was that of the river eating into the mountains, leading to landslides which were an occasional occurrence in that area. In September, these caused floods in the Beas and property estimated to be worth Rs. 105 crore was destroyed. The Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests by the letter dated 24.11.1993, addressed to the Secretary, Forest, Government of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla conveyed its prior approval in terms of Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for leasing to the Motel 27 bighas and 12 biswas of forest land adjoining to the land already on lease with the Motel. An expert committee formed to assess the situation of the area arrived at the following conclusion; \\"The river is presently in a highly unstable regime after the extraordinary floods of 1995, and it is difficult to predict its behaviour if another high flood occur in the near future. A long-term planning for flood control in the Kullu Valley needs to be taken up immediately with the advice of an organisation having expertise in the field, and permanent measures shall be taken to protect the area so that recurrence of such a heavy flood is mitigated permanently\\". Arguments for the defendants * Whatever construction activity was done by the motel on the land under its possession and on the area around, if any, was done with a view to protect the lease-hold land from floods. * Divisional Forest Officer permitted the motel to carry out the necessary works subject to the conditions that the department would not be liable to pay any amount incurred for the said purpose by the motel. However, it could be easily ascertained from the facts that the Motel had made various constructions on the surrounding area and on the banks of the river. Judgment of the court The forest lands which have been given on lease to the Motel by the State Governments are situated at the bank of the river Beas. Beas is a young and dynamic river. The river is fast-flowing, carrying large boulders, at the time of flood. When water velocity is not sufficient to carry the boulders, these are deposited in the channel often blocking the flow of water. Under such circumstances the river stream changes its course, remaining within the valley but swinging from one bank to the other. The right bank of the river Beas where the motel is located mostly comes under forest, the left bank consists of plateaus, having steep banks facing the river, where fruit orchards and cereal cultivation are predominant. The area being ecologically fragile and full of scenic beauty should not have been permitted to be converted into private ownership and for commercial gains. =Doctrine of Public trust under Roman Law= The notion that the public has a right to expect certain lands and natural areas to retain their natural characteristic is finding its way into the law of the land. The ancient Roman Empire developed a legal theory known as the \\"Doctrine of the Public Trust\\". It was founded on the ideas that certain common properties such as rivers, sea-shore, forests and the air were held by Government in trusteeship for the free and unimpeded use of the general public. Under the Roman Law these resources were either owned by no one (Res Nullious) or by everyone in common (Res Communious). =Doctrine of Public trust under English common Law= Under the English common law, however, the Sovereign could own these resources but the ownership was limited in nature, the Crown could not grant these properties to private owners if the effect was to interfere with the public interests in navigation of fishing. Resources that were suitable for these uses were deemed to be held in trust by the Crown for the benefit of the public. The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, waters and the forests have such a great importance to the people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership. The said resources being a gift of nature. They should be made freely available to everyone irrespective of the status in life. The doctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect the resources for the enjoyment of the general public rather than to permit their use for private ownership or commercial purposes. Three types of restrictions on governmental authority are often thought to be imposed by the public trust: first, the property subject to the trust must not only be used for a public purpose, but it must be held available for use by the general public; second, the property may not be sold, even for a fair cash equivalent; and third, the property must be maintained for particular types of uses. =Lake Mono Case= Supreme Court of California said in the Mono Lake case, \\"‚Ä¶.the public trust is more than an affirmation of state power to use public property for public purposes. It is an affirmation of the duty of the state to protect the people's common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands, surrendering that right of protection only in rare cases when the abandonment of that right is consistent with the purposes of the trust....\\" Our legal system-based on English Common Law - includes the public trust doctrine as part of its jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all natural resources which are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment. The State as a trustee is under a legal duty to protect the natural resources. These resources meant for public use cannot be converted into private ownership. The esthetic use and the pristine glory of the natural resources, the environment and the eco-systems of our country cannot be permitted to be eroded for private, commercial or any other use unless the courts find it necessary in good faith, for the public good and in public interest to encroach upon the said resources. The Court said that they had no hesitation in holding that the Himachal Pradesh Government committed patent breach of public trust by leasing the ecologically fragile land to the Motel management. Both the lease - transactions are in patent breach of the trust held by the State Government. The second lease granted in the year 1994 was virtually of the land which is a part of riverbed. Even the board in its report has recommended deleasing of the said area. Orders of the Court The public trust doctrine, as discussed by the Court in this judgment was a part of the law of the land. The prior approval granted by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forest and the lease-deed dated 11.04.1994 in favour of the Motel were quashed. The lease granted to the Motel by the said lease-deed in respect of 27 bighas and 12 biswas of area, is cancelled and set aside. The Himachal Pradesh Government shall take over the area and restore it to its original-natural conditions. The Motel shall pay compensation by way of cost for the restitution of the environment and ecology of the area. The pollution caused by various constitutions made by the Motel in the riverbed and the banks on the river Beas have to be removed and reversed.  References  External links *India -- M.C. Mehta v.

Born in 1930, child of Lilly and Louis Caller, Jacobs was educated in the United States (as a wartime evacuee) and then at Westonbirt School. In 1950 she married Basil Jacobs who she met at a youth club in the East End of London where they both volunteered; they had three children. In 1971, as chairman of the Jewish Women's Association, Jacobs staged a 24-hour fast outside the Soviet embassy in London to draw attention to the plight of a sick Jewish woman serving a 10-year sentence in a labour camp having been accused of an attempted hijacking. After her husband's death in 1973 Jacobs became involved full-time in campaigning. The founder and first Chair of the National Council for Soviet Jews, she led missions in the 1970s to visit Jews who had been denied permission to emigrate (refuseniks) from the Soviet Bloc. She visited as part of a \\"tourist group and then\\" managed to \\"break away from them\\", risking jail for her activities. In particular, she regularly visited Moscow and Leningrad (now St Petersburg). Jacobs later became known as an advocate of Jewish women's issues. As President of the International Council of Jewish Women (1996‚Äì2002), she represented the organisation at the UN Commission on the Status of Women in New York. She remained involved late in her life through her membership of the European Women's Lobby and Women's International Commission. Jacobs was a member of the board of directors of the New Israel Fund, a campaign for social justice in Israel. She was a patron of the Jewish Council for Racial Equality (JCORE), a member of the Black Jewish Asian Forum, Life President of Jewish Child's Day, and Vice-President of the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture and Chairperson of their Nahum Goldmann Fellowship Program. As foreign affairs spokesperson for the Board of Deputies of British Jews, she courted controversy in meeting first representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in the UK and later the leader of the PLO, Yasser Arafat. Jacobs was unrepentant in the face of criticism of these meetings saying \\"it was just the right thing to do: how else can we attempt to bring peace if we don't talk?\\". A trustee of the Kessler Foundation, she was \\"Chairperson, Mishpacha\\" of this New York based foundation committed to the renewal and enhancement of Jewish culture worldwide. She was chairperson of the EJC Commission on European Institutions (Great Britain) and a senior Trustee of the Next Century Foundation. Jacobs was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours. June Jacobs lived in Kentish Town, London. She died on 22 July 2018 at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke.

Career A native of Paintsville, Kentucky, Fyffe became Auburn's play-by-play announcer in 1981 and spent 22 seasons calling Auburn football games. His signature \\"TOUCHDOWN AUBURN\\" call was beloved by Auburn fans. During his tenure as the voice of the Auburn Tigers, Fyffe shared the Auburn broadcast booth with three former Auburn quarterbacks. Pat Sullivan, the 1971 Heisman Trophy winner was the color commentator from 1981 to 1985. When Sullivan joined the Auburn coaching staff in 1986, he was replaced by Charlie Trotman, the Tigers quarterback from 1977 to 1979. When Trotman stepped down after the 2000 season, Stan White (the Tigers quarterback from 1990 to 1993) replaced him and worked with Fyffe during his final two seasons in the broadcast booth. Fyffe also called Auburn basketball for 22 years. During basketball games, Fyffe was known to say \\"hello\\" to an Auburn player's home town following a slam dunk. According to Fyffe, this tradition started after Charles Barkley asked him to say hello to all the people in Leeds, Alabama, Barkley's hometown. Fyffe told Barkley that he would have to dunk the ball for him to do that. Barkley did, and thus began a tradition that Fyffe continued throughout his years behind the Auburn microphone. Fyffe also hosted \\"Tiger Talk\\", the Auburn Network's weekly radio call-in show until 1998, when Rod Bramblett succeeded him. Fyffe would end every broadcast by saying, \\"My time's up, I thank you for yours.\\" He would occasionally alter the phrase to be, \\"Our time's up, we thank you for yours.\\" Fyffe was also the play-by-play announcer for the USFL's Birmingham Stallions, Birmingham Steeldogs and Columbus Wardogs of the Arena Football League. He was also the public address announcer for Talladega Superspeedway for 20 years, and was associated with the Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic in Montgomery. Fyffe was a pioneer in sports-talk radio in Alabama, hosting one of the first such shows in Montgomery in the 1970s.http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view;=company&srctype;=display&back;=company&id;=332&pos;=75,15,248&PHPSESSID;=ef5e403804212fc97ca893a5d1cab25b At the time of his death, Fyffe hosted a sports-talk show on WACV in Montgomery, Alabama. Death On May 14, 2003, Fyffe attended an Auburn alumni meeting in Prattville, Alabama where he gave a speech opening for Auburn head football coach Tommy Tuberville. Shortly after arriving home, he complained of a headache to his wife, Rose, and eventually collapsed. He was rushed by ambulance to Montgomery's Jackson Hospital where he was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. Fyffe was removed from life support and pronounced dead at approximately 10:00 AM on May 15, 2003. Following the announcement of his death, many sports talk shows and Alabama TV newscasts played some of his most notable calls, and allowed fans and colleagues of Fyffe to share some of their favorite stories and voice grief over the loss. A public memorial service for Fyffe was held in Montgomery at Leak Memory Chapel, followed by a public funeral at First United Methodist Church. Fyffe is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Montgomery, Alabama. Fyffe was survived by his wife Rose, five children, five grandchildren and one great grandchild.http://www.ocm.auburn.edu/news_releases/fyffe.html Rose Fyffe died on June 5, 2011.http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity- memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Rose-Fyffe&lc;=4338&pid;=151610720‚à£=4698468 Awards Fyffe was named Alabama Sportscaster of the Year nine times during his career, and received numerous honors from the Auburn University Board of Trustees, the Alabama State Legislature, the Montgomery City Council, and the Auburn Alumni Association. He was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view;=company&srctype;=display&back;=company&id;=332&pos;=75,15,248&PHPSESSID;=ef5e403804212fc97ca893a5d1cab25b Legacy Rod Bramblett succeeded Fyffe in the Auburn broadcast booth.http://www.clarkecountydemocrat.com/news/2003/0626/Sports/077.html During each football game broadcast, Bramblett remembered Fyffe by using his signature \\"Touchdown Auburn\\" call at least once during the course of a broadcast. Fyffe suffered from diabetes during his life. Upon his death, the Jim Fyffe Diabetes Research Fund at Auburn University was created in his memory. The fund supports graduate students conducting diabetes research and provides funding for diabetes research projects. The fund was established by Auburn University, the Auburn Network and Fyffe's widow, Rose Fyffe. Memorable calls =1987: Auburn at Georgia Tech= In his autobiography, Fyffe admitted that this call, from the October 17, 1987 game at Georgia Tech was probably the call he was most known for, and he considered it the second greatest Auburn win at the time the book was written (1996). This call is on every collection of memorable radio calls released by the Auburn Network, and it was the call that Paul Finebaum played to open his show on the day of Fyffe's death. Auburn was heavily favored in the game with Georgia Tech, and this game was to be the last yearly meeting between the two rivals. But with 4:01 to play in the game, Auburn trailed 10-7 and needed to go 91-yards to score. The Tigers moved down the field behind the passing of quarterback Jeff Burger and, 16 plays later, were at the Georgia Tech four-yard-line with only 29 seconds to play: The pass from Jeff Burger to receiver Lawyer Tillman completed a 17 play, 91-yard drive and the PAT gave Auburn a 14-10 lead. The Tigers' Aundray Bruce completed the scoring by returning a tipped pass for a touchdown on the last play of the game, and Auburn won 20-10. Fyffe received some criticism from the call...mainly, he said, from Alabama fans. Some in the media criticized him, saying they couldn't tell what was happening. Of the call, Fyffe said, \\"Frankly, in listening to the replay of the call through the years, I've never thought it was my best. I probably did go too crazy, but I think the listener could tell what was going on without any problem. No matter what I think about it, Auburn fans still come up to me and tell me it was the best call they've ever heard. And that's what matters.\\" =1993: Alabama at Auburn= Under new head coach Terry Bowden, Auburn had reached the season ending game with Alabama undefeated at 10-0. The Crimson Tide was 8-1-1 and were the defending National Champions. Normally, a game of this magnitude would've been played before a national television audience. But Auburn was under NCAA sanctions and were not allowed to appear on television during 1993. This was Alabama's second trip to Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium and, due to the magnitude of the game, the two schools set up a closed-circuit television feed to Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium in Tuscaloosa. Fyffe set the scene this way as he opened the broadcast of the game on the Auburn Network: Auburn trailed 14-5 at halftime having mustered only a field goal and a sack of Alabama quarterback Jay Barker for a safety. Midway through the third quarter, the Auburn offense began its best drive of the game, moving from its own 30 yard-line to the Alabama 31. But three plays later, senior quarterback Stan White was knocked out of the game with a knee injury. Rather than punt or attempt a long field goal, Bowden elected to send backup quarterback Patrick Nix into the game with a fourth down play: Fyffe's voice was noticeably hoarse during the call and, in his autobiography, Fyffe stated that his voice was noticeably weak at the start of the game, a game he considered one of the biggest of his career due to the magnitude of the game, and the fact the game wasn't on television. He continued, however, and watched as Auburn took the lead on a Scott Etheridge field goal, and, with 2:32 left in the game, Fyffe made his second memorable call as James Bostic sealed the victory: The Tigers won 22-14 and finished 11-0 for the first time in the school's history. =1999: Ole Miss at Auburn (Basketball)= Though he was most known for his memorable football calls, Fyffe grew up loving college basketball. In his autobiography, Fyffe mentioned the legendary Kentucky announcer Cawood Ledford as one of his favorites. Fyffe's basketball calls are most likely less memorable due to Auburn's struggles in basketball during most of his career. That was not the case during the 1998‚Äì99 season as the Tigers dominated the SEC en route to a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament. On February 10, 1999, Auburn hosted Ole Miss before a sellout crowd at Beard-Eaves Memorial Coliseum and a national television audience on ESPN. Fyffe called the game on the Auburn Network along with color analyst Joe Dean, Jr. Auburn started fast and led 18-4 when a missed basket by the Rebels led to an Auburn fast break. The result of the play provides an example of Fyffe's slam dunk call: The Tigers would win the game 95-66.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/news/1999/02/09/auburn_olemiss/ Books * References * *Alabama Sports Hall of Fame Biography *Auburn University Press Release \\"Announcer Jim Fyffe Dies\\" *The Clarke County Democrat \\"Bramblett to take over for Fyffe as AU announcer\\" *Jim Fyffe Diabetes Research Fund at Auburn University Category:College basketball announcers in the United States Category:College football announcers Category:1945 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Atlanta Falcons broadcasters Category:Auburn Tigers football broadcasters Category:Auburn Tigers basketball broadcasters Category:American radio sports announcers Category:People from Paintsville, Kentucky Category:People from Montgomery, Alabama Category:Public address announcers Category:United States Football League announcers Category:Radio personalities from Kentucky Category:Deaths from intracranial aneurysm ","title":"Jim Fyffe"},{"id":"13677275","text":"Wilfred Dent Turner (January 30, 1855 ‚Äì November 8, 1933) was a lawyer, legislator, businessman, and the ninth Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina from 1901 to 1905, serving under Governor Charles B.

They were formed in 1894 as a result of a merger between two local clubs, Wanderers and Strathmore. The club was briefly a member of the Scottish Football League (SFL), playing in Division Two during the 1894‚Äì95 season, but after finishing second from bottom of the league they failed re-election. In December 1894 the suffered an all-time record SFL defeat, losing 15‚Äì1 to Airdrieonians. Their home ground was Clepington Park (now Tannadice Park, the home of Dundee United). History Wanderers were formed in 1885 as a breakaway from Dundee Our Boys (which eight years later merged with Dundee East End to form Dundee F.C.). In 1894 Wanderers merged with another city club, Strathmore, to form Dundonians, in order to apply for membership of the Scottish Football League. They were successful, but as Dundee F.C. had objected to their name, Dundonians became Dundee Wanderers in June 1894. They spent the 1894‚Äì95 season as members of the Second Division, finishing ninth out of ten. Their performance might well have been worse had they not been awarded two points after Renton failed to fulfil a fixture against the club, with the Dunbartonshire side instead opting for a glamour friendly against Queen's Park.B. Crampsey, The First Hundred Years, Glasgow: Scottish Football League, 1990, p. 32 Wanderers' brief sojourn in the Scottish League did produce one record that still stands, however, with the club's 15‚Äì1 away defeat to Airdrieonians remaining the heaviest defeat in Scottish League history. The club lost the tenancy of Clepington Park during the summer of 1894, as a consequence of which they played the first half of their one season as a League club at East Dock Street. In December they returned to Clepington Park, but failed to secure re-election to the Scottish League for season 1895‚Äì96 and went on to join the Northern League. They became Northern League champions in 1900, but lost the tenancy of Clepington Park again in 1909 to the newly formed Dundee Hibernian (later Dundee United). Rendered homeless, Wanderers had to play all of their matches on the grounds of their opponents the following season and, still unable to find a ground, were forced to resign from the Northern League at the end of it, playing only cup ties and friendly matches during 1910‚Äì11. Having secured the tenancy of St Margaret's Park in Lochee, the club re-joined the Northern League for season 1911‚Äì12 but their demise was approaching. The final national competitive match played by Dundee Wanderers was a Scottish Cup tie at Arbroath on 7 September 1912, which they lost 8‚Äì0. The only record of the club taking the field again was for a Forfarshire Cup semi-final tie at Dens Park, Dundee (against Dundee 'A') on 15 March 1913. Wanderers had received a bye into the semi-final, but lost by six goals to one and the club was formally wound up at the end of that season.

Boyle Somerville is in the centre of the front row. Vice-Admiral Henry Boyle Townshend Somerville CMG (7 September 1863 ‚Äì 24 March 1936), generally known as Boyle Somerville, was an Irishman who served in the Royal Navy. He was a maritime author, as well as publishing on ethnography and archaeology. He was shot dead by the IRA. Biography Somervillle's map of Niuafo'ou, published in 1896 Admiralty Chart of the New Hebrides (Vanuatu), surveyed by HMS Dart Boyle Somerville was born at Castletownshend, Co. Cork. His father was Thomas Henry Somerville and his mother was Adelaide Eliza Coghill. Somerville joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1877. His first service was in South America in 1880, and then in the first Egyptian war in 1882. He then spent four years on the China Station. He trained as a Hydrographic Surveyor, and as a Lieutenant worked on the surveys of the Queensland coast and the New Hebrides, now Vanuatu, in the South Pacific, (, 1890‚Äì91). While in Vanuata he carried out ethnographical work, which was published in 1894. In 1893-4 he was surveying in the South Pacific with . Sounding in the Kermadec Trench between New Zealand and Tonga, they found a depth of , the greatest ocean depth ever found up to that time. They then surveyed New Georgia in the Solomon Islands, also with Penguin, and Somerville published an account of the islands and its peoples. He built a significant collection of ethnographic artefacts from the Solomon Islands which is now in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford. In 1895, working on the survey of Tonga, also on Penguin, he took the opportunity to visit Niuafo'ou, and published an early description of the island. Chart of magnetic variation in the Indian Ocean, from the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition of 1905 Admiralty Chart of Bearhaven, Ireland, Surveyed by Somerville in 1910 Somerville Sounding Gear He was promoted to Commander on 31 December 1901, and the following year was posted to the Hydrographic Department for temporary service. He surveyed the Persian Gulf in 1902 (), and Ceylon and the Indian Ocean between 1904 and 1907 with . In the summer of 1905, Somerville and HMS Sealark were assigned to the Indian Ocean expedition sponsored by the Percy Sladen Trust, which was led by J. Stanley Gardiner. Somerville took part in the scientific work of the expedition, as well as making oceanographic and magnetic observations. From 1908-1914 he surveyed British coastal waters in . He was promoted to Captain in 1912 and Vice Admiral on 1 August 1919. G.S. Ritchie, Hydrographer of the Navy from 1966‚Äì71, described him as a \\"surveyor of distinction\\". Shortly before World War I he developed a steam-operated sounding machine for determining ocean depth from a ship that was under way. Somerville's plan of the Callanish stones on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland In 1908, while surveying in British waters, he read a book suggesting stone circles and standing stones might have astronomical significance. He thereafter devoted much of his time to surveying such monuments in Britain, Ireland and elsewhere, and became a recognised expert in the field of archaeoastronomy. He contributed papers to the Journal of the British Astronomical Association and Antiquity. His archaeological studies have been reviewed by Lacey (2008) During World War I he served in the North Atlantic Patrol from 1914‚Äì1916, commanding HMS Victorian, , and . Operations were based around Madeira, the Canary Islands, the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands. With no safe harbours in these islands the ships were always at sea during the night, taking on coal only during daylight hours, to reduce the risk of submarine attacks. This led to one spell of 385 consecutive nights at sea during 1915‚Äì1916. Somerville was involved in the \\"diplomacy of force\\" with the Spanish authorities to prevent violations of neutrality, both regarding use of radio communications and port facilities by the Germans. In October 1914 this led to the internment in La Palma of the Macedonia, a neutral-flagged vessel believed to be provisioning the German commerce-raider . In 1917 he was based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, commanding on Atlantic convoy support. One incident he describes from this period was The Great Search of the ship conveying the German Ambassador Count Bernstorff from the USA back to Germany after diplomatic relations were discontinued. This occurred in Halifax, Nova Scotia, took 10 days, and yielded considerable quantities of contraband. As part of the late summer 1917 reorganisation of the burgeoning British Secret Intelligence Service, led by Mansfield Smith-Cumming and his de facto deputy, Colonel Freddie Browning, Somerville was appointed as 'officer in charge of the Naval Section within the Secret Service Bureau.' This was the first career naval officer posting to the Secret Service. In February 1919, Somerville wrote a review setting out a number of basic principles for service and encouraging the development of specialist intelligence technical skills within the navy for intelligence gathering and analysis. Also in February 1919, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George \\"in recognition of valuable services during the war\\". He retired on 2 August 1919. After his retirement he returned to the family home at Castletownshend, near Cork in Ireland. During his retirement He continued to work for the Admiralty, in the Hydrographic Department and on the Tidal Committee, and published several books including Ocean Passages for the World in 1923. He also published articles describing his surveying experiences in Blackwood's Magazine. He continued to be active in archaeology, publishing his last paper in 1931. He was killed on the evening of 24 March 1936. He went to answer a knocking at the front door. \\"Are you Mr Somerville?\\"; \\"I am Admiral Somerville.\\" He was then shot five times through the glass-panelled front door. A note was left saying that \\"This British agent has recruited 52 boys to the British Army in the past few months\\". IRA chief of staff Tom Barry was involved in authorising the shooting. The family rejected the claim that he recruited for the armed forces, saying that he merely gave references to young people who called to the family door and asked for a reference. The mention of the British Army in the note led to suspicions that the target was in fact his Army brother who lived close by, and was more prominent and a much more likely target. The admiral was an Irish language speaker, and he was a \\"nationalist\\". Somerville's killing was one of the events that led the de Valera government to ban the IRA (18 June 1936). IRA leader Tom Barry stated in an interview in later years that the shooting was a mistake in that he was only meant to have been taken hostage. He was the younger brother of the novelist and artist, Edith Somerville, who finished his biography of William Mariner for its posthumous publication.

He is best known as a former investor on the BBC television programme Dragons' Den, in which he was one of the Dragons from 2007 to 2010. More recently, he has hosted The Business Class on CNBC, a series which sees him joined by experts from a cross-section of industries to analyse and advise innovative UK small and medium enterprises. He is also Chairman of the UK Government's Start Up Loans Scheme. Caan initially achieved success in the recruitment industry, founding the recruitment company Alexander Mann in 1985, which he sold in 2002. In 1993, he co-founded the executive head-hunting firm Humana International, in which he sold his stake in 1999. He is also the founder and current CEO of the UK-based private equity firm Hamilton Bradshaw. In 2013, he was named Chairman of the Year at the International Business Awards. Caan has been involved in a number of charitable activities and founded the James Caan Foundation in 2006. Early life and education Born in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, Caan's family emigrated to the United Kingdom when he was two years old. His father came to the UK without any money or knowing the language but was able to build a successful business from scratch. He subsequently established a clothing company in Brick Lane, east London. Caan's father had intended him to join the family business once his formal education was completed, but Caan decided he wanted to find his own way in the world. At 16, before he had begun his O-Levels, he left home and moved to a flat in Kensington. This led to Caan's being estranged from his father for many years. Other than a Saturday job at Mr Buyright, Caan had no formal experience of work and so went to a recruitment agency to find some. His first job was door to door sales, which he found tiring. At this point, he knew he wanted to work in an office. He went back to the recruitment agency and asked for something that was indoors and saw a job working for Grand Metropolitan. He worked for several recruitment companies and started a fashion boutique with his wife before deciding he wanted to start his own company. Caan started his own recruitment company in the early 1980s. His first office was in Pall Mall but was so small that the door could not be fully opened as it was blocked by his desk. He deliberately chose the prestigious address to add credibility to his business. Caan did not excel at school and did not attend university as an undergraduate, but attended the 7-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 2003. Career =Business= He founded the recruitment company Alexander Mann in 1987. In 1993 Caan co-founded the executive headhunting firm Humana International with Doug Bugie, eventually growing the business to over 147 offices in 30 countries. In the same year, Caan launched the trade magazine Recruitment International, which he later sold in 2000. In 1996 Caan co-founded the business process outsourcing company AMS with Rosaleen Blair. Caan subsequently sold his interests in AMS in 2002. In 1999, Caan sold Humana International to CDI International, a New York listed company. Later in that year, Caan sold a minority stake in Alexander Mann Group to private equity firm Advent International. In 2002 Caan sold his interests in Alexander Mann, which by that time had a turnover of around ¬£130m. In 2004 Caan established the London-based private equity firm, Hamilton Bradshaw. Hamilton Bradshaw is an investment group that specialises in Seed Capital and Growth Capital for recruitment businesses. Hamilton Bradshaw has invested in more than 30 portfolio businesses across 46 offices in the UK, and in 2014 reported more than ¬£300 million in turnover. Founded in 2013, Recruitment Entrepreneur is the Seed Capital arm of Hamilton Bradshaw which provides the seed funding and support for ambitious, experienced recruitment professionals to start, or scale, their own recruitment ventures. In June 2013, Caan gave an interview in which he criticised parents who aid their children with finding jobs and don't let them 'stand on their own two feet', he was accused of hypocrisy when it emerged that he had employed his own daughter in one of his companies. Caan responded that his daughter's recruitment process had been \\"rigorous\\", and stated that the outburst around this revelation would not detract from his six-month effort to campaign for a breakdown of employment barriers. However, in an interview with The Independent Caan admitted, \\"'I would find it very difficult not to help my child'\\". In the same year, he invested in the managed office provider Avanta, which he sold three years later to the private equity company Kenmore. In 2007 Hamilton Bradshaw acquired the recruitment specialist Eden Brown and Caan sold his remaining interest in Alexander Mann Group to Graphite Private Equity in a management buy-out led by Rosaleen Blair. In 2009 Caan launched HBRIDA, with his then business partner Helen Reynolds (ex ACEO of the REC). HBRIDA worked with SME recruitment agencies to help them achieve growth and led them to an exit. Reynolds performed a management buyout of the business in March 2012. In 2010 Caan launched The Entrepreneurs Business Academy and became a non‚ÄìExecutive Director of McCann London. In 2011 Caan founded Hamilton Bradshaw Venture Partners. In 2012/13, Caan launched Hamilton Bradshaw Real Estate (HBRE) to invest in \\"disruptive property start-ups\\". James Caan was recognised in the 2015 New Year Honours List, with a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to entrepreneurship and charitable services through the James Caan Foundation. Caan, Chairman of Start Up Loans, which has supported thousands of people with funding and mentoring to start their own business was \\"delighted and privileged\\" to receive the accolade. This award is recognition for the 23,000 new businesses set up through the scheme as well as his philanthropic work which has helped thousands since the floods hit Pakistan in July 2010. =Television= In 2007, Caan joined the panel of Dragons' Den judges for the fifth series of the show. Hilary Devey replaced James Caan on Dragons Den in 2012. Through his role on Dragons' Den, Caan worked with Children in Need for many years. In 2008, Children in Need filmed a 'Youth Dragons Den'. 'Look for Loneliness' was his initiative to reduce bullying and get children to understand what it is like to feel isolated. Caan went on to work with Children in Need in 2009, helping to renovate a Community Centre for young people to visit before and after school. In 2008, in aid of Comic Relief, Caan teamed up with the other presenters of Dragons Den for a special edition of the programme titled 'Victorians Dragons' Den'. In December 2009 Caan joined the Sport Relief team on a four-day trip to Kenya. In 2012, he was approached by CNBC to host The Business Class, a series which sees him joined by experts from a cross-section of industries, looking at the challenges and opportunities faced by UK SMEs. Each 30-minute episode featured an innovative business which was seeking guidance to help it grow in the marketplace. The popularity of the series saw it recommissioned for a second series in October 2013. In 2014, Caan joined the UKs largest business magazine Business Matters as a columnist. =Social media= In 2011, James Caan launched his mobile app 'James Caan Business Secrets'. Within weeks of launching the app rose to Number 1 in the iTunes chart and later became the fastest downloaded Business app of the year. It has regularly been ranked as a top business app by various publications, it has received over 250,000 downloads and has more than 1.5 million sessions. In 2014, Caan relaunched the latest version of his app to include three free audiobooks as well as additional chapters with tangible advice to help people start, grow or exit businesses. It focuses on key issues such as raising finance, marketing, growth and expansion. In October 2012, James Caan was approached by LinkedIn to be one of 150 LinkedIn Influencers. By June 2014, Caan surpassed 1 million followers on LinkedIn. In late June, Caan surpassed U.S. President Barack Obama and UK Prime minister David Cameron in the number of followers, making him the 7th most followed person on LinkedIn. As a LinkedIn influencer, James blogs about career advice and provides tips for entrepreneurs and small business owners on growing their business and leadership. =Author= Caan has written several books on business and his life. The first book covered his life story and was published in 2008 called 'The Real Deal - My Story from Brick Lane to Dragons' Den'. Following publications focused on business and entrepreneurship with 'Get the Job You Really Want', 'Start Your Business in 7 Days' and most recently, 'Get the Life You Really Want'. Public sector Caan has been involved with the British Government and their agencies on a number of initiatives related to UK business for many years. These include The Government Entrepreneur's Forum and The Department for International Development (DFID) where he worked on the relief effort after the 2010 Pakistan flood. =The Start Up Loans Company= In May 2012, Caan was approached by the government to become Chairman of the Start Up Loans initiative. The aim is to support young people with funding and mentoring to start up new businesses in the UK. Over ¬£112 million of loans were to be offered to 18- to 30-year-olds over a 3-year period. James and his board of entrepreneur ambassadors head up the government scheme, providing loans of around ¬£2,500 to the 18- to 30-year-olds to start their own businesses. Originally, the goal of Start Up Loans was to help 1,000 businesses obtain government and private sector investments to fund these new ventures, however as of 2014, James Caan has helped provide funding and mentorship to more than 18,000 start ups. Charitable activities =The James Caan Foundation= Caan founded the James Caan Foundation (JCF) in 2006 after he took a 'gap year' to visit his homeland of Pakistan. The JCF supports charities in the UK and seeks to promote greater awareness of issues facing the developing world, with a primary focus on children's access to education and healthcare. The JCF has funded the construction of a new school at his birthplace Lahore, located in the eastern province of Punjab. Since first purchasing a barren plot of land and opening the 16-classroom school in 2005, the TCF School, named after Caan's father, educates over 420 children aged between 5-11. =2010 Pakistan floods= In July 2010, Caan flew to Pakistan immediately after the worst flooding in the country's history and personally purchased, prepared and delivered emergency food parcels to families in the Northern village of Nowshera. Upon his return to the UK Caan partnered with UNICEF to provide urgent food, medical supplies and water and hygiene kits to 1,000 families in the affected area. Caan also undertook an extensive media outreach campaign and his trip was widely covered in national newspapers. After just two weeks, Caan had raised ¬£100,000 for UNICEF. Caan and the James Caan Foundation subsequently undertook a project to rebuild a village in Pakistan, including schools, hospitals, homes and all infrastructure and water supplies. Aid agencies including UNICEF, Oxfam, Islamic Relief, Muslim Hands and Mosaic were also involved in the project. Controversy Caan drew criticism when he was caught on camera offering to buy a baby for his brother for ¬£725 from a family that was a victim of the 2010 Pakistan flood despite having a multi- million pound net-worth at the time. He later stated that he regretted the incident and described his behaviour as \\"clearly wrong\\". Caan was later filmed saying: \\"If there's an opportunity to give a life a chance of survival, it's more an emotional response than a rational decision.\\", \\"What I have to remember is that I am here to build a village\\". The father of the baby responded to those comments, stating \\"I am not a trader of my children [...] I can beg for my children but I cannot even think to sell them\\" and \\"I cannot believe such disrespect to a mother and father to believe you can take one of their children from them for the payment of money [...] I cannot believe what a man who is a father has tried to do\\". =Other= Caan is involved with and supports other charities including The Prince's Trust, Marie Curie, Mosaic, Care Foundation the NSPCC and PENNY APPEAL. In 2009 Caan was appointed chairman of The Big Issue Company. Caan was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to entrepreneurship and charitable services.

Mathematical contributions Early notable results of Bowditch include clarifying the classic notion of geometric finiteness for higher-dimensional Kleinian groups in constant and variable negative curvature. In a 1993 paper Bowditch proved that five standard characterisations of geometric finiteness for discrete groups of isometries of hyperbolic 3-space and hyperbolic plane, (including the definition in terms of having a finitely-sided fundamental polyhedron) remain equivalent for groups of isometries of hyperbolic n-space where n ‚â• 4\\\\. He showed, however, that in dimensions n ‚â• 4 the condition of having a finitely-sided Dirichlet domain is no longer equivalent to the standard notions of geometric finiteness. In a subsequent paperB. H. Bowditch, \\"Geometrical finiteness with variable negative curvature\\" Duke Mathematical Journal, vol. 77 (1995), no. 1, 229‚Äì274 Bowditch considered a similar problem for discrete groups of isometries of Hadamard manifold of pinched (but not necessarily constant) negative curvature and of arbitrary dimension n ‚â• 2\\\\. He proved that four out of five equivalent definitions of geometric finiteness considered in his previous paper remain equivalent in this general set-up, but the condition of having a finitely-sided fundamental polyhedron is no longer equivalent to them. Much of Bowditch's work in the 1990s concerned studying boundaries at infinity of word-hyperbolic groups. He proved the cut-point conjecture which says that the boundary of a one-ended word-hyperbolic group does not have any global cut-points. Bowditch first proved this conjecture in the main cases of a one-ended hyperbolic group that does not split over a two- ended subgroupB. H. Bowditch, \\"Group actions on trees and dendrons\\" Topology, vol. 37 (1998), no. 6, pp. 1275‚Äì1298 (that is, a subgroup containing infinite cyclic subgroup of finite index) and also for one-ended hyperbolic groups that are \\"strongly accessible\\".B. H. Bowditch, \\"Boundaries of strongly accessible hyperbolic groups\\" The Epstein birthday schrift, pp. 51‚Äì97, Geometry&Topology; Monographs, vol. 1, Geom. Topol. Publ., Coventry, 1998 The general case of the conjecture was finished shortly thereafter by G. Ananda SwarupG. A. Swarup, \\"On the cut point conjecture\\" Electronic Research Announcements of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 2 (1996), no. 2, pp. 98‚Äì100 who characterised Bowditch's work as follows: \\"The most significant advances in this direction were carried out by Brian Bowditch in a brilliant series of papers ([4]-[7]). We draw heavily from his work\\". Soon after Swarup's paper Bowditch supplied an alternative proof of the cut-point conjecture in the general case.B. H. Bowditch, \\"Connectedness properties of limit sets\\" Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 351 (1999), no. 9, pp. 3673‚Äì3686 Bowditch's work relied on extracting various discrete tree-like structures from the action of a word-hyperbolic group on its boundary. Bowditch also proved that (modulo a few exceptions) the boundary of a one- ended word-hyperbolic group G has local cut-points if and only if G admits an essential splitting, as an amalgamated free product or an HNN extension, over a virtually infinite cyclic group. This allowed Bowditch to produceB. H. Bowditch, \\"Cut points and canonical splittings of hyperbolic groups\\" Acta Mathematica, vol. 180 (1998), no. 2, 145‚Äì186. a theory of JSJ decomposition for word-hyperbolic groups that was more canonical and more general (particularly because it covered groups with nontrivial torsion) than the original JSJ decomposition theory of Zlil Sela.Zlil Sela, \\"Structure and rigidity in (Gromov) hyperbolic groups and discrete groups in rank $$1 Lie groups. II\\" Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 7 (1997), no. 3, pp. 561‚Äì593. One of the consequences of Bowditch's work is that for one-ended word-hyperbolic groups (with a few exceptions) having a nontrivial essential splitting over a virtually cyclic subgroup is a quasi-isometry invariant. Bowditch also gave a topological characterisation of word-hyperbolic groups, thus solving a conjecture proposed by Mikhail Gromov. Namely, Bowditch provedB. H. Bowditch, \\"A topological characterisation of hyperbolic groups\\" Journal of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 11 (1998), no. 3, pp. 643‚Äì667. that a group G is word-hyperbolic if and only if G admits an action by homeomorphisms on a perfect metrisable compactum M as a \\"uniform convergence group\\", that is such that the diagonal action of G on the set of distinct triples from M is properly discontinuous and co-compact; moreover, in that case M is G-equivariantly homeomorphic to the boundary ‚àÇG of G. Later, building up on this work, Bowditch's PhD student Yaman gave a topological characterisation of relatively hyperbolic groups.Asli Yaman, \\"A topological characterisation of relatively hyperbolic groups\\". Crelle's Journal, vol. 566 (2004), pp. 41‚Äì89. Much of Bowditch's work in 2000s concerns the study of the curve complex, with various applications to 3-manifolds, mapping class groups and Kleinian groups. The curve complex C(S) of a finite type surface S, introduced by Harvey in the late 1970s,W. J. Harvey, \\"Boundary structure of the modular group\\". Riemann surfaces and related topics: Proceedings of the 1978 Stony Brook Conference (State Univ. New York, Stony Brook, N.Y., 1978), pp. 245‚Äì251, Ann. of Math. Stud., 97, Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, N.J., 1981. has the set of free homotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on S as the set of vertices, where several distinct vertices span a simplex if the corresponding curves can be realised disjointly. The curve complex turned out to be a fundamental tool in the study of the geometry of the Teichm√ºller space, of mapping class groups and of Kleinian groups. In a 1999 paperHoward Masur, and Yair Minsky, \\"Geometry of the complex of curves. I. Hyperbolicity\\" Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 138 (1999), no. 1, pp. 103‚Äì149. Howard Masur and Yair Minsky proved that for a finite type orientable surface S the curve complex C(S) is Gromov-hyperbolic. This result was a key component in the subsequent proof of Thurston's Ending lamination conjecture, a solution which was based on the combined work of Yair Minsky, Howard Masur, Jeffrey Brock, and Richard Canary.Yair Minsky, \\"Curve complexes, surfaces and 3-manifolds\\". International Congress of Mathematics. Vol. II, pp. 1001‚Äì1033, Eur. Math. Soc., Z√ºrich, 2006. In 2006 Bowditch gave another proofBrian H. Bowditch, \\"Intersection numbers and the hyperbolicity of the curve complex\\" Crelle's Journal, vol. 598 (2006), pp. 105‚Äì129. of hyperbolicity of the curve complex. Bowditch's proof is more combinatorial and rather different from the Masur- Minsky original argument. Bowditch's result also provides an estimate on the hyperbolicity constant of the curve complex which is logarithmic in complexity of the surface and also gives a description of geodesics in the curve complex in terms of the intersection numbers. A subsequent 2008 paper of BowditchBrian H. Bowditch, \\"Tight geodesics in the curve complex\\" Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 171 (2008), no. 2, pp. 281‚Äì300. pushed these ideas further and obtained new quantitative finiteness results regarding the so-called \\"tight geodesics\\" in the curve complex, a notion introduced by Masur and Minsky to combat the fact that the curve complex is not locally finite. As an application, Bowditch proved that, with a few exceptions of surfaces of small complexity, the action of the mapping class group Mod(S) on C(S) is \\"acylindrical\\" and that the asymptotic translation lengths of pseudo-Anosov elements of Mod(S) on C(S) are rational numbers with bounded denominators. A 2007 paper of Bowditch produces a positive solution of the angel problem of John Conway:John H. Conway, \\"The angel problem\\" Games of no chance (Berkeley, California, 1994), pp. 3‚Äì12, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute Publications, 29, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. At the time of its nomination it contained three resources, all of which are contributing buildings. with The buildings were constructed over a 24-year time period, and reflect the styles that were popular when they were built. The facility currently houses a local history museum, and renovations are underway to convert a portion of it back to a passenger train depot. Description The historic district consists of a former passenger depot (1910) and a former freight station (1934) built by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. They replaced an earlier frame passenger depot that was built in 1888 and later expanded to include the freight office. Fort Madison had become a division and crew change point for Santa Fe routes, and it had a locomotive repair shop and other facilities in town, so an upgraded depot was seen as a necessity. This was the railroad's only stop in Iowa. It also includes the Railway Express Agency's (REA) Express Office, which was completed in 1922. The station was closed in 1968 and replaced by the current Amtrak station. Architecture Postcard image of the depot c. 1941 Both the passenger depot and the Railway Express Office were designed in the Mission Revival style, however, they were designed separately by different individuals. The depot was designed as a combination passenger and freight station by C.F. Morse, Chief Engineer for the Santa Fe. It is an adaptation of the brick depot standard they called the \\"county-seat.\\" The depot is a single- story structure and rectangular in shape, that measures . The exterior is composed of pressed brick and its copings, window sills, and water table are of composed of locally quarried Appanoose stone. The building rests on a reinforced concrete foundation and it is capped with a red tile hipped roof. There are three curvilinear roof dormers on the north elevation and two on the south. They each feature the Santa Fe insignia. In the center of the structure is a three-story tower. A 1945 renovation changed the interior to the Art Deco style and removed the women's waiting room. The Railway Express Office was designed by J. M. Dunham, who was the REA's architect and superintendent of buildings working in their St. Louis office. Adjoining the depot, it too is composed of pressed brick with stone trim, a concrete foundation, and red tile roof. It differed in that it featured copper flashings on the chimney and a copper dormer with louvers on the east and west elevations. The dormers were removed in a 1990 renovation. The Santa Fe Freight Office was built to the west of the Railway Express Office between January 1931 and December 1934. It is a two-story rectangular brick structure, and it is more utilitarian than Mission Revival in its style. The Santa Fe logo in stone is located in the upper corners of the north and south elevations. A fire in the late 1960s or early 1970s destroyed a wooden frame structure that was attached to the building and was used for loading and unloading freight. As the depot was a crew changing location, the Santa Fe's conductor and brakemen showered and slept in this building. Post Santa Fe-era When the Santa Fe closed their depot here in 1968, they sold the facility to the City of Fort Madison for $1. The railroad removed most of the furnishings. The city leased the buildings to the North Lee County Historical Society (NLCHS) beginning in 1972 for a local history museum. The NLCHS is responsible for routine maintenance of the three buildings. A Santa Fe caboose (1954) is on display on the property, Steam Locomotive 2913 (1944) is located a little farther to the east. Since 2006, the City of Fort Madison, BNSF Railway, Amtrak, the Iowa Department of Transportation, the Southeast Iowa Regional Planning Commission, and the NLCHS have worked together to restore the old Santa Fe station and create an Amtrak waiting room and ticket office in addition to the museum space. Metzger Johnson Architects of Galesburg, Illinois assisted in the design of the four- phase project. The first phase, completed in 2011, raised the buildings and attach them to the new foundations that are now above the projected 500-year flood elevation. This was necessitated by the complex's location near the Mississippi River and its floods. The second phase raised, graded, and paved the parking lot. The fourth phase was completed at the same time as phase two in 2012 and renovated the interiors to accommodate Amtrak and the museum. The third phase, yet to be completed, is to construct a concrete platform and a canopy for rail passengers. The total cost of the project is estimated at $3.2 million. The city obtained funding from various grant programs, including $1.5 million through the Federal Highway Administration's Transportation Enhancements program and $1.13 million through I-Jobs, a state economic investment program that is designed to update Iowa's infrastructure and to help create and retain jobs. Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad station The former Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (CB&Q;) Fort Madison station is located immediately to the north of the Santa Fe complex, but it is not part of the historic district. The station was built in 1898 and currently houses the North Lee County Historical Society Transportation Museum. The station was impacted by flooding in 2019, as the area was not a part of the project to raise the foundation of the former Santa Fe station. The single track is also owned by the BNSF Railway on the Hannibal Subdivision, also known as the \\"K Line.\\" References Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lee County, Iowa Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Railway buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Historic districts in Lee County, Iowa Category:Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway stations Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1910 Category:Railway stations closed in 1968 Category:Railway freight houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Fort Madison, Iowa Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:1909 establishments in Iowa Category:1968 disestablishments in Iowa Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Lee County, Iowa Category:Former railway stations in Iowa ","title":"Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Passenger and Freight Complex Historic District"},{"id":"13677429","text":"'Hiripoda Wassa' is a 2006 Sinhalese romantic movie directed by Udayakantha Warnasuriya and produced by Soma Edirisinghe for EAP Films.

Benefits of public eProcurement Benefits of Public eProcurement can differ from benefits of electronic purchasing in private sector. Governments objective is not only cost efficiency and obtaining the best value-for-money because of a high impact of public procurement on the market and the society. Commonly discussed benefits of the eProcurement in the public sector are as follows: ¬∑ Transaction costs reduction ‚Äì Electronic automation of processes is supposed to replace various phases of procurement processed manually. It can significantly reduce wage costs, printing costs and make communication much easier for both contractor and supplier.GUR√çN, Martin.

Barriers to entry in public procurement: Evidence from the Czech Republic. Bachelor thesis. Prague: Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Social Sciences, Institute of Economic Studies. ¬∑ Corruption control ‚Äì eProcurement is considered to be suitable tool to prevent corruption as it can make tender process easier to monitor. Electronic tools are also believed to reduce amount of mistakes or errors made by humans involved. Phases The term of the Electronic Public Procurement can be defined as the usage of e-Government platform over the electronic resources (Internet and Web-based applications) to conduct transactions for purchasing the products and services from suppliers to authority's buyers. The following sub-phases of the electronic public procurement process could be identified: * eSourcing: preparatory activities conducted by the contracting authority/entity to collect and reuse information for the preparation of a call; potential bidders may be contacted, if admitted by the legal rules, by electronic means to provide quotations or manifest interest. * eNoticing: advertisement of calls for tenders through the publication of appropriate contract notices in electronic format in the relevant Official Journal (national/EU); electronic access to tender documents and specifications as well as additional related documents are provided in a non-discriminatory way. * eAccess: electronic access to tender documents and specifications as well support to economic operators for the preparation of an offer, e.g. clarifications, questions and answers. * eSubmission: submission of offers in electronic format to the contracting authority/entity, which is able to receive, accept and process it in compliance with the legal requirements. * eTendering: is the union of the eAccess and eSubmission phases. * eAwarding: opening and evaluation of the electronic tenders received, and award of the contract to the best offer in terms of the lowest price or economically most advantageous bid. * eContract: conclusion, enactment and monitoring of a contract / agreement through electronic means between the contracting authority/entity and the winning tenderer. *eOrders: preparation and issuing of an electronic order by the contracting authority/entity and its acceptance by the contractor. *eOrder Status: preparation and delivery of status information against the eOrder. * eInvoicing: preparation and delivery of an invoice in electronic format. * ePayment: electronic payment of the ordered goods, services or works. =eInvoicing= eInvoicing allows an invoice to be sent and received by the customer electronically. eInvoicing is currently defined in multiple ways. A simple search finds 3 simple variations: ‚Äúan invoice issued, received and processed electronically‚Äù, ‚Äúan invoice sent by electronic means to the recipient‚Äù, and ‚Äúan invoice received by the customer electronically‚Äù. Driving a single strategy requires a single definition; a common language. The best definition should be customer-centric. The same common language divides the tiers of eInvoicing based on cash management impacts. * Tier 3 reduces delivery time (e.g. email delivery of pdf versions of invoices) * Tier 2 reduces delivery time and digitizes the data for easier management by customers (e.g. electronic files (xml, edi, flat, etc.) which match the sellers sales invoice) * Tier 1 reduces delivery time, digitizes data and reduces reconciliation time (e.g. electronic files (xml, edi, flat, etc.) which match the customers purchase order, or web invoicing solutions). Enabling systems To successfully conduct electronic procurement across borders, eProcurement systems rely on some ‚Äúkey-enablers‚Äù * eSignature: data in electronic form which are attached to or logically associated with other electronic data and which serve as a method of authentication with regard to this data. * eIdentity: dynamic collection of all attributes, in electronic format, related to a specific entity (citizen, enterprise, or object) which serve to ascertain a specific identity. * eAttestations (Virtual Company Dossier): set of certificates and attestations, in electronic format, to be provided by a supplier to prove compliance with the selection and exclusion criteria of a procurement procedure. * eCatalogues: electronic supplier catalogue prospect uses used to prepare and submit offers or parts of them. * eArchiving: use of electronic means for long-term preservation of documents in digitalised format, ensuring that they can be easily retrieved without conversions.  In Practice  = Portugal = Beginning in 2009 Portugal implemented mandatory use of electronic systems for public procurement. The government has continued to utilize more pilot programs to continue the implementation of the program in Portugal and to establish the e-procurement process until the contract is awarded in a public procurement deal. = Ukraine = In Ukraine the government established the Prozorro system in 2014. It was a major innovation for the government as they switched to a more transparent e-procurement system based on OpenProcurement platform.

It makes up 0.012% (120 ppm) of the total amount of potassium found in nature. Potassium-40 is a rare example of an isotope that undergoes both types of beta decay. In about 89.28% of events, it decays to calcium-40 (40Ca) with emission of a beta particle (Œ≤‚àí, an electron) with a maximum energy of 1.31 MeV and an antineutrino. In about 10.72% of events, it decays to argon-40 (40Ar) by electron capture (EC), with the emission of a neutrino and then a 1.460 MeV gamma ray.This photon would be called an x-ray if emitted from an electron. In nuclear physics, it is common to name photons according to their origin rather than their energy, high energy photons produced by electrical transitions are called \\"x-rays\\" while those emitted from atomic nuclei are called \\"gamma rays\\" irrespective of their energy. The radioactive decay of this particular isotope explains the large abundance of argon (nearly 1%) in the Earth's atmosphere, as well as prevalence of 40Ar over other isotopes. Very rarely (0.001% of events), it will decay to 40Ar by emitting a positron (Œ≤+) and a neutrino. Potassium‚Äìargon dating Decay scheme Potassium-40 is especially important in potassium‚Äìargon (K‚ÄìAr) dating. Argon is a gas that does not ordinarily combine with other elements. So, when a mineral forms ‚Äì whether from molten rock, or from substances dissolved in water ‚Äì it will be initially argon-free, even if there is some argon in the liquid. However, if the mineral contains any potassium, then decay of the 40K isotope present will create fresh argon-40 that will remain locked up in the mineral. Since the rate at which this conversion occurs is known, it is possible to determine the elapsed time since the mineral formed by measuring the ratio of 40K and 40Ar atoms contained in it. The argon found in Earth's atmosphere is 99.6% 40Ar; whereas the argon in the Sun ‚Äì and presumably in the primordial material that condensed into the planets ‚Äì is mostly 36Ar, with less than 15% of 38Ar. It follows that most of the terrestrial argon derives from potassium-40 that decayed into argon-40, which eventually escaped to the atmosphere. Contribution to natural radioactivity The evolution of Earth's mantle radiogenic heat flow over time: contribution from 40K in yellow. The radioactive decay of 40K in the Earth's mantle ranks third, after 232Th and 238U, as the source of radiogenic heat. The core also likely contains radiogenic sources, although how much is uncertain. It has been proposed that significant core radioactivity (1‚Äì2 TW) may be caused by high levels of U, Th, and K. Potassium-40 is the largest source of natural radioactivity in animals including humans. A 70 kg human body contains about 140 grams of potassium, hence about 0.000117 √ó 140 = 0.0164 grams of 40K; whose decay produces about 4,300 disintegrations per second (becquerel) continuously throughout the life of the body.The number of radioactive decays per second in a given mass of 40K is the number of atoms in that mass, divided by the average lifetime of a 40K atom in seconds. The number of atoms in one gram of 40K is Avogadro's number 6.022 (the number of atoms per mole) divided by the atomic weight of potassium-40 (39.96 grams per mole), which is about 0.1507 per gram. As in any exponential decay, the average lifetime is the half-life divided by the natural logarithm of 2, or about 56.82 seconds.

Saint Olaf's Church in Novgorod was a church for Varangians which existed from the 11th century until the 14th century in the Russian city of Novgorod. The church was located in the permanent Varangian centre of trade in Novgorod's trading area (torgovaja storona), which was called got'skij dvor (\\"Gothic court\\") according to an early tradition.Pritsak 1981:370 The functions of the church was not merely to provide a place of worship, but it also served as a treasury and as a warehouse, as was generally the case for churches in Varangian and Hanseatic trading colonies. Like other medieval churches it was probably also a defensive structure to which may testify the Sjusta Runestone in Uppland, Sweden, which was raised after a man named Spjallbo√∞i who died in the church.Jansson 1980:23 Omeljan Pritsak, on the other hand, suggests that Spjallbo√∞i may have died in a fire c. 1070‚Äì1080, one of several that ravaged the church. Saint Olaf began to be venerated as a saint almost directly after his death in 1030, and in 1050, the cult had arrived in England. Saint Olaf had special connections with the city of Novgorod since its Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise was not only the brother- in-law of Olaf, but he also fostered Olaf's son Magnus I of Norway at his court. In addition to appearing on the Sjusta Runestone, Saint Olaf's church is also mentioned in two written sources. The Acta Sancti Olavi regis et martyris was written by Trondheim's archbishop Eysteinn Erlendsson in the third quarter of the 12th century. It informs that a Latin priest named Stephan served in Saint Olaf's church in Novgorod (Holmegarder).Pritsak 1981:370-371 There is also a draft of a German treaty with Novgorod which dates to c. 1230, and it talks of Curia gotensium cum ecclesia et cimiterium Sancti Olaui, which means \\"the Gothic court (i.e. Got'skij dvor) with Saint Olaf's church and cemetery\\".Pritsak 1981:371 The Novgorod First Chronicle only talks of the church of the Varangians (cerky ... variaz'skaja na T\\"rgovi≈°ƒçi). The chronicle mentions the church four times because of fires. In 1152, the church burnt down together with eight other churches, in 1181, it burnt down because of lightning. In 1217, the church is mentioned as Varjaz'skaja bo≈ænica, the \\"Varangian shrine\\" and it reports that considerable amounts of merchandise belonging to the Varangians were completely lost in a fire. The last mention is from 1311, when it burnt down together with seven other churches. The Acta Sancti Olavi talks of a miracle worked by Saint Olaf during a fire in Novgorod, and Pritsak suggests that it was the fire of 1152. Notes Sources *Jansson, Sven B. (1980). Runstenar.

Beauchemin was one of the first musicians from Quebec to have his music mass marketed.  Career  Born in Nicolet, Quebec, Beauchemin began his professional life working as a veterinarian for the Government of Canada. He lived and worked in Winnipeg from 1922 to 1924, but moved to Montreal in 1924. While there, he began to perform on radio station CKAC, accompanied by his wife Marguerite Duval on the piano. Beauchemin made his first recordings‚Äîtwo songs‚Äîin 1926, with the Starr recording company. He began recording songs for His Master's Voice recording company in 1928. Between 1928 and 1932, he recorded 45 songs under their label. These included both popular French songs and French versions of contemporary American songs. He was partial to the songs of Rom√©o Beaudry, who wrote fifteen of the songs Beauchemin recorded with His Master's Voice. In 1936 Beauchemin moved to Quebec City and abandoned his musical career to focus on his veterinary work. He died in Montreal in 1957.

The station is owned by Media East, LLC. WSTK offers an Urban Contemporary Gospel format as The Vine Connection. History In October 2007, WSTK began simulcasting WLGT 98.3 FM, airing a Contemporary Christian format, branded as The Light. It was also simulcast on WEGG (710 AM) for the first month. In March 2008, The Light brand was dropped from WSTK and WLGT. WSTK, WLGT, and WEGG were rebranded Glory Radio, all three stations operating separately. WSTK offered a Southern Gospel format. In June 2008, WLGT became \\"The Promise 98.3\\". WEGG and WSTK were rebranded Joy 710 & 104.5 with a traditional black gospel music format, operating the same syndicated format as 1490 WWIL (AM), under LMA by the same person who operates 1490. In October 2008, WSTK went silent due to financial difficulties, and one month later changed its call sign to \\"WAVQ\\". The station came back on the air for less than one month under the name The Wave with a Carolina Beach Music format, simulcasting with WAVQ 1400 AM in Jacksonville, North Carolina. The venture was cut short when the principal investor backed out. The station went silent once again. On February 6, 2009, the call sign was reverted to WSTK. In May 2009, WSTK resumed broadcasting, simulcasting WEGG. WEGG added new FM translator W240BN 95.9 FM. W240BN was located on the 710 AM tower, and broadcast with 250 watts of power. The station was rebranded as The Gospel Superstation. On June 1, 2009, WSTK went silent once again. On July 1, 2010, WSTK began simulcasting WEGG (710 AM) The Gospel Superstation, once again. On September 1, 2010, WSTK broke away from the simulcast with WEGG and was rebranded as Hometown Gospel Station before going silent yet again on October 4, 2010. On January 4, 2011, WSTK returned to the air as Your Christian Radio, broadcasting a traditional black gospel format. The station began a simulcast with WLGT-FM 98.3 on November 14, 2011. In April 2012, WSTK and WLGT flipped to a Christian Talk format, under the same branding as Your Christian Radio. WSTK fell silent again on January 18, 2012 due to transmitter problems. WSTK resumed broadcasting in January 2013, simulcasting WLGT as Your Christian Radio. On May 4, 2013, WLGT (98.3 FM) became \\"The Bridge\\" with a Contemporary Christian Music format, while WSTK continued under the Your Christian Radio branding. In June 2013, WSTK's transmitter power supply failed, which caused the station to be silent until the new power supply would arrive, the manufacturer stated it would take \\"more than 30 days\\" to send out a new power supply.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101545865&formid;=910&fac;_num=85793 In June 2013, WSTK resumed operations under new branding as The Vine Connection with an Urban contemporary gospel format, under LMA. The Vine Connection was previously on WTOW 1320 AM in Washington, North Carolina from 2005 to 2008, and 2011 to 2013. The Vine Connection was unable to generate sufficient revenue to continue operating the radio station, and was, unfortunately, dropped from the station on February 29, 2016. The Vine Connection does, however, continue to operate as an internet radio station. On March 1, 2016, Surge Media, LLC entered into an LMA with Media East, LLC to operate WSTK. Surge Media, LLC also operates WEGG 710 AM via LMA, and owns FM translator W263BE 100.5 FM. WSTK once again began simulcasting WEGG, as Surge Radio with a Rhythmic Adult Contemporary/Dance Hits format, and on Sunday offers Urban Gospel. On August 10, 2016, Surge Media, LLC announced that it would be ending its LMA with Media East, LLC and would cease broadcasting on WSTK as of August 31, 2016 at 11:59pm. Surge Media, LLC was unable to generate any revenue from the station, and determined that it was not a viable option to continue operating the signal. Ken Santarelli of Surge Media, LLC cited extreme tropospheric interference problems as being the major component of why WSTK was not viable, in which tropospheric ducting would cause other radio stations, even from several states away, to cause interference in the Morehead City, New Bern, and Washington areas; making WSTK unlistenable for as much as six hours out of the day. Interference from the recently upgraded WYHW also caused additional interference issues, specifically in the Morehead City area. The simulcast with WEGG ended at 11:59pm on August 31, 2016 with Haley - This Is How It Goes. Afterward, WSTK went silent. Surge Radio continued to broadcast on WEGG until January 10, 2017. Surge continues to stream online. On Thursday, October 6, 2016 WSTK became Oldies 104.5, playing a fully automated Oldies format, ranging from the 1930s to the 1990s. The Oldies format also failed to generate any revenue. The Oldies format ended abruptly when the Studio-To-Transmitter Link was hacked, and the station began playing a loop of FDT by YG and Nipsey Hussle. It took several days before station management noticed the problem, WSTK was then taken off the air on January 31, 2017. On Wednesday, March 1, 2017 WSTK, once again, became The Vine Connection with an Urban Contemporary Gospel format, under LMA. On Friday, September 1, 2017 WSTK began simulcasting, once again, on WEGG, continuing as The Vine Connection On Monday July 1, 2019 WSTK ceased simulcasting on WEGG. WSTK is continuing as The Vine Connection but WEGG became Country music 100.5 Kix FM.

It is native to much of southern and eastern Africa: Ethiopia, Sudan, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Eswatini (Swaziland), and South Africa (the Cape Provinces, KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and the Northern Provinces). Scadoxus puniceus can be found in cool, shady habitat such as ravines and forests, where it is often found in moist leaf litter. Other common names include snake lily, royal paintbrush, King-of-Candida, African blood lily (English), rooikwas (Afrikaans), isisphompho, and umgola (Zulu). There are nine species of Scadoxus of which three, S. puniceus, S. multiflorus (with 2 subspecies) and S.membranaceus, occur in South Africa. Description Ripened fruits The bright red, round fruits are about a centimeter wide, and each produces a single opalescent seed. Taxonomy The genus was named by the polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, who did not explain its etymology. The name is possibly from doxus meaning \\"glory\\" or \\"splendour\\" in Ancient Greek, referring to the scarlet flowers; the prefix sca means \\"obscure\\" or \\"hidden\\", or from the Greek \\"skia\\" = shade.http://www.photomazza.com/?Scadoxus-multiflorus-subsp One source reports the origin of the name to be unclear. p. 167 The species name puniceus means \\"reddish-purple\\". Previously classified as part of Haemanthus, it was separated mainly because of its stalked leaves. =Synonyms= *Gyaxis puniceus (L.)

It was popular in the Netherlands as early as the beginning of the 18th century. =Cultivars= Some artificial hybrids between Scadoxus puniceus and S. multiflorus subsp. katherinae are known. Johannes Nicolai raised S. 'K√∂nig Albert', which flowered for the first time in 1899. Although rare in cultivation, it multiplies rapidly. Of the same parentage is S. 'Andromeda', which was raised by C. G. van Tubergen around 1904. Uses While the bulb is considered poisonous in significant amounts, it is used traditionally to treat \\"coughs, gastro-intestinal problems, febrile colds, asthma, leprosy, sprains and bruises,\\" and \\"as an antidote to poisons.'\\" It is also used as a diuretic. The leaves are applied to sores and ulcers to aid healing and act as an antiseptic. The plant is also traditionally consumed during pregnancy as part of an herbal regime to ensure safe labour. The alkaloids in the plant include haemanthamines, haemanthidine, 6-Œ≤-hydroxycrinamine, scapunine, and scadoxucines.

The label is owned and run entirely by Charles Kennedy who started out by self- releasing cassettes sold at gigs by his first band 'Night World' in 1987. The first CD release was Fretwork Southeast, a compilation album of local bands from Southwest London in 1993. After three more CDs in the series, and an eponymous debut album by Kennedy's alias The Aries Project, the label moved into signing legacy artists starting with Wishbone Ash, and singer-songwriter, Rob Reynolds. Other releases in the 1990s, distributed by Pinnacle in the UK, included electro compilations such as Speed Garage Invasion and Drum n Bass Invasion. After a gap of five years, the label restarted operations in Camden Town in January 2003, releasing niche cash-in products such as a box set of Emerson, Lake & Palmer remixes by Mike Bennett, a box set of Wishbone Ash demos, and a compilation of covers of David Bowie songs. Hazel O'Connor joined the label with a reissue series of her 1990s albums. Releases included music by guitarist Stevie Salas, Silver Sun (two studio albums), Hugh Cornwell (two studio albums and a live set) and Thomas Dolby (live CD / DVD box set). In 2008 Invisible Hands signed a partially-reformed lineup of The Jam (sans Paul Weller), and released a new Hugh Cornwell album, Hooverdam, available as a free download.

WRGC is owned and operated by Five Forty Broadcasting Company, LLC. History =680 AM= Jimmy Childers and Asheville resident Harold Thomas signed on WMSJ in November 1957, operating in Sylva, North Carolina (Jackson county) on a frequency of 680 kHz. The letters of its callsign stood for \\"Macon/Swain/Jackson,\\" Macon and Swain being the counties immediately south and west, respectively, of Jackson county. The station's call sign was changed to WRGC in memory of Ronnie Childress, the former owner's son who was electrocuted while working on the transmitter during a thunderstorm in the 1970s (his initials were RGC). WRGC broadcasts sports from Western Carolina University and Smoky Mountain High School, as well as local election results and weather. WRGC airs a \\"buy-sell-and-trade call-in show\\" called \\"Tradio.\\" Georgia-Carolina Radiocasting Company bought WRGC in 2002, changing the format from country and gospel to soft rock. WRGC had about 8,000 listeners in Jackson, Macon and Swain Counties, though 98 percent of its advertising revenue came from Jackson County. The economic crisis hit the station hard, as several car dealers closed and other potential advertisers cut spending. On August 31, 2011, the station turned off its transmitter. A posting on their website stated, \\"WRGC has left the air due to the severe economic conditions.\\" The statement also addressed the permanency of this event, \\"Our long term plans for WRGC are not decided, but we have notified the Federal Communications Commission to go off the air until a decision is made.\\" Art Sutton, president of Georgia-Carolina Radiocasting Company, hoped someone local could buy the station, because a local owner could \\"better develop relationships with those smaller businesses\\" needed to make a station successful, as his company's stations WNCC-FM and WFSC in nearby Franklin were. =540 AM= Roy Burnette of 540 Broadcasting Company announced plans to increase the signal of WRGC to 5,000 watts, with the help of a county loan of $289,000, for which a public hearing was planned for December 12, 2011. The stronger signal will likely attract more advertisers. Burnette said, \\"We want to offer in-depth service to Jackson, Macon, Swain and Haywood.\\" After test broadcasts on April 1, the new 540 AM WRGC officially signed on at 12:05 PM (on a new frequency of 540 kHz) with a welcoming statement by new owner, Roy Burnette, and the playing of the National Anthem (the Star Spangled Banner). 540 AM is a Canadian and Mexican clear-channel frequency.

The station broadcasts a classic country music format. Coverage WKOO's main signal on 710 AM reaches all of Duplin County as well as the cities of Benson, Burgaw, Clinton, Elizabethtown, Goldsboro, Greenville, Kinston, Jacksonville, New Bern, Smithfield, and Wilmington. Depending on weather conditions, WKOO can be heard as far away as Durham, Fayetteville, Florence (South Carolina), and Raleigh. WKOO's 250-watt translator, W263BE, covers most of Duplin County, extending as far north as Warsaw, North Carolina and as far south as Burgaw, North Carolina in Pender County. While 710 AM is only available during daylight hours, 100.5 FM is available 24 hours a day. 710 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency, on which WOR in New York, New York and KIRO in Seattle, Washington share Class A status. History The original construction permit for 710 AM in Rose Hill, North Carolina, was applied for on August 13, 1966, by Duplin County Broadcasters, founded by Jeff Barnes Wilson, and was granted on June 9, 1970. The WEGG call letters were assigned on December 28, 1970. The call letters were intended to reflect the poultry industry which was next door to the radio station, as well as the local landmark, The World's Largest Frying Pan. WEGG first began broadcasting in August 1975 with 250 watts daytime-only. =The Wonderful Egg 710= WEGG started out as a country music station, eventually becoming full service, and began incorporating Southern Gospel music as well. WEGG was originally branded as The Wonderful Egg. The station carried programming from ABC News, The North Carolina News Network, and Southern Farm Network. James Kenan High School football and Wake Forest sports were part of the programming as well. Since much of the sporting events, especially the High School Football, occurred after the nightly sign-off. WEGG would broadcast the play-by-play of the game, the next day. The station operates on 710 AM, which is designated a clear channel, in which WOR in New York City has priority over the frequency in the night hours. One of the liners on WEGG was \\"Clear Channel Radio 71\\", even though the station itself is not classified as a clear channel station. In 1981, WEGG began airing Gospel music and Bible Teaching programs seven days a week in addition to country music. Charlie Robinson hosted a daily afternoon program called All Gospel For All People, which featured traditional black gospel and coined the call letters as standing for \\"Where Everyone Glorifies God\\". Thru The Bible Radio with Dr. J. Vernon McGee was part of the programming throughout Wilson's ownership of the station. Jerry Falwell's program was also a part of the lineup. Many local churches aired their ministries on the station as well. In 1993, Duplin County Broadcasters added FM sister station WBSY 104.7 FM, which allowed WEGG's programming to broadcast 24 hours a day. =Country Bear= In 1995, Jeff Barnes Wilson died, and Duplin County Broadcasters sold WEGG and sister station WBSY to Conner Media Corporation on June 7, 1996. WEGG & WBSY, shortly afterward, became Country Bear, simulcasting WZBR 97.7 in Goldsboro. =All Gospel Radio and La Caliente= In 1999, WEGG and WBSY broke away from the simulcast. WEGG flipped to traditional black gospel, and one of WEGG's notable personalities during this time was Patricia \\"Ann\\" Pratt. WBSY became a part of the Go Mix! Network, before becoming regional Mexican with the call letters WZUP, and relocating to Kinston, North Carolina. Though WBSY was no longer simulcasting WEGG, WEGG continued to use invoice forms, in which the letterhead read, \\"WEGG 710 AM / WBSY 104.7 FM\\" until 2014. In June 2005, WEGG flipped to a regional Mexican format. The format change resulted in a backlash against the station, and a local minister organized a committee to bring gospel music back to the radio station, which failed. WEGG also received threats of the NAACP potentially getting involved. =Christian formats= In December 2005, WEGG dropped the regional Mexican format, and became a part of the Fundamental Broadcasting Network, an Independent Fundamental Baptist radio network based in Newport, North Carolina. During this time, WEGG was granted a construction permit for a power increase to 2,500 watts. After Fundamental Broadcasting Network elected not to renew their lease in July 2006, Conner Media Corporation intended to close WEGG. However, general manager Suzanne Wilson, in an attempt to save the radio station, brought back the traditional black gospel music format, along with the former on-air personality, Ann Faison. WEGG also began carrying IRN/USA Radio Network news. Ultimately, Conner Media Corporation decided to complete the power upgrade, and replaced the original Collins 300G transmitter with a Broadcast Electronics AM2.5E transmitter. As soon as the upgrade was completed, WEGG was put up for sale, and remained on the market until 2014. In October 2007, Media East built WSTK 104.5 FM and acquired WLGT 98.3 FM. These two stations, along with WEGG, became known as \\"The Light\\", with a Contemporary Christian Music format under LMA, broadcasting from a studio above the Pepsi Store in New Bern, North Carolina. In March 2008, The Light brand was dropped from WSTK and WLGT. WSTK, WLGT, and WEGG were rebranded as \\"Glory Radio\\", with all three stations operating separately. WLGT 98.3 FM and WEGG 710 AM offered a Traditional Black Gospel format, while WSTK 104.5 FM offered a Southern Gospel format. In June 2008, WEGG and WSTK were rebranded with the moniker Joy, offering a traditional black gospel music format, simulcasting 1490 WWIL (AM). In October 2008, WWIL terminated their LMA with WEGG and WSTK; WSTK went silent, while WEGG reverted to branding as \\"Glory Radio\\" with a traditional black gospel music format, now broadcasting from the WEGG studio in Rose Hill, North Carolina. In May 2009, WSTK resumed broadcasting, simulcasting WEGG. WEGG added new FM translator W240BN at 95.9 FM. W240BN was located on the 710 AM tower and broadcast with 250 watts of power. The station was rebranded as The Gospel Superstation. In January 2011, WEGG was branded Your Christian Radio 710 & 95.9 with a traditional black gospel music format. 104.5 FM WSTK also used the same moniker, but offered a Christian Talk format. Sermons from local ministers were broadcast daily. Local ministers also participated in the \\"Noon Day Prayer\\" each day at noon, during which time a local minister would offer a 15 to 20-minute prayer, and afterward listeners could call in and request prayer from the minister or share a testimony. The station also featured church announcements and local obituaries read throughout the morning. From March 2011 to December 2011, WEGG rebroadcast the audio from \\"The Great Awakening\\" revival services at The River Church in Tampa, Florida, with an immediate repeat overnight. In early 2013, W240BN was relocated, changed frequencies, sold, and eventually became WHQR's Classical HQR 96.7. A new translator, W263BE at 100.5 FM, was launched in its stead, broadcasting from a taller tower outside of Wallace to provide improved reception in Duplin County. =Surge 100= In August 2014, Ken Santarelli, former co-owner of \\"The Surge of SoCal\\", a then-defunct Dance Hits formatted internet radio station based in Los Angeles, California, began talks with Conner Media Corporation about possibly purchasing the radio station. On October 22, 2014, Surge Media, LLC was organized and an agreement was proposed that Surge Media, LLC would purchase FM translator W263BE, and operate WEGG via local marketing agreement for a time, and then Surge Media, LLC would purchase WEGG as well. The station would use the Surge Radio brand. Ken Santarelli and Christian Mergliano have the Surge Radio brand trademarked with the United States Patents and Trademarks Office, and have been using the brand since April 2005. On November 1, 2014, Conner Media Corporation entered into an LMA with Surge Media, LLC. On November 4, 2014, an application was filed with the FCC to transfer ownership of translator W263BE from Conner Media Corporation to Surge Media, LLC. On November 15, 2014, Surge Media, LLC flipped the format rhythmic hot adult contemporary as Surge 100, under guidance by Michael Oaks, owner of internet radio station Energy 98, former Program Director at KNRJ-Energy 92.7 & 101.1 in Phoenix, Arizona and former Music Director at KVBE-Vibe 94.5 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Your Christian Radio 710 and 100.5 signed off with \\"You Can Search\\" by the Angelic Gospel Singers, and Surge 100 signed on at 2 p.m. with \\"Hello\\" by Martin Solveig & Dragonette. WEGG also began streaming online for the first time in its history. Surge 100 immediately began offering mix shows from some of former DJs who were a part of the line up on The Surge of SoCal. These included DJ Mirage and DJ Beatz from the Los Angeles area, Garage Sound System from Moscow (formerly on the Europa Plus network in Russia), and Rohit Bangera of Mumbai (currently living in College Park, Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C.). After the format change, the radio station received many calls from former listeners hoping to get the gospel format back on the air. However, Ken Santarelli, owner and manager of Surge Media, refused, stating that the new format was for the purpose of reaching a larger group of people, better serving the needs of the community, and building a stronger income to help keep the radio station alive. WEGG continued to offer Gospel music and Christian talk programming from local ministries on Sundays. As of January 2015, Garage Sound System from Moscow on Saturday nights was replaced by DJ Perry from Phoenix, Arizona, and House of Grooves Radio with Miss Kay Dee and Audio Jacker. Both of these programs were originally on The Surge of SoCal. Surge also added a mix show from Justin Dohman. The Listening Room with Mikeo (Michael Oaks), which also runs on Mike's other stations Energy 98 and KXJM- HD2-Too Wild 107.5-HD2, was added Sunday nights. The Listening Room plays tomorrow's potential Dance Hits and gives listeners the opportunity to rate the music. Gospel Tunes with Robert Osborne (formerly of the now-defunct WTRQ in Warsaw, North Carolina) was added to the Sunday lineup. Osborne also hosted another program on Saturdays, titled The Fantastic Voyage, which blends the regular playlist with more of an Urban Contemporary flavor. After January 2, 2015, DJ Beatz, who was a resident DJ at The Surge of SoCal since 2012, was replaced by Seduction Mixshow with Mickey Bono of The Beat Thrillerz, another program which was formerly broadcast on The Surge of SoCal. On January 7, 2015, the FCC approved the sale of FM translator W263BE to Surge Media, LLC. On January 13, 2015, Conner Media Corporation closed on the sale of FM translator W263BE 100.5 FM to Surge Media, LLC. Starting the week of January 27, 2015, Surge 100 began adding dance currents during the daytime. In late February 2015, WEGG, once again, began airing content from Southern Farm Network, after 20 years. At the beginning of April 2015, WEGG ended its affiliation with IRN/USA Radio Network, and had no news service for the rest of the month. WEGG began carrying North Carolina News Network once again, on May 11, 2015. In Fall 2015, WEGG began broadcasting high school football, which had been absent from the station since 1996. WEGG covered selected games at Wallace-Rose Hill High School, James Kenan High School, East Duplin High School, Clinton High School, and Harrells Christian Academy. On December 4, 2015; WEGG broadcast the Wallace-Rose Hill High School vs. James Kenan High School playoff championship game, nicknamed the \\"Duplin County Super Bowl,\\" where Wallace-Rose Hill High School won the championship. In October 2015, WEGG closed the original studio and office on Highway 117 just north of Rose Hill, and opened a new office on Main Street in Downtown Wallace. Shortly after, Robert Osborne discontinued his Saturday afternoon program, and took over weekday afternoons. Amber Rose became the midday personality, and Turtle took evenings. From December 2015 to August 2016, WEGG's programming was simulcast daily 2pm-8am on WDJS 1430 AM in Mount Olive, North Carolina. This was to keep WEGG's programming available to the northern portions of Duplin County (where the 100.5 translator signal wasn't as clear) as well as the larger cities of Kinston and Goldsboro during the times when WEGG's 710 AM signal was either off the air during the night hours (due to its dayimer status) or overlapped by WOR prior to sunset.https://www.mail- archive.com/irca@hard-core-dx.com/msg75566.html On March 1, 2016, WSTK began once again simulcasting WEGG. WSTK had, for approximately three years, been operating a Traditional Black Gospel format as \\"The Vine Connection\\" under LMA, but the format failed to sustain the station and was dropped. Surge Media, LLC then entered into an LMA with Media East, LLC to operate WSTK. The branding was planned to be completely adjusted from \\"Surge 100\\" to Surge Radio within the first week, but due to the passing of Ken Santarelli's mother on March 3, necessitating an extended trip out of town, the adjustment of on air imaging was delayed. In late April 2016, Amber Rose quit and was replaced by Heather B. of CHOM-FM/97.7, who handled middays on WEGG via voice-tracking. Turtle, shortly after, left the evening shift and was replaced by Lisa G, who is also an on-air personality with internet radio station Energy 98. On August 10, 2016, Surge Media, LLC announced that it would be ending its LMA with Media East, LLC and would cease broadcasting on WSTK as of August 31, 2016 at 11:59 p.m. Surge Media, LLC was unable to generate any revenue from that station, and determined that it was not a viable option to continue operating the signal. On August 31, 2016, after playing This Is How It Goes by Haley, WEGG and WSTK went to dead air. After a few minutes, WEGG ran an EAS test, and resumed operation. WSTK continued broadcasting dead air until the transmitter was shut off sometime later. The next day WEGG relaunched with a Dance Hits format, with music programmed by Ken Santarelli, owner of Surge Media. The focus of WEGG became more about its presence as an internet radio station rather than a community focused radio station, as Duplin County had showed little interest in the community programming. On October 30, 2016, WEGG began simulcasting its programming in the overnight hours on KCXL/1140 AM & 102.9 FM in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after, Ken Santarelli left Duplin County to build Surge's presence in Kansas City. On January 10, 2017 at 11:59 p.m., Surge Radio ceased broadcasting on WEGG with the final song So This Is Goodbye (Pink Ganter Remix) by William Fitzsimmons. Immediately afterward, WEGG began stunting airing a loop of the Data & Picard song by Pogo with a message, in Ken Santarelli's voice, saying \\"This is WEGG and W263BE Rose Hill. If you're looking for Surge Radio, you'll need to hike it on over to surge radio dot org...\\" followed by a statement that changes between each song stating that a different format was coming on Monday morning at 7:15, leaving no definitive answer about what the new format would be. Some of the statements made references to radio brands that previously existed in Duplin County (i.e. \\"WTRQ returns to Duplin County airwaves monday morning...\\" or \\"There's going to be a lot more Power in Duplin County monday morning...\\") while others made references to radio brands currently in existence in the nearby Jacksonville/New Bern/Greenville market (i.e. \\"Duplin County will get to know Bob...\\" or \\"Duplin County will be kissed\\"), and yet others simply stated a specific format was coming (i.e. \\"There's a whole new country coming to Duplin County...\\" or \\"This just in, the news comes to Duplin County...\\"). Surge Radio continues to broadcast as an internet radio station, and continued part-time on KCXL in Kansas City until July 2017. =100.5 The Dream= On January 16, 2017 at 7:15 a.m., after playing The Black American National Anthem, WEGG became Rhythmic Oldies as 100.5 The Dream, with the first song being Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now by McFadden & Whitehead. The Dream was a partnership between Surge Media and Unique Media. Unique Media's Ray Boney a.k.a. Big Ray Da Hit Man (formerly of WZFX) became the program director. With January 16 being Martin Luther King Jr. Day, WEGG hosted a remote from the NAACP-Duplin County branch's Martin Luther King Jr. Day Celebration at the Lois G. Brit Agricultural Center in Kenansville. On January 23, 2017, an application was filed with the FCC to transfer ownership of WEGG from Conner Media Corporation to Surge Media, LLC. On April 1, 2017, Ken Santarelli's Surge Media, LLC acquired WEGG from Conner Media Corporation. Robert Osborne became WEGG's General Manager. Shortly after the acquisition, Unique Media fell into financial difficulties and began failing to support the radio station. WEGG began to severely deplete Surge Media's resources, to the point that Surge had to terminate its time brokerage agreement with KCXL in Kansas City. Surge Media traded the audio processing equipment they installed at KCXL's FM translators in exchange for an additional month and a half of airtime for Surge Radio in Kansas City. The partnership with Unique Media was terminated on June 30, 2017. =The Soul of Duplin County= On July 1, 2017, Ray Boney exited as program director, and, as a result, WEGG dropped The Dream moniker. WEGG began using the call sign as its moniker. Jay Starling mornings and Robert Osborne afternoons remained in place, and the format remained the same but with a lot of the Hip Hop elements removed. Robert Osborne took the reins as program director in addition to his duties as general manager. =The Vine Connection= Owner Ken Santarelli accepted an LMA offer from The Vine Connection based in Washington, North Carolina, since the Rhythmic Oldies format was generating less than 20% of the station's operating costs. The Vine Connection had also been operating WSTK 104.5 FM via LMA from June 2013 to March 2016 and again since March 2017, and previously operated WTOW 1320 AM from February 2005 to February 2008 and December 2011 to June 2013. Robert Osborne chose to exit as general manager. On September 1, 2017, WEGG became Urban Contemporary Gospel The Vine Connection with Mae Rodgers as program director, once again simulcasting with WSTK 104.5 FM. WEGG's office in Wallace was closed shortly after. On June 5, 2018, an application was filed to transfer WEGG and W263BE back to Conner Media Corporation for $50,000. Surge Media is selling WEGG back to Conner Media at a loss, having purchased WEGG for $120,000 and W263BE for $80,000. The deal also included a construction permit for a new translator. Ken Santarelli of Surge Media cited financial difficulties, the passing of his father, and plans to move to Vi√±a del Mar, Chile, as reasons for selling it back to Conner Media. Ken Santarelli had not lived in the area since late 2016, and even said in an article published by a Kansas City area health club that living in Duplin County, North Carolina is \\"a fate worse than death.\\"https://www.facebook.com/genesishealthclubs/posts/2335680003124637 On May 30, 2019, the sale from Surge Media, LLC back to Conner Media Corporation was finalized. =100.5 Kix FM= On July 1, 2019, WEGG broke away from its simulcast with WSTK and flipped to a classic country music format, as 100.5 Kix FM with Clay McCauley as program director. Clay McCauley had previously hosted a Sunday program on WEGG called The Big Kahuna's Gospel Train from 2009 to 2017. On July 1, 2020, the call letters were changed to WKOO, marking the first time the callsign has been changed in the history of the radio station.

Licensed to Cramerton, North Carolina and owned by Marty Hurney's 2G Media, Inc., the station broadcasts from studios on Morehead Street just outside downtown Charlotte, with transmitter located in northwestern Mecklenburg County. History of WOHS Robert Wallace formed Western Carolina Radio Corporation in 1945 with the intent to sign on a station in Western North Carolina. He was granted a license for 730 AM with the call letters WOHS, with the transmitter located in Shelby just off Hwy 74 East. The station signed on the air August 21, 1946. Wallace signed the station on and then turned over the programming to Hugh Dover. Dover was known as the 'Happy Birthday Man' for his daily renditions to whoever was celebrating that particular day. A mainstay of homes in the community, Dover's popular \\"Carolina in the Morning\\" show would run 38 years until Dover's semi-retirement in 1984. One popular guest on the show was Cleveland County native and bluegrass legend, Earl Scruggs. Scruggs and Dover had been childhood friends, growing up in the Flint Hill Community of Cleveland County. When Don Gibson hosted \\"Sons of the Soil\\" in the early 1950s, he told Jonas Bridges, an announcer on the show, that he would write a song that would make him rich. Bridges didn't believe him, but he ended up playing \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\" on WKMT in 1957.Joe DePriest, \\"Country Music Hall-of- famer, Shelby Native Dies at Age 75 ‚Äì Singer/songwriter Penned Hit \`I Can't Stop Loving You,'\\"The Charlotte Observer, November 19, 2003. Doug Limerick, now an ABC News anchor, worked at WOHS at night while in high school, playing Top 40.

On April 1, 1993, Hastings' KTC Broadcasting took over WLON in Lincolnton in a lease agreement. WLON's Tim Biggerstaff would remain as morning DJ, and his show would be heard on all four KTC stations. News for the entire area would be expanded. The four stations aired UNC-Chapel Hill football and basketball, Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins NFL football, and CBS coverage of such events as The World Series and The Super Bowl.Joe Marusak, \\"New Owner Will Cut Positions at WLON\\", The Charlotte Observer, March 24, 1993.

They also aired games of the NBA Charlotte Hornets.David Poole, \\"Sports Finds Many Homes on Dial\\", The Charlotte Observer, October 4, 1995. In 2000, the stations began airing the Redskins again instead of the Panthers (WGNC aired the Panthers if there was no conflict).David Scott, \\"Sports Business\\", The Charlotte Observer, November 20, 2000. Late in 1999, the four stations changed from country music to \\"super oldies.\\" Biggerstaff, the program director, said country had moved away from its traditional sound. Lillie White remained as midday host, and Andy Foster was afternoon host. Local and sports remained important, and the stations aired the One-on-One sports radio network at night.Sharon E.

Later he moved to Lincolnton-based Hometown Radio's Shelby operation. On WADA he played classic country music and hosted a \\"Swap Shop\\" show on WGNC and WOHS. By this time he had experienced a kidney transplant and two pancreas transplants. On Memorial Day 2007, while on the air, Biggerstaff had a seizure and asked for help on the air, and a listener called 911. He ended up being interviewed by BBC London, Today and People Magazine.Joe DePriest, \\"DJ's Listeners Friends in Need and in Deed\\", The Charlotte Observer, June 7, 2007. The station was an affiliate of the Atlanta Braves radio network, the largest radio affiliate network in Major League Baseball. History of WZGV In April 2009, the station was listed as \\"licensed and silent\\" on the FCC database. HRN bought the dormant license, moved it to Cramerton in Gaston County, and changed its call letters to WZGV in 2009. Another Shelby radio station took the WOHS letters.Rebecca Clark, \\"Local Radio Returns to Shelby\\", The Shelby Star, January 8, 2009.http://www.fcc.gov/fcc- bin/amq?.call=WOHS, Retrieved on 2009/01/13. WZGV planned to return to the air playing classic hits/oldies as \\"Groove 730\\" in February 2010. WOLS morning host Ken Conrad would do mornings, Liz Luke of Magic 96.1 was to be midday host, and Glenn Trent, formerly a radio personality in Asheville, North Carolina, would have the afternoon slot. General manager Lanny Ford said late in February that weather-related \\"construction delays\\" were delaying the station's debut to March. On March 15, 2010, WZGV made its long-awaited debut with its classic hits/oldies format (though the name was Z-730). It boosted its power to 10,000 watts from a new transmitter in northwest Charlotte, allowing it to easily cover most of the Charlotte area during the day while still remaining within 15 miles of Cramerton as required by FCC regulations. However, at night it must power down to 195 watts to protect a cluster of clear-channel stations, including CKAC in Montreal, Quebec, effectively limiting its coverage to Charlotte itself and eastern Gaston County (Cramerton, Mount Holly, Belmont, North CarolinaBelmont). To make up for the shortfall in coverage, it operated a low-powered translator at 97.5 FM in Charlotte, W283AR. In August 2010, WZGV became an affiliate of Fox Sports Radio. The oldies format had difficulty attracting advertising because it was on AM, and FM stations had similar music. WZGV moved into Magic 96.1's former studios on Morehead Street, and local shows began September 20. \\"Bottom Line\\" was hosted by Lanny Ford with Bill Rosinski of ESPN, Darin Gantt of The Herald and Mike Solarte of News 14 Carolina. \\"Sports Yapp\\" with Bryce Johnson moved from WAVO/WTIX. Early in 2011, Richard Walker of The Gaston Gazette began hosting the \\"Bottom Line\\" morning show on Tuesdays, Dave Mobley's \\"The Golf Mob\\" moved from WFNZ, and Ford announced WZGV would be an Atlanta Braves affiliate. In its first week a straw poll of listeners conducted by an independent agency found the format of WZGV to be far superior to that of WFNZ. The listeners cited professionalism and signal strength as reasons for their decision. In April 2011, WZGV agreed to air Charlotte 49ers basketball and football. On August 8, 2011 WZGV switched affiliations to ESPN Radio and rebranded itself as \\"ESPN 730\\". The change meant Mike and Mike would air in Charlotte for the first time, while Jim Rome and Dan Patrick would disappear. \\"The Bottom Line\\" moved from mornings to afternoons with Rosinski three days, Ford one day, and guest hosts on Fridays. The Herd with Colin Cowherd and The Scott Van Pelt Show would also be part of the schedule. In 2012, WZGV announced that it would be a Braves affiliate once again, but that some games would not air if NASCAR had an event at the same time. On February 5, 2012, The Sports Sound Off with JT and Kuveikis debuted on WZGV. In 2012, WZGV's \\"America's Garage Radio Show\\", hosted by Chuck \\"Crank\\" Sperry, Chris \\"Stick\\" Romeis and \\"The Car Chick\\" began national syndication, with affiliates in Greensboro, North Carolina; Arizona and Colorado. On August 20, 2012, WZGV added David Glenn's Raleigh, North Carolina-based show at noon, and The Sports Pulse, hosted by Mike Pacheco and Rosinski, moved to afternoons. During football season, College Football Preview Show with Ford and Charles Arbuckle airs on Saturday mornings. Starting in 2012, WZGV aired Charlotte Checkers hockey. Starting in 2014, WZGV aired Charlotte Knights baseball; the station said it would also air the 2014 Triple-A All-Star Game and the 2014 Gildan Triple-A National Championship Game. On February 2, 2015, Lanny Ford, general manager since the station started, and former Carolina Panthers general manager Marty Hurney announced they were leasing WZGV and WZGM in Asheville, North Carolina from HRN. Hurney, also an NFL Insiders analyst, had worked for WZGV since June 2014, co-hosting one show with Al Gardner and later working with Ford. Ford also said some WZGV programs would air on WZGM. Effective April 20, 2018, HRN Broadcasting, Inc. sold WZGV and its translator W283AR (now W248CO) to Marty Hurney's 2G Media, Inc. for $900,000. Soon after taking control, Hurney rebranded the station as \\"730 AM the Game.\\" Starting in 2020, WZGV added Carolina Hurricanes hockey.

The riots emerged during the Civil Rights Movement, locally led by Gloria Richardson and the local chapter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. They were opposed by segregationists including the police.  The background. Events of 1962  In January 1962, Baltimore's Civic Interest Group (CIG) - an affiliate of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) - began organizing sit-ins and freedom rides in towns along Maryland's Eastern Shore. When SNCC organizers arrived in Cambridge, demonstrations were organized downtown to demand desegregation of local businesses. The Cambridge Nonviolent Action Committee (CNAC) was founded soon after these initial demonstrations to support and continue local protests. Governor J. Millard Tawes urged the Maryland General Assembly to pass an anti-discrimination bill aimed at ending prejudice in establishments throughout the state, though the effort was hampered when Eastern Shore legislators pushed to allow counties to exempt themselves from enforcement of the bill. At the close of the summer of 1962, most establishments in Cambridge were still segregated, with CNAC-led protests dwindling as school resumed for its student members.  Events of 1963  Demonstrations by the CNAC resumed at the end of March, when a local movie theater expanded its discriminatory practices by relegating African-Americans to the back rows of the balcony instead of the entire balcony, as had been done previously. This escalation motivated leaders of both the CNAC and CIG to meet with city officials to discuss the desegregation of public accommodations, equal employment opportunities, and fair housing for African Americans, but their demands went unmet. In response, demonstrators marched through downtown Cambridge to protest the continuing segregation allowed in public venues, which ended with the arrest of Richardson and sixteen other demonstrators for \\"disorderly conduct.\\" A boycott of white-owned businesses was then organized by the CNAC, with this pattern of protests, arrests, boycotts, and harassment continuing through April. CNAC demonstrations continued in mid-May, with many of them led by high school students Dwight Cromwell and Dinez White, both 15, who were later charged with \\"disorderly conduct\\" after being arrested while praying peacefully outside of a segregated facility. Cromwell and White were held without bail and eventually sentenced to indefinite incarceration in a state juvenile facility. Marches were organized by the CNAC on the nights of June 11 and June 12 to protest the sentences given to Cromwell and White. On June 13, a third march was organized downtown. On June 14, several white-owned businesses in the Second Ward - a predominately African-American section of town - were set on fire, and gunfire was exchanged between white and African-American citizens, resulting in casualties. Gloria Richardson, a graduate of Howard University, helped establish organizations that addressed community concerns about civil rights. Richardson also was a key leader in promoting black pride. Governor Tawes declared martial law and deployed the Maryland National Guard to Cambridge after the CNAC refused a year-long moratorium on protests. The guardsmen remained in the town for 25 days, from June 14 through July 8. On July 11 a clash between whites and African-Americans broke out when six sit-in demonstrators at Dizzyland restaurant, one of the main targets of the CNACs summer-long integration campaign, were harassed and beaten by white patrons. Tensions further increased when 250 African-Americans organized a \\"freedom walk\\" to the Dorchester County Court House that evening and were met by a crowd of 700 whites. The two groups were kept apart and eventually dispersed by the Maryland State Police. Cambridge remained quiet until 10 p.m., when two white men and a 12-year-old boy were wounded by shotgun fire near their homes and police brought eight African-American men in for questioning. In the early morning hours of July 12, two carloads of white men drove through the Second Ward, exchanging gunfire with African Americans. Police arrested five white men in their early 20s after the first exchange of gunfire in the African- American district. Three National Guardsmen in a civilian car were injured when a gunshot blast punctured their windshield during the second round of gunfire between whites and African Americans. Order was reestablished around 2 a.m. on July 12 and Major George E. Davidson of the Maryland State Police recommended to Governor Tawes that full martial law be reinstated. On July 24, the events continued to escalate due to Hubert Gerold Brown. Brown was a black power advocate and threatened people he would burn down the city of Cambridge if his demands were not met. The Maryland National Guard was redeployed to Cambridge, where they would remain for the next year. Brigadier General George Gelston, assistant state adjutant general and commander of the troops, imposed a modified martial law that consisted of a 9 p.m. curfew, a ban on further racial demonstrations, and prohibitions of carrying firearms and selling liquor.  Events of 1967  In July 1967, the National States Rights party and the Ku Klux Klan came to the city of Cambridge to protest school desegregation. The situation escalated when Hubert Gerold \\"H. Rap\\" Brown, a Black Power advocate, arrived in Cambridge in late July. Brown made comments such as \\"burn this town down\\" and \\"It's time for Cambridge to explode,\\" if the local blacks felt that their demands were not being met. The National Guard was quickly ordered into the city. Brown was arrested and charged with arson, inciting riot, and disturbing the peace. Brown is now known to have no direct relationship with the violence of 1967 and historians dispute as to whether it actually qualifies as a riot. Documents from the Kerner Commission investigation show that he completed his speech at 10 pm July 24, then walked a woman home and was shot by a deputy sheriff without provocation. Brown was hastily treated for his injuries and secretly taken out of Cambridge. The one major fire did not break out until hours later, and its expansion is attributed to the deliberate inaction of the Cambridge police and fire departments, which had hostile relations with the black community. The head of the Cambridge police department, Brice Kinnamon, nonetheless claimed that the city had no racial problems, Brown was the \\"sole\\" cause of the disorder, and it was \\"a well-planned Communist attempt to overthrow the government.\\" See also *Cambridge riot of 1967 *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States References Cambridge riot Category:1963 riots Category:African-American history in Cambridge, Maryland Category:African- American riots in the United States Category:History of racism in Maryland Category:Riots and civil disorder in Maryland ","title":"Cambridge riot of 1963"},{"id":"13678075","text":"The Cor (or Co, Col, C√πa; Vietnamese: Ng∆∞·ªùi Co) are an ethnic group of Vietnam.

Rombertus was one of the founders of the University of Franeker in 1585. Gerrit van Uylenburgh, who may have been Rombertus' brother, tended to Mennonitism, left for Poland to become the royal furniture maker in Crakow, and became the father of the art-dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh.  Life  Rombertus was born at Bergum. He studied law at the Catholic University of Leuven or Heidelberg and graduated in the year 1578. In this same year, he became a lawyer in Leeuwarden. He married Siuckien Ulckedr Aessinga (or Sjoukje Osinga) and probably had three sons and four daughters: Jeltje, Romke, Ulke, Antje, Edzert, Hiskje (= Hiskia) and Saakje (= Saskia). With a career constantly on the rise, he became a pensionaris and mayor of Leeuwarden. He was also chosen in 1584 as a delegate of the states of Friesland and one of the Frisian envoys in the Hague. Because votes were per region, the number of delegates made no difference. Van Uylenburgh was present at Delft on the day of the murder of prince William of Orange ‚Äî 10 July 1584 ‚Äî for discussions with the prince over difficulties in the Frisian States. Rombertus, embarrassed, was invited to the lunch, because there were no other guests. At the end of the meal, William of Orange stumbled on the stair, and was then murdered with a pistol by Balthasar Gerards. Cornelis van Aarsens ‚Äî according to Uylenburgh not present at the event ‚Äî jotted down the prince's last words. The bishop Morillon wrote \\"Je le tiens mentir de ce qu' auroit dit ledict Orangier estant f√©ru, puisqu' il advint apr√®s boire, lorsqu' il estoit tousiours raoust.\\" Until 1591 Uylenburgh rose as a state lawyer (landsadvocaat), but was forced ‚Äî because of the variety of positions he held ‚Äî to give up that post. In his later legal career he became the supreme-court lawyer (raadsheer) at the Court of Friesland. In 1595 he bought a house on the Ossekop, where Saskia was born. (Today the building is in use by the famous twins and lawyers Wim and Hans Anker.) Van Uylenburgh owned two farms, one in Rijperkerk, the other in Gaasterland. Two sons became lawyers, one son-in-law was the Polish theological professor Johannes Maccovius, and the other was Gerrit van Loo, municipal secretary in Het Bildt, the place where Rembrandt and Saskia married in 1634.

After five seasons of mid-table finishes, the club won the Second Division championship in 1927 and were promoted to the First Division. The club was relegated back to the Second Division after just one season. Bo'ness then struggled financially, like many other clubs in the region, due to the decline of the local coal and shale oil industries. Bo'ness offered free admission to local unemployed people after 30 minutes of play. The club struggled to raise the ¬£50 match guarantee to visiting clubs in 1931, but was surprisingly re-elected. Further failures to provide match guarantees meant that the club was expelled from the League during the 1932‚Äì33 season. Bo'ness continued as a non-league side until 1939, appearing in the Scottish Football Alliance, Edinburgh and District League, Scottish Football Combination and the East of Scotland Football League. Future Scotland international Alex Munro also came through the ranks at this time. The club survived World War II but merged with local side Bo'ness Cadora to form junior club Bo'ness United in 1945.

Starting in 1974, the band released several singles under the production guidance of Les Emmerson (of the Canadian rock group Five Man Electrical Band). The group had some early regional success with the tracks ‚ÄúFinally (With You)‚Äù and ‚ÄúMiss Lonelyhearts‚Äù under the Polydor label. Though not until they signed with producer Gary Cape did they chart in the U.S. and see real success. Biography The band first gained attention in the summer of 1978 when they signed with Capricorn Records and producer Gary Cape. The label was producing several of the most popular southern-rock acts of the time including: The Allman Brothers Band, The Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie, and Elvin Bishop. Over the next few years the Cooper Brothers released two albums, the self-titled, The Cooper Brothers and Pitfalls of the Ballroom. Both albums sold well and the singles \\"The Dream Never Dies\\", \\"Show Some Emotion\\" and \\"I'll Know Her When I See Her\\", all charted on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2006, the band was signed to record label EMI Records. Among their many critical accolades, the Cooper Brothers were voted Best New Group in 1978, Best MOR Group in 1979 and Best Overall Group in 1980 by Canadian Contemporary Music Programmers. In 1980, \\"The Dream Never Dies\\" also earned an ASCAP Award as one of the most performed songs on U.S radio. The song has subsequently been recorded by several other artists including Bill Anderson and Juice Newton, and was also the title theme for a feature-length documentary on Canada's National Ski team. At the height of their career the band toured extensively throughout North America, opening for The Doobie Brothers, Black Oak Arkansas, Joe Cocker, Charlie Daniels, Atlanta Rhythm Section, McGuinn, Clark & Hillman and Seals and Crofts. In addition, the band worked with some of the most prolific musicians of the day including Chuck Leavell, who played on the Cooper Brothers‚Äô track \\"Ridin High\\". Despite their success, the band faced a dramatic transformation in late 1980, when Capricorn Records folded. The band however, would once again go into the studio with Cape producing but now the band was joined by Les Emmerson of Five Man Electrical Band. One more album was produced, Learning to Live with It, but it had little success. With Les Emmerson now lending his experience and expertise, the Cooper Brothers produced one last album, Reach for the Sky. This last album went unreleased and the band members parted ways shortly after in 1983. Dick Cooper moved from music to a career as a screenwriter for children's TV programs like You Can't Do That on Television and created his own teen drama series, Highschool Confidential, while working at Ottawa television station CJOH. In October 2006, the Cooper Brothers reunited to release a CD collection of their most popular tracks entitled, The Best of the Cooper Brothers under the EMI/Pacemaker label and the band performed for the first time on stage in over twenty years. This led to a number of sold-out live dates throughout Southern Ontario including an Ottawa Bluesfest concert with the band opening up for James Taylor in front of a crowd of over 25,000 people. The experience sparked Richard Cooper's muse again and he began writing songs. Before long the brothers had enough material for a new album and approached respected musician/producer and old friend Colin Linden. \\"When I heard the songs, I thought they sounded timeless. They were brimming with ideas. They weren't trivial and they were musically and lyrically so well thought out...\\" said Linden. In September 2009 with Colin at the helm, the brothers went to Masterlink Studio in Nashville to begin recording with session musicians including Audley Freed (Black Crowes, Jakob Dylan, Dixie Chicks) Dan Dugmore (Linda Rostadt, James Taylor) Kevin McKendree (Brian Seltzer, Lee Roy Parnell) Lynn Williams (John Hiatt, Delbert McClinton) and Steve Mackey (Trisha Yearwood) \\"Nashville was so much fun,\\" said Richard Cooper after the fall 2009 recording sessions. \\"Playing alongside musicians of that calibre was inspiring and Colin certainly managed to capture the vision I had for these songs... and then some.\\" After additional recording back in Ottawa and Toronto, the CD was mixed in Los Angeles by John Whynot. In February 2010, a new Cooper Brothers album, In From the Cold was released, featuring 12 new songs. The album also featured a number of guest artists including Blue Rodeo's Jim Cuddy, plus Delbert McClinton and Chuck Leavell. In June 2013, the Cooper Brothers released Southbound. The album was recorded at the Tragically Hip's studio in Bath, Ontario and was produced by Colin Cripps (Blue Rodeo, Crash Vegas). The current live band line-up of Ed Bimm, Rob Holtz, Jeff Rogers, Darwin Demers and John Steel all play and sing on every track. Other session musicians include Gary Craig (Anne Murray/Tom Cochrane/Jann Arden), Peter Fredette (Kim Mitchell), Topher Stott (Jarvis Church/ Jerome Godboo) and guitar whiz Carey Blackwell. The CD featured eleven new Richard Cooper penned tracks including the first single, \\"Southbound\\", a tongue-in-cheek look at the band's love/hate relationship with Canadian winters. Other notable songs on the CD are \\"Love's Been a Stranger\\", a duet featuring Brian and Juno Award winner, Kellylee Evans as well as \\"Maybe This is the Night\\" and \\"Bridges\\" - both songs featuring the harmonies that the band is noted for.

The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security is responsible for the social welfare system. Welfare in China is linked to the hukou system.

Child care, education, job placement, housing, subsistence, health care, and elder care were largely the responsibility of the work unit as administered through state-owned enterprises and agricultural communes and collectives. As those systems disappeared or were reformed, the \\"iron rice bowl\\" approach to welfare changed.

The four stations aired UNC football and basketball, Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins NFL football, and CBS coverage of such events as the World Series and the Super Bowl.Joe Marusak, \\"New Owner Will Cut Positions at WLON\\", The Charlotte Observer, March 24, 1993. The four stations added the NFL Carolina Panthers when the team began playing in 1995. They also aired games of the NBA Charlotte HornetsDavid Poole, \\"Sports Finds Many Homes on Dial\\", The Charlotte Observer, October 4, 1995. In 2000, the stations began airing the Redskins again instead of the Panthers (WGNC aired the Panthers if there was no conflict).David Scott, \\"Sports Business\\", The Charlotte Observer, November 20, 2000. Previous logo Late in 1999, the four stations changed from country music to \\"super oldies.\\" Biggerstaff, the program director, said country had moved away from its traditional sound. Lillie White remained as midday host, and Andy Foster was afternoon host. Local and sports remained important, and the stations aired the One-on-One sports radio network at night.Sharon E. White, \\"Up-Tempo Oldies Push Country Aside at 4 Stations in Regional AM Network\\", The Charlotte Observer, December 5, 1999. In 2004, Biggerstaff was still hosting his show on WCSL and WLON despite diabetes-related health problems.Joe DePriest, \\"New Friend Offers Gift for Ailing DJ\\", The Charlotte Observer, April 14, 2004. Later he moved to Lincolnton-based Hometown Radio's Shelby operation. On WADA he played classic country music, and he hosted a \\"Swap Shop\\" show on WGNC and WOHS. By this time he had experienced a kidney transplant and two pancreas transplants.Joe DePriest, \\"DJ's Listeners Friends in Need and in Deed\\", The Charlotte Observer, June 7, 2007.

(The Cooper Brothers had previously performed \\"I'll Know Her When I See Her\\" on YCDTOTV's short-lived CTV network spinoff, Whatever Turns You On, in 1979.) While working at CJOH in 1986, Cooper also created and developed his first original series entitled Highschool Confidential. Cooper would write and produce 21 episodes of the teen variety series, and the show was later syndicated in the U.S. and Canada, winning the International Iris Award at NATPE in 1987. In 1988, Cooper followed up Highschool Confidential by producing and directing 13 episodes of the television series Denim Blues, a half-hour teen drama which was subsequently syndicated in both Canada and Japan. The show would also mark the acting debut of Golden Globe Winner Sandra Oh as well as Tyley Ross, of the popular singing ensemble the East Village Opera Company. The series was also presented with the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Gold Ribbon Award in 1989. 1990s In 1990, Cooper left CJOH to pursue a freelance career as a writer, director and producer. During this time, he continued to work as a story editor, as well as teaching screenwriting at the Ottawa based Algonquin College and the Summer Institute of Film and Television. Cooper also wrote and scored the soundtracks for several industrial films, television shows and documentaries. In 1997, Cooper was hired on as the Creative Director of Ottawa based video game developer Artech Studios. Over the next ten years, Cooper would work on over 50 best- selling video game titles including: Q*Bert, Star Wars Monopoly, Jeopardy!, Wheel Of Fortune, Family Feud, Stanley, Trivial Pursuit Unhinged and Lord of the Rings Trivial Pursuit; working with the likes of Andy Serkis, Whoopi Goldberg, Alex Trebek, Vanna White, John O'Hurley and John Cleese. 2000s In 2006, Cooper once again become involved with the Cooper Brothers when the band reformed after twenty years of separation to release a \\"Best Of\\" CD under the EMI Pacemaker label. Dick left Artech Studios in 2007 when his first novel Jukebox, published by Rain Books, was released. Since then he has gone back to freelance writing, and written several episodes of Forensic Factor (EPI Productions) which airs on the Discovery Channel. 2010s In February 2010, a new Cooper Brothers album entitled In From the Cold was released. The album features a number of guest artists including Blue Rodeo's Jim Cuddy, Delbert McClinton, and Chuck Leavell. In 2012 Jukebox was re-published by General Store Publishing. That same year, Dick started teaching song writing and performance at Algonquin College in Ottawa in their Introduction to Music Industry Arts program. In June 2013, the Cooper Brothers released a new CD entitled \\"Southbound\\", produced by Colin Cripps (Blue Rodeo, Crash Vegas). The album features eleven Richard Cooper penned tracks.

October 2006) was a German biophysicist. He was professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin, and best known as one of the founders, with Tom Rapoport, of metabolic control theory in parallel with similar ideas developed at about the same time by Henrik Kacser and Jim Burns. His far-reaching theoretical work on metabolism, signal transduction, and other cellular processes has made him one of the most influential forerunners of present-day systems biology. Reinhart's many talents made him appear as a modern Renaissance man. He played the violin, and published an autobiographic novel (Jenseits von Babel ) and several works of lyric poetry for which he received the Brigitte Reimann Prize. Among his services to the scientific community, Reinhart was associate editor of PLoS Computational Biology. Reinhart Heinrich was born in Dresden and lived at first in the Soviet Union, growing up in Kuybyshev/–ö—É–π–±—ã—à–µ–≤ (called Samara since 1991) where his father Helmut Heinrich ‚Äî a German mathematician turned aircraft constructor ‚Äî had been taken after the Second World War to work. Having been educated as a theoretical physicist at Dresden University of Technology in East Germany, Reinhart conducted his postdoctoral research in the early 1970s at the Charit√©'s Institute of Biochemistry in East Berlin. He could not fail to notice the absence of mathematical theory from cell biology as compared with other natural sciences. Enzyme kinetics was a notable exception. However, how enzymes affect the flux through a metabolic pathway was still discussed using the rather vague term rate-limiting step. Working with Tom Rapoport on mathematical models of glycolysis in red blood cells, Reinhart discovered a precise and general definition of rate limitation in metabolic pathways, for which he received in 1974 the Humboldt Prize. He extended his knowledge in this area, working over one year in Pushchino with Evgeni Selkov, who also worked on mathematical modelling of metabolic processes. The parallel development of metabolic control theory by Henrik Kacser and Jim Burns in Edinburgh shows that the time was ripe for a quantitative understanding of metabolic regulation. Instead of postulating a single rate-limiting step, these theories evaluated the degree of flux control exerted by an individual enzyme in a linear pathway or in a more complex network. The corresponding measure, now called the flux control coefficient by general agreement, turned out to be a truly systemic quantity, depending not only on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme itself but also on those of other enzymes, as well as on the position of the reaction in the network. After a slow start metabolic control theory has become more widely known by biochemists. Control coefficients have been measured for many pathways, confirming the theoretical prediction that flux control is frequently shared by several reactions. This finding has become of practical importance for the genetic engineering of large metabolic networks in biotechnology. The dual approach ‚Äî modelling concrete cellular processes and, at the same time, searching for general laws ‚Äî has been a characteristic of Reinhart's work. The areas he worked in were amazingly diverse, including metabolic control, osmoregulation, cell shapes, signal transduction, vesicular transport, protein translation and transport, as well as the population dynamics of malaria parasites. Perhaps the questions that interested him the most were those of evolution. To understand the kinetic design of enzymes and enzymatic reaction networks, Reinhart strove to rationalize, in mathematical terms, the selective pressures and physico‚Äìchemical constraints that these systems were subjected to. Reinhart's work on this topic is full of original insight and makes specific predictions, some of which have begun to be tested successfully in recent years. Reinhart was author of more than 160 research articles and, together with Stefan Schuster, the book The Regulation of Cellular Systems, which has become a classic of cell systems biology. In addition to this large body of original work, he was a gifted mentor of young scientists and for more than ten years ran the highly successful interdisciplinary graduate program Dynamics and Evolution of Cellular Processes at Humboldt University, Berlin. In 1996 he received an Honorary degree from the University of Bordeaux. References *H√∂fer T (2007) In Remembrance: Reinhart Heinrich 1946‚Äì2006.

It is located in the eastern part of the country, mostly in the Guant√°namo Province and reaching to the north into the Holgu√≠n Province. Most of the reserve is established in the drainage area of the Toa River, which flows for to the Atlantic Ocean in Baracoa. Overview The reserve extends along , of which to the marine area. Cuchillas del Toa is considered as one of the principal centers of biodiversity and endemism in Cuba and the insular Caribbean with pine forests, cloud forests and xeric scrub to complex coastal vegetation with mangroves and coral reefs. The karstic system of the great cave of Moa Head lands is one of the five natural monuments in the country and one of the great cave systems in eastern Cuba. With high biodiversity in flora and fauna, there are 928 endemic species reported, including primitive species belonging to the genera Podocarpus and Dracaena. Cuchillas del Toa is home to the highly endangered Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis bairdii), Cuban kite (Chondrohierax wilsoni), and the Cuban solenodon (Solenodon cubanus). Some of the world‚Äôs smallest mammal species are found in the reserve. About 18,300 inhabitants (2002), in 498 communities, live in the buffer zone and transition area of this mountainous reserve. Engaged in forestry, traditional agriculture (coffee, coconut, and cacao) and ecotourism, they also raise cattle and participate in nickel, chromium, iron and cobalt mining. These activities had increased negative impacts in the carrying capacity of the ecosystems, one of the main problems the reserve faces today. Another interesting aspect of this biosphere reserve is its history as battlefield for freedom. In the 18th and 19th centuries, escaped African slaves called Cimmarones found refuge in the region. It is twinned with the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico, due to similar environmental conditions and resource management. The reserve protects tropical wet forest and coastal/marine ecosystems. It surrounds the Alejandro de Humboldt National Park and also contains El Yunque table mountain, the Infierno Creek with a waterfall, the Great Cave of Moa (Gran Caverna de Moa) and the Bay of Taco, north of Baracoa. Conservation The reserve was classified as IUCN Managed Resource Protected Area. It has a total area of , and its core area, the Alejandro de Humboldt National Park, is sub-divided into 4 areas, called Cupeyal del Norte, Ojito de Agua, la Melba and Baracoa. Cuchillas del Toa was listed as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1987. The reserve protects species such as the Cuban solenodon (Solenodon cubanus, almiqu√≠), Cuban trogon (Priotelus temnurus, Cuba's national bird), Gundlach's hawk (Accipiter gundlachi) and Cuban green woodpecker (Xiphidiopicus percussus), some endangered. =Protected areas= The different areas of the reserve have various uses, and are further divided into other protected areas, such as the proposed Ecological Reserve Quivijan-Duaba- Yunque de Baracoa and the Flora Managed Reserve of Pico Galan (Galan Peak) See also *Toa River *Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa References Category:Biosphere reserves of Cuba Category:Mountains of Cuba Category:Geography of Guant√°namo Province Category:Protected areas established in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in Cuba ","title":"Cuchillas del Toa"},{"id":"13678422","text":"Broxburn United Football Club was a football club based at Sports Park in Broxburn, West Lothian in Scotland.D.

The club was the more senior of the town's two teams and first came to attention as members of the Eastern League in 1891‚Äì92. The club went on to appear in many of the top competitions below the Scottish Football League in subsequent seasons, appearing in the Central Football Combination, the Scottish Football Alliance, the Scottish Football Union and the Central Football League. Broxburn Athletic joined the Eastern Football League in 1905‚Äì06 and the Central Football League 1909‚Äì10. Broxburn United emerged in 1912 when it became clear that a small town like Broxburn could not support two senior sides. United became members of the Central Football League (apart from a spell in the Eastern Football League from 1915 to 1917) and along with much of the membership of this group they were admitted to the newly expanded Scottish Football League Second Division in 1921. It appeared to be unrealistic for a town of just 3,000 people to sustain a league club, and although the club's first match in the SFL attracted a crowd of 3,500, Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888‚Äì2005, Yore Publications, p220 an economic downturn meant that too many clubs were trying to attract too few spectators. Broxburn were censured in 1922 for fielding only two first team players in a league match against St Bernard's. Stenhousemuir player Joe Shortt reported to the League that he had been offered ¬£50 by the representatives of a bookmaker from Glasgow to play poorly in a match against Broxburn United. The club struggled in the League and finished bottom in the 1925‚Äì26 season. Facing re-election, they were rejected in favour of Forfar Athletic and dropped out of the League. Broxburn United joined the Scottish Football Alliance for the 1926‚Äì27 season, but found this level to be too financially taxing and soon joined the ranks of Scottish junior football by joining the Midlothian Junior League. The club continued until 1932 when financial troubles finally claimed them. Colours *1912‚Äì1920: Black & white striped shirts, white shorts. *1920‚Äì1932: Maroon shirts, white shorts.

The district is bisected by the A217 and bordered by the River Wandle.http://hidden-london.com/gazetteer/summerstown/ History Evidence of settlement in the area of Summerstown first appears in the late Middle Ages, when the River Wandle was bordered by mills in this area, worked by villagers from the nearby hamlet of Garratt (which gives its name to 'Garratt Lane', the local stretch of the A217).http://hidden- london.com/gazetteer/summerstown/ By 1631, ‚ÄòDutchmen‚Äô are recorded as manufacturing kettles and frying pans here, while other Huguenot refugees are thought to have engaged in silk weaving and wig making here.http://hidden- london.com/gazetteer/summerstown/ By the mid-nineteenth century, this area was becoming increasingly populated, with many of the present day properties being built in the area at this time, notably the St Clement Danes almshouses in 1848‚Äì9, which have now become council housing.http://hidden- london.com/gazetteer/summerstown/ The nineteenth century also saw the construction of Summerstown‚Äôs parish church, with a chapel being built in 1836, and extended in 1861 and 1870. By 1903, it was apparent that a yet larger church was needed, so the present day St Mary's Church was constructed just off Garratt Lane, where it remains little altered to this day. The early twentieth century was a turbulent time for the parish, with the Great War costing the lives of 182 men in the parish, who were memorialised by Summerstown's war memorial, which is located just inside St Mary's Church. In the Second World War, Summerstown was also affected by bombing, particularly in 1944, when a V2 rocket struck Hazelhurst Road, killing 35 and injuring over a hundred. After the war, this presented the council with the opportunity to construct the Hazelhurst estate in 1969‚Äì73. Present Day The parish church, St Mary's Church, is still open and active in the parish, hosting a service at 10:30 each Sunday morning, and holds a range of services include singing, prayers and a talks from the Bible as well as activities for children. It is home to the By The Horns Brewing Co. The area was also home to Wimbledon Stadium, a dog racing track that also hosted speedway, stock car and other racing events, which closed in 2017.

During the Third Anglo-Dutch War she served as a flagship of the Lord High Admiral the Duke of York (later James II & VII.) During the Battle of Solebay (1672) she was in the centre of the English fleet that was attacked by the Dutch centre led by Admiral Michiel de Ruyter. Prince was heavily damaged by De Ruyter's flagship De Zeven Provinci√´n in a two hours' duel and Captain of the Fleet Sir John Cox was killed on board. The Duke of York was forced to shift his flag to . Princes second captain, John Narborough, however conducted himself with such conspicuous valour that he won special approbation and was knighted shortly afterwards. HMS Prince was rebuilt by Robert Lee at Chatham Dockyard in 1692, and renamed at the same time as HMS Royal William. During the War of the Grand Alliance the ship saw action at the Battle of Barfleur of 19 May 1692. Prince belonged to the red squadron and carried the flag of Rear-admiral of the red Sir Cloudesley Shovell. She was the first ship to break the French line during the battle. Later she was rebuilt for a second time by John Naish at Portsmouth Dockyard from 1714, relaunching on 3 September 1719. She was laid up after her re-launch and saw no service at all until she was reduced to an 84-gun Second rate ship in 1756. One year later, she was part of an unsuccessful expedition against Rochefort led by Admiral Sir Edward Hawke. Her squadron, under Vice- Admiral Charles Knowles, attacked the √éle-d'Aix and forced her garrison to surrender. In 1758 she participated in Boscawen's and Wolfe's attack on the French Fortress of Louisbourg (Nova Scotia) and an indecisive skirmish with a French squadron. The following year Royal William returned to Canada under the command of Captain Hugh Pigot to join the attack on Quebec. After the Battle of the Plains of Abraham and the capture of Quebec she sailed back to England with the body of General Wolfe. In 1760 Royal William was Boscawen's flagship when he took command of the fleet in Quiberon Bay. However, after a severe gale he was forced to return and shift his flag to . During the expedition against Belle √éle of 1761 she was detached with several other ships to cruise off Brest and prevent a French counter-attack from there.

Grafisk) Legion of the Damned (original Danish title: Ford√∏mtes Legion) is the first in a series of fourteen World War II novels by Danish-born author Sven Hassel. The book covers a chronological period of a number of years, starting with the protagonist's arrest and time in German concentration camps, and ending with his being an officer and company commander on the Russian front. All of Sven Hassel's subsequent war stories, from a chronological point of view, fill in details omitted by this book. Published in 1953, the book provides an account of life as a German soldier on the Eastern Front during World War II. The book opens with the author being tried and convicted as a deserter, and as a result being sent to a concentration camp. He spends a number of months in camps, particularly at Gross Rosen and Lenggries, where he is involved in bomb disposal and also witnesses a number of atrocities committed by the SS guards, before abruptly being \\"pardoned\\" and dispatched to a penal combat unit. There, the author meets comrades Old Man or Old Un (real name Willy Beier),prankster Joseph Porta,the massive Pluto (real name Gustav Eicken), their highly abusive commander Meier, which they later take revenge on,and student Hugo Stege. Legion of the Damned won critical acclaim across Europe and the United States and was translated into 15 languages.

Communication enablement adds real-time networking functionality to an IT application. Providing communications capability to an IT application: * removes the human latency which exists when (i) making sense of information from many different sources, (ii) orchestrating suitable responses to events, and (iii) keeping track of actions carried out when responding to information received; * enables users to be part of the creative flow of content and processes. What distinguishes a CEA from other software applications is its intrinsic reliance upon communications technologies to accomplish its objectives. A CEA depends on real-time networking capabilities together with such network oriented functions as location, presence, proximity, and identity. Another distinguishing characteristic of a CEA is the implicit assumption that network services will be available as callable services within the SOA frameworks from which the CEA is constructed. To provide callable services, the network services which are available today must be made virtual and component-like. CEAs apply to business processes as well as instances where no obvious business process which requires improvement exists (e.g., games, entertainment video). CEAs that apply to business processes are referred to as communications enabled business processes or communications enabled business solutions. Importance CEA are important for at least four reasons: # The convergence of (i) CEA, (ii) broadband and (iii) millions of different devices connected to the network is expected to significantly affect the communications industry. # CEA introduce a fundamental change in the way that information communications technology (ICT) applications and services are designed, developed, delivered, and used. To date, SOA has focused on building IT applications only and the network has been mostly deemed to be a transport pipe. CEA incorporate communications capability into any application. This requires that network services must be made virtual and component-like as well as callable within a SOA framework. CEA implementation entails a significant reorganization of present network management functionality. # CEA bring together the richness of IT applications with the sophistication and intelligence of communications networks. This enables greater customization, greater simplification of interactions, and automatic adaptation to users' environments and preferences. # Making network components from multiple vendors work in a mashup will be a major challenge. The service level agreements (SLAs) for these mashups will be difficult to define and deliver upon. Examples * A tech savvy entrepreneur can integrate highly secure services such as messaging, voice, conference call, authentication and inbound short message service into an IT application for the purpose of delivering a customized solution in hours or days at a fraction of the cost of large packaged applications or custom development projects. * A patient is discharged more quickly because the patient care application used by authorizing medical personnel can reach out to the discharge application, wherever they are. * A new policy is processed and approved more quickly because the client‚Äôs insurance agent initiates real-time communications with people who have reviewed the policy and are required to approve it. * Faster and more effective emergency response is provided because the first responder application recognized the availability and location of key resources. * An industrial customer problem is resolved more quickly because the project management application scheduled the earliest possible conference call with all key available stakeholders and delivered all relevant information to them. * A data center backup package that runs overnight must be complete by 8 a.m. when the network turns back to daytime operations. The application recognizes that it will not complete in time - so it makes a request of the network for more capacity. The network can apply logic to translate the request into a set of commands to the various nodes to do whatever is required for the task to be completed by 8 a.m. (e.g., change the priority, provision more capacity, allocate more wavelengths).

He is often referred to as Major, but he attained the rank of Colonel in the closing days of the war. Early life William Norris was born December 6, 1820 in Baltimore County, Maryland. He graduated from Yale College in 1840 at the age of nineteen and went to New Orleans to practice law. He headed to California during the 1849 Gold Rush. After his arrival he was appointed Judge Advocate to the United States Pacific Squadron.Tidwell, W. A., Hall, J. O., & Gaddy, D. W. (1988). Come retribution. He sailed to Valpara√≠so, Chile in 1851 and on March 13, 1851, he married Ellen Lyles Hobson of Baltimore, a daughter of a former United States consul. After the wedding, Norris returned with his bride to the family estate, Brookland, near Reisterstown, northwest of Baltimore. He and his wife had a son, named Richard, in 1852. In 1858, he became the president of the Baltimore Mechanical Bakery, an ultramodern establishment on South Howard near Pratt Street. Civil War In the winter of 1860-61 pro-Confederate sentiment was strong in Baltimore. On the 18th and 19 April 1861, the Pratt Street Riot took place in Baltimore. Norris made no secret of his southern sympathies and with the outbreak of war he and his family left for Virginia. There he volunteered as a civilian aide on the staff of Brigadier General John Bankhead Magruder. After Magruder sent Norris to learn signals in Norfolk under Captain Milligan, Milligan gave Norris a book of his system of signals and On July 18. 1861, Magruder gave Norris authority to establish a system of signals on the Peninsula and across the James River. Norris set up a network which employed flags and colored balls raised on poles. Due to his efforts on the signal system Norris was commissioned as a captain. Norris also commanded the Secret Service Bureau, a unit within the Signal Corps. The Secret Service Bureau oversaw a communications network whose missions included the running of agents to and from Union territory and the forwarding of messages from Confederate officials in Richmond to contacts in Canada and Europe.United States(2005)Intelligence in the Civil War. William Norris finally achieved the rank of colonel on April 26, 1865 and became the Commissioner of Exchange (of prisoners of war) replacing Colonel Robert Ould. Within a week Norris was in Union hands. Norris was held in detention in Richmond but eventually cleared of charge. On June 30, 1865 Norris swore allegiance to the United States. After the war Norris and his family returned to Brookline near Reisterstown. After the war Norris considered going to Chile to set up a signal corps for the military there. In 1866 Norris wrote a letter to the lawyer defending John H. Surratt from complicity in the Lincoln assassination. Norris absolved Surratt of any involvement and offered to testify in his behalf. In 1874 his eyewitness account of the USS Monitor and CSS Virginia battle was published in the Southern Magazine.

The cemetery has the largest cluster of khachkars in Armenia. It is currently the largest surviving cemetery with khachkars following the destruction of the khachkars in Old Julfa, Nakhichevan by the government of Azerbaijan.European Parliament On Destruction of Cultural Heritage Khachkars An ensemble of khachkars. The oldest khachkars in the cemetery date back to the late 10th century. During the revival of the khachkar tradition in the 16-17th centuries many khachkars were built under the yoke of the Safavid Empire when oriental influences seeped into Armenian art. Three master carvers from this period carved khachkars in Noraduz, the most notable of whom was Kiram Kazmogh (1551-1610), his contemporaries were Arakel and Meliset. The cemetery is spread over a seven hectare field containing almost a thousand khachkars each of them depicting unique ornamentation. The majority of the khachkars are covered by moss and lichen. Several tombstones in the cemetery depict carved scenes of weddings and farm life. Adjacent to the old cemetery a new modern cemetery has been built separated by a long fence. Nearby the cemetery in the village there is the Holy Virgin church built in the ninth century. One of the khachkars from the cemetery was donated to the British Museum in 1977 by Catholicos Vazgen I.*British Museum Collection The front face of the rectangular khachkar has a leaved-cross with two smaller crosses below that are framed with trefoil and bunches of grapes projecting from either side. An inscription on the left side seeks God's mercy for a certain Aputayli. Folklore Noratus khachkars A popular folktale associated with the cemetery concerns the invading army of Tamerlane. According to one story the villagers placed helmets on top of the khachkars and leaned swords against them. From a distance the khachkars looked like armed soldiers holding a defensive position as a result of which Tamerlane‚Äôs army retreated. In another popular story, the 19th-century monk named Ter Karapet Hovhanesi-Hovakimyan, from a monastery near the village, conducted burial services at Noraduz; in order to avoid the two-hour round trip from the cemetery to the monastery he built himself a small cell in Noraduz. When he was 90 years old, he asked his brother monks to bury him alive. His last words were: \\"I do not fear death. I would like you to not be afraid also. Never fear anything, but God alone. Let anyone who has fear come to me. Pour water at the burial stone, drink the water, wash your face, chest, arms and legs. Then break the vessel that contained the water. Fear will then abandon you.\\" To this day people come to the monk's grave to perform this ritual, leaving broken pieces of glass scattered all about.

Between 2003 and 2006, the senior writer at GayNZ.com was Christopher Banks. His feature articles focused mainly on social and political issues relevant to the gay community, or debunking religious arguments against homosexuality. Some articles were based around in- depth interviews with political or religious leaders. Banks' writings for GayNZ.com also included a number of film reviews, two of which caused some upset in the conservative Christian community. His review of the controversial 2002 French film Irr√©versible was cited by the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards in their attempts to have the film banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand). His positive review of Kinsey, the 2004 biopic of the American sex researcher, drew the ire of Investigate magazine editor Ian Wishart, prompting a further series of articles by Banks on Alfred Kinsey. = Son of MP's homophobic internet page = In September 2007, GayNZ.com published an article accusing the teenage son of National Party deputy leader Bill English of posting homophobic abuse on social networking site Bebo. GayNZ.com had unsuccessfully sought comment from English before publishing the story. After the story's publication, National leader John Key criticised the website for dragging a politician's son into public debate, and English sought legal advice about the article.

Racing career  Pine Island, unraced as a two-year-old quickly displayed her promise by winning her first career start, a maiden special weight race on the turf at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Florida, in February 2006. Rested for almost three months after her triumphant debut, Pine Island returned to the racetrack in May, this time winning an allowance race on the main track at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. After two strong second-place finishes in the Grade 1 Mother Goose Stakes and Coaching Club American Oaks, both at Belmont, Pine Island notched her first major score in August by winning the Grade 1 Alabama Stakes at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York. She followed up this success with a win in the Grade 1 Gazelle Stakes at Belmont in September.  Death  Pine Island's promising career and ultimately her life came to an end on November 4, 2006 when she broke down on the backstretch during the running of the Breeders' Cup Distaff which was held at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky that year. It was discovered that she had dislocated her left front ankle so severely that there would be virtually no chance of her survival. Dr. Wayne McIlwraith, a track veterinarian at Churchill Downs who examined her said that there were likely multiple fractures and soft tissue injuries as well. Due to the decreased blood supply and the risk of contamination from the open wound caused by the injury, she was humanely euthanized after being vanned off the racetrack.  Legacy  Pine Island was buried on November 13 in a private ceremony at Claiborne Farm's Marchmont Cemetery. Claude R. \\"Shug\\" McGaughey III, who trained Pine Island for the Phipps Stable, was quoted as saying: \\"She was a pleasure to be around because she liked doing it, and she made very few mistakes around the barn.\\" Gus Koch, the Farm Manager of Claiborne, said: \\"It was a sad, sad day. It was sad for the Phippses and all of us at Claiborne. We foaled her and weaned her and raised her as a yearling. She was a lovely individual to be around and very nice to get along with. It's just a tragic loss.\\" Pine Island's grave is located right next to 1998 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, Banshee Breeze. Others who share the same cemetery space as her include the Phipps's racing superstar Easy Goer.

Le Guin, first published in 1974. It is considered a short story prologue to The Dispossessed and represents an idealized anarchy by following the character of \\"Odo\\", the semi-legendary woman who led the revolution that founded the anarchist society in The Dispossessed.Spivack, Charlotte, Ursula K. Le Guin, (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984), page 74.  Plot summary The story follows Laia Asieo Odo through a day of her life. In The Dispossessed, she is usually referred to as the historical figure \\"Odo\\", but in this story, told from her point of view, she is called Laia. Laia is the woman who developed an anarchist philosophy that inspired the revolution that founded the anarchist society of Anarres in the novel The Dispossessed, which is set several generations after the events in this story. At the time of the story Laia is an elderly woman who has already had a major stroke. Her husband is long dead, her days as a political prisoner are in the past and her major anarchist treatises were written many years ago. She lives in the nation of A-Io on Urras in an \\"Odonian House\\", a building or commune in which her anarchist principles are followed and she acts as a focal point and inspiration for revolutionary action. The day is strongly implied to be both the day before the General Strike which becomes a revolution and results in the settlement of the barren moon Anarres by Laia's followers, and also the last day of Laia's own life. The experience of aging, death, grief and sexuality in older age are themes explored in the short story that were largely absent from The Dispossessed, which has a younger protagonist.Spivack, Charlotte, Ursula K. Le Guin, (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984), page 159. During the day Laia both re-affirms her commitment to anarchism and to \\"her people\\" (the urban poor and dispossessed), and is distanced from them by her partial foreknowledge of her impending death. There are also echoes of some themes in The Dispossessed. In particular the temptations of convention and authority have already appeared; Laia recognizes that some of the status and honor she is accorded by her fellow anarchists is not in keeping with her principles or theirs. In her discussion of the story in The Wind's Twelve Quarters, Le Guin refers to Laia as one of the ones who walk away from OmelasUrsula K. Le Guin (1975). The Wind's Twelve Quarters. New York: Harper & Row, p. 285.--a reference to Le Guin's short story of an apparent utopia that rests on torture and misery.  Publication  The story was first published in Galaxy in 1974, and collected in Le Guin's short fiction collection The Wind's Twelve Quarters in 1975. It has been anthologized and reprinted many times, including in Nebula Award Stories 10 (1975) and in the second volume of Pamela Sargent's Women of Wonder series, More Women of Wonder (1975). \\"The Day Before the Revolution\\" won the Nebula Award for short story in 1974, the Locus Award for short story in 1975, and was nominated for the short story Hugo Award in 1975.

It is the second anthology in the 1632 series following after Ring of Fire (2004).  Premise of the series  The initial Ring of Fire book was a notable departure in that it heralded a new era in writing series fiction by being set in an authors' milieu shared with other writers, but especially and uncharacteristically by doing so without the control of the milieu creator, its author. Flint, in explanation, has self-styled himself as something of a gambler; he demonstrated that by deliberately asking the other writers to share in creating the main threads and plot lines of the milieu so that this work and the large second full novel in the series, 1633, were written contemporaneously. Flint is on record that large portions of 1633 were adjusted drastically, even thrown out and rewritten as later submissions in the collected stories in Ring of Fire impacted the various and diverse story threads. For a fuller precis on this interesting and historic literary development see Assiti Shards series.  Stories in the anthology  = \\"City of the Dead\\" = : by Jay Robison = \\"Noelle Comes Home\\" = : by Virginia DeMarce Flint's e-book preface refers to this work as being a prequel to his own short novel (below), but the title does not agree with the credited work on 1632.org's timeframes spreadsheet. = \\"Horse Thieves\\" = : by Karen Bergstralh The story focus on four former mercenaries who worked for Count Tilly before being exempted on good behavior and becoming horse traders in Grantville. While returning to Grantville following a horse trade in France, the traders encounter a foreign mercenary army contingent preparing to attack Grantville's allied city, Badenburg. They also observe that the mercenaries are equipped with American Civil War era equipment and doctrines that they had somehow acquired from modern history books. The traders - with help from the American militia - make several skirmishes against the army before finally eliminating them. = \\"Second Issue?\\" = : by Eric Flint and Bradley H. Sinor A story by Bradley H. Sinor about the birth of tabloid journalism in Grantville. The plot structure begins with a suggestion that it might be a tale of investigative journalism, but it ends with a humorous twist. There are tight connections between this story and \\"The Wallenstein Gambit\\" = \\"Diving Belle\\" = : by Gunnar Dahlin and Dave Freer A story by Gunnar Dahlin and Dave Freer about an attempt to raise the Vasa from its resting place in Stockholm harbor. Or, is it an elaborate fraud? = \\"A Gift from the Duchess\\" = : by Virginia DeMarce = \\"Lucky at Cards\\" = : by Andrew Dennis = \\"A Trip to Amsterdam\\" = : by Gorg Huff and Paula Goodlett This vignette by Gorg Huff and Paula Goodlett returns to the story of the two groups maturing of tycoons known respectively as the Sewing Circle and the Barbie Consortium introduced initially in \\"The Sewing Circle\\", continued again in \\"Other People‚Äôs Money\\", and other seminal background tales. = \\"This'll Be the Day...\\" = : by Walt Boyes The story recounts the deeds of Father Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld on the day of his former death. = \\"Command Performance\\" = : by David Carrico This continuation of the \\"Franz and Marla\\" stories by David Carrico, ties in with a brief mention of the story behind and within the concert as told here. The same tale, from a different prospective was used as background for the entrance of Admiral John Simpson and wife Mary as they come on stage during the end of the industrial disaster that begins the novel 1634: The Baltic War. As a continuation and perhaps climax of the Franz and Marla saga, the tale reveals Marla in a triumphal debut among the rich and famous in Magdeburg, while the lovable and tragic Franz finds a new musical groove‚Äîand is able to play again publicly ‚Äî while, finally, proving worthy in his own eyes of \\"getting the girl\\". Like the preceding Franz and Marla stories, it is an excellent tale told with skill and is good at evoking emotions and painting complex characters undergoing lives' pressures. = \\"Ellis Island\\" = : by Russ Rittgers The story recounts the tribulations of a peasant family immigrating to Grantville. = \\"Malungu Seed\\" = : by Jonathan Cresswell The story focus on an African Jesuit layman who has an urgent mission in Grantville and elsewhere. = \\"Trials\\" = : by Jay Robison The story focus on the trials of Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi and a Grantville housewife. = \\"The Chase\\" = : by Iver Cooper This story is a sequel to \\"Grand Tour,\\" which appeared in Grantville Gazette X, in which historical figures Thomas Hobbes and a young William Cavendish (the Earl of Devonshire) have arrived in their destination in Grantville and befriending several of the young ladies of the \\"Barbie Consortium.\\" There is a scene set at a down-time tennis court, and it's worth noting that Iver also wrote an article on down-time tennis (\\"Tennis: The Game of Kings\\") which appeared in Grantville Gazette XV. = \\"Eddie and the King's Daughter\\" = : by K.D. Wentworth Set as a prequel to 1634: The Baltic War, the story focus on Eddie Cantrell, who was captured by the Danish in the confused aftermath the Battle of Wismar depicted in 1633, became involved with the daughter of Christian IV of Denmark. = \\"Second Thoughts\\" = : by Virginia DeMarce The story discloses the events leading to marriage between the parents of Noelle Brigitte Murphy. = \\"The Austro- Hungarian Connection\\" = : by Eric Flint This short novel by Flint features a return to the enigmatic secret agent, Noelle Murphy, introduced in 1634: The Ram Rebellion who considered becoming a Catholic Nun (see \\"Enter the Ram\\"). Literary significance and reception A reviewer for SFRevu wrote that he liked the book because \\"the characters are allowed to be flawed. They often are given the chance for redemption, but don't always take it.\\" Another reviewer wrote that \\"this anthology has a sort of crazy-quilt feel at times\\" since \\"the stories connect to one another and to the other anthologies and novels in various complex ways, reinforcing one another by casting light on aspects of characters and events that might otherwise be ignored.\\" However, \\"the gems in this anthology outweigh the few weak ones\\" and \\"heartily recommend the purchase\\". The reviewer also recommends re-reading the other novels and anthologies of the series to \\"really appreciate all the interconnections between the various storylines\\". Ring of Fire II was listed on the Locus (magazine) Hardcovers Bestsellers List for single month during 2008 at number 6.

Plot During the Civil War, Cal Wayne accidentally kills a fellow Confederate soldier who was also a long-time friend. After the war, Wayne returns to his hometown of Abilene, Kansas where he discovers his sweetheart, Amy - who thought he was dead - about to marry cattle baron Grant Evers, the brother of the man Wayne killed. To try to assuage his guilt, Wayne refuses to try to win Amy back. A feud is ongoing between local cattlemen and farmers. Evers takes it upon himself to exact harsh justice against anyone, with or without proof, who crosses him and his growing business. Reluctantly, but at Evers' behest, Wayne replaces the corrupt sheriff, Joe Slade.

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 22 October 2007. He was introduced as the serial's first emo character and as the foster son of Jack (Jimmy McKenna) and Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson). During the character's duration he was involved in notable storylines including schizophrenia, a suicide pact and living in foster care. In 2010, Mirallegro quit the serial to pursue other projects. Newt left the village on 25 June 2010. Character creation and casting Newt has been noted as the first \\"emo\\" character for Hollyoaks and has been shown to follow certain emo characteristics, such as a reluctance to communicate with those around him. Producer Bryan Kirkwood stated: \\"He's a little belter who after a couple of years in the background will hopefully prove to be a really big character.\\" Actor Nico Mirallegro was cast into the role. In March 2010 it was announced that Mirallegro would be leaving the serial after almost three years to pursue other projects, although his departure was included in the list of 11 other departees that new series producer Paul Marquess had axed. Character development =Characterisation= Newt takes on the characteristics of an angry young \\"emo\\" character Of his appearance Newt differs from Mirallegro because he has to wear a wig and fake piercings. Mirallegro explained the look has its set backs commenting: \\"The wig as it‚Äôs very hot and annoying and itchy!\\" The serial's official website describe him as a \\"kind-hearted emo\\" and also \\"loyal to his friends\\". =Schizophrenia= One of Newt's key storylines has been the portrayal of schizophrenia, which started in 2008. Mirallegro carried out intensive research for the role including watching the films such as Sybil, Fight Club, Secret Window and A Beautiful Mind. He also read a series of books focusing on the illness. The storyliners who pitched the story worked with called a charity Rethink, the UK's leading mental health charity, Mirallegro also took advice from them. In an interview with lastbroadcast.co.uk, Mirallegro revealed he was completely comfortable with the storyline stating: \\"I‚Äôm liking the direction a lot. It‚Äôs been great to play Newt, great from an actor‚Äôs point of view to play such challenging role and also to highlight such an important issue too.\\" Mirallegro also revealed that it was to be a long storyline-arc confirming: \\"Unfortunately his diagnosis is just the beginning of Newt‚Äôs problems.\\" =Suicide pact= In July 2009, at the Hollyoaks press day, series producer Lucy Allan announced that there would be a 'big stunt' involving Newt in October the same year. In September 2009, it was announced that a new character, Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) would join the serial as part of a \\"shock suicide plot\\" involving Newt, which would see the two characters jump off a bridge. Behind the scenes filming took place at Stanley Dock in Liverpool where they had to act out the stunts. Allan praised Barlow and Mirallegro for their willingness to perform their own stunts, during an interview with Liverpool Daily Post she stated: \\"The team did a brilliant job at constructing a 45ft tower at Stanley Dock for the main stunt. We had stunt doubles there if the actors felt they did not want to do it. But they are a tenacious bunch and they wanted to do it all themselves. She also added: \\"They even stayed underwater for three or four minutes for the big underwater sequence.\\" The storyline came into the spotlight just days before the suicide scenes were due to air, after two young girls in Scotland jumped from the Erskine Bridge into the River Clyde, subsequently dying in their suicide pact. The serial's broadcaster decided to go ahead and air the scenes citing that any similarities were entirely coincidental and they had carefully thought out the decision. Also adding: \\"The audience will be familiar with the character of Newt and this plotline, which has been both trailed and promoted, has been developing over a number of weeks. Hollyoaks has a strong track record of dealing with sensitive issues, and the transmission will be followed by a programme support announcement directing viewers to a 24-hour helpline.\\" The real-life care home in which the two girls were housed issued a statement criticising the broadcaster for airing the scenes stating: \\"The decision to air this show is likely to cause further distress.\\" Whilst interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy, producer Allan admitted the suicide scenes were her overall favourite from 2009, commenting: \\"My favourite scene of the year has to be the underwater sequence with Newt, Rae, Eli and Jack the hero! It was a beautiful moment on screen and it was the moment that the audience realised that Newt was trying to kill himself. For me, that moment of realisation made that scene so powerful.\\" Storylines =Backstory= Newt was born to his mother Shelly Newton (Beverly Denim), a drug addict. Shelly continued to look after Newt alone until he was three, where social services took him into care. Shelly disappeared and did not visit Newt. Growing up in care, Newt made friends with Eli (Marc Silcock), who was older than he was and looked out for him. When Eli was twelve and Newt was eight, he committed suicide by hanging.

(2013) Oosorption and migratory strategy of the milkweed bug,Oncopeltus fasciatus. Animal Behaviour 86(3):651-657. It is distributed throughout North America. It ranges from Central America through Mexico and the Caribbean to southern areas in Canada. Costa Rica represents this insect's southern limit.Baldiwn, D.J., Dingle, H. (1986) Geographic variation in the effects of temperature on life history traits in the large milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus. Oecologia 69(1): 64-71. It inhabits disturbed areas, roadsides and open pastures.Dingle, H., Palmer, J.O., Leslie, J.F. (1986) Behaviour genetics of flexible life histories in milkweed bugs (Onceopeltus fasciatus). Evolutionary Genetics of Invertebrate Behavior. New York: Plenum Press. Due to this widespread geographic distribution, this insect exhibits varying life history trade-offs depending on the population location, including differences in wing length and other traits based on location.  Identification  Adults can range from 10‚Äì18 mm in length and have a red/orange and black X-shaped pattern on their wings underneath the triangle that is typical to hemipterans.Liu,P., Kaufman, T.C. (2009) Morphology and husbandry of the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. Animal Behaviour 86(3): 651-657. This feature makes the bug easily seen, acting as an aposematic warning to predators of distastefulness. O. fasciatus exhibits M√ºllerian mimicry and is noxious to predators. The ventral side of the fourth abdominal segment bears a black band in the male and two black spots in the female. Juveniles are born mostly red with black antennae and a few black spots, throughout growth the black spots are developed as well as wing pads. Eggs of this insect are bright orange and easily detectable.  Life cycle  Exuviae from a molt may seem like ghost insects. Russell R. Kirt Prairie, Illinois This large milkweed bug is a hemimetabolous insect, meaning it grows in stages called instars and goes through incomplete metamorphosis exhibiting small changes throughout development such as coloration changes, development of wings and genitalia. O. fasciatus begins as an egg and experiences four nymphal stages over 28‚Äì30 days before moulting to adulthood.Leslie, J.F., (1990) Geographical and genetic structure of life history variation in milkweed bugs (Hemiptera:Lygaeidae: Oncopeltus). Evolution 44(2):295-304. Females become sexually receptive within a few days of adulthood. Geographic location has a large effect on egg production rate and clutch size, although the intrinsic increase in reproduction depends on what the individual is acclimated to. For example, two close populations (60 km apart) residing on a sharp incline have differing optimal reproduction temperatures where the cooler (higher) adapted population is at 23 ¬∞C and the warmer (lower) population is adapted to 27 ¬∞C. Highest clutch size occurs in Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas populations at 30-50 eggs per clutch. Lowest clutch size was found in California at 25-30 eggs per clutch. Iowa and Maryland (northern populations) exhibited a clutch size in between the two extremes from 25-35 eggs per clutch. O. fasciatus In favourable conditions (tropics) reproduction occurs continuously all year round, in less-favourable conditions (temperate zones) reproduction occurs during the warmer months.Woodring, J., et al. (2007) Feeding, nutrient flow, and digestive enzyme release in the giant milkweed bug. Physiological Entomology 32:328-335. Reproducing when migrants arrive introduces gene flow between northern and southern populations, this provides an advantage to the mid-range populations (variable climates) because females then can ensure genetic variability. The milkweed bug can produce from one to three generations per year depending on climate and geographic location. O. fasciatus exhibits strong selection for survival and will halt reproduction as a trade-off if conditions are not ideal. Diapause occurs on short days and on cold days in temperate regions and occasionally occurs during dry season in tropical regions. Most populations of the milkweed bug overwinter; usually after migration to their overwintering sites due to environmental triggers such as temperature and photoperiod.Dingle, H., et al. (1980) Variation in photoperiodic response within and among species of milkweed bugs (Oncepeltus). Evolution 34(2): 356-370. However, photoperiod only predicts overwintering in areas where day length effects the maturation of milkweeds. Therefore, no overwintering occurs in tropical regions as it does not supply an adaptive advantage.  Migration  Adult O. fasciatus O. fasciatus can be separated into migrators and non-migrators. Palmer and DinglePalmer, J. O., Dingle, H. (1986) Direct and correlated responses to selection among life-history traits in milkweed bugs (Oncopeltus fasciatus). Evolution 40(4):767-777. showed that northern populations such as the one in Iowa show the greatest tendency for long distance flight and are highly migratory. Oppositely, southern populations such as those in Puerto Rico show the lowest tendency and are sedentary.Dingle, H., Evans,K.E., Palmer, J.O. (1988) Responses to selection among life-history traits in a nonmigratory population of milkweed bugs (Oncopeltus fasciatus). Evolution 42(1):79-92. South populations grow seasonally as migrants first appear in late spring and mid-summer.Dingle, H., et al. (1980) Variation in photoperiodic response within and among species of milkweed bugs (Oncepeltus). Evolution 34(2):356-370. A migratory syndrome has been described in the northern population, meaning that traits such as wing length, fecundity, developmental time and flight duration are all genetically correlated. Groeters and DingleGroeters, F.R., Dingle, H. (1987) Genetic and maternal influences on life history plasticity in response to photoperiod by milkweed bugs (Oncopeltus fasciatus). The American Naturalist 129(3): 3332-346. suggested that selection is specific to the populations environment due to the small correlations between life history strategies across geographic ranges. A trade-off between migration and life history traits may be the causation of such a wide geological distribution. AttisanoAttisano, A. (2013) Oosorption and migratory strategy of the milkweed bug,Oncopeltus fasciatus. Animal Behaviour 86(3):651-657. suggested that genetic factors as well as environmental cues trigger migration in some individuals. Since long duration flights decrease with decreasing latitude, temperature is a strong factor influencing the migration. Also, this movement correlates with flowering of milkweeds which provides further evidence that environmental triggers relate to migration. Larger females are thought to allocate resources to migration simply because they have more to spare. Smaller individuals are thought to deploy alternative mechanisms; one being the reabsorption of oocytes for energy. The fact that these insects return to northern environments after migration could be the influence of a genetic predisposition or selected for due to crowding and increased intraspecific competition for resources in the southern areas.Gonzalaz, M.S., et al. (2014) Effects of essential oil from leaves of eugenia sulcata on the development of agricultural pest insects. Brazilian Journal of Pharmacognosy 24(4):413-418. Tropical populations migrate shorter distances than temperate populations because spatial variation of their choice host is much greater, so it is advantageous to seek new plant congregations rather than tolerate the depletion of resources.  Diet  Asclepias syriaca Asclepias curassavica Oncopletus fasciatus is a specialist herbivore that frequently consumes common milkweed seeds, Asclepias syriaca Apocynaceae.Woodring, J., et al. (2007) Feeding, nutrient flow, and digestive enzyme release in the giant milkweed bug. Physiological Entomology 32(4):328-335. This bug also feeds on A. nivea, Sarcostemma clausa, Calotropis procera, and Nerium oleander. The southern populations often consume Asclepias curassavica, a tropical milkweed. When given sunflower seeds in a laboratory, this bug obtained 90% of their lipids, 50% of their protein and 20% of their carbohydrates, making it an efficient feeder. Toxic compounds in milkweeds are also sequestered, giving this insect its toxicity. Adults wander during the daytime in search of food since milkweeds live in patches that can vary in size and distance apart from one another. When a follicle is found, they inject saliva into it through their long rostrums, this pre-digests the seed and allows O. fasciatus to suck it up through their anterior pump and pharynx. Often there are multiple individuals feeding on one follicle, suggesting that a signal is released by feeding individuals that indicates a good food source. It has been shown that adults are more likely to find a food source when another adult is already feeding on it, further supporting the signaling concept. Occasionally, females are seen feeding on shedding exoskeletons from moulting individuals. Rarely, cannibalization is observed in laboratory settings.Dingle, H., Palmer, J.O., Leslie, J.F. (1986) Behaviour genetics of flexible life histories in milkweed bugs (Onceopeltus fasciatus). Evolutionary Genetics of Invertebrate Behavior. New York: Plenum Press. Juvenile O. fasciatus require the seed of milkweed plants for development and growth. Adults can survive on other types of seeds such as: sunflower, watermelon, almond and cashew, as shown in lab populations. Nymphs live in large groups of about 20 individuals on the plant. Juveniles have an advantageous discontinuous three-part gut that acts similarly to a crop, ventriculus and ileum however they are lacking definitive parts. During the final instar of development, oil accumulates to allow for more efficient absorption of nutrients as well as aid in osmoregulation.  Laboratory use  This insect is often used as a model organism and reared for laboratory experiments due to the insect being easy to rear and handle, short developmental time, few instars and a high fecundity.Liu, P., Kaufman, T.C. (2009) Morphology and husbandry of the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. Animal Behaviour 86(3): 651-657. The phylogenetic placement of O. fasciatus is ideal to use as an outgroup to make comparisons to more derived holometabolous insects, acting as a valuable organism for the study of evolutionary patterns.

The society membership comprises more than 8,000 scientists and engineers in over 70 countries worldwide who hold individual membership, as well as roughly 100 corporations and laboratories that hold corporate membership.  History  In November 1901, Charles John Reed set out on a mission to create a new society in order to more quickly and efficiently exchange information and ideas among those interested in electrochemistry. With the help of friend and professor Joseph W. Richards, the two men started what is the modern day Electrochemical Society. April 3 of 1902 marked the first meeting of the \\"American Electrochemical Society\\" at the Manufacturers' Club in Philadelphia. Co- founder Joseph W. Richards was named president ‚Äì a post which he kept until 1904, the year that marked the end of his two-year presidential term. After his term as president ended, Richards took on the post of secretary, which coincided with a decreasing membership and bankrupt treasury. Richards looked to the more business minded members in order to develop advertisements to stimulate both membership growth and the interests of members. In this period, the manufacturer Charles Ernest Acker, of the \\"Acker Process Company\\" in Niagara Falls, New York, became director of the society.John William Leonard (ed.), Who's Who in Finance, Banking and Insurance (New York, 1911), p. 508. With the end of the war, the year 1919 saw a return to more normal scientific concerns, such as the report of the Committee on the Algebraic Signs of the Electrode Potentials. Colin Fink was secretary from 1921 to 1947. During this period, Robert M. Burns became a force for positive change in the society. He was influential in establishing the \\"patron\\" grade of membership. This level of membership allowed companies to support the society directly rather than through advertising. Burns was among those who encouraged publication of the Corrosion Handbook ‚Äì the second in the series of the Electrochemical Society monographs. Burns also suggested a change in meeting and publication policies, of which authors now only had to submit abstracts of their papers.  Meetings  The society holds meetings in the spring and fall of each year.  Publications  ECS publishes peer-reviewed technical journals, proceedings, monographs, conference abstracts, and a quarterly news magazine. = Journals = The society has published several journals, starting in 1902. * Bulletin of the American Electrochemical Society * Bulletin of the Electrochemical Society * ECS Electrochemistry Letters * ECS Journal of Solid State Science and Technology * ECS Solid State Letters * ECS Transactions * Electrochemical Society Interface * Electrochemical Society Monograph Series * Electrochemical Society Proceedings Series * Electrochemical Technology * Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters * Interface * Journal of the Electrochemical Society * Transactions of the American Electrochemical Society * Transactions of the Electrochemical Society = Interface = The quarterly publication Interface provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and news within international scientific community at-large. = ECS Meetings Abstracts = Contains extended abstracts of the technical papers presented at the spring and fall meetings of ECS. = ECS Transactions = An online proceedings database of full-text content from ECS and ECS sponsored conferences. Open access Part of the society's mission is to disseminate research as widely as possible. Hence, the organization tries to expand the number of articles published as open access. Authors are offered the choice of publishing their articles as open access at the point of submitting their manuscript and if they are members, or are from an institution that subscribes to ECS Plus, article processing charges are waived. Awards The society recognizes members for outstanding technical achievement in electrochemical and solid-state science and technology with a number of different awards. ECS's most prestigious award, the Edward Goodrich Acheson Award, established in 1928, is presented in even-numbered years for \\"conspicuous contribution to the advancement of the objectives, purposes, and activities of the society\\". The Olin Palladium Award (formerly the Palladium Medal Award), established in 1950, is presented in odd-numbered years to recognize \\"distinguished contributions to the field of electrochemical or corrosion science.\\"  Notable members  The most notable members include: *Lawrence Addicks (1878-1964), president of the Electrochemical Society from 1915 to 1916. *Thomas Edison: Edison became a member on April 4, 1903. Early members, such as Charles Burgess, recall attending a meeting at Edison's home in the early days of the society. Most recognized for the invention of the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the practical electric light bulb ‚Äì Edison's contributions to electrochemistry were monumental. *Gordon Moore: Known for his 1965 principal for the delivery of more powerful and lower costing semiconductor chips, which was later dubbed Moore's law ‚Äì Moore continues to be committed to progress in science and technology. *Edward Goodrich Acheson: Recognized for inventing the Acheson process and being a manufacturer of carborundum and graphite, Acheson is among the society's most prestigious members. *Herbert Dow: Among his most significant achievements, Dow founded the Dow Chemical Company in 1897. *Norman Hackerman: Known internationally as an expert in metal corrosion, Hackerman is most recognized for developing the electrochemistry of oxidation. *Carl Wagner: Often referred to as the father of solid state chemistry, Wagner's work on oxidation rate theory, counter diffusion of ions, and defect chemistry considerably advanced our knowledge of how reactions proceed at the atomic level in the solid state. *Charles W. Tobias: As former president of the society and pioneer in the field of electrochemical engineering, Tobias was instrumental in the advancement of electrochemical science. Through his role in forming the Chemical Engineering Department at Berkeley in 1947, Tobias made a long-lasting and far-reaching impact on the field. *Leo Baekeland: Aside from holding the post of president of the society in 1909, Baekland is most famously known for inventing Bakelite in 1907. Baekeland's entrepreneurial genius and inventive nature made him one of the most important players in chemical technology. *Edward Weston: Noted for his achievements in electroplating, Weston developed the electrochemical cell ‚Äì named the Weston cell, for the voltage standard. *Charles Martin Hall: Hall is best known for inventing an inexpensive process to produce aluminum. *Willis R. Whitney: Among his many achievements, Whitney is most recognized for founding the research laboratory of the General Electric Company.

He founded the Walsh Institute of Accountancy on July 7, 1922, and on September 18 of that year, 23 students were enrolled in the first courses at the institute. When Mervyn Walsh retired in 1965, the State of Michigan had adopted a new bachelor's degree requirement for candidates to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination. At this time, Michigan's community college system was developing and a pivotal decision was made to build upon, rather than compete with, the community colleges by becoming an upper-division college. On December 31, 1968, Walsh Institute became an upper-division college offering a business education to juniors and seniors who had finished two years of college. The new Walsh College of Accountancy and Business Administration forged partnerships with Oakland and Macomb community colleges and in 1970 broke ground for a 10,000-square-foot building in Troy, Michigan, near both colleges. Community college partnerships continued to flourish over the next two decades, and business leaders were invited to teach and develop curriculum. The college offered its first bachelor's degrees, a Bachelor of Accountancy and Bachelor of Business Administration, in 1970. The first graduate degree, the Master of Science in Taxation, was offered in 1974. The following year, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) accredited Walsh College. Over the next several years, Walsh introduced Master of Science degrees in Professional Accountancy (1980), Finance (1986), and Management (1989). During the 1990s, the College continued to enlarge its facilities, offer classes at other locations in metropolitan Detroit, and introduce new degrees and online technology. The Master of Science in Information Management and Communication (MSIMC) degree was introduced in 1996. In 1998 the Novi campus was opened and the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree was introduced. The first online courses were offered in 1998. In 2001, the NCA granted Walsh College approval to offer full online degree programs and provided the College with a full ten-year extension on its accreditation. The first fully online degree, the Master of Science in Information Assurance, was offered in 2005. Walsh information assurance curriculum maps to industry standards as well as National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security specifications. Since 2003, these agencies have renewed the college's designation as a U.S. Center of Academic Excellence for Information Assurance Education. In 2006, the NCA gave the college approval to offer its first doctoral degree, the Doctor of Management (DM) in Executive Leadership. In the fall of 2007, the first student cohort entered the program. The college also received national recognition in April 2010 for a major grant to promote entrepreneurship among students and alumni. The Blackstone Charitable Foundation of New York announced that it had selected Walsh College and Detroit's Wayne State University to share a $2 million grant to initiate Blackstone LaunchPad.https://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20140710/BLOG106/140719995/wayne- state-walsh-college-help-blackstone-launchpad-grow-michigan Community Walsh College assists the community in ongoing volunteer efforts: Blackwell Institute in Detroit, Capuchin Soup Kitchen, Focus: HOPE, Gleaners, U.S. Marines, and Vets Returning Home, Inc.

In 1913, the school became known as Long Eaton County Secondary School. In 1916, school dinners were introduced, with most of the vegetables being grown on site. In 1918, the school leaving age was raised from 12 to 14. In 1945, it became the Long Eaton Grammar School. In 1972, it merged with the nearby Roper Secondary modern school, built in 1964, to become a comprehensive school.

Moreover, the bank was absent in several provinces of Italy, such as South Tyrol (the equity investment in S√ºdtiroler Sparkasse was sold in 2007), and the province of Sondrio, Lombardy. Moreover, the bank only presented in one out of eight provinces of Sardinia and one out of five provinces of Calabria (only in Reggio Calabria). History =Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara= Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara, Societ√† Cooperativa a responsabilit√† limitata (known as just Banco Popolare; P.I. 0323127 023 6) was formed in 2002 by the merger of Banco Popolare di Verona ‚Äì S.Geminiano e S.Prospero and Banca Popolare di Novara. From 2002 to 2004 the group made multiple deals with insurer Cattolica Assicurazioni on Credito Bergamasco and other joint ventures. The partnership with the insurer ended in 2007, which after the merger with BPI, the new banking group changed to partner with Fondiaria-Sai in bancassurance (Popolare Vita, ex-BPV Vita). =Banco Popolare= Banco Popolare Societ√† Cooperativa (P.I. 0370043 023 8) was formed by the merger of Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara (BPVN) and Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI). After the deal a new holding company was formed, with Banco Popolare di Verona ‚Äì S.Geminiano e S.Prospero, Banca Popolare di Novara, Banca Popolare di Lodi, Credito Bergamasco and Cassa di Risparmio di Lucca Pisa Livorno were the main subsidiaries. 64% of the shareholders of the new bank were former shareholders of BPVN, with the rest being the former holders of BPI. Banco Popolare also sold Banca Popolare di Mantova to Banca Popolare di Milano in 2008. In June 2009 the company became the first Italian bank to receive state aid from the Government of Italy due to the ongoing financial crisis. It sold ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in convertible bonds to the state. On 1 January 2011 the group sold Banca Caripe to Banca Tercas, the bank only section in Abruzzo. In the same year most of the subsidiaries were absorbed into the parent companies, but remained as a brand and as internal bank divisions and departments. The incorporation of Credito Bergamasco was completed in 2014. In 2015 Banca Italease was absorbed. It became the leasing division of the bank. In 2015 the equity stake in ARCA SGR was sold to Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna and Banca Popolare di Sondrio for ‚Ç¨95.5 million. In 2016 it was announced that the bank would be merged with Banca Popolare di Milano. The new bank would be ranked as the joint-third among the retail and commercial banks of Italy (both the proposed new bank and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena had total assets of around ‚Ç¨170 billion according to 2015 data). The bank also claimed that the new bank would be ranked as the third in terms of branches (above 8%) and more specifically the first in Lombardy (above 15.5% where BPMilano, BPMantova and BPL were located), the third in Veneto (above 9.5% where BPV was located) and the third in Piedmont (above 12.5% where BPN was located). As part of the deal Banco Popolare would also recapitalize ‚Ç¨1 billion in order increases its capital quality. Both banks had below 1 P/B ratio (which Banco Popolare had a higher discount), making the share capital of the new bank roughly composed of 54% shareholders of Banco Popolare and 46% BPM. As part of the merger and demutualization, Banco Popolare had set an exit price of ‚Ç¨3.156 per shares for shareholders who did not vote or against the merger in the extraordinary shareholders' meeting in October 2016, which was calculated by the mean of the share price of the previous six months, although it was still above the market price at that time.

The license is defined by the author of the work and has no legal definition. Private label rights is derived from private labeling. Similar licenses include resell rights, also used in internet marketing. Use The license is used for various digital products such as articles, ebooks, software, graphic templates etc. Because there are many buyers of the same product, the price of a single unit is generally lower than if one would create a similar product from scratch (either by oneself or by outsourcing). However, people can also purchase private label content that is limited in distribution, minimizing the number of competing marketers using the same content. Private Label Content comes in many different formats, including PLR reports, ebooks, articles, graphics, templates, email newsletters and even videos. While licenses differ with each author and seller, the basic premise is that the license permits buyers to re-brand the content under their own name and brand (excluding copyright). In general practice this means that the product can be modified, sold, resold or repurposed in many different formats. In some cases authorship on the original product is allowed and with unrestricted private label, buyers are often able to resell the same rights they've acquired although not all private label releases offer or permit license distribution or transfer. Marketers use private label products for reselling under their own brands or in the case of written products for online marketing through channels like article directories, content syndication, ebook directories, slide-sharing websites and similar. Private Label Content comes with different rights depending on the developer so it's important to thoroughly check each license prior to use, to become familiar with any restrictions that may be in place. Advantages Claimed advantages to using Private Label Content are: * Saving time. * Saving money, compared to hiring a writer or buying exclusive rights * Can be used to generate ideas for blogging or content marketing * Can be re- purposed into different types of digital products Criticism Due to private label being distributed to multiple customers, and without being exclusive or unique content, marketers are often hesitant on incorporating private label content into their marketing campaigns. Private Label Content is best used as a \\"resource\\" rather than a 'source\\", meaning that users should consider revising and improving existing private label content before distributing it under their own brand.

It is part of the Barbie film series, a series of CGI Barbie films, the second to be a musical, and the first movie of Barbie animated by Mainframe Entertainment under the name of Rainmaker Animation. The film features the voice of Kelly Sheridan as Rosella. The score for this film was composed by Arnie Roth. Songs for the film were written by Megan Cavallari, Amy Powers and executive producer Rob Hudnut. Synopsis After a violent storm, Sagi, a wise red panda and Azul, a flamboyant peacock discover that a 6-year-old girl has been shipwrecked on their island. Along with a baby elephant named Tika, they decide to help her. Over time, she learns to talk to animals but fails to remember anything about her past before the shipwreck, including her name. Her only clues are a battered trunk with a broken nameplate \\"Ro\\" and a shredded flag with a white rose. Ten years later, a handsome prince named Antonio discovers Ro's island. She saves his life when crocodiles attack him and his friend Frazer. Grateful for her help, Antonio asks Ro if she would like to return with him to his kingdom of Apollonia. Hoping to discover her past, Ro agrees as long as her animal family goes with. During the voyage, Ro and Antonio begin to fall in love. When they return, Antonio introduces Ro to his parents, King Peter and Queen Danielle as well as Antonio's younger sisters; the triplets Rita, Gina, and Sofia. While the little girls immediately love Ro and her animals, Danielle is unsure what to think about Ro while Peter doesn't like her at all. The king becomes even more disturbed by his son's obvious affection towards the \\"uncivilized island girl\\". Ro does, however, succeed in earning the friendship of the queen's pet monkey, Tallulah. Peter is determined to have his adventurous son settle down and marry. While away, he arranged for Antonio to wed Luciana, a princess from a neighboring kingdom. Like the prince, Luciana doesn't want to marry someone she doesn't love but is forced to be a puppet in her mother's schemes. Unknown to all, Luciana's mother, Queen Ariana is plotting to kill Antonio's family at the wedding and overthrow their kingdom. Luciana does not want to help her mother, as she is much too kind, and she befriends Ro. Queen Ariana's motive is revenge for her parents, who were banished and reduced to pig farmers for the attempted murder of Antonio's parents years ago. The queen sees Ro as a threat to her plans and quickly plots to dispose of her. Over the next few days, Ro repeatedly tries to please Antonio's parents, but due to Ariana's interference, they all end in disaster, which further increases the king's dislike of her. By now, Ro feels like she doesn't belong in Apollonia and thinks about returning to her island, but her love for Antonio and determination to find out about herself convinces her to stay. Trying to cheer her up, Ro's animals and Tallulah help her dress for Antonio and Luciana's engagement party. Thanks to their efforts, Ro arrives in a stunning dress while her grace leaves all the guests impressed, including Peter. When Antonio confesses to Ro that he loves her, Ro reminds him of his pledge to Luciana. After a dance together, she leaves and spots a carriage outside the castle bearing the same design as the flag found back on the island. The carriage's horse tells Ro that the flag belongs to another neighboring kingdom called Paladia, but the duke and duchess (the carriage's owners) only had three sons; no daughters. Fed up with his father's attempts to push him into marriage, Antonio gives up the throne and writes a note for Ro, saying that he wants to run away with her instead of marrying Luciana. Tika witnesses this and decides to hide the note from Ro, fearing that Ro will leave her. As part of her plan to get rid of Ro, Ariana has her three pet rats put a deadly sleeping herb called \\"sunset herb\\" into the food of all the animals in the kingdom. The next day, animals all over the kingdom are unable to wake up, and Ro is blamed for the epidemic. The king has Ro locked away in the dungeon, and during that time, the \\"prisoner food\\" that Azul eats also contains the Sunset Herb, and he too falls into a deep sleep. When Antonio begs for her release, Peter makes a deal with his son; if he resumes his duties as prince and marries Luciana, Ro will be freed and returned to her island. Ro is banished from Apollonia and placed on a boat that will take her back to her island. On the journey, Tika confesses how she hid Antonio's note, and Ro forgives her. The entire group is then thrown overboard, as Ariana had paid a man to sabotage the boat. When Ro almost drowns and Sagi attempts to come for her, her memory is triggered of how she was lost at sea as a child, and of her father yelling her real name; \\"Rosella\\". Ro manages to call dolphins for help just in time and they bring the group safely back to shore. As Antonio and Luciana's wedding starts, Ariana sneaks some of the sunset herb into the wedding cake, with a little bird named Tiny witnessing it. Ro arrives and quickly starts to make a rose tonic antidote for the poison. Tiny comes to her and tells her that Ariana poisoned the wedding cake as well. She almost completes her task when the king's guards discover her. Sagi escapes and takes the antidote to Tallulah, who has been poisoned as well. One of the guards chases after him, but Tika takes him down. The other guard is about to lead Ro back to the dungeons. Hearing about the commotion from Tika, who enters the wedding room just as it is about to start, Antonio, Luciana, Antonio's parents, Ariana and their guests hurry to the greenhouse, disrupting the wedding. Antonio is ecstatic to see Ro again, while Peter demands that she be thrown in prison for daring to return. She tries to explain the animals have really been poisoned and that she can cure them. The king is hesitant at first, but then a cured Tallulah appears with Sagi, showing that Ro is telling the truth. Ro then exposes Ariana's plot to everyone. Ariana denies it, but a shocked Luciana confirms Ro's story by saying that her mother had told her not to eat anything. Exposed, Ariana tries to make a getaway in the wedding carriage, but after a long chase scene, is eventually stopped and captured by falling into the pigs' pen, which is her only fear from her past. The king apologizes to Ro and his son. He gives the couple his blessing and embraces Ro. She tells the royal family that her real name is Rosella. A guest behind them, Queen Marissa from Paladia, overhears Rosella and comes forward. She tells them that she had a daughter named Rosella. Rosella pauses and then starts to sing a lullaby she knew since she was little. Marissa joins in to complete the song, realizing that Rosella is indeed her long-lost daughter and that she is the princess of Paladia. Antonio, his parents and Rosella's animal friends, including the now awake Azul, watch as the reunited mother and daughter embrace. Rosella and Antonio are promptly married. Luciana also attends the wedding and meets a handsome young prince. The happy couple, Rosella and Antonio, wave goodbye to everyone as they set sail on a honeymoon voyage with Sagi, Azul, Tika and Tallulah in tow.

As of 2017, it has a population of 85 people, living in approximately 35 houses, and is characterized by detached houses, several businesses and a church.Villages - Weststellingwerf municipality Peperga is located on the A32 between Wolvega and Steenwijk, with public transportation offering a service to the nearby villages of Steggerda and De Blesse. Peperga is best known as the birthplace of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Director-General of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. The church, completed in 1810, was formerly dedicated to Saint Nicholas but is now named after Stuyvesant. History The village originates in the Middle Ages and is listed as a parish in 1328; mention of it occurs in the seventeenth-century copy of a 1399 document as Pepergae (Pepergo is also found, in 1408 and 1510)‚Äîpeper is a Frisian term for the boggy type of wetland on which the village was built. Peperga and nearby Blesdijke were burned by troops of Frederick of Blankenheim during war in 1413 at the time of the short-lived independence of the Stellingwerf area (comprising Weststellingwerf and Ooststellingwerf). The land was so wet that before 1660 the entire village, including the church, was moved one kilometer to a dryer area. It is found in the 1716 atlas by Bernardus Schotanus √† Sterringa as a linear village with buildings exclusively on the north side of the road, except for a church on the south side, in the middle of the area. An 1850 atlas by Wopke Eekhoff shows that the village's meadows were dug up completely for peat. A provincial road in 1828 between Leeuwarden and Zwolle was the impetus for the formation of a new village west of Peperga, De Blesse. De Blesse, like nearby Blesdijke, derives its name from the little river Blesse, which separates Blesdijke from Peperga. In 1865, the construction of a railway between Zwolle and Leeuwarden split the town in two: it separated Peperga from its west side, an area subsequently added to De Blesse. This division was boosted in the late eighties with the construction of a highway on the east side of the track. Peperga had its own railway station which opened in 1870 (with an adjoining cafe) as an expansion of an earlier home for railroad watchmen and closed on January 5, 1941. In the early seventies, the station was demolished. The nearby bridge over the river Linde is on the list of national state monuments as a Rijksmonument. Notable landmarks Peter Stuyvesant Monument A medieval church had its \\"elegant\\" late-medieval tower expanded in 1537. Peter Stuyvesant's father Balthasar Stuyvesant was pastor of that (by then Dutch Reformed) church at the time of his son's birth in 1611 or 1612. Peter Stuyvesant was probably baptised there, though this cannot be proved since the parish register is missing. In 1810 a fire gutted the building and it was rebuilt. It was dedicated to Saint Nicholas until the church was closed for worship in autumn 2001 and sold. The church came into the hands of Folkert Munsterman, who wanted to convert it into a restaurant. This did not happen, and the church was sold again in 2007. The dysfunctional Van der Molen organ from 1912 was removed and replaced in 2007 by the 1903 from the Reformed Church of Woldendorp. The current owner has had the church renamed Peter Stuyvesant Kirke. The building is available for different purposes. The village also has a Dutch Reformed chapel, and a Roman Catholic church was built in 1837. A monument in the village honors Stuyvesant. It consists of a model of a sailing ship on top of a glacial erratic.

He was also an owner in professional baseball, owning a franchise during the only season of the Players' League, 1890, and being an early part-owner of the team that would become the Brooklyn Dodgers, during 1891‚Äì1896. Biography Chauncey was a native of Brooklyn, New York, and a baseball fan. He got into the sport by financing the formation of a team in the Players' League of 1890 that became known as Brooklyn Ward's Wonders, named for manager and shortstop John Montgomery Ward. Chauncey also financed the construction of a stadium for the Wonders in Brownsville, called Eastern Park. The team and the league lasted only one season. In 1891, Chauncey arranged a merger of his team with the National League's Brooklyn Grooms. The deal saw him accumulate a large share of the Grooms stock and he convinced the other owners to leave their previous home at Washington Park for his facility at Eastern Park. He also insisted that manager Bill McGunnigle, who had just won two league championships, be fired and replaced with Ward, which the other owners, desperate for his cash, agreed to. Chauncey's time as owner of the Brooklyn team came to an end in 1897 when he sold his shares in the team to the other owners Ferdinand Abell and Charles Byrne. Chauncey had multiple business interests in banking and real estate, including being president of a bank from 1902 to 1914 then chairman until his death, and was president of a real estate company. He was a Freemason and an avid angler. Born in 1847, Chauncey died in 1926 following a two-week battle with pneumonia, on the day before his 79th birthday. He was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, and was survived by his wife and three children.

The song is a parody of the song of the same name from Slim Thug's debut album Already Platinum. The song is narrated by a businessman (Andy Samberg) who describes his increasingly outlandish daily activities as \\"the boss\\". The music video initially aired as an SNL Digital Short on Saturday Night Live with actor Seth Rogen. In 2011, it was subject to a lawsuit from the producers of the song, who claimed they never received proper compensation for their work. Song \\"Like a Boss\\" premiered as a Saturday Night Live Digital Short on April 4, 2009. In the song, Andy Samberg is a businessman, evidently in middle management, having a performance review. The reviewer asks him to describe the things he does in an average day, and does so for the remainder of the song in his trademark aggressive style while repeating the lyric \\"like a boss\\" after every activity. Video The video features Seth Rogen, recording over the vocals done by Akiva Schaffer on the single. The video adds additional visuals not included with the words of the song. It ends with Samberg's tombstone being shown (which has the epitaph \\"He was da Best\\"), and a skeptical Rogen trying to confirm some of the more bizarre events with Samberg. The \\"bomb the Russians\\" part shows Samberg attacking St. Basil's Cathedral. The video features brief cameo appearances from Saturday Night Live writer John Mulaney as the worker that Samberg micromanages, Casey Wilson as the woman giving Samberg the memo, Kristen Wiig as Samberg's office crush Debra, Jason Sudeikis as Samberg's boss and Bill Hader as the man on whom Samberg performs fellatio. It also features Jorma Taccone as the man giving him the lawsuit, and Akiva Schaffer selling him the gun. Abby Elliott and Bobby Moynihan can be seen in the video as background dancers. On the NBC version of this digital short, the part where Andy has a gun in his mouth and whines, \\"Oh fuck, man, I can't fuckin' do it. Shit!\\" had the shot of Andy with the gun in his mouth shortened and redubbed the line to, \\"Oh crap, man, I can't effin' do it. Ugh!!\\" Popularity Prior to the release of the video on Saturday Night Live, the term \\"Like a Boss\\" was not often searched for or used in social context. Though it was indeed searched for prior to the release of the video, the term clearly spiked at release and peaked on Google on April 29, 2009, hitting a 100 on the Google Trend chart. It has also become popular on social media sites such as Twitter Tumblr, and Facebook, where it is a popular hashtag to cite a task completed, goal achieved or successful action that someone is proud of doing. It has also led to parody videos such as \\"Like a Bus\\", where a bus is shown flying through traffic and often bad weather conditions with no regard or slowing for the bad conditions. On 22 October 2012, \\"Like A Boss\\" surpassed 100 million views. The video was featured by The Huffington Post, and TV Guide. Lawsuit In November 2011 a production team from St. Louis filed charges against Andy Samberg and Co., NBC Universal and Universal Republic Records. At the root of the suit was the claim that Monique ‚ÄúFoxx StarStrukk‚Äù Hines and Aleric ‚ÄúRick Tha Rular‚Äù Banks submitted the audio track for \\"Like a Boss\\" along with the audio track that would become another hit for The Lonely Island, \\"Shy Ronnie\\". The duo claimed that, through a mutual connection in 2008, they knew Samberg and submitted their tracks for inclusion in the upcoming debut album, Incredibad. The Lonely Island then recorded their own lyrics on top of the audio track to create the songs. The duo from StarStrukk productions claimed that they were never compensated properly for their work, both in money and recognition / notoriety. Banks claimed that originally he signed an agreement giving him a 50% ownership of the song, given his position as writer and producer. According to his lawsuit, he received a response from Universal Music Group that gave him only a 25% interest in \\"Like a Boss.\\" Banks, however, claims that he has yet to see any sort of a royalty for the song. Another track from the duo was later featured on the band's 2011 album Turtleneck & Chain in the song \\"Shy Ronnie 2: Ronnie & Clyde.\\" References External links Original video: * Censored video: * Video and Song Lyrics: \\"Like a Boss\\" * Lonely Island's Song Page: \\"Like a Boss\\" Category:2000s in comedy Category:2009 singles Category:2009 songs Category:Comedy rap songs Category:Saturday Night Live sketches Category:The Lonely Island songs Category:Dirty rap songs ","title":"Like a Boss"},{"id":"13679872","text":"Florence Lee (March 12, 1888 - September 1, 1962)IMDb lists her year of birth as 1858, but most sources, such as the IBDb and the United States Library of Congress list 1888 was an American actress of the silent era, who appeared in 22 films between 1921 and 1929.

After the Maine State Legislature repealed the 'Blue Laws' prohibiting stores greater than in size to be open for business on Sunday, Hannaford made the decision to convert its smaller Shop 'N' Save grocery stores to Super Shop 'N' Save, which would include floor space for a pharmacy. Because the Shop 'N' Saves were in the same communities as Hannaford's Wellby stores, Hannaford decided to sell the pharmacy chain. In 1992, Wellby Super Drug was sold to Rite Aid; its successor in Maine, Walgreens, continues to operate in many of the former Wellby locations to this day.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries.  Service  Pembina, a screw gunboat built by Thomas Stack and Novelty Iron Works, New York City, was commissioned 16 October 1861, Lt. John P. Bankhead in command. By 5 November, she had joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and with Ottawa, Seneca, and Pawnee engaged and dispersed a small Confederate squadron in Port Royal Sound, then fired on Fort Beauregard and Fort Walker. Returning with a larger force on 7 November, she fired on Fort Walker until it was abandoned. Then, on 9 November, she covered the occupation of Beaufort, South Carolina. In early December, she penetrated into Wassaw Sound to assist in closing off Savannah, Georgia. By the end of the month, she had engaged Confederate positions at Port Royal Ferry and into January 1862 assisted in clearing the Coosaw River. Between 17 January and 18 February, she operated in the Wright‚Äôs and Mud rivers area, clearing mines from the Savannah River above the mouth of Wright‚Äôs River between 13‚Äì15 February. Continuing to cruise off the Georgia and northern Florida coasts she escorted transports and covered troops as they assaulted Confederate positions and, on 9 April, as they evacuated Jacksonville, Florida. In May, she shifted to the Carolina coast for operations in the Stono River, where on 6 June seized her first prize, the schooner Rowena. Later shifted to the U.S. Gulf Coast, she captured a second vessel, the sloop Elias Beckwith, near Mobile, Alabama, 23 April 1863. Remaining on the Gulf Coast, she seized her third and last blockade runner, the Dutch brig Geziena Hilligonda, carrying medicines, iron and cloth, off Brazos Santiago, Texas, on 4 December 1864. After the war, she returned to the U.S. East Coast. Decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on 22 September 1865, she was sold at New York City on 30 November 1865.

It is managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. History The belief that the King and Queen's Seat rock formation was used by Native Americans for ceremonial purposes stems from a book published in 1880 by Thomas Wysong entitled The Rocks of Deer Creek: Their Legends and History.

During his second year, he won four stages in three different races, became the overall winner of two other stage races and finished seventh in the under-23 road race at the 2006 UCI Road World Championships. The next year, he achieved his first professional victory when he won the M√ºnsterland Giro. His debut in a Grand Tour came in 2009, when he took part in the Giro d'Italia. One year later, he finished ninth in two different stages of that same race, and achieved two time-trial victories in one week, winning the prologues of the Delta Tour Zeeland and the Ster ZLM Toer. Later that year, he was the winner of the Dutch National Time Trial Championships. Van Emden made international headlines when he proposed to his girlfriend during a time-trial stage of the 2014 Giro d'Italia. After she accepted, he finished the stage 120th out of 156 starters. In 2015, van Emden finished second in the time trial stage of the Tour of California, sitting in the leader's hot seat all day before being beaten by Peter Sagan. Two months later, van Emden participated in his first Tour de France; he finished fifth in the opening time-trial that took place in his home country. His biggest victory for the time being came when he won the time trial stage of the Eneco Tour, subsequently gaining the right to wear the leader's jersey. He was named in the startlist for the 2016 Vuelta a Espa√±a. In 2019 van Emden won the Dutch National Time Trial Championships for the second time.

It is widely used as a reagent in the synthesis of other organic compounds.  Uses  DPPA undergoes pseudohalogen replacement of the azido group by treatment with nucleophilic reagents, such as ammonia and various amines. This compound is used as a reagent for the synthesis of peptides by virtue of its reactions with carboxylic acids leading to either the urethane or the amide. The formation of the urethane is particularly valuable since it works with carboxylic acids which fail to undergo the Schmidt reaction, and is believed to involve transfer of the azido group to the carboxylic acid. It is now suggested that this reaction proceeds through the intermediate mixed anhydride, resulting from attack by the nucleophilic carboxylate anion on the phosphorus atom, with expulsion of the azide ion. The latter then attacks the carbonyl carbon atom, to give the acyl azide and loss of the diphenylphosphate anion, known to be a good leaving group. Finally, the acyl azide reacts in the normal manner to give the urethane. Studies show that DPPA reacts with amines giving the corresponding phosphoramidates; it therefore appears that formation of the amide similarly involves the intermediate anhydride, followed by nucleophilic substitution by the amine. In the synthesis of NSAIDs, DPPA is able to rearrange a propanoyl group into an isopropanoic acid. Safety DPPA is very toxic and a potential explosive like most other azide compounds.

It was similar to the British Defence of the Realm Acts, and granted the Executive very wide powers of preventive detention, internment without trial, restriction of writing, speech, and of movement. However, unlike the English law which was limited to persons of hostile associations or origin, the Defence of India act could be applied to any subject of the King, and was used to an overwhelming extent against Indians. The passage of the act was supported unanimously by the non-official Indian members in the Viceroy's legislative council, and was seen as necessary to protect against British India from subversive nationalist violence. The act was first applied during the First Lahore Conspiracy trial in the aftermath of the failed Ghadar Conspiracy of 1915, and was instrumental in crushing the Ghadr movement in Punjab and the Anushilan Samiti in Bengal. However its widespread and indiscriminate use in stifling genuine political discourse made it deeply unpopular, and became increasingly reviled within India. The extension of the law in the form of the Rowlatt Act after the end of World War I was opposed unanimously by the non-official Indian members of the Viceroy's council. It became a flashpoint of political discontent and nationalist agitation, culminating in the Rowlatt Satyagraha. The act was re-enacted during World War II as Defence of India act 1939. Independent India retained the law in a number of amended forms, which have seen use in proclaimed states of national emergency including Sino-Indian War, Bangladesh crisis, The Emergency of 1975 and subsequently the Punjab insurgency. Background Punjab and Bengal, along with Maharashtra, became hotbeds of revolutionary nationalist violence against British rule in India in the first decade of the 20th century. 1905 partition of Bengal and the 1907 colonisation bill in Punjab fed growing discontent. In Bengal, revolutionary organisations like Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar drew young recruits from the educated middle-class Bhadralok ranks, and engaged in a number of prominent attacks on both figures in the administration as well as the local police investigating incidents of robbery, violence and murder linked to these groups. These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants, prominent public figures and Indian informants. In 1907 attempts were made on the life of the Bengal Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. In 1908, a failed assassination attempt by Jugantar on the life of Presidency Magistrate Douglas Kingsford led to death of two European women. In 1909, a failed assassination attempt saw two bombs thrown at Lord Minto. In December that year the magistrate of Nasik A. M. T. Jackson was shot dead by Anant Kanhere, and suspicion fell on links to India House in London which was at the time being led by V. D. Savarkar whose elder brother Ganesh had been convicted by Jackson of seditious conspiracy. India House was also held responsible for the murder in London of William Hutt Curzon Wyllie, the political ADC to the secretary of state to India. A number of assassinations were also carried out of approvers who had turned crown- witnesses. In 1909 Naren Gossain, crown-witness for the prosecution in Alipore bomb case, was shot dead within Alipore Jail by Satyendranath Bose and Kanailal Dutt. Ashutosh Biswas, an advocate of Calcutta High Court in charge of prosecution of Gossain murder case, was shot dead within Calcutta High Court in 1909. In 1910, Shamsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Bengal Police responsible for investigating the Alipore Bomb case, was shot dead on the steps of Calcutta High Court. In Punjab, agitation against the 1907 colonisation bill, which the protagonists falsely believed was attempting to introduce law of primogeniture. Punjab police had become aware of nuclei of nationalist movements arising across the state in the form of a nascent Ghadr movement, fed by resources and the efforts of emigrant Sikh communities living in Canada. Investigations during 1912 into an attempt to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Charles Hardinge, promulgated the discovery of links between Bengal revolutionaries commanded by erstwhile Jugantar member Rash Behari Bose, and the Ghadr movement in Punjab. Early laws =Preventive detention= The Bengal Regulation of 1812 and Regulation III of 1818 were some of the earliest laws in British India to incorporate the provisions of Preventive detention, without having to commit the detainee to trial.http://www.thehindu.com/op/2004/09/07/stories/2004090700101500.htm In the Presidencies of Madras and Bombay, similar laws had been enacted in 1819 and 1827 respectively. Prisoners under these regulations had no right of habeas corpus. Section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code introduced the writ of Habeas Corpus in 1882. In 1907, emergency ordinances were issued in Punjab and in Eastern Bengal and Assam on the fiftieth anniversary of the 1857 mutiny. This allowed abolishment of public meetings, and the Indian press was subjected to controls to limit seditious material being published. The Explosive Substances Act and the Newspaper Act were passed in June 1908 to try and arrest agitation. In June 1907 local governments were further authorised to initiate proceedings against local press publishing seditious material amongst civilian population or the army. The Indian Sociologist was banned in India in September 1907 and in November that year the Prevention of Seditious Meetings Act was passed. February 1910 saw the introduction of Indian Press Act which allowed Provincial governments to ask for punitive securities of up to Rs 5,000 from newspapers likely to incite sedition and violence. This act resulted in a number of nationalist publications closing down unable to provide such a surety. =Criminal law amendment 1908= Failure of prosecution in a number of cases under the Criminal procedures act 1898 led to a special act whereby crimes of nationalist violence were to be tried by a special tribunal composed of three high-court judges. December 1908 saw the passage of the Criminal Law amendments under the terms of Regulation III of 1818 and to suppress associations formed for seditious conspiracies. The act was first applied to deport nine Bengali revolutionaries to Mandalay prison in 1908. Despite these measures however, high standards of evidence demanded by the Calcutta High Court, insufficient investigations by police, and at times outright fabrication of evidence led to persistent failure to tame nationalist violence. Police forces felt unable to deal with the operations of secretive nationalist organisations, leading to demands for special powers. These were opposed vehemently in the Indian press, which argued against any extension of already wide powers enjoyed by the police forces in India, and which it was argued was being used to oppress Indian people. World War I The First World War began with an unprecedented outpouring of support towards Britain from within the mainstream political leadership, contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt. India contributed massively to the British war effort by providing men and resources. About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money and ammunition. However, Bengal and Punjab remained hotbeds of anti colonial activities. After the onset of the First World War, plague, rising grain prices, dissatisfaction with immigration policies within the British empire (highlighted by the Komagata Maru affair), and rumours of British misfortunes in the war meant by 1914, Punjab was in an unsettled state. India lay considerably far away from the Central Powers, with only feasible routes of invasion being through Persia and Afghanistan. The Indian Government at the outset of the war anticipated that India would remain safe as long as Afghanistan maintained neutrality, and the tribes of NWFP were under control. The worst situation would be from a combination of war with Afghanistan and internal unrest fomented by either the Bengali revolutionary network, the Ghadr in Punjab or Indian Muslims who may sympathise with Ottoman Umma. =Ghadr= British intelligence in North America indicated early in the war that the Ghadr Party, co-ordinating with the Berlin Committee in Germany, and the Indian revolutionary underground was attempting to transport men and arms from United States and East Asia into India, intended for a revolution and mutiny in the British Indian Army. From August 1914, a large number of Sikh expatriates began leaving Canada and USA under the plans of the Ghadr leadership for fomenting mutiny in India, whilst in Bengal nationalist crime also increased. Department of Criminal Intelligence chief Charles Cleveland noted that the threat to India should be dealt with by dealing with Ghadr activists who were already in India and those who were returning. To this end, Ingress into India Ordinance, 1914 was passed to limit the influx of Ghadarites, but failed to stem the inflow. The planned mutiny for February 1915 was averted at the last minute. =Bengal= In the meantime, the situation in Bengal worsened considerably following the Rodda Company raid by Jugantar, which handed large amount of firearms to Bengal revolutionaries. There were 36 outrages in 1915, climbing steeply from 13 in 1913 and 14 in 1914. The revolutionaries launched what has been described by some historians as \\"a reign of terror in both the cities and the countryside\\" that \\"came close to achieving their key goal of paralysing the administration.\\" A general atmosphere of fear encompassed the police and the law courts, severely affecting the moral. In entire 1915, only six revolutionaries were successfully brought to trial. Defence of India act On 19 March 1915, Sir Reginald Craddock, home member in the Viceroy's council introduced the law and it passed in a single sitting. It was enacted as a temporary legislation in effect for the duration of World War I and for six months afterwards. The act gave the Governor General in Council the power to make rules Considerable pressure for the passage of the act was from Michael O'Dwyer particularly in light of the Ghadr threat. Answering to Sir Surendranath Bannerjee in the legislative assembly, Craddock denied any necessity or propriety for the government to constitute an advisory board of judicial character that would deal with the applications of the act. In this regard the law differed from the Defence of the Realm act. Craddock explained to the assembly that the lack of judicial oversight and advice were acceptable since the restrictive measures in the act were \\"preventive and not punitive in measures\\". =Scope= The law was to be valid for the duration of the war and for six months thereafter \\"for public safety\\" and \\"the defence of British India\\". The main object of the law made it illegal to communicate with the enemy, obtaining information, spreading false reports, as well as any activities that the government saw prejudicial to the war effort. The act allowed local governments to make rules detain indefinitely, without representation, and to try by special tribunals persons \\"reasonably suspected\\" of being of hostile origin or acting in a manner prejudicial to the safety of the empire.Halliday, Karpik & Feeley(2012), pp. 63 committing or conspiring to commit crimes either described in the act, or crimes which maybe punishable by death, transportation or at least seven year imprisonment. Power of detention, unlike under DORA, was carried by subordinate officers. For Trials already initiated under the Criminal procedures act 1898 or the 1908 Criminal law amendment were exempt from the act. Prosecution was to follow the procedures prescribed in the criminal procedures act 1898, but was superseded by the special powers and discretion of court. Crucially however, the Commissioners could take direct cognisance of the offences alleged and therefore preliminary procedures could be disposed off with. =Implementation= The act gave powers to local government to appoint three commissioners for trials who may be below the status of high-court judges. At least two would be Sessions judges or additional sessions judges for at least three years, were qualified for appointment as Judges of a High Court, or advocates of a Chief Court or pleaders of ten years' standing. A majority verdict was acceptable. The act allowed the commissioners to accept as evidence statements recorded by a magistrates without scrutiny to cross examination and superseded the standards of evidence proscribed in the Indian evidence act 1872. Further the act allowed commissioners to accept such recorded evidence where the witness was unavailable or dead. This measure was intended to secure and safeguard against intimidation and assassinations by revolutionaries of approvers. There was no right to trial by jury. The act excluded from appeal or judicial review the decisions of the commissioners appointed under the Defence of India act. Although designed to maintain order and curtail revolutionary movement, the law was in practice used in widespread scale from limiting revolutionaries, through arresting perpetrators of religious violence, to curtailing the voice of moderate political leaders. Unlike the Defence of the Realm Act (which was limited in scope to people of Hostile origin or associations, i.e. enemy citizens or collaborators), the act could be applied against any subject of the King. By June 1917, 705 were under home-arrest under the act, along with 99 imprisonments under Regulation III. Through the war, more than 1400 people were interned in India under the Defence of India Act alone, and a further three hundred subjected to minor restrictions, while more than two thousand were subjected to the restrictions of the Ingress into India Ordinance. Impact At the time of its enactment, the Defence of India act received universal support from Indian non-officiating members in the Governor General's council, from moderate leaders within Indian Political Movement. The British war effort had received popular support within India and the act received support on the understanding that the measures enacted were necessary in the war-situation. Its application saw a significant curtailment in revolutionary violence in India. However, the wide scope and widespread use amongst general population and against even moderate leaders led to growing revulsion within Indian population. =Revolutionary violence= The enactment of the law saw 46 executions and 64 life sentences handed out to revolutionaries in Bengal and Punjab in the Lahore Conspiracy Trial and Benares Conspiracy Trial, and in tribunals in Bengal, effectively crushing the revolutionary movement. The power of preventive detention were however applied more particularly to Bengal. By March 1916 widespread arrests helped Bengal Police crush the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti in Calcutta. Regulation III and Defence of India act was applied to Bengal from August 1916 on a wide scale. In Bengal, revolutionary violence in Bengal plummeted to 10 in 1917. By the end of the war there were more than eight hundred interned in Bengal under the act. =Moderate dissent= The application of the act was not limited to those suspected of revolutionary crimes. It gradually came to be used in coercing and suppressing the voice of many nationalist leaders, even of moderate views, where regional administration felt their opinion or views were seditious to British rule in India, or dangerous to the administration. A number of prominent moderate leaders were interned or deported under the Defence of India act. Most notable of these leaders was Mrs Annie Besant. Beasant had set up branches of the Home Rule League in major towns and cities at the time Bal Gangadhar Tilak was establishing the league in Bombay and in Western India. Although these amounted to little more than debating societies (having been modelled on the Fabian Societies), the leagues were noted to be publishing political pamphlets, selling alm ost 46000 of these in 1916. Libraries were also established where political treatises were made available. Beasant's league had 27000 members by 1917, and that same year both Tilak and Beasant were interned under the act on the grounds their activities were becoming subversive. India. Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar and Maulana Shaukat Ali were arrested and interned after they were found to have been in liaison with individuals in Kabul linked to the German mission, which the administration suspected may have been to promulgate a pan-Indian Islamic revolution. Abul Kalam Azad was deported from Bengal and placed under house arrest in Ranchi for his writing in Al Balagh. =Post-WWI= The Defence of India Act, in its implementation, was increasingly reviled. The unpopularity was such that the Lucknow session of the Indian National Congress in 1917 passed a resolution expressing alarm at the extensive use of the act, and urged the Government that its use be under same principles as the Defence of the Realm Act. Immediately after the war, Benjamin Horniman was deported from the Presidency of Bombay for his reporting on the Amritsar massacre. Later laws =Rowlatt act= With the impending lapse of the 1915 act, the Rowlatt Committee was appointed to recommend measures to deal with the threat from the revolutionary movement. Rowlatt recommended an extension of the provisions of the Defence of India act for a further three years with removal of habeas corpus provisions. It was met with universal opposition by the Indian members of the Viceroy's council, as well within the population in general, earning the title of \\"The Black Bills\\" from Mohandas Gandhi. Mohammed Ali Jinnah left the Viceroy's council in protest, after having warned the council of the dangerous consequences of enacting an extension of such an unpopular bill. Rowlatt's recommendations were enacted in the Rowlatt Bills. The agitations against the proposed Rowlatt bills took shape as the Rowlatt Satyagraha under the leadership of Gandhi, one of the first Civil disobedience movements that he would lead the Indian independence movement. The protests saw hartals in Delhi, public protests in Punjab as well as other protest movements across India. In Punjab, protests against the bills, along with a perceived threat of a Ghadrite uprising by the Punjab regional government culminated in the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre in April 1919. After nearly three years of agitation, the government finally repealed the Rowlatt act and its component sister acts. =1939 act= The Defence of India act 1915 was re-enacted in a more severe form at the onset of World War II as the Defence of India act 1939. It was enacted on 29 September 1939 but deemed to come into force from 3 September 1939, the day when the Second World War began. The act was used notoriously during the war in subduing the independence movement. It expired six months after the termination of the war and was ultimately repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1947(Act II of 1948). =Independent India= The Indian Constitution retained the principles of preventive detention encapsulated in the Defence of India act, making one of the few countries were citizens of the country may be subjected to such measures. In Independent India, the law retained in legislations in the form of Preventive Detention act 1950, and has seen implementation as the Defence of India Rules 1962 during the Sino-Indian War of 1962, and the Defence of India Act, 1971 during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. The 1962 act gained notoriety for its use in internment of Chinese immigrants in India, most notably Calcutta. Other similar laws enacted in independent India include the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) during The Emergency, and Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (enacted during the Punjab insurgency) which carry very similar provisions.

Howard Fiction and Verse Timeline , retrieved 11 October 2007 The story follows Costigan's participation in a \\"Scandinavians Only\\" boxing match in Japan and the complications that arise. Plot Having docked in Yokohama and looking for a boxing match to raise money, Costigan and the crew of the Sea Girl find that the only fight club in town is booked up with Swedes vs. Danes matches because the whaling fleet is in port as well. Luck seems to come, however, when the Swedish sailor Dirck \\"The Gotland Giant\\" Jacobsen breaks his wrist and a replacement is needed quickly for the match against the Danish sailor Hakon Torkilsen that night. The crew try to pass of Costigan as a Swede called Lars Ivarson. The club owner does not believe the ruse but has no other option. The fight goes ahead, although the crowd is unconvinced as well. Further complications soon arise. The first complication is that the match referee turns out to be a man Costigan knocked out earlier in the day for attempting to kick his dog Mike. He knows who Costigan is and tells him he'll reveal everything at the end of the match, at which point the crowd will turn on Costigan for intruding on a Scandinavian matter. The second complication emerges soon after the match starts. A rival captain got the Sea Girl's captain drunk and tricked him into betting the Sea Girl on Hakon Torkilsen to win and signing a contract as proof. Despite the captain's pleas, Costigan refuses to throw the fight, both for himself, for his ship mates who have bet everything on him, and for the Swedes that he is now representing. The fight continues regardless and Hakon turns out to be an equal for Costigan. The complications distract Costigan and render his performance uneven. He is knocked down several times. The problem of the bet is resolved when the rival captain, Gid Jessup, gets too near the ring while Costigan has almost been knocked out of it. Costigan grabs the contract, the only proof of the bet, and begins to eat it. Jessup tries to retrieve it, but Swedes in the audience, thinking he is trying to interfere with their boxer, attack him. Free of that problem, Costigan decides to fight to the finish regardless of the referee's threat. This too is solved quite soon after when, in the confusion of the fight, the referee accidentally starts to count Costigan out in Spanish (having only used Swedish, Danish and Norwegian so far). Costigan realises that he isn't Scandinavian, either, and the referee admits that he is an American vaudeville linguist called John Jones who took the job because he needed the money. Costigan and Hakon fight savagely but Hakon eventually collapses in a corner and cannot get up again. The Swedish captain celebrates with Costigan and, after the match they have seen, does not mind that he clearly is not one of his countrymen.

Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other churches within the Latter Day Saint Movement read of a concept of the \\"lake of fire\\" in the Book of Mormon, in several passages of the record. The most descriptive instance of a \\"lake of fire\\" in the Book of Mormon occurs in Jacob 6:10, which reads, \\"Ye must go away into that lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever, which lake of fire and brimstone is endless torment.\\" The Book of Mormon also refers to the lake of fire as a state of second death or spiritual death, where there is no hope for redemption or salvation until after the resurrection or, for sons of perdition, never. =Third century= Hippolytus of Rome (d. 235) pictured Hades, the abode of the dead, as containing \\"a lake of unquenchable fire\\" at the edge of which the unrighteous \\"shudder in horror at the expectation of the future judgment, (as if they were) already feeling the power of their punishment\\".

London: British Museum Press. pp68 When unwanted metals, such as lead and copper, are heated in the presence of sulfur, the chemical reaction reduces the unwanted metals into sulfides, such as lead(II) sulfide and copper(I) sulfide. Since sulfur is a much lighter element, atomic number 16 on periodic table, the new sulfide molecules easily float to the top of the crucible as dross. Sulfur is also part of the smelting process related to silver and gold and other metal ores and naturally occurs in these ores.

Merrie Melodies cartoon short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on February 23, 1946. The film is a spoof of the fairy tale \\"The Elves and the Shoemaker\\". The plot concerns a pack of elves who help a shoemaker, Jake. The cartoon is set to a number of classical music pieces, some of which are used as running gags, especially from \\"The Nutcracker Suite\\". The title is a play on the David Rose number \\"Holiday for Strings\\". However, that tune is not played in the score. The cartoon is done largely in pantomime, with the occasional (unintelligible) bickering of elves, many of which look like miniature versions of Elmer Fudd with elf-like ears (anticipating a similar role played by Elmer 10 years later). Plot Based on the classic Fairy Tale, the cartoon concerns a pack of Elmer Fudd-like elves who help a shoemaker, Jake, who has advertised for help. The cartoon is done largely in pantomime with the gags timed to a number of classical music pieces, from such composers as Johann Strauss, Frederic Chopin, and Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, with the occasional (unintelligible) bickering of the elves. The twist on the usual story is that the bedridden shoemaker, suddenly feeling much better upon seeing the elves working feverishly, tries to sneak out to play golf, possibly implying that the shoemaker was actually faking his illness the whole time to avoid from doing his job. The elves, realizing this, drag Jake back to bed, tie him down ala Gulliver's Travels, and are seen dragging the golf clubs out of the house for themselves to play a round with, at iris-out. Notes *According to the 1999 Toonheads episode \\"Night Of 1000 Elves\\", the reason why the elves resemble Elmer Fudd is because director Friz Freleng apparently hated Elmer and therefore did such to make fun of the character. *At one scene one of the elves replace the shoe stickers from 4F to 1A. Those \\"4F\\" and \\"1A\\" were military terms used during World War II to describe the person's capability in the army, where \\"4F\\" means unfit for military service. However those references become dated during the cartoon's release, as at the time the cartoon was released in theaters, World War II had already ended. *Caricatures of Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, and Charlie Chaplin briefly appear in the short.

They became a high-profile couple, but the relationship ended after a year and a half. In 2004 she received a lot of attention for her dress at the baptism of Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway. In the following years she has had numerous appearances in Norwegian media. Her first occupation was as a columnist for Norway‚Äôs biggest newspaper, VG. (2004), then she moved on to the Norwegian edition of the magazine Cosmopolitan as a Fashion & Entertainment Editor (2004/2005). In February 2005 she got a job as a jury member in the TV show Shopaholic at TV 3. Later that year she became the TV host of the shows Kjendisjakten (2005) and then Frokostquiz (2006) on TV 2, Norway's biggest commercial channel.::: Pia Haraldsen :::Egmont and A-pressen acquire Schibsted‚Äôs shares in TV 2 In February 2007 she started as Political Editor on one of TV 2's most popular shows Rikets R√∏st (translated as \\"The Nations Voice\\") hosted by comedian Otto Jespersen where she punked and provoked political interview subjects with dupe questions and her fake ignorance. She also covered the presidential election for the show from Norway in November 2008. September 2007 she participated in Norway's Dancing with the Stars (Skal vi danse ) on TV2. November 2007 she published her first book; Pias bekjennelser, shopping, sjekking, skikk og bruk. Spring 2009 it was announced that Pia and her mother Jasmin Haraldsen, would search for love in their own dating reality show \\"Pia og Jasmin\\" on Norwegian TV3. The show was shot in South of France summer of 2009, and broadcast on TV the following fall. Pia chose partner Vemund Aarstrand in the show finale, while mother Jasmin found love in contestant Jan Horn, whom she married February 2010. Pia and Vemund broke up spring 2010, as documented in the Norwegian press. In 2010, Pia designed her first womenswear collection for Norwegian fashion house Agape. The collection was named Pia Haraldsen for Agape, and launched at Oslo Fashion Week in August 2010. In 2011, Pia made her TV-comeback as host of a Travel Show on TV8, called \\"LuksusFri\\". The same year Pia also hosted a fashion makeover show and was named the face of Passion Watches.  Interview with James Oddo  In the summer of 2007, Haraldsen filmed an interview with New York City politician James Oddo. James Oddo - full length interview!!! She asked how Barack Obama could run for president, as he is not a U.S. citizen (she said she read somewhere he was \\"African-American\\") and asked if Senator Clinton could be president after the \\"cigar incident?\\". The councilman reacted to the questions and threw the crew out of his office. After the interview was shown on Norwegian Television it was posted on YouTubeJames Oddo - Get the f*** out of my office on YouTube.com and attracted attention. Haraldsen was interviewed by large American media outlets like USA Today, Inside Edition and Fox News.Pia satire-kjendis i USA (Pia satire celebrity in the USA) P4 In early October 2008, Haraldsen was denied a visa by US authorities. This came after the US Embassy in Oslo had sought a second opinion from the Department of Homeland Security. The refusal states that she does not appear to fulfil requirements for journalists, however, it states she may apply for an artist visa.

Among the duties of the unit were maintaining law and order in the city, but also guarding state and military buildings. The Vilnian National Guard took part in the Battle of Vilna later that year, during Napoleon's retreat from Russia. Following the Russian take-over of the city the Guard was disbanded. Already before the French invasion started, a large part of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania revolted against the Russian Empire. Soon after his arrival to Vilna, Napoleon Bonaparte formed the Provisional Government of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, promising to restore it to its former wealth. The new government instantly renewed the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Union and agreed to form the forces of the popular uprising into regular army. On July 5, 1812, the irregulars were formed into three regiments of guards cavalry and five regiments of infantry. In addition to the regular units, on July 1 an irregular unit of Vilnian burghers was formed in order to carry out police and safekeeping duties within the confines of the city. The unit, named Vilnian National Guard, or Gwardia Narodowa Wile≈Ñska in Polish, was composed of 2 battalions. In accordance with the rules for similar units formed in Warsaw, Minsk, Grodno and other towns, the membership was to be limited to all able-bodied men between 18 and 50 years of age, who possessed financial qualifications for the service (two thirds of all the recruits paid for their own equipment and uniform). Following the renewal of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Union the command over the unit was passed to experienced Polish officers from the Duchy of Warsaw, often veterans of the Old Guard. The first commander of the newly formed unit was Colonel Kozielski. Among its officers was also J√≥zef Deszczy≈Ñski, a noted Polish composer and director of the epoch.

He was from Yingchuan (ÊΩÅÂ∑ù, in modern Xuchang, Henan.) According to the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang, his father was Guo Chufan (ÈÉ≠ËôïÁØÑ), who at one point served as the secretary general of Zhucheng County (Ë´∏Âüé, in modern Weifang, Shandong).New Book of Tang, vol. 74.1 As of 682, late in the reign of Emperor Gaozong, Guo was Huangmen Shilang (ÈªÉÈñÄ‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), when he was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingchangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. However, nothing was recorded about his acts as chancellor, and the next reference to him was in 684, by which time Emperor Gaozong had died and been succeeded by his son Emperor Zhongzong‚Äîwho was then deposed by Empress Wu, then empress dowager and regent, for disobeying her‚Äîand then by Emperor Zhongzong's brother Emperor Ruizong. In 684, there had been a rebellion by Li Jingye the Duke of Ying against Empress Dowager Wu's rule, and while Li Jingye's rebellion was quickly defeated, the chancellor Pei Yan was executed on suspicion that he sympathized with Li Jingye's rebellion. After Pei's death, there were a series of official movements involving officials who had tried to defend Pei, and as part of these movements, Guo was stripped of his status as chancellor and made a member of the staff of Emperor Ruizong's crown prince Li Chengqi, but just a month later, he was further demoted to the post of prefect of Yue Prefecture (Â≤≥Â∑û, roughly modern Yueyang, Henan). Nothing further about him was recorded in history, although the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang indicated his grandsons Guo Run (ÈÉ≠ÊΩ§) and Guo Na (ÈÉ≠Á¥ç) later served as imperial officials.

Relics of St. Roland are housed in the altar of the parish church of Ch√©zery. Prayers for St. Roland's intercession are said to be effective for curing eye, head and stomach ailments, and for alleviating drought. A local legend has St. Roland encountering a thirsty reaper along the road to L√©lex on a hot day. He offers the reaper a choice of wine or water. The reaper replies that wine is not made for the lips of the poor, and he is very poor. St. Roland strikes the ground with his walking stick, and up springs fresh water. Today the \\"Oratory of the Blessed Fountain\\" stands over the site. Locals will often comment: \\"If only the peasant had asked for wine.\\" Sometimes St. Roland is also said to be patron saint of Riga, Latvia.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries.  Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  Penobscot, built in ninety days by C.P. Carter, Belfast, Maine, was launched 19 November 1861 and delivered to the Navy at Boston, Massachusetts, 16 January 1862. Assigned initially to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Penobscot destroyed her first Confederate vessel, the schooner Sereta, grounded and abandoned off Shallotte Inlet, North Carolina, 8 June 1862. On 1 August she seized sloop Lizzie off New Inlet and on 22 October British brig Robert Burns off Cape Fear. Again off Shallotte Inlet 3 November, she forced the British ship Pathfinder aground, then destroyed her. Continuing her patrol of the Carolina coast into the summer of 1863, she forced blockade runner Kate ashore at Smith's Island 12 July.  Gulf of Mexico operations  Shifted then to the Gulf of Mexico, Penobscot joined the blockade ships cruising off the Texas coast. In early January 1864, she provided support for troops landed on the Matagorda Peninsula on 31 December. On 28 February she seized Lilly, a British schooner attempting to run the blockade at Velasco, Texas, to deliver her cargo of powder, and the next day captured schooners Stingray and John Douglas, outward bound with cargoes of cotton. On 12 July, off Galveston, Texas, the \\"ninety-day\\" gunboat intercepted the schooner James Williams with a cargo of medicine, coffee, and liquor.  Penobscot's final operations of the war  By 1865 the Union stranglehold had achieved its purpose. The South was suffering for the materials necessary to wage war. On 18 February Penobscot made her last interceptions. She forced the schooners Mary Agnes and Louisa ashore at Aransas Pass and on the 19th sent a boat crew to destroy them.  Post-war activity and final decommissioning and sale  After the war Penobscot returned to the U.S. East Coast. She decommissioned at New York City 31 July 1865 and on 19 October 1869 was sold, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Nehemiah Gibson.

It can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include Barack Obama, New York City, Volkswagen Golf, or anything else that can be named. Named entities can simply be viewed as entity instances (e.g., New York City is an instance of a city). From a historical perspective, the term Named Entity was coined during the MUC-6 evaluation campaign and contained ENAMEX (entity name expressions e.g. persons, locations and organizations) and NUMEX (numerical expression). A more formal definition can be derived from the rigid designator by Saul Kripke. In the expression \\"Named Entity\\", the word \\"Named\\" aims to restrict the possible set of entities to only those for which one or many rigid designators stands for the referent. A designator is rigid when it designates the same thing in every possible world. On the contrary, flaccid designators may designate different things in different possible worlds. As an example, consider the sentence, \\"Trump is the president of the United States\\". Both \\"Trump\\" and the \\"United States\\" are named entities since they refer to specific objects (Donald Trump and United States). However, \\"president\\" is not a named entity since it can be used to refer to many different objects in different worlds (in different presidential periods referring to different persons, or even in different countries or organizations referring to different people). Rigid designators usually include proper names as well as certain natural terms like biological species and substances. There is also a general agreement in the Named Entity Recognition community to consider as named entities temporal and numerical expressions such as amounts of money and other types of units, which may violate the rigid designator perspective. The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Named Entity Disambiguation. Both tasks require dedicated algorithms and resources to be addressed.

Historically, the IVI was the first known electroacoustic phenomenon. It was predicted by Peter Debye in 1933. When a longitudinal sound wave travels through a solvent, the associated pressure gradients push the fluid particles back and forth, and it is easy in practice to create such accelerations that measure thousands or millions of g's. If a solute molecule is more dense or less dense than the surrounding liquid, then in this accelerating environment, the molecule will move relative to the surrounding liquid. This relative motion is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs in a centrifuge, or more simply, it is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs when low-density objects float to the top of a glass of water, and high-density particles sink to the bottom (see the equivalence principle, which states that gravity is just like any other acceleration). The amount of relative motion depends on the balance between the molecule's effective mass (which includes both the mass of the molecule itself and any solvent molecules that are so tightly bound to the molecule that they follow along with the molecule's motion), its effective volume (related to buoyant force), and the viscous drag (friction) between the molecule and the surrounding fluid. IVI concerns the case where the particles in question are anions and cations. In general, they will have different amounts of motion relative to the fluid during the sound wave oscillations, and that discrepancy creates an alternating electric potential between various points in a sound wave. This effect was extensively used in the 1950s and 1960s for characterizing ion solvation. These works are mostly associated with the names of Zana and Yaeger, who published a review of their studies in 1982.

Education and career Born on March 29, 1879, in Bristol, Virginia, Roberts attended the University of Virginia School of Law. He entered private practice in Bristol in 1904. Unsuccessful federal judicial nomination and recess appointment Roberts received a recess appointment from President Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 6, 1938, to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, to a new seat authorized by 52 Stat. 584. He was nominated to the same position by President Roosevelt on January 5, 1939. His service terminated on February 6, 1939, due to his resignation, after his nomination was rejected by the United States Senate that same day. He would otherwise have been eligible to continue serving until August 5, 1939, the day the first session of the 76th United States Congress adjourned. =Circumstances of his nomination= Roosevelt reportedly \\"made the decision to nominate Roberts in order to discipline\\" Virginia's senators, Harry F. Byrd and Carter Glass \\"for their consistent opposition to the New Deal and in an effort to assure a friendly Virginia delegation to the 1940 Democratic convention.\\" In the \\"broader political context\\" of 1938, Roosevelt tried to oppose the renomination of Democrats who opposed his New Deal. The timing of the Roberts' nomination corresponded with Roosevelt's efforts across the board to reassert his authority over Democratic legislators. At stake were not only the immediate prospects for Roosevelt's legislative agenda, but also the prospect of a future struggle over the presidential nomination in 1940, as Roosevelt sought to use federal patronage to woo Democratic supporters away from Democratic opponents of the New Deal, in Virginia and elsewhere. Roberts had the support of Congressman John W. Flannagan Jr., but both Virginia senators, Harry F. Byrd and Carter Glass, disapproved of Roberts' selection. They preferred another state court judge, A.C. Buchanan, or Assistant United States Attorney Frank S. Tavenner Jr., among others seeking the position.Neither were purely patronage picks. Buchanan became a member of the Virginia Supreme Court; Tavenner became U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, then counsel to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, then counsel for the House Un-American Activities Committee, associated with the Hollywood blacklist. Months prior, Roosevelt had debated about who should have \\"veto power\\" over federal appointments in Virginia, suggesting that newly elected Governor James H. Price should have that power rather than the United States Senators. Charles J. Harkrader, a member of the Senate of Virginia and publisher of the Bristol Herald Courier made this White House discussion public in March 1938. When Senator Glass objected that he had not been consulted over Roberts' selection, Roosevelt responded \\"that he was happy to consult Glass, but reserved the right to consult others, including, if he wished, 'Nancy Astor, the Duchess of Windsor, the WPA, a Virginia moonshiner, Governor Price or Charlie McCarthy.'\\" Virginian R. Walton Moore, a former Congressman and president of the Virginia Bar Association, then serving as Counselor in the State Department, \\"led the administration's effort to secure\\" the Roberts nomination, but Moore badly underestimated the vigor of Glass and Byrd's opposition. Senator Glass, in his remarks before the Senate, declared that the Roberts nomination was \\"personally obnoxious\\" to him, invoking the magic words that guaranteed the confirmation's denial. At Roberts' confirmation hearing, witnesses testifying to his qualifications included Governor Price, former governors Westmoreland Davis and E. Lee Trinkle, and the head of the Virginia Bar Association. The Judiciary Committee recommended against confirming Roberts, by vote of 14-3, \\"on the grounds that his nomination was 'personally offensive' to the two Virginia Senators.\\" According to this report, two of the 19 nominations that failed in the Senate between 1939 and 2003 were for seats on the Western District of Virginia, Roberts and one other in 1976. The Senate vote against Roberts was 72-9, with Harry S. Truman among other Democrats siding with Glass and against Roosevelt. Commenting on Roosevelt's position, Senator Glass declared: \\"Ninety-six Senators have the right of veto over Presidential nominations in specified cases, and on last Monday seventy-two of them exercised their right of veto on the President's nominee for Judge of the Western District of Virginia.\\" As of February 6, 1939, the day of the Senate vote, \\"Judge Roberts was now out of a job, and the administration was seen as having suffered a stunning political defeat.\\" The day after the Senate vote, Roosevelt wrote and made public a lengthy letter to Roberts, declaring his thanks for \\"the honorable, efficient, and in every way praiseworthy service that you have rendered to the people of the United States in general and to the people of the Western District of Virginia in particular\\" and that \\"not one single person who has opposed your confirmation has lifted his voice in any shape, manner or form against your personal integrity and ability.\\" Commenting on who might be nominated after Roberts by Roosevelt, Senator Glass predicted: \\"I think he'll send up a more objectionable one ‚Äî if he can find it.\\" Roosevelt solved the problem of filling the judgeship by naming the dean of the University of Virginia Law School, Armistead Mason Dobie, then state court judge Alfred D. Barksdale, to the position. Roberts returned to private practice in Bristol, and litigated cases as counsel before his successors as judge in both state and federal court. Death and legacy Roberts died on January 27, 1967. His wife also died by the end of the year. They are buried in Bristol's Mountain View Cemetery. A portrait of Judge Roberts hangs in the courtroom of the Circuit Court for the City of Bristol.

Four books out of an original eight are still extant. The philosophy of Epictetus is intensely practical. He directs his students to focus attention on their opinions, anxieties, passions and desires, so that \\"they may never fail to get what they desire, nor fall into what they avoid.\\" True education lies in learning to distinguish what is our own from what does not belong to us, and in learning to correctly assent or dissent to external impressions. The purpose of his teaching was to make people free and happy. The Discourses have been influential since they were written. They are referred to and quoted by Marcus Aurelius. Since the 16th century they have been translated into multiple languages and reprinted many times. Title and dating The books did not have a formal title in ancient times. Although Simplicius called them Diatribai (ŒîŒπŒ±œÑœÅŒπŒ≤Œ±ŒØ, Discourses),Simplicius, Commentary on Epictetus' Enchiridion. other writers gave them titles such as Dialexis (ŒîŒπŒ±ŒªŒ≠ŒæŒµŒπœÇ, Talks),Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights, xix. 1 Apomn√™moneumata (·ºàœÄŒøŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒøŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒ±, Records),Stobaeus, i. 3. 50; iii. 6. 57, 58; iii. 29. 84 and Homiliai (·ΩâŒºŒπŒªŒØŒ±Œπ, Conversations).Stobaeus, iv. 33. 28; Photius, Biblioth. 58 The modern name comes from the titles given in the earliest medieval manuscript: \\"Arrian's Diatribai of Epictetus\\" (). The Greek word Diatribai literally means \\"informal talks\\". As to the date, it is generally agreed that the Discourses were composed sometime in the years around 108 AD. Epictetus himself refers to the coins of Trajan,Discourses, iv. 5. 17 which shows he was teaching during that reign. Arrian was suffect consul in around 130, and since forty-two was the standard age for that position, he would have been at the right age of around twenty in 108. Furthermore the \\"commissioner\\" of the \\"free cities\\" to whom Discourse iii. 7 is addressed is thought to be the same man Pliny the Younger addresses his Letter viii. 24--a letter which has been dated to around 108. Writing There were originally eight books, but only four now remain in their entirety, along with a few fragments of the others. In a preface attached to the Discourses, Arrian explains how he came to write them: The Discourses purport to be the actual words of Epictetus. They are written in Koine Greek unlike the Attic Greek Arrian uses in his own compositions. The differences in style are very marked, and they portray a vivid and separate personality. The precise method Arrian used to write the Discourses has long been a matter of vigorous debate. Extreme positions have been held ranging from the view that they are largely Arrian's own compositions to the view that Epictetus actually wrote them himself.. The first position Long ascribes to Theo Wirth, the second position is ascribed to Robert Dobbin. The mainstream opinion is that the Discourses report the actual words of Epictetus, even if they cannot be a pure verbatim record. A. A. Long writes: Setting The Discourses are set in Epictetus' own classroom in Nicopolis and they show him conversing with visitors, and reproving, exhorting, and encouraging his pupils. These pupils appear to have been young men like Arrian, of high social position and contemplating entering the public service. The Discourses are neither formal lectures nor are they part of the curriculum proper. The regular classes involved reading and interpreting characteristic portions of Stoic philosophical works, which, as well as ethics, must have included instruction in the logic and physics which were part of the Stoic system. The Discourses instead record conversations which followed the formal instruction. They dwell on points which Epictetus regarded as of special importance, and which gave him an opportunity for friendly discourse with his pupils and to discuss their personal affairs. They are not, therefore, a formal presentation of Stoic philosophy. Instead the Discourses are intensely practical. They are concerned with the conscious moral problem of right living, and how life is to be carried out well. Themes =Three parts of philosophy= Epictetus divides philosophy into three fields of training, with especial application to ethics. The three fields, according to Epictetus, are, (1) desire (·ΩÑœÅŒµŒæŒπœÇ); (2) choice (·ΩÅœÅŒºŒÆ); (3) assent (œÉœÖŒ≥Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨Œ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ): The first and most essential practice is directed towards our passions and desires, which are themselves only types of impression, and as such they press and compel us. A continued practice is thus required to oppose them. To this first practice must be added a second, which is directed towards that which is appropriate (duty), and a third, the object of which is certainty and truth; but the latter must not pretend to supplant the former. Avoidance of the bad, desire for the good, direction towards the appropriate, and the ability to assent or dissent, this is the mark of the philosopher. Scholars disagree on whether these three fields relate to the traditional Stoic division of philosophy into Logic, Physics, and Ethics. The third field unambiguously refers to logic since it concerns valid reasoning and certainty in judgment. The second field relates to ethics, and the first field, on desires and aversions, appears to be preliminary to ethics. However Pierre Hadot has argued that this first field relates to physics since for the Stoics the study of human nature was part of the wider subject of the nature of things. =What is 'up to us'= True education lies in learning to distinguish what is our own from what does not belong to us. But there is only one thing which is fully our own,‚Äîthat is, our will or choice (prohairesis). The use which we make of the external impressions is our one chief concern, and upon the right kind of use depends exclusively our happiness. Although we are not responsible for the ideas that present themselves to our consciousness, we are absolutely responsible for the way in which we use them. In the realm of judgement the truth or falsity of the external impression is to be decided. Here our concern is to assent to the true impression, reject the false, and suspend judgement regarding the uncertain. This is the act of choice. Only that which is subject to our choice is good or evil; all the rest is neither good nor evil; it concerns us not, it is beyond our reach; it is something external, merely a subject for our choice: in itself it is indifferent, but its application is not indifferent, and its application is either consistent with or contrary to nature. This choice, and consequently our opinion upon it, is in our power; in our choice we are free; nothing that is external of us, not even Zeus, can overcome our choice: it alone can control itself. Nothing external, neither death nor exile nor pain nor any such thing, can ever force us to act against our will. =Universal nature= We are bound up by the law of nature with the whole fabric of the world. In the world the true position of a human is that of a member of a great system. Each human being is in the first instance a citizen of one's own nation or commonwealth; but we are also a member of the great city of gods and people. Nature places us in certain relations to other persons, and these determine our obligations to parents, siblings, children, relatives, friends, fellow- citizens, and humankind in general. The shortcomings of our fellow people are to be met with patience and charity, and we should not allow ourselves to grow indignant over them, for they too are a necessary element in the universal system. =Providence= The universe is wholly governed by an all-wise, divine Providence. All things, even apparent evils, are the will of God, and good from the point of view of the whole. In virtue of our rationality we are neither less nor worse than the gods, for the magnitude of reason is estimated not by length nor by height but by its judgments. The aim of the philosopher therefore is to reach the position of a mind which embraces the whole world. The person who recognizes that every event is necessary and reasonable for the best interest of the whole, feels no discontent with anything outside the control of moral purpose. =The Cynic sage= The historical models to which Epictetus refers to are Socrates and Diogenes. But he describes an ideal character of a missionary sage, the perfect Stoic‚Äîor, as he calls him, the Cynic. This philosopher has neither country nor home nor land nor slave; his bed is the ground; he is without wife or child; his only home is the earth and sky and a cloak. He must suffer beatings, and must love those who beat him. The ideal human thus described will not be angry with the wrong-doer; he will only pity his erring. Manuscript editions The Codex Bodleianus of the Discourses of Epictetus. Note the large stain on the manuscript which has made this passage (Book 1. 18. 8-11) partially illegible. The earliest manuscript of the Discourses is a twelfth-century manuscript kept at the Bodleian Library, Oxford as MS Auct. T. 4. 13.Oxford University Philosophy Faculty Library - Manuscripts and rare books In the Bodleian manuscript, a blot or stain has fallen onto one of the pages, and has made a series of words illegible;Discourses, i. 18. 8-11 in all the other known manuscripts these words (or sometimes the entire passage) are omitted,W. M. Lindsay (1896), An Introduction to Latin Textual Emendation, page 44. thus all the other manuscripts are derived from this one archetype.Aston et al., (1984), The History of the University of Oxford, Oxford University Press. It is thought that the Bodleian manuscript may be a copy of one owned by Arethas of Caesarea in the early 10th century. Arethas was an important collector of manuscripts and he is also responsible for transmitting a copy of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. The Bodleian manuscript contains marginal notes which have been identified as by Arethas. The manuscript is however \\"full of errors of all kinds\\". Many corrections were made by medieval scholars themselves, and many emendations have been made by modern scholars to produce a clean text. Publication history The Discourses were first printed (in Greek) by Vettore Trincavelli, at Venice in 1535, although the manuscript used was very faulty. This was followed by editions by Jakob Schegk (1554) and Hieronymus Wolf (1560). John Upton's edition published 1739‚Äì41 was an improvement on these since he had some knowledge of several manuscripts. This in turn was improved upon by the five volume edition by Johann Schweigh√§user, 1799‚Äì1800. A critical edition was produced by Heinrich Schenkl in 1894 (second edition 1916) which was based upon the Bodleian manuscript. English translations The first English translation did not appear until 1758 with the appearance of Elizabeth Carter's translation. This proved to be very successful, with a second edition appearing a year later (1759), a third edition in 1768, and a fourth edition published posthumously in 1807. It influenced later translations: e.g. those of Higginson and George Long (see his Introduction for comments, some critical of Carter). A complete list of English translations is as follows: * Elizabeth Carter, (1758), All the works of Epictetus, which are now extant; consisting of his Discourses, preserved by Arrian, in four books, the Enchiridion, and fragments.

(Oxford University Press) All of these are complete translations with the exception of Robert Dobbin's book which only contains 64 out of the 95 Discourses. Robin Hard has produced two translations: the first (for Everyman in 1995) was just a revision of Elizabeth Carter's version, however his 2014 edition (for Oxford University Press) is the first complete original translation since the 1920s.

Kinslow (January 12, 1866 ‚Äì February 22, 1901) was a professional baseball player who played catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1886 until 1898. He played for eight teams in his ten-season career. Four of those seasons were with Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the National League (NL). During his playing days, his height was listed at , his weight as , he batted and threw right-handed, and had blonde hair. He was a member of the Washington Light Infantry, a local Washington, D.C. militia, and played in many of their amateur baseball games throughout his life. When not playing, he tended to his bar. Noted for being a genial, friendly individual, he was quick to make friends, and was a fan-favorite in his hometown of Washington, D.C. Kinslow was a heavy drinker however, which caused him to miss games and team movements on occasion. Late into his career, these alcohol issues were much less tolerated, eventually hastening his exit from the game. He died at the age of 35, after a year-long battle with tuberculosis. Early life Thomas Kinslow was born on January 12, 1866 in Washington, D.C.; his father Michael worked as a laborer and an ice dealer, later working in the oyster business. He began playing amateur baseball in the city's first ward on a team known as the \\"Quicks\\", as well as a team named the Falcons. He later became a member of the Washington Light Infantry, Company C, a local militia, and played as their catcher against the 5th Maryland Regiment on June 29, 1885; a game won by Washington 11‚Äì7. Baseball career =Early career= Kinslow made his MLB debut with the Washington Nationals of the NL on June 4, 1886 as their starting catcher. He injured his finger in the third inning trying to catch a bad pitch thrown by Bob Barr, and had to leave the game. On June 15, he was again injured by a Barr pitch, and forced to leave the game with a dislocated finger. He played in three games for the Nationals in 1886, collecting two hits in eight at bats. In 1887, he was signed by the Peanut Eaters of the Pennsylvania State Association, and played in 36 games before being sold to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, along with Ed Beatin for $1,000 on July 27. Soon, the deal was put on hold by the NL, as the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association (AA) also claimed they had a deal in place for these players. On September 6, an arbitration board for the NL and AA leagues convened to render their findings. They found that Detroit's contract with the players was dated on July 20, which superseded Cincinnati's contract that was signed on July 27, and awarded Detroit the players. Detroit then sold their contracts with the players to the London Tecumsehs of the International Association. Though he did not play for London in 1887, he did play in two games for the New York Metropolitans of the AA, going hitless in eight at bats. =Brooklyn= Kinslow played the next two seasons for the Tecumsehs, and had a batting average of .200 in 1888, but improved it to .343 in 1889. In 1890, a new league was created, the Players' League (PL), and he signed with Ward's Wonders of Brooklyn. During the season, he had a batting average of .264, and caught 64 games. On June 28, he hit the first home run of his career in a game against Henry Gruber and the Cleveland Infants. Later, on July 11, he hit two home runs in the same game off of George Keefe of the Buffalo Bisons, the only time Kinslow would achieve this feat. The PL folded following the 1890 season, and Kinslow stayed in Brooklyn by signing with the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the NL. He followed John Montgomery Ward, who was hired as team's new manager. Shortly afterwards, Kinslow's services were kept exclusive as the team listed him among those players covered under the reserve clause. During the game on July 8, Kinslow was benched by Ward for what was described as insubordination. Kinslow played in 61 games for Brooklyn in 1891, being platooned primarily at catcher with Con Daily, and had a .237 batting average. In 1892, he continued to platoon with Daily and played in 66 games. He improved his batting average to .305, and hit two home runs. With a third catcher, Tom Daly, no longer with the team in 1893, Kinslow's playing time increased slightly to 78 games. His batting average dropped to .244, but he tied his career-high with four home runs. Although he was popular player during his time in Brooklyn, Kinslow had caused trouble with the team at some point in the season, and had been restricted from playing in home games by owner Charles Byrne. Upon signing his contract with Brooklyn in 1894, Kinslow wrote a letter to the owner apologizing for his conduct during the previous season, and vowed to improve significantly going forward. His batting average improved to .305 during the 1894 season while playing in 62 games, sharing time with Daily once again. =Late career= On January 26, 1895, Kinslow was traded by Brooklyn to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Ad Gumbert. The Red Stockings quickly disputed the deal however, claiming that they had an earlier agreement with Pittsburgh's manager Connie Mack that would have brought them Gumbert and Buck Weaver in exchange for Billy Merritt. Despite the dispute, the Brooklyn deal went forward, and Kinslow joined the Pirates. With the catching duties being split between Merritt and Joe Sugden, there was little playing time allotted for Kinslow; Kinslow's behavior had become a problem for Mack and the Pirates. Once, he was fined for missing a game due to drinking, and in late May, he was suspended for failing to show up for a game in Washington, D.C. On June 22, he failed to be ready for a road series, and was released from the team for disorderly conduct. Kinslow expressed sorrow and shock over getting released, claiming that while he drank too much, Brooklyn would issue fines for his behavior instead. In 19 games played for Pittsburgh, he had a .226 batting average, Though he had received interest from Cincinnati and the Washington Senators, he claimed that he wanted to take the remainder the year off to be ready for the next season. During the off-season, Kinslow tended to the bar he owned in Washington, D.C., mainly passing time opening oysters and clams, and playing games for the Washington Light Infantry. On May 21, it was reported that he had agreed to play for the Louisville Colonels of the NL. In eight games for the Colonels, Kinslow collected seven hits in 25 at bats for a .280 batting average. After playing very little in 1896, and not at all in 1897, he signed with the Senators for the 1898 season. He admitted that his weight had increased to 225 lbs during the time off from the game, but would quickly drop his weight to 160 once he began playing. He appeared in three games for Washington until he was sold to the St. Louis Browns on August 18\\\\. He played in an additional 14 games for St. Louis, and was released from the team at the conclusion of the season. In his 380 career games played, he had a .266 batting average, 12 home runs, and 222 runs batted in. Personal life Kinslow was known to have a genial, sunny disposition, and was quick to make friends. In the 1900 United States Census, he was living with his father and working as an oyster dealer. He is listed as being married for ten years, but his wife was not living in the same home. He died in his hometown of Washington, D.C. after a year-long battle with consumption (tuberculosis), and is interred at Congressional Cemetery.

During Emperor Gaozong's reign, he had drawn hatred from the official Zhou Xing as the conveyor of the bad news that Zhou was not getting promoted, and in 689, Zhou, having by that point become one of Empress Dowager Wu's trusted secret police officials, falsely accused Wei of opposing Empress Dowager Wu. She forced Wei to commit suicide.  Background  Wei Xuantong was born in 617, near the end of Tang Dynasty's predecessor Sui Dynasty. He was from what would eventually become Ding Prefecture (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei), and his grandfather Wei Shikuo (È≠èÂ£´Âªì) had served as a general for Northern Qi.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  Wei Xuantong himself had passed the imperial examination, and thereafter became the magistrate of Chang'an County, one of the two counties making up Tang's capital Chang'an. By 664, he was serving as the director of performance reviews at the ministry of civil service, when, on account of his friendship with the chancellor Shangguan Yi, who had been executed after unsuccessfully trying to persuade Emperor Gaozong to depose his powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), Wei was exiled to the Lingnan region. It was said that during his exile, he was not particularly interested in returning to politics, and he spent most of his days hunting. Early in Emperor Gaozong's Shangyuan era (674-676), there was a general pardon, and Wei was recalled to the capital. Liu Shenli (ÂäâÂØ©Á¶Æ) the minister of public works was aware of Wei's talent, and he recommended Wei. Wei was subsequently made the secretary general of Qi Prefecture (Â≤êÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and then the deputy minister of civil service. In 682, he was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. He was also created the Baron of Julu. Around this time, Wei also submitted a lengthy petition to Emperor Gaozong, advocating a major reform of the civil service system. In his petition, he pointed out that during the Zhou Dynasty and Han Dynasty, the responsibilities for recommending, promoting, and evaluating officials were split between various central government officials and local officials, and that only during Cao Wei and Jin Dynasty (265-420) did the responsibilities began to be concentrated in a single ministry of civil service‚Äîa system that he found faulty in that it required a small number of officials to make snap judgment as to the merits of the officials for the entire state, and therefore, even if the officials were capable and honest, they would not be able to make correct decisions all the time‚Äîand that the system was open to manipulation through corruption or incompetence. Emperor Gaozong did not take action on his petition. It was also around this time that Wei would bring an enmity against him that would eventually be his undoing. At this time, Zhou Xing, the magistrate of Heyang County (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), had become known for his abilities, and was summoned to the capital, as Emperor Gaozong was considering promoting him. However, someone submitted a letter to Emperor Gaozong, pointing out that Zhou had not passed imperial examinations, and Emperor Gaozong changed his idea about promoting Zhou. However, Zhou was not aware of this, and he repeatedly visited the government officials, awaiting a promotion. The chancellors said nothing to him, but eventually Wei told him, \\"Magistrate Zhou, you may go.\\" Zhou thereafter believed that Wei was the one who blocked his promotion, and hated Wei immensely.  During Empress Dowager Wu's regency  In 683, Emperor Gaozong died and was succeeded by his son Li Zhe (as Emperor Zhongzong), but in early 684, after Emperor Zhongzong displayed signs of independence, Empress Wu (by this point empress dowager and regent) deposed Emperor Zhongzong and replaced him with his brother Li Dan the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong), but thereafter held onto power even more tightly. Meanwhile, Wei Xuantong continued to serve as chancellor. By 685, he was serving as one of the secretaries general for the executive bureau of government (ÊñáÊòåËá∫, Wenchang Tai), when he was made Luantai Shilang (È∏ûËá∫‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau (È∏ûËá∫, Luan Tai), and he was given a more honored designation as chancellor de facto, Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫‰∏âÂìÅ). In 687, he became acting Nayan (Á¥çË®Ä), the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor and made the official in charge of Chang'an (as Empress Dowager had, by this point, effectively moved the capital to the eastern capital Luoyang). By 689, Zhou Xing had become a powerful official‚Äîas he had been in charge of many politically charged investigations carried out against officials and nobles under Empress Dowager Wu's direction. He still resented Wei for what he thought was Wei's role in blocking his promotion. Wei had been great friends with fellow chancellor Pei Yan, who was executed in 684 for what Empress Dowager Wu saw as opposition against her (i.e., Pei's advocacy that she return imperial powers to Emperor Ruizong). Zhou, knowing this, falsely accused Wei of having said, \\"The empress dowager is old. It is better to support the emperor, for he will last longer.\\" This angered Empress Dowager Wu, and she ordered that Wei commit suicide, and she sent the assistant imperial censor Fang Ji (ÊàøÊøü) to monitor his suicide. When Fang got to Wei's mansion, he said to Wei, \\"Honored old man, why do you not pretend to be making a secret accusation? That way, the empress dowager will summon you to her presence, and when she does, you can explain that the accusation against you is false.\\" Wei sighed and responded, \\"What is the difference between being killed by men and being killed by ghosts [(i.e., natural death)]? How can I be an accuser?\\" He later committed suicide.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 87. * New Book of Tang, vol. 117. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 203, 204.

The character proved immensely popular and quickly made the jump to other media, including comics. Comic strips John Celardo drew the Tarzan comic strip from 1954 to 1968. Tarzan of the Apes was adapted into newspaper strip form, first published January 7, 1929, with illustrations by Hal Foster. A full page Sunday strip began on March 15, 1931, with artwork by Rex Maxon. United Feature Syndicate distributed the strip. Over the years, many artists have drawn the Tarzan comic strip, notably Rex Maxon (1929‚Äì1947), Burne Hogarth (1937‚Äì1945, 1947‚Äì1950), Ruben Moreira (1945‚Äì1947), Dan Barry (1948), Paul Reinman (1949‚Äì1950), Bob Lubbers (1950‚Äì1954), John Celardo (1954‚Äì1967), Russ Manning (1967‚Äì1979), Gil Kane (1979‚Äì1981), Mike Grell (1981‚Äì1983), Gray Morrow (1983‚Äì2001) and Eric Battle (2001‚Äì2002). The daily strip began to reprint old dailies after the last Russ Manning daily (#10,308, which ran on 29 July 1972). The Sunday strip also turned to reprints after May 19, 2002. Both strips continue as reprints today in a few newspapers and in Comics Revue magazine. The comic strip has often borrowed plots and characters from the Burroughs Tarzan books. Writer Don Kraar, who wrote the strip from 1983 to 1995, included in his stories characters from other books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, including David Innes of Pellucidar and John Carter of Mars. =Stories= Shortly after the daily strip launched in 1929, the stories were given titles; this practice ran until 1939.

In 2014, Dark Horse Books began to reprint the Hal Foster and Burne Hogarth Sundays in the original full page size. * One full year of the strip is reprinted by The Library of American Comics in the LoAC Essentials line of books. The book covers a year of Hal Foster's run. * The Library of American Comics reprinted Russ Manning's run of the Tarzan newspaper strip, in their series, Tarzan: The Complete Russ Manning Newspaper Strips. Comic books =United States= Tarzan has appeared in many comic books from numerous publishers over the years, notably Western Publishing, Charlton Comics, DC Comics, Marvel Comics and Dark Horse Comics. The character's earliest comic book appearances were in comic strip reprints published in several titles, such as Sparkler, Tip Top Comics and Single Series. Western Publishing Western Publishing published Tarzan in Dell Comics' Four Color Comics #134 & 161 in 1947, before giving him his own series, Tarzan #1‚Äì131 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1948 ‚Äì July‚ÄìAugust 1962), through Dell Comics as well as in some Dell Giants and March of Comics giveaways, then continued the series with #132‚Äì206 (November 1962 to February 1972) through their own Gold Key Comics. This series featured artwork by Jesse Marsh, Russ Manning, and Doug Wildey. It included adaptions of most of Edgar Rice Burroughs's original Tarzan books (skipping only Tarzan and the Leopard Men, Tarzan the Magnificent, Tarzan and the Madman and Tarzan and the Castaways), as well as original stories and other features. Almost all of the Dell and Gold Key Tarzan stories were written by Gaylord DuBois. Western also published a companion series, Korak: Son of Tarzan for 45 issues from 1964 to 1972. When Western refused to expand the number of Edgar Rice Burroughs comic books being published, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. sold the rights to DC Comics, who were willing to publish more comics so long as they sold. This decision was motivated by the lucrative overseas reprint rights, which Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. were selling to foreign publishers on a per-page rate. DC Comics DC Comics took over the series in 1972, publishing Tarzan #207‚Äì258 from April 1972 to February 1977. DC continued the numbering from the Gold Key series, rather than starting over at #1. Publishers believed at the time that a series would sell less if people perceived it as new. This version initially showcased artist Joe Kubert's depiction of the character, considered some of the best work of the artist's career. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Kubert's \\"scripts and artwork ranked among the most authentic and effective ever seen.\\" DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz stated in 2010 that \\"Joe Kubert produced an adaptation that Burroughs aficionados could respect.\\" The series featured some adaptations of the Burroughs books in addition to original stories, adapting Tarzan of the Apes, The Return of Tarzan, Jungle Tales of Tarzan, Tarzan the Untamed, Tarzan and the Lion Man and Tarzan and the Castaways. Issues #230 (April‚ÄìMay 1974) to #235 (Feb.‚ÄìMarch 1975) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format. Initially the series featured adaptions of other Burroughs creations, and had the companion titles Korak, Son of TarzanOverstreet, p. 814 and Weird Worlds. The Korak series was later renamed The Tarzan Family, into which all the non-Tarzan Burroughs adaptations were consolidated. During this period, the British arm of Warner Bros., the corporate parent of DC Comics, published Tarzan and Korak for the British market. Two issues of Limited Collectors' Edition featured reprints of Kubert's Tarzan stories. Because Russ Manning's portrayal of Tarzan was considered \\"definitive\\" in most countries, Joe Kubert's Tarzan comics were not well-received outside of the U.S.A., and were consistently outsold by reprints of Manning's Tarzan. Afraid that foreign publishers would stop purchasing reprint rights to the new comics, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. hired Manning (and later Mark Evanier) to oversee the creation of exclusively overseas editions done in Manning's style. Marvel Comics In 1977 the series moved to Marvel Comics, retitled as Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. Marvel published 29 issues from June 1977 to October 1979 and three Annuals. It restarted the numbering rather than assuming that used by the previous publishers. The series was written by Roy Thomas and featured artwork by John Buscema. Burroughs books adapted by Marvel include Tarzan of the Apes, Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar and Jungle Tales of Tarzan. Mark Evanier remarked that > ... the whole Marvel deal was doomed from the start. ... The foreign > publishers did not want adaptations. Roy Thomas felt they should do > adaptations. They wanted the Russ Manning versions, but John Buscema wanted > to make it as much like the Joe Kubert version as possible. Also, the > foreign publishers needed stories in fifteen-page increments, because most > of the books feature thirty pages of material and two pages of ads. > Everything that made the books commercial in America, made them uncommercial > overseas. Marvel did not continue the Tarzan Family title, publishing instead a series on Burroughs' primary non-Tarzan character, John Carter, Warlord of Mars. Marvel Super Special #29 (1983) featured a Tarzan story by writers Sharman DiVono and Mark Evanier and artist Dan Spiegle.Marvel Super Special #29 at the Grand Comics Database Dark Horse Comics Dark Horse Comics has published various Tarzan series from 1996 to the present, including archive reprints of works from previous publishers such as Western/Gold Key and DC. Dark Horse and DC published two crossover titles teaming Tarzan with Batman and Superman. Batman/Tarzan: Claws of the Cat-woman is a \\"straight\\" team-up between Tarzan and the 1930s Batman to save an ancient city ‚Äì during which the two form an effective team as they acknowledge their similar origins, despite such differences as Tarzan's willingness to use lethal force. Superman/Tarzan: Sons of the Jungle is a revisionist version in which Lord Greystoke grows up in England, while Kal-El is raised by the apes as \\"Argozan\\", although the two switch roles at the conclusion with Greystoke remaining in the jungle while Kal-El returns to the city, Greystoke stating in a letter to his parents that he feels as though he has found his true place. Tarzan also fought the Predators in the Tarzan vs. Predator: At the Earth's Core miniseries. In 2015, Sequential Pulp Comics, a graphic novel imprint distributed by Dark Horse Comics, published Jungle Tales of Tarzan by writer Martin Powell and artists Pablo Marcos, Terry Beatty, Will Meugniot, Nik Poliwko, Antonio Romero Olmedo, Mark Wheatley, Diana Leto, Steven E. Gordon, Lowell Isaac, Tom Floyd, and Jamie Chase. The cover was by Daren Bader. Idaho Comics Group Although Dark Horse Comics holds the comic book licensing rights for the Tarzan character, in 2014 they allowed Idaho Comics Group to publish Tarzan and the Comics of Idaho #1. Edgar Rice Burroughs spent many formative years in Idaho and wrote his first draft of Tarzan in the Gem State. Tarzan and the Comics of Idaho was a comic book anthology showcasing the comic book creators from Idaho. It featured stories and art from Charles Soule, Dennis Eichhorn, Todd Clark of the nationally syndicated Lola comic strip, Steve Moore, Dame Darcy, and others. Only 500 copies of this comic book were printed and all of the proceeds were to benefit the Boise Public Library. In 2015, Tarzan and the Comics of Idaho #2 was released. This edition featured work by Monte Michael Moore, Dennis Eichhorn, Bill Schelly, Todd Clark of the nationally syndicated Lola comic strip, the award-winning poet of Miss Lost Nation Bethany Schultz Hurst, and many more. Dynamite Entertainment In December 2011, Dynamite Entertainment launched the series Lord of the Jungle, starring Tarzan. The publisher avoided using the character's name on the cover, as not to violate the trademark, even though the character is in the public domain and freely available to use but ERB, Inc. brought a lawsuit against Dynamite. In 2013, a crossover with John Carter was released entitled Lords of Mars. In 2016 Dynamite released limited series Lords of the Jungle featuring Tarzan and Sheena.Overstreet, p. 836 Other publishers During the timespan of the original comic book series from Western, DC and Marvel, a number of other comic book projects from other publishers also appeared. Charlton Comics briefly published a Tarzan comic from December 1964 ‚Äì July 1965 titled Jungle Tales of Tarzan,Overstreet, p. 800 adapting stories from that Burroughs book, on the mistaken belief that the character was in the public domain. Watson- Guptill Publications published hardcover comic book versions of the first half of Tarzan of The Apes in 1972 and four stories from Jungle Tales of Tarzan in 1976. These were illustrated by Hogarth many years after he stopped doing the newspaper strip and had a level of penmanship rarely seen in comics or even illustrations. It had captions of text from the novel instead of speech balloons. Between the periods when Marvel and Dark Horse held the licence to the character, Tarzan had no regular comic book publisher for a number of years. During this time Blackthorne Publishing published a four-issue Tarzan series in 1986, reprinting strips by Hogarth, Manning, Gil Kane, and Mike Grell. In 1992, Malibu Comics produced a five-issue miniseries entitled Tarzan the Warrior, written by Mark Wheatley with art by Neil Vokes. The first issue included two covers with one featuring painted art by Simon Bisley. There have been a number of minor appearance of Tarzan in comic books over the years. Though not mentioned by name, Tarzan is referenced in Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Places and people from the original Tarzan novels are referred to, suggesting that Tarzan does or did exist in that universe. In a 1999 The Phantom story, Lord of the Jungle, the hero meets Edgar Rice Burroughs, and inspires him to create Tarzan. Warren Ellis' Planetary series has a pastiche of Tarzan named Lord Blackstock. In 1999, Dark Horse Comics published comics featuring the Disney version of the character from the 1999 film.Overstreet, p. 637 In 2012, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc began publishing webcomics on their official website including Tarzan by writer Roy Thomas and artist Tom Grindberg and Tarzan of The Apes by Roy Thomas, artist Pablo Marcos, and colorist/letterer Oscar Gonzales. In October 2016, the Tarzan has to be drawn by Benito Gallego. =Europe= Tarzan comics were the first publications banned by the German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons after its founding in 1954. The German Tarzan #34 and 35 of the monthly series were not allowed to be sold in Germany because the agency considered them to be harmful for young readers. Westworld Publications in UK began by reprinting the bedsheet size version of Mondadori's Italian and French editions which chiefly reprinted the Foster and Hogarth Sunday pages at roughly the size in which they had originally appeared. By the mid-1950s Westworld produced a regular comic book size weekly and by 1957, under the editorship of teenaged Michael Moorcock, ran features about other Burroughs characters as well as newly-created stories and strips with a strong Burroughs flavor. After Moorcock left, having rewritten from Spanish plates (the English plates having been destroyed in the Blitz) a long Foster sequence. After Moorcock resigned his 75-year-old assistant removed all references to Burroughs or his characters, as well as all fantasy or sci fi content, and the magazine folded around 1960. During the 1970s and 1980s, Tarzan comic story was published in Greece, by Dragounis Editions (\\"Pidalio Press Corporation\\"). The European version of the Tarzan comic was published from 1983 to 1989 by Marketprint in Yugoslavia, and later translated and published in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark. There were over 100 published episodes, each of which had 16 pages. In most of them Branislav Kerac was involved, either as the writer, penciller, inker, or complete author. He was also responsible for \\"The Kalonga Star,\\" a five episode crossover between Tarzan and Kobra. Other notable episodes were \\"Tarzan and Barbarians,\\" \\"The Tiger,\\" \\"The Boy from the Stars,\\" and \\"Big Race.\\" Collected editions =Dark Horse Comics= * Tarzan: The Jesse Marsh Years ** Volume 1 collects Four Color #134 and 161 and Tarzan #1‚Äì4, 256 pages, January 2009, ** Volume 2 collects Tarzan #5‚Äì10, 224 pages, May 2009, ** Volume 3 collects Tarzan #11‚Äì16, 240 pages, September 2009, ** Volume 4 collects Tarzan #17‚Äì21, 232 pages, November 2009, ** Volume 5 collects Tarzan #22‚Äì27, 240 pages, February 2010, ** Volume 6 collects Tarzan #28‚Äì32 and Tarzan's Jungle Annual #1, 248 pages, August 2010, ** Volume 7 collects Tarzan #33‚Äì38, 224 pages, November 2010, ** Volume 8 collects Tarzan #39‚Äì43, 224 pages, February 2011, ** Volume 9 collects Tarzan #44‚Äì46 and Tarzan‚Äôs Jungle Annual #2, 240 pages, May 2011, ** Volume 10 collects Tarzan #47‚Äì51, 224 pages, December 2011, ** Volume 11 collects Tarzan #52‚Äì56 and March of Comics #125, 224 pages, July 2012, * Tarzan: The Russ Manning Years ** Volume 1 collects Tarzan #155‚Äì161, #163‚Äì164, and #166‚Äì167, 288 pages, December 2012, * Tarzan: The Joe Kubert Years ** Volume 1 collects Tarzan #207‚Äì214, 200 pages, November 2005, ** Volume 2 collects Tarzan #215‚Äì224, 208 pages, March 2006, ** Volume 3 collects Tarzan #225‚Äì235, 216 pages, July 2006, *The Unauthorized Tarzan **Jungle Tales of Tarzan #1‚Äì#4, 112 pages, March 2013, =IDW Publishing= * Joe Kubert's Tarzan of the Apes: Artist's Edition 156 pages, September 2012, References External links Tarzan comic strip at GoComics *Tarzan at Mike's Amazing World of Comics *Tarzan at the Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators *Tarzan's webcomics at Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.'s official website * Category:1929 comics debuts Category:Adventure comic strips Category:Adventure comics Category:American comic strips Category:American webcomics Category:Comics based on novels Category:Comics by Roy Thomas Category:Comics characters introduced in 1929 Category:Dark Horse Comics titles Category:DC Comics fantasy characters Category:DC Comics titles Category:Dell Comics titles Category:Dynamite Entertainment characters Category:Dynamite Entertainment titles Category:Disney comics Category:Gold Key Comics titles Category:Jungle (genre) comics Category:Marvel Comics titles Category:Serbian comics titles Comics Category:Yugoslav comics titles ","title":"Tarzan in comics"},{"id":"13680647","text":"T. M. Gray (born November 23, 1963 in Bar Harbor, Maine) is an American horror author of many short stories, several novels and a nonfiction book on ghost hunting. Gray lives in Birch Harbor, Maine and is a member of the Horror Writers Association.  Early life and education  At four years of age, Gray's family moved from Bar Harbor, Maine to nearby Winter Harbor, Maine. T. M. Gray attended schools in Gouldsboro, Maine and Sullivan, Maine and took secretarial classes in Bangor, Maine. At age 17, she wrote her first novel and met Stephen King in October 1980. In December of that year, she fell in love with Robert Gray, a lobster fisherman from Wonsqueak Harbor, Maine. They married on August 10, 1984. They have two children, son Thomas Gardner (born in 1985) and a daughter Robyn Elizabeth (born in 1991).Hubbard, John Mistress of Terror - Gouldsboro Writer‚Äôs Horror Tales Appear on the Web and in Print Ellsworth American January 3, 2002  Career  T. M. Gray's professional writing career began with short horror stories. \\"Compassion\\" was one of the first to be published (in 1999 at Bloody Muse, a zine owned by Bram Stoker winning author Weston Oches). Since then, Gray's stories have been published in print magazines such as Morbid Curiosity, Thirteen Stories, Scared Naked and in various anthologies (Small Bites, The Blackest Death, Vol. II, and Femmes de la Brumme among others). T.M. Gray's bibliography Gray's first novel, a rambling, error-ridden erotic vampire tale written in high school, was never published, nor was Gray's second novel, Eriksson's Vinlanda, a work based on the Icelandic Sagas. The third try was a success, however when Mr. Crisper (mass market size tpb) was published in 2004 by Hellbound Books, and later that year The Ravenous (trade paperback) was published by Black Death Books. Ghosts of Eden (hardcover) was published in 2005 by Five Star, a Thomson Gale imprint. Gray's nonfiction Ghosts of Maine was published by Schiffer Books in February 2008.  Writing style  In an interview with Staci Layne Wilson of About.com, T.M. Gray admits being drawn to write dark tales at a young age. \\"[Fairytales] triggered something in my psyche as a small child. Sleeping Beauty or Rapunzel, perhaps...and later on, George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead and King's novel Salem's Lot. I've been asked why I chose horror as a genre for my writing. I always say it's the other way around: horror chose me.\\" Gray revealed the most memorable thing anyone has said about her work in an interview at The Eternal Night, a book review site in Britain. Says Gray, \\"Well, a few years ago, I submitted a story to an editor who wrote back and said it was the sickest thing she ever read, but then she said it was \\"sick in the best sense of the word\\". I may be warped, but knowing that the editor had seen a lot of bizarre stuff in her career, I took her comment as a huge compliment, especially since the story was as psychological as it was gritty-physical. I went on to sell it elsewhere (twice!), and it received a Stoker recommendation, so I guess others thought it \\"sick\\" as well.\\"The Chronicle Issue 31 - \\"T.M. Gray Q&A; \\\\- The Eternal Night Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Web Site\\" Gray's books and stories take place in Maine, and according to a 2005 Library Journal review: \\"Gray (Mr. Crisper and The Ravenous) continues her tradition of creating compelling horror tales with a strong foothold in setting and regional folklore.\\" Library Journal (2005), Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier, Inc. In a 2005 interview by Kopfhalter! magazine, Gray explains why so many of her works happen in coastal Maine: \\"I like to think it's more cerebral than merely writing what I know, but when it comes right down to the wire, New England is a fairly scary place. Without question, coastal Downeast Maine is beautiful, breathtaking even, but bottom line is this: it's an isolated, harsh and natural beauty, and nature itself is neutral, neither bad nor good. It just is. Only when something terrible happens...it seems mighty evil. That's what's really frightening: the misinterpretation of events and the inability to foresee what lies ahead...\\" Kopfhalter! Winnipeg, Canada, Vol. 1, Issue 1, pgs. 23-26.  Collaborations  Over the years T.M. Gray has teamed up with other writers. In 2003, she and fellow Maine horror writer Mark Edward Hall wrote \\"The Ruby Necklace\\", a short story published by Lost Village Publishing Enterprises. In 2004, Gray and British horror writer Mark West penned the novel White Meat. A collaboration of a new novel is in the works by Gray, West and New York City horror writer, Darren Franz.Gray Splatter, Nov. 2004 issue  Reviews  Gray's books have been favorably reviewed by David Niall Wilson in Cemetery Dance magazine, Michael Laimo, James Newman and Brian Keene. A book review in the Bangor Daily News (February 2005) declares, \\"T.M. Gray proves herself a writer to watch in the horror field.\\" In an Amazon.com review, Harriet Klausner writes, \\"T.M.

It consists of about and about 135 structures. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977.. The district is located about east of Keene, New Hampshire, then north on Harrisville-Dublin Road from New Hampshire Route 101. History Harrisville Historic District in 2005 with Harris Mill on the left, and Cheshire Mill in the distance. The area of what is today the town of Harrisville, New Hampshire was originally part of the towns of Dublin and Nelson, in Cheshire County. The site of the village is located on hilly terrain on a ridge that forms the divide between the Connecticut and Merrimack rivers, approximately above sea level. In 1774, Abel Twitchel built a combination grist and saw mill on a stream running through the village. Later, Jason Harris built a blacksmith shop in the village, which until 1830 was known as Twitchell's Mills. In 1799, Jonas Clark built a clothing mill for fulling and dressing cloth. His wife also spun linen thread in the same mill. The Clarks sold their mill to James Horsley in 1804 and moved to Canada. By this time Clark's grist mill had been fitted with a wool carding machine, installed by Bethuel Harris and Abel Twitchell. It is claimed that this was only the second such machine to be installed in the entire United States. In 1822, Bethuel and Cyrus Harris constructed a brick mill on the stream for the manufacture of woolen cloths. The machinery for the mill was installed by Milan Harris. In 1833 Milan Harris and A.S. Hutchinson built a new mill, referred to as the \\"Upper Mill\\", on the site of the old grist and saw- mill.History of Harrisville, J.W. Lewis & Co., 1886 The \\"Upper Mill\\", now known as the Harris Mill, is now owned Historic Harrisville, Inc. and occupied by Harrisville Designs, which was established in 1971 to help preserve the history of the manufacture of wool yarn and cloth in the village. Cheshire Mill No. 1, with its distinctive bell tower, was constructed in 1848 by Cyrus Harris from New Hampshire granite. It was one of the last remaining operational textile mills in New England, closing its doors in 1970. The site also includes the abutting Cheshire Mill No. 2, a red brick structure built in 1859, as well as Cheshire Mill No. 3, 4 and 5, built in the early 20th century.Historic American Buildings Survey The National Historic Landmark District also includes numerous historic homes and worker cottages, several churches, a storehouse, general store and a cemetery.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries. Capture of the vessel, conversion to Union Navy use Thistle ‚Äî a sidewheel steamer ‚Äî was captured by on 4 June 1864 while running the blockade off the coast of North Carolina; sent to Boston, Massachusetts, for condemnation; purchased from the prize court on 20 July 1864; renamed Dumbarton; and commissioned on 13 August 1864, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant H. Brown in command. Assigned to search for the raider CSS Tallahassee Dumbartons first assignment was to search for raider along the Atlantic coast. She then joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Beaufort, North Carolina, and served on the blockade of Wilmington, North Carolina until 6 December 1864. Post-war activity and decommissioning After being at Norfolk Navy Yard, Dumbarton served as flagship of Rear Admiral W. Radford in the James River, Virginia from 17 February-27 March 1865. She was out of commission at Washington Navy Yard until 11 November, when she was taken to New York Navy Yard and placed in ordinary. She was sold there on 15 October 1867.

In addition to visible light, mass attenuation coefficients can be defined for other electromagnetic radiation (such as X-rays), sound, or any other beam that can be attenuated. The SI unit of mass attenuation coefficient is the square metre per kilogram (). Other common units include cm2/g (the most common unit for X-ray mass attenuation coefficients) and mL‚ãÖg‚àí1‚ãÖcm‚àí1 (sometimes used in solution chemistry). Mass extinction coefficient is an old term for this quantity. The mass attenuation coefficient can be thought of as a variant of absorption cross section where the effective area is defined per unit mass instead of per particle. Mathematical definitions Mass attenuation coefficient is defined as :\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho_m}, where *Œº is the attenuation coefficient (linear attenuation coefficient); *œÅm is the mass density. When using the mass attenuation coefficient, the Beer‚ÄìLambert law is written in alternative form as :I = I_0 \\\\, e^{-(\\\\mu/\\\\rho_m)\\\\lambda} where :\\\\lambda=\\\\rho_m \\\\ell is the area density known also as mass thickness, and \\\\ell is the length, over which the attenuation takes place. =Mass absorption and scattering coefficients= When a narrow (collimated) beam passes through a volume, the beam will lose intensity to two processes: absorption and scattering. Mass absorption coefficient, and mass scattering coefficient are defined as :\\\\frac{\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{a}}{\\\\rho_m},\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{s}}{\\\\rho_m}, where *Œºa is the absorption coefficient; *Œºs is the scattering coefficient. =In solutions= In chemistry, mass attenuation coefficients are often used for a chemical species dissolved in a solution. In that case, the mass attenuation coefficient is defined by the same equation, except that the \\"density\\" is the density of only that one chemical species, and the \\"attenuation\\" is the attenuation due to only that one chemical species. The actual attenuation coefficient is computed by :\\\\mu = (\\\\mu/\\\\rho)_1 \\\\rho_1 + (\\\\mu/\\\\rho)_2 \\\\rho_2 + \\\\ldots, where each term in the sum is the mass attenuation coefficient and density of a different component of the solution (the solvent must also be included). This is a convenient concept because the mass attenuation coefficient of a species is approximately independent of its concentration (as long as certain assumptions are fulfilled). A closely related concept is molar absorptivity. They are quantitatively related by :(mass attenuation coefficient) √ó (molar mass) = (molar absorptivity). X-rays coherent scattering, incoherent scattering, photoelectric absorption, and two types of pair production. The discontinuity of photoelectric absorption values are due to K-edge. Graph data came from NIST's XCOM database. Mass attenuation coefficient values shown for all elements with atomic number Z smaller than 100 collected for photons with energies from 1 keV to 20 MeV. The discontinuities in the values are due to absorption edges which were also shown. Tables of photon mass attenuation coefficients are essential in radiological physics, radiography (for medical and security purposes), dosimetry, diffraction, interferometry, crystallography, and other branches of physics. The photons can be in form of X-rays, gamma rays, and bremsstrahlung. The values of mass attenuation coefficients are dependent upon the absorption and scattering of the incident radiation caused by several different mechanisms such as *Rayleigh scattering (coherent scattering); *Compton scattering (incoherent scattering); *photoelectric absorption; *pair production, electron-positron production in the fields of the nucleus and atomic electrons. The actual values have been thoroughly examined and are available to the general public through three databases run by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): #XAAMDI database; #XCOM database; #FFAST database. Calculating the composition of a solution If several known chemicals are dissolved in a single solution, the concentrations of each can be calculated using a light absorption analysis. First, the mass attenuation coefficients of each individual solute or solvent, ideally across a broad spectrum of wavelengths, must be measured or looked up. Second, the attenuation coefficient of the actual solution must be measured. Finally, using the formula :\\\\mu = (\\\\mu/\\\\rho)_1 \\\\rho_1 + (\\\\mu/\\\\rho)_2 \\\\rho_2 + \\\\ldots, the spectrum can be fitted using œÅ1, œÅ2, ‚Ä¶ as adjustable parameters, since Œº and each are functions of wavelength. If there are N solutes or solvents, this procedure requires at least N measured wavelengths to create a solvable system of simultaneous equations, although using more wavelengths gives more reliable data.
