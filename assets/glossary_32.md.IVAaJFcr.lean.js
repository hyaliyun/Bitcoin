Active from 1943-1946, the battalion trained with the 17th Airborne Division; served with the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team in the Italian Campaign, Operation Dragoon, and the Battle of the Bulge; and ended the war assigned to the 13th Airborne Division before inactivation. History The 460th PFAB was formed at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James B. Anderson and utilizing cadre from the 377th PFAB. After training at Camp Toccoa and Camp Mackall, North Carolina, the battalion conducted jump training at Fort Benning, Georgia, completing its fifth training jump on 18 September 1943. Further training at Camp Mackall culminated in training maneuvers in Tennessee in January–February 1944, where the battalion participated in the \\"annihilation\\" of the 26th \\"Yankee\\" Division during a 64-mile forced march with its supported infantry.United States Army, \\"13th Airborne Division\\" (1946). World War Regimental Histories. Book 180. . Returning to Camp Mackall, the battalion was relieved from the 17th Airborne Division and attached to the 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment to form the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team (PRCT). In early May 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Anderson and his staff were relieved, replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Raymond L. Cato and officers selected from the 466th PFAB. During this short period before deployment, Lieutenant Colonel Cato ordered Battery D, originally organized as an anti-tank and anti-aircraft unit with 37mm guns and .50 caliber machine guns, converted to a fourth 75mm pack howitzer battery. After final preparations at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia, the battalion departed Hampton Roads, Virginia on 17 May 1944, aboard the USS \\"Cristobal\\".\\"The 460th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion: Unit History.\\" The U.S. Airborne World War II.

Arriving in Naples, Italy, on 31 May 1944, the 460th staged at \\"The Crater\\" outside the city for two weeks, waiting the arrival of the unit's equipment. After moving north aboard an LST to Civitavecchia, the 460th entered combat, supporting the 36th Infantry Division's attacks toward Follonica for 12 days. Throughout July 1944, the battalion staged at Frascati, near Rome. While preparing for the invasion of southern France, the Paratroopers were also able to relax with passes to Rome, the establishment of an NCO club, and other amusements. Some non-jumpers were also qualified at the Airborne Training Center south of Rome. On 12 August 1944, the battalion (less Battery C, which staged with the 1st Battalion, 517th Parachute Infantry near Canino and assaulted with 1/517 in Serial 9) staged at the Montalto Air Field for two days, before departing for France in the Serial 8. On 15 August 1944, the 460th conducted its first combat parachute assault, landing in southern France. A third of the battalion (15 plane loads) landed near the intended drop zone. Lieutenant Colonel Cato led the assembly of this group, which had four howitzers in operation by 0630 hours, and an additional two by 0800 hours. Captain Louis Vogel of Battery C assembled most of his battery and two guns near Trans-en-Provence, northwest of the drop zone and dragged the howitzers by hand back toward the assembly area. A third group, about 40–60 men from Batteries A, B and D, jumped early and landed near Frejus, France, nearly 20 miles from the intended drop zone. Consolidating under Major Edward Frank, the battalion executive officer, \\"Task Force Frank\\" neutralized an 88mm position and routed an enemy battalion on their way to the assembly area. \\"Task Force Frank\\" finally arrived at the battalion's assembly area, with four howitzers. On the evening of 15 August 1944, the battalion received the gliders of the 602nd Glider FA Battalion, doubling the artillery support to the infantry. Over the next 90 days, the 460th accompanied the 517th as it pursued the Germans north and east into the Alps, continuously providing direct support to the infantry and firing 9,130 rounds. After relief in the line, the battalion was assigned to XVIII Airborne Corps and moved from La Colle, near Nice, to Soissons in northern France by train, arriving on 9–10 December 1944.Archer, Clark, ed. \\"Paratroopers' Odyssey: A History of the 517th Parachute Combat Team.\\" 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team Association: 1985.

It stars Chris Evans, Jason Statham, Jessica Biel, Joy Bryant, Kelli Garner, and Isla Fisher. Plot Syd (Chris Evans) receives a phone call from a friend informing him that his ex-girlfriend London (Jessica Biel) is having a going-away party before she moves to California with her new boyfriend in a few days. Syd, who has been deeply depressed since London cheated on him, flies into a rage upon hearing the news, and wrecks his apartment. He decides to go to the party uninvited, bringing along Bateman (Jason Statham), a banker who delivers cocaine to Syd as a favor to their mutual dealer. After arriving at the party at the condominium belonging to the parents of club girl Rebecca (Isla Fisher), Bateman and Syd install themselves in the bathroom, where they snort line after line of cocaine, guzzle tequila and discuss love, sex, God, women and pain. Over the course of the night and a massive pile of blow, Bateman tells Syd to get on with his life. The private party-within-a-party is soon joined by Maya (Kelli Garner) and Mallory (Joy Bryant), who feign sympathy for Syd to grab some free cocaine. When Syd learns that London has arrived, Bateman challenges him to go out and talk to her. After a heated confrontation in the middle of the party, Syd and London decide to leave to talk somewhere more private. As they are leaving, a fight ensues in which Syd and Bateman fight the other male guests, barely making it out of the party. London and Syd make up in Syd's car, and later they have sex in London's apartment. In the last scene, at the airport, Syd tells London he loves her. Although this impresses London, she still leaves him.

Background Darrell Trociuk and Reni Ernst were an estranged unmarried couple who became parents to triplets in January 1996. When filling out the birth registration, Ernst had indicated the father was \\"unacknowledged by the mother\\" and that they were not together at the time. Consequently, she put \\"Ernst\\" as their surnames. However, Trociuk claimed they had agreed on registering the children's surnames as \\"Ernst-Trociuk\\" and tried to get the records changed to include his particulars. Section 3(1)(b) and 4(1)(a) of the Vital Statistics Act prevented a father from amending registrations. Trociuk applied for a declaration to have the provision struck out as unconstitutional for violating his section 15 right to equality. The Director of Vital Statistics denied the changing of the children's surnames to include their biological father's name. Trociuk took his case to the British Columbia Supreme Court, where it was heard by Justice Collver on May 17, 1999. Collver rejected Trociuk’s petition to change his children’s last names. However, he did not address the issue of whether section 3(1)(b) and 3(6)(b) violated the father’s right to equality; he decided that if it did, it would be justifiable under section 1 of the Charter. Trociuk was unhappy with Collver’s ruling and appealed his case to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. His case was heard by a panel of three judges. Two out of the three judges, Justice Southin and Newbury ruled that the judgement of the British Columbia Supreme Court would be upheld on May 23, 2001. Justice Prowse, the other judge, disagreed with her colleagues ruling concerning the Charter issue. She believed that the Vital Statistics Act violated section 15(1) of the Charter and could not be justified in a fair and democratic society (reasonable limitations clause). Trociuk then again appealed his case to the Supreme Court of Canada. It was heard December 4, 2002. On June 6, 2003, the S.C.C. released its decision to reverse the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal and deemed that section 3(1)(b) and section 3(6)(b) of the Vital Statistics Act were unconstitutional and were not justifiable in a free and democratic society (reasonable limitations clause) and should be altered. Crown's Arguments The Crown argued that this legislation put him in a disadvantaged position that it did not impose upon the mother. He claimed that this could perceived in a manner that communicated the message that a father’s relationship with their children is less worthy of respect than a mother’s relationship with her children, which is demeaning to his dignity. The Crown also argued that the association of fathers who were unacknowledged by the mother without a substantial reason with those who were excluded with reason (e.g. rape), and fathers who were incapable or unknown to the mother, is similar to stereotyping and is demeaning of the fathers’ dignity. Defense's Argument The defense argued that the infringements upon the father’s right to equality, if any, did not have a significant impact on the interest of the father and were therefore non-important. However, the judge determined that involvement in deciding the child’s name is an important part of a parent’s life and would have a significant impact on the interest of the parent. The defense also argued that the father’s claim to section 15(1) of the Charter is weakened because he isn’t one of the historically disadvantaged groups. However, the judge found this illogical. She noted that despite that the Law test states that historical disadvantage “probably the most compelling factor favouring a conclusion that differential treatment imposed by legislation is truly discriminatory” (para. 63), it doesn’t state that lack of historical disadvantage is a compelling factor against finding discrimination. Thus, this argument was misguided and irrelevant. Opinion of the court Deschamps J, writing for a Supreme Court, allowed the appeal in favour of Trociuk. It was found that section 3 of the Act violated section 15(1) of the Charter by allowing differential treatment based on sex. The provision had the effect of excluding the father's particulars from birth registration, excluding him from choosing his child's surname, and precluding any recourse. These effects were found to be arbitrary and created significant impact on the perception of the father's dignity, and consequently violated section 15(1). On the section 1 analysis, Deschamps J held the violation could not be saved because the law did not impair Trociuk's rights as little as reasonably possible. Importance This case set the precedent for all cases concerning section 15 of the Charter (equality rights).

Aromanian The names armân/arumân, just as român/rumân (Romanian), derive directly from Latin Romanus (\\"Roman\\") through regular sound changes (see Name of Romania). Adding \\"a\\" in front of certain words that begin with a consonant is a regular feature of the Aromanian language. In Greece variants include arumâni and armâni. An older form of \\"rumân\\", was still found in the 19th century, in folk songs in Greece. In Albania, the most common form is rămăńi, with occasional forms rumăńi and romăńi. The form, aromân, used especially by the Aromanians of Romania, is a modern creation, a blend of român (used by the Daco-Romanians) and arumân (used by the Aromanians in Greece). The form \\"Aromanian\\", created by analogy with the word \\"Romanian\\", was first used by Gustav Weigand in 1894/1895 to replace terms such as \\"Macedonian Vlachs\\" or \\"Macedo-Romanians\\". Vlach Vlachs was a term used in the Medieval Balkans, as an exonym of Germanic origin for all the Romanic people of the region, but nowadays, it is commonly used only for the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, the Romanians being named Vlachs only in historical context and in Serbia. Greeks also use the name kutsovlach \\"Limping Vlach\\". Macedo-Romanian Macedo-Romanian (macedo-român, derived from \\"Macedonia\\" and \\"Romanian\\") is a form created by the modern linguists and ethnologists in analogy with the other Balkan Romance languages: Daco-Romanian (or proper Romanian) in Dacia, Istro-Romanian in Istria and Megleno-Romanian in Meglena. Although quite often used, it is a rather improper form, as the Aromanians can be found all across the Balkans, not only in Macedonia.  Macedonian  One of the traditional names of Aromanians in the geographical region of Macedonia was Macedonians. It is widespread in Romania.Unirea Basarabiei şi a Bucovinei cu România 1917-1918.

In April 2007, Citroën announced that the four-door C4 would be built in Argentina. The Argentinian and Brazilian versions are sold as the C4 Pallas in some South American and European markets.

The sedan is much larger than the hatchback: its length is over the hatchback's and its wheelbase measures against of the hatchback.

Until his death on 10 March 2017, it was owned by John Surtees, the only person to have won world Grand Prix championships in both Formula One car racing and Grand Prix motorcycle racing. Situated in a woodland setting between the M2 and M20 motorways directly above High Speed 1, its proximity to London makes it Britain's busiest circuit. With seven different fleets of kart the circuit offers karting experiences for all ages and experience levels. Buckmore Park is a circuit where many current and past Formula One drivers learned their trade, including Johnny Herbert and Formula 1 champions Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton, who was originally discovered by Ron Dennis in the 1996 Champions of the Future Event held at Buckmore Park. Although Buckmore Park is primarily a race circuit, it also has on-site conference and catering facilities.  Buckmore Kart Racing School  The Buckmore Kart School has been preparing drivers for success in Motorsport since 1972 and has trained more than 20 European and British kart champions. There are both introductory and more in-depth training options for ages 8+. As well as a Bambino School & club for ages 6–7.  Types of Hire Event  Buckmore Park is well known for its Hire Kart Club which regularly hosts events for its members. One type of event is 'Sprint' style racing, where competitors compete in a series of heats and finals. Starting positions for heats place each driver at the front, middle and rear of the grid for one race, whereas finals are decided by points acquired from finishing positions in heats. Sprint events at Buckmore include the Grand Prix League, National Sprint, International Sprint and the two Junior Kart Club classes. Some individual competitors prefer 'Endurance' races, where grid positions are decided by a short qualifying session, leading to the fastest driver starting on pole. Races are then usually an hour long and include the Solo 30 enduro, Solo 45enduro, Man Of Steel and the Iron Man. Team races are also popular, and work in the same way as Endurance races but include fuel stops and driver changes. Popular team events include the 3 hour (3 hours using RT8 390cc karts for 2-4 drivers) and the 6 hour team endurance.  Star Pupil  At the end of each hire season, Buckmore hosts an annual 'Star Pupil' day, for the top drivers in all of its hire kart categories. The drivers participate in a mix of endurance and sprint events. Two guest judges will decide the winner based not only on track performance but also on their punctuality to race briefings, courtesy and general behaviour off of the track. Carl Tebbutt won the event in 2006 with Simon Rudd winning the following year. Jack Harding won in 2008, Terry Waller in 2009 and most recently in the 2010 star pupil, Matt Jones was judged the winner. Terry Waller was again the winner in 2011. Simon Rudd returned as the winner in the 2012 competition. In 2013, the event was won by Paul Janes. The 2014 event was sponsored by MINI Challenge and was won by Piers Prior, who also won the event in 2015. Buckmore have now added Rookie of the Year and both Junior and Bambino Star Pupil events.  History  The circuit saw its inception in the early 1960s when local businessman Cecil Whitehead, a keen supporter of the Scouts, saw the opportunity to allow them to participate in the fast growing pastime of kart racing by developing a track at the woodland site that the local scouts were leasing at the top of Bluebell Hill, Buckmore Park Scout Centre. Whitehead consulted with the designer of the Rye House Kart Circuit, Doug Jest, the local Rochester Motor Club and Camberley Kart Club to design the 400m circuit. Whitehead then approached the Royal School of Military Engineering in nearby Chatham and persuaded them to build the circuit as an engineering training exercise. The circuit subsequently opened in 1963 at no cost to the scouts. During the 1970s the track was used by the scouts, visitors to the park and the Rochester Motor Club but had fallen into disrepair by the 1980s due to the scouts not having enough money to maintain it. Whitehead was about to close the circuit due to safety concerns when, in 1985, new owners were found and redevelopment of the track began with their priority being to gain an MSA competition circuit licence in order to make the circuit commercially viable. After extensive restoration and resurfacing, the circuit began staging events again, with the first RACMSA event taking place in 1989. The circuit staged its first national championship in 1992 and in 1994 the track was extended to 900m. The track length was extended again in 1999 to bring it up to full international length and around the same time the unmade access road was replaced with a tarmac road. In 2003 a new £1.25m clubhouse was opened by Stirling Moss, Bernie Ecclestone and circuit part- owner John Surtees. Surtees, already the landowner of the circuit, bought out other interests and took full commercial control of the circuit for an undisclosed sum in April 2015.

Known as an \\"Interactive Music Workstation\\", the i3 broke new ground for Korg, and defined a new type of instrument - the professional auto- accompaniment workstation. Contrary to popular belief, it was not Korg's first foray into the realm of auto-accompaniment - it had a minor hit in 1985 with the SAS-20, a home keyboard with built-in speakers. Previously, the auto- accompaniment concept was not taken seriously by professional users, who saw it more the preserve of home hobbyists, and the market had been dominated by low-cost machines made by the likes of Casio and Yamaha. Roland's E-Series line had made inroads into improving the reputation of auto-accompaniment, but there was still some way to go. Retailing for $2500, the i3 used a 32-voice tone generation system derived from the X3, using the company's familiar AI2 synthesis system. All 340 tones were user-editable (max. 64 user voices could be saved in backed RAM + 2 user drum sets) and sampled at 32 kHz. The auto- accompaniment section consisted of 48 in-built styles, each consisting of 4 variations, 2 fill-ins, and 2 intros/endings. There were a further 4 \\"blank\\" spaces for user styles to be loaded into non-volatile RAM via a 3.5\\" DD floppy disk and 4 from a memory card. There were also two sequencers; a conventional 16-track General MIDI compatible system for the editing and playback of SMF data, whilst there was also a \\"Backing Sequencer\\" - effectively a simple recorder for recording of performances using the auto-accompaniment system, but had the ability to add a further 10 tracks over this. The most obvious sign to the user that the i3 was a departure from the usual auto-accompaniment keyboard format was the lack of built in speakers. Early reviews of the i3 were favourable, and the company released a 76-note version (the i2) shortly afterward, whilst a version equipped with speakers, the i4S debuted in 1994. A further cut down version (the i5S) followed in 1996. The auto-accompaniment workstation concept was quickly imitated by other manufacturers, most notably Roland's G-800, launched in 1995. Korg replaced the i3 in 1998 with the i30, and its speakered siblings the iS40 and iS50.

This page contains terms starting with T – Z. Select a letter from the table of contents to find terms on other pages. T * Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: An educational taxonomy that classifies educational objectives into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. * Teacher: In education, one who teaches students or pupils, often a course of study, lesson plan, or a practical skill, including learning and thinking skills. There are many different ways to teach and help students learn. This is often referred to as the teacher's pedagogy. When deciding what teaching method to use, a teacher will need to consider students' background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized curriculum as determined by their school district. * Technology education: The study of the human ability to create and use tools to shape the natural environment to meet their needs. The goal of technology education is to spread technological literacy which is accomplished by bringing laboratory activities to students. The term \\"technology education\\" is frequently shortened to \\"tech ed\\". * Technology Integration: A term used by educators to describe effective uses of technology by teachers and students in K-12 and university classrooms. Teachers use technology to support instruction in language arts, social studies, science, math, or other content areas. When teachers integrate technology into their classroom practice, learners are empowered to be actively engaged in their learning. * Tertiary education: (also referred to as third-stage or third level education) The educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education such as a high school, secondary school, or gymnasium. Tertiary education is commonly higher education which prepares students for a quaternary education. :Colleges and universities are examples of institutions that provide tertiary education. The term Tertiary education can also be used to refer to vocational education and training. * Textbook: A manual of instruction or a standard book in any branch of study. They are classified by both the target audience and the subject. Textbooks are usually published by specialty printers to serve every request for an understanding of every subject that can be taught. It is a big business that requires mass volume sales to make the publications profitable. Although most textbooks are only published in printed format with hard covers, some can now be viewed online. * Theory of cognitive development: A developmental psychology theory developed by Jean Piaget to explain cognitive development. The theory is central to child psychology and is based on schemata--schemes of how one perceives the world--in \\"critical periods,\\" times when children are particularly susceptible to certain information. * Theory of multiple intelligences: A psychological and educational theory formulated by Howard Gardner espousing that eight kinds of \\"intelligence\\" exist in humans, each relating to a different sphere of human life and activity. * The Times Higher Education Supplement:, (also known as The Times Higher or The THES) A newspaper based in London that reports specifically on issues related to higher education. It is owned by TSL Education, which was, until October 2005, a division of News International. The paper is edited by John O'Leary, author of The Times Good University Guide. The THES is probably best known for publishing The Times Higher World University Rankings (see college and university rankings), which first appeared in November 2004, with new rankings published annually. * Training: Refers to the acquisition of knowledge, skills, attitudes as a result of the teaching of vocational or practical skills and knowledge and relates to specific useful skills. It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at technical colleges or polytechnics. Today it is often referred to as professional development. * Truth: When someone sincerely agrees with an assertion, he or she is claiming that it is the truth. Philosophy seeks answers for certain questions about truth and the word truth. * Tuition: A fee charged for educational instruction especially at a formal institution of learning. Tuition is charged by educational institutions to assist with funding of staff and faculty salaries, course offerings, lab equipment, computer systems, libraries, and facility upkeeping. Fees are also used to fund facilities that provide a comfortable learning experience for its students, such as student lounges. U * Understanding: A psychological process related to an abstract or physical object, such as, person, situation and message whereby one is able to think about it and use concepts to deal adequately with that object. * UNESCO: The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, commonly known as UNESCO, is a specialized agency of the United Nations established in 1945. Its purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through education, science, and culture in order to further universal respect for justice, the rule of law, and the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the UN Charter. * Universal preschool: The notion that access to preschool should be available to families similar to Kindergarten. Child advocates have different definitions of the definition of who is included and how it is to be funded. There has been a move to change the name to Preschool for All. Like Kindergarten, the concept is to have a voluntary program, unlike education, that is mandated by law in the United States with exceptions to allow for homeschooling and alternative education. * University: An institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which awards academic degrees in various academic disciplines. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. * Unobservables: Entities whose existence, nature, properties, qualities or relations are not observable. In the philosophy of science typical examples of \\"unobservables\\" are atomic particles, the force of gravity, causation and beliefs or desires. However, philosophers also characterize all objects—trees, tables, other minds, microbiological things and so on to which humans ascribe as the thing causing their perception—as unobservable. V A blacksmith is a traditional trade. * Virtual learning environment: (VLE) A software system designed to facilitate teachers in the management of educational courses for their students, especially by helping teachers and learners with course administration. The system can often track the learners' progress, which can be monitored by both teachers and learners. While often thought of as primarily tools for distance education, they are most often used to supplement the face-to-face classroom. * Visual learning: A proven teaching method in which graphic organizers, such as webs, concept maps idea maps, and slide shows are used to help students of all ages think and learn more effectively. * Vocational education: (or Vocational Education and Training (VET)) Prepares learners for careers or professions that are traditionally non-academic and directly related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation, hence the term, in which the learner participates. It is sometimes referred to as technical education, as the learner directly specialises in a particular narrow technique of using technology. W * Waldorf education Waldorf education (also known as Steiner education) is a humanistic approach to pedagogy based on the educational philosophy of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. Learning is interdisciplinary, integrating practical, artistic, and conceptual elements. The approach emphasizes the role of the imagination in learning, developing thinking that includes a creative as well as an analytic component. * Whole language: A term used by reading teachers to describe an instructional philosophy which focuses on reading as an activity best taught in a broader context of meaning. Rather than focusing on reading as a mechanical skill, it is taught as an ongoing part of every student's existing language and life experience. Building on language skills each student already possesses, reading and writing are seen as a part of a broader \\"whole language\\" spectrum. * Wisdom: The ability to make correct judgments and decisions. It is an intangible quality gained through experience some think. Yet others think it is a quality that even a child, otherwise immature, may possess independent of experience or complete knowledge. Whether or not something is wise is determined in a pragmatic sense by its popularity, how long it has been around, and its ability to predict against future events. Wisdom is also accepted from cultural, philosophical and religious sources. Some think of wisdom as foreseeing consequences and acting to maximize beneficial results. * Writing: May refer to two activities: the inscribing of characters on a medium, with the intention of forming words and other constructs that represent language or record information, and the creation of material to be conveyed through written language. (There are some exceptions; for example, the use of a typewriter to record language is generally called typing, rather than writing.) Writing refers to both activities equally, and both activities may often occur simultaneously. * Workshop: A brief intensive course, a seminar or a series of meetings emphasizing interaction and exchange of information among a usually small number of participants.. X *Xylophone: a musical instrument that is used in elementary music classes. It is simple to use and the teacher can add or remove \\"accidental\\" notes (sharped and flatted pitches) so that the instrument can play in different keys. Z *Zero tolerance policy: A policy that states that prohibited behaviors and actions will not be tolerated—no exceptions. Zero tolerance policies have different prohibitions, which may includem inter alia, contraband such as weapons, illegal drugs, or actions such as bullying, harassment, or violence.

Helmingham Hall is a moated manor house in Helmingham, Suffolk, England. It was begun by John Tollemache in 1480 and has been owned by the Tollemache family ever since. The house is built around a courtyard in typical late medieval/Tudor style. The house is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England, and its park and formal gardens are also Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. History The present Helmingham Hall may have been initially constructed in 1510 on the site of an earlier house called Creke Hall. The exterior was altered between 1745–1760, again in 1800 by John Nash, and in 1840. The original half-timbered walls have been concealed by brick and tiles. The house is surrounded by a moat 60 feet wide, over which it is reached only by two working drawbridges, which have been pulled up every night since 1510. These were originally operated with a windlass but in recent years this has been replaced by an electric motor. In addition to the house and gardens, several other buildings and structures on the estate are listed Grade II. The garden wall to the south west of the hall, two urns and a male and female statue, a sundial and an obelisk, the tea rooms, bridge, game larder, and revetment are all listed Grade II. The gate lodge to the north east of the hall and the left and right front lodges are also listed Grade II, as is the entrance gateway and piers between the front lodges. The Church of St Mary on the edge of the park has connections with the Tollemache family dating back to the Middle Ages. Gardens The house is not open to the public and Helmingham is best known for its fine garden, which is open to the public from May to September. It is a semi-formal mixed garden with extensive borders, a rose garden, a knot garden, a parterre and an orchard. Beyond the garden there is a park with herds of red and fallow deer. Lady (Alexandra) Tollemache is a garden designer who works under the name Xa Tollemache. She supervises the gardens at Helmingham and has also worked on the Millennium Garden at Castle Hill in Devon, Dunbeath Castle in Scotland, and the Cloister Garden at Wilton House.  Treasures of Helmingham  The Tollemaches of Helmingham own one of the only two English Orpharion viols.Gill, Donald (July 1960) \\"The orpharion and bandora.\\" The Galpin Society Journal. Vol. 13. Their instrument is dated 1580 and bears the label of John Rose, a 16th-century English viol-maker. Of the four John Rose viols which survive, this is the only one in private hands. It is believed to have been made for Queen Elizabeth I who presented it to them during one of her visits to Suffolk. The \\"Tollemache lute manuscript\\" was acquired from the Helmingham Hall collections and sold by Sotheby's in 1965 to Robert Spencer. It was written by Henry Sampson. Robert Spencer, the present owner of the manuscript, maintains \\"Tollemache\\" in its common reference, despite the change of owner. In media In May 2018 the hall was the venue for BBC One's Antiques Roadshow. It also appeared in the 2019 BBC documentary Danny Dyer's Right Royal Family.

The English edition was published in 1987 by Harvard University Press. It is written in a textbook style, and contains a full-featured approach to the empirical study of science and technology. Moreover, it also entertains ontological conceptions and theoretical discussions making it a research monograph and not a methodological handbook per se. In the first chapter Latour develops the methodological dictum that science and technology must be studied \\"in action\\", or \\"in the making\\". Because scientific discoveries turn esoteric and difficult to understand, it has to be studied where discoveries are made in practice. For example, Latour turns back time in the case of the discovery of the \\"double helix\\". Going back in time, deconstructing statements, machines and articles, it is possible to arrive at a point where scientific discovery could have chosen to take many other directions (contingency). Also the concept of \\"black box\\" is introduced. A black box is a metaphor borrowed from cybernetics denoting a piece of machinery that \\"runs by itself\\". That is, when a series of instructions are too complicated to be repeated all the time, a black box is drawn around it, allowing it to function only by giving it \\"input\\" and \\"output\\" data. For example, a CPU inside a computer is a black box. Its inner complexity doesn't have to be known; one only needs to use it in his/her daily activities. Criticism Latour's work, including Science in Action, has received heavy criticism from some scholars. Olga Amsterdamska's highly critical book review concluded with the following sentence: \\"Somehow, the ideal of a social science whose only goal is to tell inconsistent, false, and incoherent stories about nothing in particular does not strike me as very appealing or sufficiently ambitious.\\"Amsterdamska, Olga.

Erosion control In 2004–2005, the National Park Service undertook a significant erosion control project at Outer Island, to stabilize the bluff which had proved susceptible to erosion since the station's earliest days. The project followed a similar effort completed the previous year at the Raspberry Island Lighthouse, and consisted of a three- part strategy: armoring the cliff base with a massive stone wall; improving drainage on the upper grounds to prevent runoff from undercutting the clay bank; and stabilizing the bluff face with \\"bio-engineering,\\" i.e. planting carefully selected vegetation to anchor the slope. The rock wall at the bottom and drainage system at the top were completed, but a shortage of funds required scaling back the bio-engineering plans, and only the most critical sections of the bluff face were treated.U.S. National Park Service, Annual Reports, Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, on file at AINL headquarters, Bayfield, Wisconsin Notable incidents On September 2, 1905, Outer Island Keeper John Irvine performed a heroic rescue, when the 337-foot, three-masted schooner-barge Pretoria lost the line to its towing steamer Venezuela during a fierce storm. The Pretoria attempted to anchor about off the island, but when the ship began to break up, the ten-man crew attempted to flee in a lifeboat. Sixty-one-year-old keeper Irvine was alone on the island, his assistants having gone to town, but when the lifeboat flipped in the surf, he waded into the waves and rescued five of the ten men. On that same night, the steamer Sevona also sank in the Apostle Islands, striking a reef near the Sand Island Lighthouse, with the loss of seven men.

Never a leading man in sound films mainly due to his difficult to interpret accent, he established later in his career, and with the advent of talkies, many character roles, in which he mostly portrayed villains or Nazis in both American and British films with his trademark German accent such as the Ernst Lubitsch film, To Be or Not to Be (1942). Death Henry Victor died in 1945, aged 52, from a brain tumour. He is buried in Chatsworth, California, at the Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery.

A split jump is a sequence of body movements in which a split is performed after jumping, while the performer is still in the air. Split jumps are commonly found in dance, figure skating, and gymnastics, and may also be used as a form of exercise. In figure skating Split jumps are a category of figure skating jumps in which the skater achieves a split position in the air. Unlike most figure skating jumps, split jumps are positional jumps, rather than rotational jumps; the point of them is to achieve a position in the air, not to rotate a specific number of times. Most split jumps are derived from the half flip, a half-rotation jump with a flip entry. Split jumps can also be done with half Lutz or falling leaf (a loop jump with a half-revolution in the air) entries. More rarely, full- rotation flip and Lutz jumps can be done with a split. These jumps are known as the split flip and split Lutz. As an alternative to the standard front split, some skaters perform a Russian split, with legs in a straddle split. The only difference between this and a split jump is the position in the air. The legs extend straight out, with the toes pointed. Skaters often touch their toes as part of a Russian split. Another variation is the stag jump, in which the forward leg is bent in front while the back leg kicks out as in the regular split jump. Both the Russian split and stag jump can be done from the same jump entries as the regular split jumps. Bending both legs in a stag jump is sometimes called a double stag jump. Split jumps are considered fairly basic jumps in figure skating, but they can be very dramatic when performed well. The challenge is for the skater to achieve a full horizontal split or straddle position at the apex of the jump, which requires both body flexibility and a strong spring into the air.

It was directed by Brian Yuzna. The film stars Corbin Bernsen, Jillian McWhirter, Jeff Doucette, and Susanne Wright. Plot Dr. Alan Feinstone is in the maximum security mental hospital he was sentenced to at the end of the first film. While talking to the psychiatrist, he remembers the murders he committed in his own mind, while convincing the doctor that it was another man who did those things. His remorseful story distracts her from seeing him pull a sharpened tool that he stitched into his own leg, and he uses her as a hostage to escape. Alan's wife Brooke is alive despite her missing tongue and inability to speak (she has since had new dental implants put in to replace all the teeth that Alan pulled out in the first film). She hires an investigator to find out where Alan has escaped to, believing that he had been putting away money before he went crazy. Brooke has in her possession some postcards that Alan had left behind, and she believes he is in one of those places. Alan winds up in the small town of Paradise, Missouri, pretending that he had grown upset at life in the big city. He uses a previously established false identity of Dr. Lawrence Caine, and has a bank account where he had been sending the money he skimmed off from his practice to hide from the IRS. The bank officer Mr. Wilkes introduces Alan to his niece Jamie, hoping that she can rent out her small cottage for \\"Larry\\" to live in so she could collect money from it. Jamie, who physically resembles Brooke, becomes a target of Alan’s affections. When he has problems with a cap on one of his teeth, Alan visits the inept town dentist, Dr. Burns, whom he takes an instant disliking to. Alan threatens Dr. Burns with a golf club, causing him to accidentally fall down the stairs to his death. Mr. Wilkes convinces Alan that he should take over as the new dentist for Paradise; Alan soon resumes his murderous ways with a passing tourist (Clint Howard) who accidentally recognizes him from Los Angeles. As the private detective tracks Alan down to Paradise, Alan learns that Jamie has an admirer named Robbie, who also is the drywall contractor hired to finish his new office. Alan's jealousy causes him to ruin a romantic dinner when it is interrupted by a call from Robbie on her answering machine, despite Jamie's insistence that she only thinks of Robbie as a friend. Meanwhile, Beverley, a teller at the bank, has doubts about \\"Larry\\" and finds out his real identity while researching on the computer. Beverley sets up an appointment to tell him she knows the truth, but when she asks too many questions he realizes that she knows something. He goes behind her and sedates her with nitrous oxide. She finds herself duct taped to the dental chair and cries and begs him to let her go. He puts a mouth clamp in her mouth to keep it open and drills her bottom- right molar tooth to the raw nerve as a \\"lie detector\\" to find out who else she has told. If she lied, he would take a sharp plaque scraping hook and painfully force it into the nerve of the tooth he drilled, wiggling the tooth hard at the same time. He repeatedly jams the hook into the exposed nerve causing Beverly tremendous pain. Robbie comes to install some more drywall and rings the office door bell, leaving Alan no choice but to pause his torture session and answer the door. Robbie asks to come in and after Beverley screams Robbie goes rushing to check on her. Just as Robbie is about to rescue her, Feinstone attacks him from outside the doorway. In the ensuing fight, Alan kills Robbie with a hammer, turns back to Beverley and re-tapes her to the dental chair. He takes a pair of dental pliers and plays a game of \\"truth or tooth\\". He asks her what did she tell Jeremy about Washington but he doesn't believe her then pulls out her left front tooth, then he asks her what she did tell Jamie. He then attempts to pull her left incisor tooth out, but instead he breaks it by accident which angers Feinstone even more. Alan then painfully drills one of her bottom front teeth down to the nerve, and continues to drill so hard that the dental clamp holding her mouth slips out from the pressure he's applying. Then, out of a final act of desperation and what seems to be her only defense, she bites down hard on the drill causing it to lock up and jam inside her teeth. Infuriated, the mad dentist tells her he has a much better idea, and that he will cut the drill out of her mouth. She then screams, and the scene comes to a close. Later that night Alan begins to have his obsessive-compulsive visions of germs and decay again after seeing his blood-stained uniform. Suddenly Brooke appears, and begins to seduce him into one of his chairs; just before she can cut his tongue off with a pair of scissors, Jamie knocks her out with an overhead lamp. However, as Jamie is calling the police about Brooke, she spots the bloody hatchet, and opens a closet door to find Robbie's and Beverley's maimed corpses. Alan turns on Jamie and a fight ensues, with him chasing her to an upstairs bathroom and finally overpowering her. He takes her to an unfinished room in the office, which in his mind is spotless, germ-free and pure white, with opera music playing, and picks up an electric drill (which in his mind is a dental drill) and tries to drill her teeth. Jamie escapes and hides, until Brooke has revived and she and Jamie trap Alan in a hallway. Brooke lunges to stab him with a pair of scissors, but Jamie inadvertently hits her over the head with a 2x4, killing her. Alan finds Jamie hiding behind some drywall, and after banter between the two, Jamie fires a nail gun repeatedly and hits him with numerous nails. Stunned, Alan walks downstairs into the midst of a surprise welcome party being given to him by the people of Paradise. Alan calmly exits out the front door, leaving the townpeople shocked and Jamie to recover from what just happened. Alan drives off into the night with numerous nails embedded in his head and shoulders. He begins to pull them out, using one as a toothpick for his cap which was lost in his fights with Jamie and Brooke, and maniacally laughs repeatedly.

DIRAVI is an acronym for \\"Direction à rappel asservi\\" literally meaning \\"steering with controlled return\\" more accurately described in English as \\"power steering with power assisted return\\".http://www.curbsideclassic.com/uncategorized/cohort- classic-1981-citroen-cx-pallas-d-modernisms-last-stand/ In the UK, it was marketed as VariPower and in the U.S. as SpeedFeel. This was the first commercially available variable assist power steering arrangement, allowing the motorist power assist when parking, but recognizing that less steering assistance was needed at high speed.http://www.cnet.com/videos/top-5-citroen- sm-innovations-that-saw-the-future/ This feature is now spreading to mainstream vehicles, using electrical motors rather than hydraulic actuation. Citroën engineer Paul Magès invented the system as part of its effort to engineer a practical high horsepower, front wheel drive car - a new type of vehicle at the time.http://jalopnik.com/264002/citroen-sm This DIRAVI system is an addition to the integrated Citroën hydropneumatic suspension and braking system. These all drew power from an engine driven pump and hydraulic accumulator. This unique Citroën power operated self centring steering system is fitted to Citroën SM, Citroën CX (most), Citroën XM (early Left Hand drive V6), Maserati Quattroporte II and Maserati Khamsin. How It Works  The steering wheel is connected to the hydraulic control unit, which contains a slide valve, the control gears and linkage, and the centring piston and cam. The steering rack pinion is connected to the hydraulic control unit through an adjuster, to allow setting of the centre point of the steering. This then drives one of the control gears, the other being driven by the steering wheel. The control linkage consists of two gears coupled with rods through ball- joints. When the gears are turned relative to each other, the rods move the slide valve, allowing fluid in or out of the rack. This moves the rack, which in turn moves its pinion, turning the control gears back to their centre position. Compare this with a conventional power steering system, which relies on the flexing of a strong spring to control the valve. The steering rack is almost conventional. As with a normal power-assisted steering setup, there is a rack-and-pinion, and a stepped hydraulic ram with a dividing plate (the piston) in the middle. On one side of the plate, the piston area is half the area of the other, giving twice the area for the fluid to work on. Thus, with full system pressure on the small area side of the ram, and half system pressure on the large area side, the ram remains perfectly balanced and centred. This is because the lower pressure is working on a larger surface area. The smaller side of the piston is at constant hydraulic pressure, the other side only varies in pressure. NOTE: The author seems to be describing the DS power steering piston and rod, on which the piston is in the middle of the rod. The SM's steering cylinder has the piston on the end of the rod, which rod's cross-sectional area is half the area of the other side of the piston. Full hydraulic pressure is admitted to the rod side at all times while the pressure on the other side of the piston (its \\"head\\") is regulated.Citroen factory repair and parts manuals The steering actually had the same \\"assist\\" at all speeds — the steering was hydraulically locked against steering movement of the wheels from the road (\\"feedback\\") up to the capacity of the unit. The reduction in 'assist' was achieved by a piston/roller pushing on a heart shaped cam geared to the steering shaft (hence the one turn to full lock), which was fed with system pressure so that as its pressure rose with increasing road speed, the steering assistance seemingly reduced and the steering centering effort rose. However, full steering wheel turning was available at all speeds, though considerable force was necessary to turn the steering wheel at high road speed. Enough pressure was admitted to the centering unit to return the wheels to the straight ahead position when the car was not moving. The centering pressure was regulated by a flyweight centrifugal governor driven by the pinion (secondary) shaft of the manual gearbox and by a proportioning valve connected to the fluid pressure in the automatic gearbox, which pressure was proportional to the speed of the output shaft. The pressure increased all the way to , and a subsidiary function of this feed was to turn off the air conditioning fans above . When there is no pressure available to operate the ram, the steering wheel will mechanically move the rack directly but with significant play through a split shaft.http://www.curbsideclassic.com/uncategorized/cohort- classic-1981-citroen-cx-pallas-d-modernisms-last-stand/ One side from the steering wheel drives a pin which mates with a slot on the output shaft connected to the rack. The free play in this emergency mechanical system is necessary for the normal play free pressure operated Diravi system to operate its feedback control loop. In practice this heavy & inaccurate manual steering character of Diravi is only required when the hydraulic system has failed, whence emergency system prioritisation firstly sacrifices the steering system. Added NOTE: The mechanical unpowered steering effort is very heavy. Driving the car without power to the steering should be used only to guide the car to a safe place to stop. Attempting to turn the steering wheel without power when the car is not moving may break the steering wheel.Personal experience! Because the DIRAVI system is much more sensitive than conventional systems, something must be done to prevent the driver over-controlling at high speeds. This is the job of the heart shaped centring cam inside the unit. A pressure loaded piston with a roller on the end runs against the edge of this cam. This pressure comes from a centrifugal governor proportioning valve driven from the gearbox (on manual gearboxes - on automatic gearboxes the gearbox's internal governor pressure controls the centring pressure). At low speeds, the centring piston pressure is 290 psig, to provide a light degree of self centring when parking etc. Proportionally the self centring pressure rises to a maximum of about 800 psig. at 80 km/h, at which self centring forces become a maximum, stiffening the steering but not excessively so. Features  * Fully hydraulic (no direct mechanical connection between the steering wheel shaft and the steering pinion during normal operation). * Power operated unlike conventional power assisted steering systems. * Rapid self centering to straight ahead position - whenever the engine is running the steering wheel will return to center, even when parked * Artificial feel inbuilt - centering force varies in proportion to vehicle speed and/or steering wheel deflection. * Power for the system from a regulated high pressure hydraulic pump which also operates the brakes and suspension system. * The steering is operated by a rack and pinion system which normally only works as a feedback loop. * The rack takes the form of a double acting hydraulic ram, but is capable of taking over full steering function in the event of a hydraulic failure. During normal operation the rack and pinion merely provides a position indication to the steering control valve through the pinion shaft. The rack and pinion do the actual steering only in the absence of system hydraulic pressure. * A hydraulic power safety prioritisation valve sets hydraulic fluid availability to each circuit in the Citroën system. * In a hydraulic system failure, order of loss is first steering, then suspension, then brakes Advantages  * No steering kickback - blowouts, potholes, ruts, etc. cannot affect the steering wheel or the direction of the steered wheels which can only be moved by steering wheel input, since apparent feedback is entirely artificial and bears no relation to the actual forces on the front wheels from the vehicle's inertia and the roadway * Requires minimal physical exertion - In the SM the steering wheel can be turned lock-to-lock with one finger when the car is standing * Very fast (minor steering inputs equal large front wheel movements) – 2.0 turns lock to lock in SM configuration, 2.5 in the CX * Can be set up permitting vehicle to travel in a straight line without driver input on a constant camber road in still conditions Disadvantages  * No feedback to the driver - apparent feedback is entirely artificial and bears no relation to the actual forces on the front wheels from the vehicle's inertia and the roadway * Driver must survey visual cues to determine approach of roadholding limit * Requires familiarization - novices find DIRAVI too fast and sensitive * Cannot allow both hands to leave steering wheel when navigating curves - because of rapid self centering * The absence of a firm mechanical linkage between the road wheels and the steering wheel means that any hydraulic-system malfunction could engender a serious loss of vehicle-control accuracy.

The World Business Council for Sustainable Development provides a definition: “Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln, replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels, like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Sometimes they can only be used after pre-processing to provide ‘tailor-made’ fuels for the cement process“ RDF consists largely of combustible components of such waste, as non recyclable plastics (not including PVC), paper cardboard, labels, and other corrugated materials. These fractions are separated by different processing steps, such as screening, air classification, ballistic separation, separation of ferrous and non ferrous materials, glass, stones and other foreign materials and shredding into a uniform grain size, or also pelletized in order to produce a homogeneous material which can be used as substitute for fossil fuels in e.g. cement plants, lime plants, coal fired power plants or as reduction agent in steel furnaces. RDF can be also further specified into e.g. tyre derived fuels (TDF) from used tyres, or solid recovered fuels (SRF) Others describe the properties, such as: * Secondary fuels * Substitute fuels * Solid recovered fuels (SRF) * “Climafuel®” as trade name from Cemex * “AF“ as an abbreviation for alternative fuels * Ultimately most of the designations are only general paraphrases for alternative fuels which are either waste- derived or biomass-derived. There is no universal exact classification or specification which is used for such materials. Even legislative authorities have not yet established any exact guidelines on the type and composition of alternative fuels. The first approaches towards classification or specification are to be found in the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesgütegemeinschaft für Sekundärbrennstoffe) as well as at European level (European Recovered Fuel Organisation). These approaches which are initiated primarily by the producers of alternative fuels, follow a correct approach: Only through an exactly defined standardisation in the composition of such materials can both production and utilisation be uniform worldwide. First approaches towards alternative fuel classification: Solid recovered fuels are part of RDF in the fact that it is produced to reach a standard such as CEN/343 ANAS.CEN/TC 343 - Published standards A comprehensive review is now available on SRF / RDF production, quality standards and thermal recovery, including statistics on European SRF quality.Velis C. et al. (2010) Production and quality assurance of solid recovered fuels using mechanical—biological treatment (MBT) of waste: a comprehensive assessment  History  In the fifties of the last century tyres were used for the first time as refuse derived fuel in the cement industry. Continuous use of various waste-derived alternative fuels then followed in the mid-eighties with “Brennstoff aus Müll“ (BRAM) – fuel from waste – in the Westphalian cement industry in Germany. At that time the thought of cost reduction through replacement of fossil fuels was the priority as considerable competition pressure weighed down on the industry. Since the eighties the German Cement Works Association (Verein Deutscher Zementwerke e.V. (VDZ, Düsseldorf)) has been documenting the use of alternative fuels in the federal German cement industry. In 1987 less than 5% of fossil fuels were replaced by refuse derived fuels, in 2015 its use increased to almost 62%. Refuse-derived fuels are used in a wide range of specialized waste to energy facilities, which are using processed refuse- derived fuels with lower calorific values of 8-14MJ/kg in grain sizes of up to 500 mm to produce electricity and thermal energy (heat/steam) for district heating systems or industrial uses. Processing Materials such as glass and metals are removed during the treatment processing since they are non- combustible. The metal is removed using a magnet and the glass using mechanical screening. After that, an air knife is used to separate the light materials from the heavy ones. The light materials have higher calorific value and they create the final RDF. The heavy materials will usually continue to a landfill. The residual material can be sold in its processed form (depending on the process treatment) as a plain mixture or it may be compressed into pellet fuel, bricks or logs and used for other purposes either stand-alone or in a recursive recycling process.Williams, P. (1998) Waste Treatment and Disposal. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester RDF is extracted from municipal solid waste and other waste using a mix of mechanical and/or biological treatment methods. The production of RDF may involve the following steps: *Bag splitting/Shredding *Size screening *Magnetic separation *Air classifier (density separation) *Coarse shredding *Refining separation by infrared separation End markets RDF can be used in a variety of ways to produce electricity. It can be used alongside traditional sources of fuel in coal power plants. In Europe RDF can be used in the cement kiln industry, where the strict standards of the Waste Incineration Directive are met. RDF can also be fed into plasma arc gasification modules & pyrolysis plants. Where the RDF is capable of being combusted cleanly or in compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, RDF can provide a funding source where unused carbon credits are sold on the open market via a carbon exchange. However, the use of municipal waste contracts and the bankability of these solutions is still a relatively new concept, thus RDF's financial advantage may be debatable. The European market for the production of RDF have been grown fast due to e.g. the European landfill directive, or landfill taxes e.g. in UK and Ireland. Refuse derived fuel (RDF) exports from the UK to Europe and beyond are expected to have reached 3.3 million tonnes in 2015, representing a near-500,000 tonnes increase on the previous year. Measurement of the biomass fraction of RDF and SRF The biomass fraction of RDF and SRF has a monetary value under multiple greenhouse gas protocols, such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and the Renewable Obligation Certificate program in the United Kingdom. Biomass is considered to be carbon-neutral since the liberated from the combustion of biomass is recycled in plants. The combusted biomass fraction of RDF/SRF is used by stationary combustion operators to reduce their overall reported emissions. Several methods have been developed by the European CEN 343 working group to determine the biomass fraction of RDF/SRF. The initial two methods developed (CEN/TS 15440) were the manual sorting method and the selective dissolution method. Since each method suffered from limitations in properly characterizing the biomass fraction, an alternative method was developed using the principles of radiocarbon dating. A technical review (CEN/TR 15591:2007) outlining the carbon-14 method was published in 2007, and a technical standard of the carbon dating method (CEN/TS 15747:2008) was published in 2008.European Committee for Standardization, list of published standards In the United States, there is already an equivalent carbon-14 method under the standard method ASTM D6866. Although carbon-14 dating can determine the biomass fraction of RDF/SRF, it cannot determine directly the biomass calorific value. Determining the calorific value is important for green certificate programs such as the Renewable Obligation Certificate program. These programs award certificates based on the energy produced from biomass. Several research papers, including the one commissioned by the Renewable Energy Association in the UK, have been published that demonstrate how the carbon-14 result can be used to calculate the biomass calorific value. Regional use=Campania In 2009, in response to the Naples waste management issue in Campania, Italy, the Acerra incineration facility was completed at a cost of over €350 million. The incinerator burns 600,000 tons of waste per year. The energy produced from the facility is enough to power 200,000 households per year.https://ejatlas.org/conflict/urban-waste-incinerator-of-acerra Iowa The first full-scale waste-to-energy facility in the US was the Arnold O.

In ancient times, the city was situated at the mouth of the Pyramus (which has changed course since), on a hill opposite Magarsa (or Magarsus) which served as its port. The district was called from it, Mallotis. The location of the site is currently inland a few km from the Mediterranean coast on an elevation in the Karataş Peninsula, Adana Province, Turkey, a few km from the city of Karataş. History Greek legend credited the establishment of Mallus to two Argive brothers named Amphilochus and Mopsus. Amphilochus is variously described as the king and seer who was the son of Amphiaraus and the brother of Alcmaeon; Alcmaeon's son; or, in Strabo, either of these figures understood as a demigod son of Apollo. Both Amphiaraus's son and Alcmaeon's son were in the generations said to have witnessed the Trojan War. Amphilochus and Mopsus were said to have left that conflict and founded MallusArrian, Anab. ii. 5. and some other oracles and towns before either returning to Argos or killing one another. Visitors to the oracle, which continued as late as Plutarch, slept overnight in the temple and their dreams were considered to be the gods' answer to their questions. Persian Achaemenid Empire coin minted in Mallus, dated Coastline near Mallus Alexander the Great erected a bridge over the Pyramus and visited Mallus during his conquest of the region, and at Mallus he performed sacrifices to Amphilochus. Alexander also exempted the town from paying taxes, because it was a colony of the Argives, and he himself claimed to have sprung from Argos, being one of the descendants of Heracles.ARRIAN, ANABASIS OF ALEXANDER, § 2.5.9 Triremes from Mallus joined Alexander's navy and participated at the Siege of Tyre.ARRIAN, ANABASIS OF ALEXANDER, § 2.20.2 It allied itself with Tarsus against Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who according to the Bible, had presented both cities to his concubine Antiochis.2 Maccabees, 4:30, 31. Mallus was a town of considerable importance, though it does not appear to have possessed any particular attractions. In the second century B.C., it was the hometown of the notable philosopher and grammarian Crates of Mallus, credited with having built the first known globe; however, he left the city at a young age and his scholarly career mainly took place elsewhere. Its port-town was Magarsa, though in later times it seems to have had a port of its own, called Portus Palorum. notes that \\"Geogr. Nub. p.195; Sanut. Secret.

The city is mentioned by numerous ancient authors, and in the Middle Ages by Arabian, Armenian, and Italian writers. The city declined in importance and disappeared with the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The ancient site of Antiochia ad Pyramum lies a few km away on the coast. Mallus figures in the various revisions of the Antiochene Notitiae Episcopatuum as suffragan of Tarsus. Six bishops are recorded. Bematius, present at the Council of Antioch (377); Valentine, present at the First Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Tarsus (434); Chrysippus at the Council of Chalcedon (451).

From the ancient sources we learn that it was situated near the mouth of the river Pyramus, on an eminence opposite to Megarsus (modern Karataş), as we must infer from Quintus Curtius, who states that Alexander entered the town after throwing a bridge across the Pyramus. Mallus therefore stood on the eastern bank of the river. According to Scylax (p. 40) it was necessary to sail up the river a short distance in order to reach Mallus; and Pomponius Mela (i.13) also states that the town is situated close upon the river; whence Ptolemy (v.8.4) must be mistaken in placing it more than two miles away from the river. Mallus is commonly believed to be in the town of Kızıltahta, Adana Province. The nearby town of Terkosan is mentioned being its necropolis. The city's location at Kızıltahta has been extrapolated by reference to the ancient sources. Stadiasmus indicates that Mallus was 150 stades away from Megarsus (Megarsus is identified to be modern Karataş). One stadia equals 600 feet and 150 stades is 27.4 km. When this distance is measured from Karataş within a 1:100,000 scale map of Turkey, the city's location is in the periphery of Kızıltahta.

The first Fukang appeared in 1992 as a semi-knock down production, rebadged Citroën ZX hatchback. The car was called the Fukang DC7140 in China, the name translating as ‘Prosperity and Health’ in Chinese. Later on, the DC7160 with a fuel-injected 1.6 liter engine was added to the lineup. 17,000 of the SKD ZXs were built until late 1996, when Dongfeng's own two plants in Wuhan province became up to speed and local production commenced. Local capacity was 150,000 per annum. Two years later, the first of a number of special Chinese market Citroën models was launched when the Citroën Fukang 988 arrived. Presented in September 1998, this was a saloon version of the Fukang DC7160 and originally featured the larger 1.6 litre, fuel-injected engine. The saloon Fukang was developed by specialist engineering firm Heuliez, who also developed a long wheelbase limousine version called the Fukang 988 VIP. The saloon versions continued until 2003, when they were replaced by an updated version of the theme, the Citroën Elysée. However, the hatchback Fukang continued to be part of the Chinese Citroën range until 2009. On February 26, 2009, the new facelifted Citroën C-Elysée hatchback finally replaced the Fukang. These models had also been joined in 2006 by the Citroën Xsara, Picasso, and the C-Triomphe. The Fukang was also available in the form of a 4-door pickup truck and a 2-door panel van.

With a title and concept very loosely based on Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera, the film concerns strange happenings at a monstrous megaplex on the night of a major movie premiere gala, Midnight Mayhem. The central character, played by Taylor Handley, is Pete Riley, the 17-year-old assistant manager of the theater. He has to cope with malfunctioning equipment, disappearing staff, and a broken popcorn machine, among other headaches. He investigates to see if the troubles are coincidence or the result of sabotage by a mysterious \\"phantom\\". The senior manager of the theater is played by Rich Hutchman, and Ricky Mabe, Julia Chantrey, Joanne Boland, J.J. Stocker, and Lisa Ng appear as other employees of the theater. Caitlin Wachs and Jacob Smith play the central character's younger siblings, and Heather and Jennifer Bertram appear as his love interest and her friend.  Plot  17-year-old Pete Riley works as the assistant manager at the local 26-screen grand megaplex, a job that he loves and spends the majority of his time at. Rumor has it that the megaplex is haunted by a \\"phantom\\", someone who was trapped inside the old movie theater that was demolished to build the current megaplex. Pete, senior manager Shawn MacGibbon, the other employees, and an elderly member of the family who once owned the original theater known as \\"Movie Mason\\" (played by Mickey Rooney) who loves movies and thinks he works at the megaplex, are working to prepare the theater for the star-studded premiere of the new Hollywood blockbuster Midnight Mayhem. Wolfgang Nedermayer, the owner of the megaplex, is to be among the guests. To Pete's disappointment, he is forced to bring along his younger siblings, 13-year-old Karen and 10-year-old Brian, to the theater while their widowed mother goes out on a date with her boyfriend George. Pete dumps his siblings in a movie (which Karen ditches to see a horror movie with her friends) so he can focus on setting up for the premiere, but problems begin to pop up all through the megaplex. The other movies begin to suffer mishaps, which Karen and Brian realize are all related to the titles of the films being shown (for example, a theater showing a movie called Cyclone Summer has a giant fan moved in front of the screen, which blows everyone out of their seats). Pete, Karen, and Brian work together and discover that the rumored phantom is behind these acts of sabotage. Through online spoilers, Brian and Karen are able to learn the movie's plot, and Pete is able to stop the phantom from sabotaging the premiere. The phantom is revealed to be Shawn, who Nedermayer immediately fires; however, Shawn explodes with anger as he did all this so Nedermayer would finally notice him (and get his name right, since he never did). Shawn is then offered partnership by the director of Midnight Mayhem to make a movie based on his exploits—Phantom of the Megaplex: The Shawn McGibbon Story. Nedermayer offers Pete the job of senior manager at the megaplex, something Pete has always wanted. Though Pete tells Nedermayer that he'd be honored, he turns down the job. Inspired by Karen and Brian from their help exposing Shawn as the phantom, Pete realizes the importance of his childhood and doesn't want to waste it anymore, asking for the rest of the night off; Nedermayer complies, giving Pete money to treat his girlfriend Caitlin Kerrigan to a nice breakfast after the film. George proposes to Julie, as per suggested by Brian who said a 4-star ending was needed to wrap things up. As everyone enters the movie theater, Movie Mason explains to Brian that he never once believed in the Phantom of the Megaplex; however, \\"the Werewolf of the Megaplex is another story.\\" Both enter the theater as an employee, known for her horrifying tales, \\"Scary Terri\\" closes the doors as a wolf howl sounds.

Early life  Peter Collinson was born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire in 1936. His parents, an actress and a musician, separated when he was two years old; he was raised by his grandparents. From the age of eight until 14 he attended the Actor's Orphanage in Chertsey, Surrey, where he had the chance to write and act in many plays. Noël Coward, who was president of the orphanage at the time, became his godfather and helped him to obtain jobs in the entertainment industry, which was dramatized in the radio play Mr Bridger's Orphan by Marcy Kahan in 2013. (Collinson later directed Coward in his best-known film, The Italian Job (1969)). He auditioned for RADA but was rejected, so went to work for the New Cross Empire theatre when aged 14. He did a variety of theatrical jobs until 1954, when he was called up for national service. He served as a private with the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) for two years in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. Career Collinson's early television work included time as a floor manager for the BBC and directing for ATV at Elstree studios. He was an assistant director on a short, The Pit (1962), and made a documentary, Blackwater Holiday (1963). He also worked with Telefís Éireann, the Republic of Ireland's national TV station, and in 1963 he won a Jacob's Award for his production The Bomb. He produced a stage musical in Dublin, Carrie (1963), starring Ray McAnally. Collinson began to direct TV: the film Don't Ever Talk to Clocks (1964), In Loving Memory (1964), The One Nighters. He also made episodes of Sergeant Cork (1964), The Sullavan Brothers (1964), The Plane Makers (1964), Love Story (1964–65), Front Page Story (1965), Knock on Any Door (1965), A Day of Peace (1965) Blackmail (1965–66), and The Power Game, Women, Women, Women and The Informer (all 1966). Features Whilst working in TV he met producer Michael Klinger, who offered him the director role on the film The Penthouse (1967); this became Collinson's directorial debut. Starring Suzy Kendall, the low-budget film was released in the US and proved to be a surprise hit. Please note this figure is a rental accruing to distributors. Collinson followed it with Up the Junction (1968), starring Kendall and Dennis Waterman, which received some strong reviews. Collinson directed two films for Paramount, both produced by Michael Deeley: The Long Day's Dying (1968), a low-budget war film, and The Italian Job (1969), a caper movie starring Michael Caine and Noel Coward. Dino De Laurentiis said he was to direct a film about Ned Kelly in Australia, The Iron Outlaw, but it was never made. Instead, Collinson went to Turkey where he directed Tony Curtis and Charles Bronson in You Can't Win 'Em All (1970). He clashed with Curtis during filming. He was meant to helm a biopic of Robert Capa, but it was never made. Back in England he made Fright (1971), a thriller with Susan George. He did a horror movie for Hammer Films, Straight On till Morning (1972), with Rita Tushingham, then Innocent Bystanders (1972), a thriller shot in Spain and Turkey with Stanley Baker. Collinson went to Spain to direct a Western, The Man Called Noon (1973). He followed it with Open Season (1974), starring Peter Fonda; a remake of And Then There Were None (1974), filmed in Iran with Oliver Reed; a remake of The Spiral Staircase (1975), shot in England with Jacqueline Bisset; Target of an Assassin (1976), filmed in South Africa with Anthony Quinn; and The Sell Out (1976), shot in Israel with Reed. He went to Canada for Tomorrow Never Comes (1978), with Donald Sutherland and Susan George; it was entered into the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. He followed it with The House on Garibaldi Street (1979), a US telemovie starring Topol. His last feature was The Earthling (1980), shot in Australia with William Holden and Ricky Schroder. He was meant to direct The Gangster Chronicles for US television but died shortly before filming was to begin. Richard Sarafian stepped in. Personal life During the filming of The Earthling (1980), Collinson discovered he was terminally ill; he died from lung cancer in Los Angeles. He was survived by his wife Hazel and two sons, aged 13 and 10.

He was the first gay service member to purposely out himself to the military to fight their ban on gays, and perhaps the best-known openly gay man in America in the 1970s next to Harvey Milk. His fight to stay in the United States Air Force after coming out of the closet became a cause célèbre around which the gay community rallied. His case resulted in articles in newspapers and magazines throughout the country, numerous television interviews, and a television movie on NBC. His photograph appeared on the cover of the September 8, 1975, issue of Time magazine, making him a symbol for thousands of gay and lesbian servicemembers and gay people generally.\\"I Am a Homosexual\\" TIME Magazine (September 8, 1975) Matlovich was the first named openly gay person to appear on the cover of a U.S. newsmagazine. According to author Randy Shilts, \\"It marked the first time the young gay movement had made the cover of a major newsweekly. To a movement still struggling for legitimacy, the event was a major turning point.\\" In October 2006, Matlovich was honored by LGBT History Month as a leader in the history of the LGBT community. Early life and early career Born at Hunter Air Force Base in Savannah, Georgia, Matlovich was the only son of a career Air Force sergeant. He spent his childhood living on military bases, primarily throughout the Southern United States. Matlovich and his sister were raised in the Roman Catholic Church. He spent much of his teenage years in Charleston, South Carolina, attending the Catholic Bishop England High School. When the Candlestick Murder occurred in Charleston in 1958, Matlovich saw it as proof of the negative societal consequences of homosexuality. Not long after he enlisted at 19, the United States increased military action in Vietnam, about ten years after the French had abandoned active colonial rule there. Matlovich volunteered for service in Vietnam and served three tours of duty. He was seriously wounded when he stepped on a landmine in Đà Nẵng. While stationed in Florida near Fort Walton Beach, he began frequenting gay bars in nearby Pensacola. \\"I met a bank president, a gas station attendant – they were all homosexual\\", Matlovich commented in a later interview. In 1973, when he was 30, he slept with another man for the first time. He \\"came out\\" to his friends, but continued to conceal the fact from his commanding officer. Having realized that the racism he had grown up around was wrong, he volunteered to teach Air Force Race Relations classes, which had been created after several racial incidents in the military in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He became so successful that the Air Force sent him around the country to coach other instructors. Matlovich gradually came to believe that the discrimination faced by gays was similar to that faced by African Americans. Activism In March 1974, previously unaware of the organized gay movement, he read an interview in the Air Force Times with gay activist Frank Kameny, who had counseled several gay people in the military over the years. He contacted Kameny, who told him he had long been looking for a gay service member with a perfect record to create a test case to challenge the military's ban on gays. Four months later, he met with Kameny at the longtime activist's Washington, D.C. home. After several months of discussion with Kameny and ACLU attorney David Addlestone during which they formulated a plan, he hand-delivered a letter to his Langley AFB commanding officer on March 6, 1975. When his commander asked, \\"What does this mean?\\" Matlovich replied, \\"It means Brown versus the Board of Education\\" – a reference to the 1954 landmark Supreme Court case outlawing racial segregation in public schools. Perhaps the most painful aspect of the whole experience for Matlovich was his revelation to his parents. He told his mother by telephone. She was so stunned she refused to tell Matlovich's father. Her first reaction was that God was punishing her for something she had done, even if her Roman Catholic faith would not have sanctioned that notion. Then, she imagined that her son had not prayed enough or had not seen enough psychiatrists. His father finally found out by reading it in the newspaper, after his challenge became public knowledge on Memorial Day 1975 through an article on the front page of The New York Times and that evening's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Matlovich recalled, \\"He cried for about two hours.\\" After that, he told his wife that, \\"If he can take it, I can take it.\\" Discharge and lawsuit At that time, the Air Force had a fairly ill- defined exception clause that could allow gay people to continue to serve if there were extenuating circumstances. These circumstances might include being immature or drunk, exemplary service, or a one-time experimentation (known sarcastically as the \\"Queen for a day\\" rule). During Matlovich's September 1975 administrative discharge hearing, an Air Force attorney asked him if he would sign a document pledging to \\"never practice homosexuality again\\" in exchange for being allowed to remain in the Air Force. Matlovich refused. Despite his exemplary military record, tours of duty in Vietnam, and high performance evaluations, the panel ruled Matlovich unfit for service, and he was recommended for a General (Under Honorable Conditions) discharge. The base commander, Alton J. Thogersen, citing Matlovich's service record, recommended that it be upgraded to Honorable. The Secretary of the Air Force agreed, confirming Matlovich's discharge in October 1975. Matlovich sued for reinstatement, but the legal process was a long one, with the case moving back and forth between United States District and Circuit Courts. When, by September 1980, the Air Force had failed to provide U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell an explanation of why Matlovich did not meet its criteria for exception (which by then had been eliminated but still could have applied to him), Gesell ordered him reinstated into the Air Force and promoted. The Air Force offered Matlovich a financial settlement instead. Convinced that the military would find some other reason to discharge him if he reentered the service, or that the conservative Supreme Court would rule against him should the Air Force appeal, Matlovich accepted. The figure, based on back pay, future pay, and pension, was $160,000. Excommunication A converted Mormon and church elder when he lived in Hampton, Virginia, Matlovich found himself at odds with the Latter-day Saints and their opposition to homosexual behavior; he was twice excommunicated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints for homosexual acts. He was first excommunicated on October 7, 1975, in Norfolk, Virginia, and then again January 17, 1979. By this time, Matlovich had stopped being a believer. Settlement, later life and illness From the moment his case was revealed to the public, Matlovich was repeatedly called upon by gay groups to help them with fundraising and advocating against anti-gay discrimination, helping lead campaigns against Anita Bryant's efforts in Miami, Florida, to overturn a gay nondiscrimination ordinance and John Briggs' attempt to ban gay teachers in California. Sometimes he was criticized by individuals more to the left than he had become. \\"I think many gays are forced into liberal camps only because that's where they can find the kind of support they need to function in society,\\" Matlovich once noted. While appealing his discharge, he moved from Virginia to Washington, D.C., and, in 1978, to San Francisco. In 1981, he moved to the Russian River town of Guerneville, where he used the proceeds of his settlement to open a pizza restaurant. With the outbreak of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. in the late 1970s, Matlovich's personal life was caught up in the hysteria about the virus that peaked in the 1980s. He sold his Guerneville restaurant in 1984, moving to Europe for a few months where, during a visit to the joint grave of lovers Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas and the grave of gay writer Oscar Wilde in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France, he got the idea for a gay memorial in the United States. He returned briefly to Washington, D.C., in 1985 and, then, to San Francisco where he sold Ford cars and once again became heavily involved in gay rights causes and the fight for adequate HIV/AIDS education and treatment. In 1986, Matlovich felt fatigued, then contracted a prolonged chest cold he seemed unable to shake. When he finally saw a physician in September of that year, he was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Too weak to continue his work at the Ford dealership, he was among the first to receive AZT treatments, but his prognosis was not encouraging. He went on disability benefits and became a champion for HIV/AIDS research for the disease which was claiming tens of thousands of lives in the Bay Area and nationally. He announced on Good Morning America in 1987 that he had contracted HIV, and was arrested with other demonstrators in front of the White House that June protesting what they believed was an inadequate response to HIV/AIDS by the administration of President Ronald Reagan. Despite his deteriorating health, he tearfully made his last public speech on May 7, 1988, in front of the California State Capitol during the March on Sacramento for Gay and Lesbian Rights: > ... And I want you to look at the flag, our rainbow flag, and I want you to > look at it with pride in your heart, because we too have a dream. And what > is our dream? Ours is more than an American dream. It's a universal dream. > Because in South Africa, we're black and white, and in Northern Ireland, > we're Protestant and Catholic, and in Israel we're Jew and Muslim. And our > mission is to reach out and teach people to love, and not to hate. And you > know the reality of the situation is that before we as an individual meet, > the only thing we have in common is our sexuality. And in the AIDS crisis – > and I have AIDS – and in the AIDS crisis, if there is any one word that > describes our community's reaction to AIDS, that word is love, love, love. Death On June 22, 1988, less than a month before his 45th birthday, Matlovich died in Los Angeles of complications from HIV/AIDS. His tombstone, meant to be a memorial to all gay veterans, does not bear his name. It reads, \\"When I was in the military, they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one.\\" Recognizing military officials would not then allow such a marker in Arlington Cemetery, Matlovich chose a gravesite in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Another reason was because the man many believe to have been the greatest love of poet Walt Whitman, Peter Doyle, is buried there. He chose the same row where the graves of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Hoover's longtime Assistant Director and heir Clyde Tolson are, as a kind of \\"last laugh\\". Legacy Matlovich's tombstone at the Congressional Cemetery, which reads: \\"A Gay Vietnam Veteran When I was in the military, they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one.\\" Before his death, Matlovich donated his personal papers and memorabilia to the GLBT Historical Society, a museum, archives and research center in San Francisco.GLBT Historical Society. \\"Guide to the Leonard Matlovich Papers, 1961–1988 (Bulk 1975–1988)\\" (Collection No. 1988-01); retrieved October 27, 2011.

San Francisco resident Michael Bedwell, a close friend and the original executor of Matlovich's estate, created a website in honor of Matlovich and other gay U.S. veterans. The site includes a history of the ban on gays and bisexuals in the U.S. military both before and after its transformation into \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\", and illustrates the role that gay veterans fighting the ban played in the earliest development of the gay rights movement in the United States.\\"About this site,\\" at LeonardMatlovich.com; retrieved October 30, 2011. Matlovich's gravesite has been a site of attraction and ceremony for LGBT rights activists since his interment including an annual LGBT Veterans Day observance, and several individuals and couples have chosen to also be buried in Congressional Cemetery identifying their being gay on their tombstones per his suggestion such as Gittings and her still-surviving partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen. In May 2011, gay Iraq veteran Capt. Stephen Hill – who would later become famous for being booed by audience members during a Republican presidential candidates debate for asking whether any would attempt to restore \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" – and his partner Josh Snyder chose to be legally married next to the gravesite to honor Matlovich's fight against the original ban. His grave is the starting point for the annual Pride Run 5K sponsored by DC Front Runners, a running, walking, and social club serving Washington DC's LGBT people and their friends. On Veterans Day 2015, a Veterans Administration memorial for his mentor Kameny (1925–2011) was dedicated immediately behind Matlovich's grave. Activists including Army Lt. Dan Choi, Army Staff Sergeant Miriam Ben-Shalom and members of GetEQUAL held a vigil at Matlovich's gravesite on November 10, 2010 before proceeding to chain themselves to the White House fence (and be subsequently arrested) to protest \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\". In June 2019, Matlovich was one of the inaugural fifty American “pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes” inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City’s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall’s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

These ties have been on-going throughout the history of both regions. Initially these relations were based on the policies of European colonial powers in the Americas. More recently, both Canada and most of the Caribbean islands have achieved self-government, putting their relations into a different phase. CARICOM diplomats have referred to Canada as a '\\"special friend\\" of the Caribbean at the regional and bilateral levels.' History New France and the French colonies in the Caribbean enjoyed a flourishing trade in the first part of the eighteenth century, with the fortress of Louisbourg acting as an important trading centre linking New France, the Caribbean and France. When Britain gained control over the northern half of the continent, these relations were largely severed as trade between North America and the British Caribbean holdings went almost exclusively through U.S. ports, especially Boston. With the American Revolution, the Americans were, in theory, to be shut out of the British colonies by the Navigation Acts and other British laws. Canadian merchants, especially those based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, strove to become the new leading trading partners. The trade with the Caribbean did become an important one for Halifax, but the British laws could do little to prevent American traders from continuing to play a central role. The merchants of the West Indies preferred dealing with the United States, which produced a greater variety of goods at lower prices than the Canadians. The weak Spanish Empire could do even less than the British to keep out foreign traders, and Canadian trade with Cuba and other Spanish holdings also rose in prominence. This trade peaked in the years immediately before Canadian Confederation. Canada shipped flour, corn, timber, and fish to the Caribbean, while sugar and rum moved north. In the Maritimes a prosperous sugar refining and rum industry arose based on these imports. Also of historical importance was the military relationship between British colonies in the Caribbean and Canada. Halifax was the major North American British naval base, and British warships frequently travelled between it and the Caribbean. In both the First and Second World Wars Canadian troops were moved to the Caribbean to replace British forces that were needed in other theatres. Canadian troops in particular were stationed in Saint Lucia to protect against attacks by the German military during the first World War. While the relationship with the United States and with Britain continued to be the most important ones to the British colonies of the West Indies, there were also growing concerns about American domination and Canada was seen as an important counterbalance. The United States imposed high import duties, and greatly favoured its domestic sugar industry over that of its southern neighbours. Proposals of political union There were continued political and cultural links between Canada and the West Indies. This led to a number of Caribbean colonies engaging in short movements to enter into Canadian Confederation.Carmichael, Dr. Trevor A. 2001. Passport to the Heart: Reflections on Canada Caribbean Relations. Ian Randle Publishers, Kingston 6, Jamaica. Some of these proposals were never seriously considered in Canada, and few in the West Indies actually felt they were valid solutions. Jamaica In the political crisis that hit Jamaica in 1882, one of the proposed solutions was joining Canada. Michael Solomon led the pro- Confederation faction, but when he introduced a motion to that effect in the Legislative Council everyone but he voted against it. Barbados Prominent Barbadian R.P. Elliott wrote to the Canadian government on behalf of a number of the islands' elite asking to join Canada. British West Indies In the years after the First World War the British started to look at ways to consolidate the British Empire. For example, several British possessions in Oceania were transferred under the protection of Australia and New Zealand, and the British government of Lloyd George strongly considered transferring the responsibility for all British colonies in the Caribbean, as well as Newfoundland and the Falkland Islands, to the Canadian government, but most Canadians were not interested due to strong sentiments that Canada should retain the policy of not becoming a colonising force in the world.Winks, Robin W. 1997. The Blacks in Canada: A History. McGill-Queen's Press, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This had some light support among Canada's business community, some of whom had just established businesses expanding into the West Indies region. Among them was Canadian businessman T.B. Macaulay, the son of the founder of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. Thomas Bassett Macaulay became very fond of working with the governments in the West Indies. He went on to become President of the group known as The Canadian-West Indian LeagueAnatomy of Big Business, 1973, Libbie Park, Frank Park, - Business & Economics, Page 142 which he co-found and was in existence until 1934. Additionally in the West Indies he acted as a representative for the Leeward Islands at the Canada-West Indies Trade Conference. Canadian businessman Harry Crowe impressed upon Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden to direct Sir Joseph Pope to issue a report titled Confidential Memorandum Upon the Subject of the Annexation of the West India Islands to the Dominion of Canada in which five major advantages were outlined for Canada to contemplate union with the West Indies territories. *It would give to Canada an increase of territory amounting to , and of population 2,300,000 thus adding considerably to the importance and influence of the Dominion. *The tropical products available in the new territory would make the Dominion more self-contained and would give us practically all the advantages of a diversity of climate and products which are afforded to that great Republic by the southern portion of the United States. *The importance of sea power would become so obvious under new conditions as to leave little room for argument to the contrary. *Confederation would afford a broader market to our manufacturers and producers which must result in a very large development of trade, as we produce precisely what they require, and vice versa. *It would balance the accessions which will accrue to the other self-governing dominions at the termination of the war in the only way in which it is possible for Canada to obtain an equivalent, and thus to some extent compensate the Dominion for the sacrifices she has made in the defence of the Empire. The Bahamas After the defeat of the Jamaican measure, the government of The Bahamas presented a similar initiative in 1911. T.B. Macaulay encouraged members of the Legislative Council in the Bahamas to likewise consider pursuing political union with Canada, this political union proposal was ultimately rejected on the Canadian side. West Indies Federation During World War II trade between the Caribbean islands and Britain was mostly severed due to the sinking of many British merchant ships in the Atlantic. Canadian trade however continued to increase and Canada became the largest trading partner of the islands. Proposals were made at the end of the war for a free trade agreement to be concluded though this idea additionally never materialised. During the 1950s several politicians involved in the West Indies Federation again broached an idea of political association with Canada. One proposal from the Caribbean heads was for the West Indies Federation to first become a fully functional unit and following five years time the bloc should look at obtaining dominion status with Britain and possibly move to seek political association with Canada at that time. The Canadian government presented the new government of the West Indies Federation with two merchant ships. The twin ships named The Federal Palm and The Federal Maple sailed to all ports between Jamaica in the north and Trinidad and Tobago in the south and were a key aspect of building trade links between the islands. Several meetings continued to take place in the Caribbean region and in Ottawa to formulate the structure and exact form of the future political association with Canada, but a constant occurrence in the Federation of haggling between the heads of governments stymied the movement. After 4 years, the entire West Indies Federation unraveled, with the head of Jamaica publicly claiming that \\"one from ten leaves nought\\", with Jamaica representing the number \\"1\\" in the number ten, thus leaving a zero (representing the remaining islands). Trinidad and Tobago's leader quickly followed Jamaica's exit by saying if Jamaica represented the 1, then they were the 0 itself leaving \\"none\\", ending the Federation experiment. The remaining islands tried a group of the \\"Little 8\\" said it wanted to go its own direction and Barbados next withdrew from any idea of a smaller group. The remaining islands came up with the West Indies Associated States, but ultimately, they too reverted to their sovereign paths. The 1960s overall marked a decade of political independence by a large number of Caribbean nations from Britain. Turks and Caicos Islands During the 1970s and 1980s the idea of political union was again briefly raised with some discussion of the Turks and Caicos Islands joining Canada. It received some political dialogue in the governments of both nations however Canada became hesitant when it was revealed that the Turks and Caicos were due to hold a General Election. A finding by a Canadian commission recommended that the government of Canada should disengage so as to not influence the free outcome of the Turks and Caicos elections. The commission maintained that if any locale wanted to open dialogue on political association with Canada it had to be totally of the resident populations own free will. The study however recommended that Canadians should consider increasing aid into the islands to support the Turks and Caicos inhabitants and to help increase their standard of living in the islands in the meanwhile. This died down around 1987 but it was again revived on the Canadian side in 2003 when a television programme aired about Canada's past flirtation of political union proposals. In 2004 Peter Goldring, MP for Edmonton Centre-East proposed holding exploratory dialogues in the Caribbean islands to find out if there is still any interest for Canada to accord a political union. He lobbied in the Canadian House of Commons that should any nation in the Caribbean wish to proceed that this state should be elevated to the level of a Province rather than territory and in so doing the locale would become Canada's 11th Province. 2009 e-mail correspondence with Mr. Goldring In a 2009 e-mail correspondence with Mr. Goldring, he noted that \\"I... do not advocate the \\"annexation\\" of The Turks and Caicos Islands, as this term is one that is associated with colonialism\\", nor did he advocate a union with the islands unless there was \\"a clear and determined great majority of overwhelming will by both countries' citizens for such an association\\" and instead advocated an economic union, whether that is through a free-trade agreement or a customs union.See :File:T&C-Kissin.pdf; for the Text Trade In the later part of the nineteenth century the British system of imperial preference was largely dismantled and the Canadian traders lost their advantage in the Caribbean. The United States' economic and political power grew in the region, as they also removed many of the tariff barriers with the region. At the end of the century the United States gained political control over a number of Caribbean areas, such as the Danish Virgin Islands, Cuba, and Puerto Rico and American business relations had a near monopoly on trade in those areas. Trade patterns also shifted, as the market for West Indian sugar disappeared. By the Second World War bauxite had replace sugar as the main export to Canada, and Jamaica and Guyana became the most important trading partners, while imports from the smaller islands declined considerably. While trade between the regions declined, Canadian investment increased. As British companies pulled out of the region after decolonization, Canadian companies moved in. This was especially true in the banking and insurance sectors. Caribbean governments welcomed Canadian investment as a tool to prevent the total economic domination of the United States. This is perhaps most obvious in Cuba which pursued close economic ties with Canada after the Cuban Revolution. Cooperation Canada and many countries of the Caribbean have a special relationship based on a long history of close commercial, investment, cultural and political ties as well as many shared common values and resemblance of institutions. Canada was a founding member of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) in January 1970, and contributed $181.5 million during the first six cycles of the CDB's Special Development Fund. These contributions provided support for sustainable socio-economic development with an emphasis on reducing poverty and, more recently, strengthening democracies and regional economies. Several agencies of the Canadian government have played a wide ranging role of offering cooperation in many of the region's countries over the decades. Some of these agencies include the Canadian International Development Agency, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, the Canadian Trade Commissioner, the Transport Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and other agencies. Canada has taken a lead role more recently in helping Haiti to return to a state of normalcy following the February, 2004 uprising. The Government of Canada has provided much of this assistance though the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti MINUSTAH in addition to direct cooperation. Aviation Canadian assistance in Aviation services in the region have been carried out through the second half of the 20th century. During the late 1960s Canadian assistance through Transport Canada was sought to establish new venues for training Caribbean-based Air Traffic Controllers.The Barbados Civil Aviation Training Centre-- Our History More recently the Vancouver Airport Services also manages many airports in and around the Caribbean region. Recent times Presently, Canada's banks have an especially large role in the Caribbean commercial banking industry. Canadian banks own the three largest banks in the English-speaking Caribbean.The Economist- \\"The Canadian connection\\" Additionally several Canadian energy companies have significant stakes in Caribbean-based providers of electricity. *Emera ** (Grand Bahama Power Company) ** (Barbados Light and Power Company—BL&P;)The Barbados Light and Power Company Limited - Our History (1990's) Formerly Canadian International Power Company Ltd.

Fortis Turks and Caicos In 2006 several Canadian politicians moved to form the Canada-Caribbean Parliamentary Friendship Group. In 2007, as part of a larger trip to Latin America and the Caribbean, Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited Barbados and Haiti. Observers said this was intended to increase Canada's visibility in the region and to remind Canadians of the region's importance.The Economist - \\"Harper steps out\\" The Canadian government announced in February 2009 that it was adding the Caribbean to its list of preferred recipients for foreign aid. This list includes 18 countries and the West Bank, as well as the Caribbean.Alexander Panetta, \\"Canada limits main foreign aid recipients to 20 countries\\", Canada East website (accessed 3 March 2009) In 2010, Canada was specifically excluded (along with the United States) from a new regional body, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States that includes all of the other sovereign states of the Americas. Migration Since the liberalization of Canada's immigration laws in the 1960s immigration from the Caribbean has increased dramatically. As of 2001, of Canada's 783,795-strong Black population (2.5% of Canadian population) nearly 40% have Jamaican heritage,Population by selected ethnic origins, by province and territory (2001 Census) and an additional 32% have heritage elsewhere in the Caribbean or Bermuda.CST.SP04.qxd In addition many Canadians of South Asian descent have immediate origins in the Caribbean. The Canadian Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP) consists of an annual recruitment of roughly 15,000 persons from the Caribbean and Mexico for temporary employment in Canada.Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program - Government of Canada - Foreign Worker Program At the same time many Canadian snowbirds move to the Caribbean seasonally or for retirement.

The forum was initiated by the Swiss environmentalist and animal activist Franz Weber. The charter and declaration was deliberately designed to mirror that of the United Nations.Guest, Iain, After Noah's Ark, a UN for threatened species, The Guardian, London, November 9, 1979 The members are established organizations and institutions, whose aims are the protection of animal life and the preservation of nature. Weber complemented the structure of the UN by adding a protection committee and the International Court of Animal Rights to the UAN. The Statutes, Charter and Declaration was put together with Swiss philosopher and author Denis de Rougemont from Ferney-Voltaire, and a lawyer from Zürich, Anton Flachsmann. On the 8 November 1979, Franz Weber presented them to the international press.  Court  The UAN’s most important organ, The International Court of Justice for Animal Rights has its seat in Geneva. Its duties are to bring to the notice of the public, by means of morally symbolic prosecutions, cruel human actions against the animal kingdom, perpetrations that cannot be legally dealt with under normal human rights legislature. The court publicly announces its verdict, if need be by naming ministers and government leaders.

The book is an English translation by Catherine Porter of the French book, Politiques de la nature. It is published by Harvard University Press. Overview In the book, Latour argues for a new and better take on political ecology (not the discipline but the ecological political movements, e.g. greens) that embraces his feeling that, \\"political ecology has nothing to do with nature\\". In fact, Latour argues that the idea of nature is unfair because it unfairly allows those engaged in political discourse to \\"short-circuit\\" discussions. Latour uses Plato's metaphor of \\"the cave\\" to describe the current role of nature and science in separating facts from values which is the role of politics and non- scientists. Building on the arguments levelled in his previous works, Latour argues that this distinction between facts and values is rarely useful and in many situations dangerous. He claims that it leads to a system that ignores nature's socially constructed status and creates a political order without \\"due process of individual will\\". Instead, he calls for a \\"new Constitution\\" where different individuals can assemble democratically without the definitions of facts and values influenced by current attitudes towards nature and scientific knowledge. Latour describes an alternate set of rules by which this assembly, or collective as he calls it, might come together and be constituted. He also describes the way that entities will be allowed in or out in the future. In describing this collective, Latour draws attention to the role of the spokesperson, who must be doubted but who must speak for otherwise mute things in order to ensure that the collective involves both \\"humans and non-humans\\". This is also an important aspect of Actor-network theory (ANT) that can be found in his main sociological works. The book includes a short summary at the end and a glossary of terms.  Reviews of the book  Sal Restivo emphasises that the book is reproducing the insights from Science Studies, which Bruno Latour himself has greatly contributed to. However, Sal Restivo questions whether Latour understood social constructivism and what sociologists actually do.S. Restivo. Politics of Latour. Organization & Environment, 18(1):111–115, Jan 2005.

Band members would subsequently go on to projects including BlackCar, Tenebrous Liar and Mew. History The band originally formed in 1989 in Essex, England under the name Blinder.Biography on Matt Pegg's MySpace page The initial lineup was Daniel Glendining (guitar/vocals), his brother Tom Glendining (drums), Nick Watts (keyboards/backing vocals) and Matt Pegg (bass guitar). The band's main influences were grunge and progressive rock and their most successful concerts were two support slots for It Bites in 1989Matt Pegg biography on Procol Harum homepage, accessed 28 August 2009 (one of which was to a capacity audience at the Hammersmith Odeon). Following Pegg's departure Blinder rethought their approach, reducing the progressive rock elements in their music. Pegg was replaced as bass player by a friend of the band, Clovis Taylor, and by 1992 Blinder had changed their name to Headswim. Headswim's first releases were two four-track EPs, Tense Nervous Head and Moment of Union on their own Crush Records label (the eight songs from the two EPs would later be compiled and released as the mini-album Tense Moments). The EPs made enough of an impression for them to be signed by the Sony Music subsidiary Epic Records in an eight-album deal and they released their full-length debut album Flood in 1994. The album's third single \\"Crawl\\" made the UK Singles Chart and the band embarked on their first extensive tour of the UK and Europe. However, the death later that year of Dan and Tom's brother Matthew (who had created all of the band's album artwork up to this point) after a long battle with leukaemia had a profound effect on the group, who took time off to regroup. Headswim re- emerged in 1997 with their second album Despite Yourself which contained many cathartic songs about death and spirituality. The group's music had also shifted from their earlier grunge influences to a more reflective alternative rock sound more akin to artists such as Radiohead and Jeff Buckley. The lead single \\"Tourniquet\\" reached the top 30 in the UK and was a minor radio hit in the United States. Soon after, the band supported Kula Shaker on a US tour. However, sales of the album did not live up to expectations and Sony made the decision to drop them. Subsequently the band released only one further single, \\"Dusty Road\\", in 2000 on the independent record label Pet Sounds in the UK, before splitting up in early 2001. Following the group's split, Daniel Glendining formed a new band, BlackCar, essentially a solo project with occasional contributions from other musicians. BlackCar released two albums, BlackCar (2004) and Last Scene Rushes (2010), before going on hiatus. Natalie Imbruglia recorded a version of BlackCar's song \\"Come On Home\\" for her UK number-one album Counting Down the Days. Glendining also composes music for film scores, having composed the instrumental score for Lindy Heymann's 2010 low-budget British film, KicksDaniel Glendining's MySpace page and contributing two tracks to the soundtrack of French television series Ainsi soient-ils.Track Listing soundtrack.net.

It was originally created in the 1960s to promote the Catalan language and spread Catalan culture. Over the years it has increased its involvement in broader social issues; in 2012 it committed itself to Catalan independence, specifically demanding the right of self-determination for Catalonia. Currently Òmnium has more than 145,000 members organised in 40 regional offices besides the headquarters in Barcelona.  History  Òmnium Cultural was created on 11 July 1961 in the context of Francoist Spain when the institutional use of Catalan was forbidden. In 1963 the Francoist authorities closed down the association. Òmnium had to continue to exist as a clandestine association between 1963–1967. In 1967, after a long legal case before the Francoist courts, the association won its right to exist and was once again authorised. In order to promote Catalan culture within the many limits of Francoism, Òmnium was the main creator and sponsor of various awards and literary contests for works published in Catalan, such as the Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes (1969). In the early 1970s it established the Nit de Santa Llúcia a festival of Catalan literature where three prizes are awarded: the Premi Sant Jordi (novel), the Premi Mercè Rodoreda (short story) and the Premi Carles Riba (poetry). After the Francoist dictatorship ended in 1975, Òmnium continued its work promoting Catalan language and culture. Once democracy was restored, Òmnium supported and defended Catalan self-government. It was awarded the Creu de Sant Jordi by the Catalan government (Generalitat) in 1984 and named a public interest body in 2009. After the Spanish Constitutional Court's rejection of the new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia in 2010, one million people marched in Barcelona calling for national self- determination in a 2010 Catalan autonomy protest organised by Òmnium. In December 2015, Jordi Cuixart was elected president by a large majority, in elections in which 5,719 members participated out of a total of 50,000. Òmnium was one of the main organisations, together with Assemblea Nacional Catalana, supporting the Catalan self-determination referendum in 2017. After Operation Anubis, both the president of Òmnium, Jordi Cuixart, and the president of ANC, Jordi Sànchez, were sent to jail. Since then, several organizations including Amnesty International, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, PEN International, the World Organisation Against Torture, Front Line Defenders and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers have asked for their release. Since Cuixart's arrest, the most important public figure of Òmnium has been the spokesman Marcel Mauri. Structure and funding Seu Nacional d'Òmnium Cultural Òmnium Cultural is one of the biggest organizations in Catalonia with more than 145,000 members. It's based in Barcelona with regional offices in 40 other municipalities. Òmnium Cultural cooperates with other organizations that share similar goals in other Catalan- speaking territories: Acció Cultural del País Valencià(in the Valencian Country) and Obra Cultural Balear (in the Balearic Islands). Between 2005 and 2012 the association received up to 13 million euros in different grants from the Catalan regional government (Generalitat). from which 1.4 million were received in 2012 alone. In November 2015 Òmnium was condemned by the Audiencia Nacional for the unauthorised use and deficient custody of personal data, after its data had been stolen by a hacker. This led to a €200,000 sanction imposed by the Spanish agency responsible for data protection. In 2013 the association announced that it would no longer receive funding from the Catalan government. In 2016, different local authorities gave grants to Òmnium, basically for local cultural activities, for a value of €144,404.12, out of a total income in 2016 of €4.4 million. According to the Spanish Civil Guard in 2018, 98% of Òmnium Cultural's budget comes from private contributions and it didn't receive funding from the Catalan government in relation to the 2017 independence referendum.

The earliest ones also worked on interconnecting various state highways to create longer, multi-state highways. Since 1990, new associations have formed (primarily for U.S. Route 66) for preservation of historic highways. The National Auto Trails associations The National Auto Trail began in the 1910s as part of the Good Roads Movement. With the growth of the automobile, state highways were beginning to be developed. The idea began to develop for a need for longer, interstate roads and associations developed to work with the various state transportation departments to interlink the roads. In 1911, the National Old Trails Association was created to establish the National Old Trails Highway, a road linking New York City with Los Angeles. Map of the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway, created by the National Highways Association in 1916 That same year, the National Highways Association was started, with the slogan \\"Good roads for everyone!\\" The organization, which was co-founded by Charles Henry Davis, promoted the creation and maintenance of 50,000 miles of highway. This includes the Jefferson Davis Highway. The organization distributed pamphlets promoting the importance of highway systems and created maps in their own office, located in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts. In 1912, the Lincoln Highway Association was created to establish the Lincoln Highway, a road between New York City and San Francisco championed by bicycle and auto parts and racing tycoon Carl Graham Fisher. Three years later, in 1915, the Old Spanish Trail Association was founded in Mobile, Alabama, to develop the southernmost national highway from St. Augustine, Florida, to San Diego, California. Subscriptions from individual cities and towns on the proposed route, along with individual memberships and donations from corporations, provided funds for the groups. Actual maintenance and construction of the roads remained the responsibility of the individual states. However, problems were not unheard of. In some cases, states would not cooperate with the organizations. The Lincoln Highway Association wanted a branch to come off the main road at Ely, Nevada to carry travelers to Los Angeles. The state of Utah, though, wanted it to branch off at Salt Lake City, Utah to keep travelers in their state longer. They therefore refused to upgrade a section of the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. Other problems included con-artists collecting money from towns and then disappearing, never providing support for the road as agreed. Also, signs at times became sporadic or difficult to read and multiple trails on the same road (also known as overlapping) tended to cause confusion to motorists. These problems would result in the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926. US Highway associations The creation of the US Highway System brought the end of the old trail associations, though the original Lincoln Highway Association would not disband officially until 1935. But new associations, to promote commerce and tourism along their specific highways, started. The U.S. Highway 66 Association formed in 1927 and became the most prominent of the groups. It would continue until 1975 as US 66 was becoming bypassed by interstates. Other groups promoted U.S. Route 40, U.S. Route 60, and U.S. Route 93. These groups mainly published travel guides for tourist, though the US 66 group was sometimes more political. Historic associations The first historic highway associations were the Arizona and Missouri Route 66 associations. Missouri's group was the first to get historic markers erected along the highway, in 1991. Currently all eight states on Route 66 have their own state organizations. There is also a National Route 66 Federation. In 1992, the Lincoln Highway Association was revitalized to preserve and promote the old Lincoln Highway. Other historic highway organizations now include: The Yellowstone Trail Association, the US Route 6 Tourist Association, the National Road Association, and the Midland Trail Association. A new American Road Foundation was formed in 2007 to promote preservation of all US highways and auto trails.

In 1996, she co- founded the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition political party and was elected as a delegate at the Multi-Party Peace Negotiations, which led to the Good Friday Peace Agreement in 1998. She served as a member of the Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly from 1998–2003 and chaired the Implementation Committee on Human Rights on behalf of the British and Irish governments. She was appointed as Chief Commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission from 2005–2011, and was the Oversight Commissioner for prison reform in Northern Ireland (2011–2015). She currently sits on the Independent Reporting Commission for the disbandment of paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland. She is Emeritus Professor in the Transitional Justice Institute at Ulster University and continues her academic research into domestic violence. She also specialises in conflict resolution and working with women in conflict regions.  Early life  McWilliams was born in Ballymoney, County Antrim, grew up in Kilrea, County Londonderry and was educated at Loreto College, Coleraine. She is a graduate of Queen's University Belfast and the University of Michigan, and became Professor of Women's Studies and Social Policy at the University of Ulster.  Career  McWilliams, a Catholic residing in south Belfast, co-founded (with Pearl Sagar, a Protestant social worker from East Belfast, and other women) the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition (NIWC), a political party with a feminist platform in an era where civil liberties, let alone women's rights, were difficult to gain traction on. She was inspired by Martin Luther King and watched the civil rights movement grow under his leadership in North America, noting herself that rights in Northern Ireland were of real concern too. Her focus for Northern Ireland was on a broader vision of peace based on inclusion, human rights and equality. In 1996, McWilliams won a seat with Sagar representing the Women’s Coalition at the multi party peace talks in Northern Ireland leading to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. She joined 3% of women globally as a signatory to an international peace treaty. She faced frequent sexism and ridicule in the Forum for Dialogue and Understanding, which sat alongside the peace talks, and challenged the way in which women in public life were subjected to such behavior. In the peace accord, she secured key outcomes such as restitution for victims, inclusion of reconciliation, integrated education, shared housing and a civic forum rather than a sole focus on decommissioning and disarmament. This was key to the success of the Good Friday agreement. She was elected as one of two Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition Members of the Legislative Assembly in Northern Ireland (the other being Jane Morrice) from 1998 to 2003, representing South Belfast. During the negotiations following the Agreement, she was the Chairperson of the Human Rights Sub-Committee until 2003. In the 2003 Assembly election she lost her seat to Sinn Féin. After ten years in existence, the NIWC decided in 2006 to stand down the party. McWilliams returned to her university post from 2003 until she was appointed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as full-time Chief Commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in June 2005, for a three-year term. She was reappointed for a second term, in September 2008. Under her six-year leadership the Commission finalized the advice on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. It was presented to the UK government in December 2008 where legislation on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is still awaited. In 2011 she returned to the University of Ulster as Professor of Women's Studies in the Transitional Justice Institute which carries out research on gender, transition, human rights and conflict. Ulster University staff profile McWilliams was one of five persons appointed in December 2011 to a Prisons Reform Oversight Group advising the Northern Ireland Department of Justice. Department of Justice press release on prison reform In 2015 she was appointed by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to the Fresh Start Panel on the Disbandment of Paramilitary Organizations in Northern Ireland. She was subsequently appointed by international treaty between the British and Irish governments to the Independent Reporting Commission from 2017 to 2021 to oversee the recommendations from the Panel report. Monica is the Chairperson of the Governing Board of Interpeace, an international NGO based in Geneva, and is Emeritus Professor in the Transitional Justice Institute at Ulster University. Monica helped establish Politics in Action and is on their board of directors. Monica has co-authored two books and three government-published research studies: Bringing It Out in the Open: Domestic Violence in Northern Ireland (1993, with Joan McKiernan) and Taking Domestic Violence Seriously: Issues for the Civil and Criminal Justice System (1996, with Lynda Spence) and 'Intimate Partner Violence in Conflict and Post-Conflict Societies Insights and Lessons from Northern Ireland' (2017 with Jessica Doyle). Her research in the 1990s led to the first government policy on domestic violence and was followed up twenty five years later as the first longitudinal study on domestic violence during and post conflict. She has published several articles on the impact of political conflict, on conflict resolution and women's rights. She has facilitated workshops with women in conflict regions including Columbia, Myanmar, Uganda, DRC, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel and Palestine. She was one of nine signatories of the Northern Ireland peace process jointly awarded the John F. Kennedy Library Profile in Courage Award in 1998. She was a joint recipient of the Frank Cousins Peace Award in 1999 (commemorating a British trade union official). She has received honorary doctorates from Lesley College (Massachusetts), Mount Mary College (Milwaukee) and University of York. Throughout her career Monica has given voice to women. In 2018, in recognition of her life work and in celebration of the 100 Anniversary of Suffrage, Women in Business awarded Monica with a Special Lifetime Achievement Award.

Life and career Lev Knipper was the nephew of the actress Olga Knipper (Anton Chekhov's wife). His older sister Olga Chekhova also became an actress and married Mikhail Chekhov. During the Russian civil war he fought in the White army and left Russia with the rest of Baron Wrangel forces in 1920. Upon his return from emigration in 1922 he was recruited by OGPU foreign département. There is no evidence that he denounced any of his fellow composers or musicians during the periods of repressions. He studied music in Moscow with Reinhold Glière and the Gnessin Music School. In the 20s, he worked at the Moscow Art Theatre with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko and Konstantin Stanislavski. Vacationed in Buryatia. He wrote his Fourth Symphony in 1934, which includes the famous song Polyushko Pole, with lyrics (dedicated to Kliment Voroshilov) by Victor Gusev. The music became one of the Marching songs of the Red Army Choir. Knipper did not suffer from the attacks of Andrei Zhdanov, who censored other composers. According to secret documents revealed in 2008, during the Second World War existed in the USSR a secret plan designed by the Kremlin in case that Moscow would fall into Nazi hands. Under the elaborate plan, ballerinas and circus acrobats were armed with grenades and pistols and ordered to assassinate German generals if they attempted to organise concerts and other celebrations upon taking the city. Lev Knipper was charged with the responsibility of killing Hitler if he got the opportunity. Knipper was prolific. He wrote 5 operas (including one on The Little Prince), 20 symphonies, ballets, pieces for piano and other film musics. He also studied ethnomusicology in the Central Asian Republics and researched folk music from Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. One of his most famed compositions is Полюшко-поле (Polyushko Polye), known as \\"Meadowland\\", and also called \\"Song of the Plains\\".

It was formed in 1876 by a merger of the Irish North Western Railway (INW), Northern Railway of Ireland, and Ulster Railway. The governments of Ireland and Northern Ireland jointly nationalised the company in 1953, and the company was liquidated in 1958: assets were split on national lines between the Ulster Transport Authority and Córas Iompair Éireann. Foundation The Ulster, D&D; and D&BJct; railways together formed the main line between Dublin and Belfast, with the D&BJct; completing the final section in 1852 to join the Ulster at . The GNRI's other main lines were between Derry and and between Omagh and Portadown. The Portadown, Dungannon and Omagh Junction Railway together with the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway enabled GNRI trains between Derry and Belfast to compete with the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway, and both this and the Dundalk route gave connections between Derry and Dublin. These main lines supported the development of an extensive branch network serving the southwest half of Ulster and northern counties of Leinster. The GNRI became Ireland's most prosperous railway company and second largest railway network. The coat of arms of the GNR. In its early years the GNR(I) closely imitated the image of its English namesake, adopting an apple green livery for its steam locomotives and a varnished teak finish for its passenger coaches. Later the company adopted its famous pale blue livery for locomotives (from 1932), with the frames and running gear picked out in scarlet. Passenger vehicles were painted brown, instead of varnished. On 12 June 1889, a significant rail accident occurred when a passenger train stalled between and . The train was divided, but during the uncoupling operation ten carriages ran away and collided with another passenger train. A total of 80 people were killed and 260 were injured in what was then the deadliest railway accident to have occurred in Europe. The accident remains the deadliest ever to have occurred on the island of Ireland. Growth and partition In the early 20th century increasing traffic led the GNRI to consider introducing larger locomotives. The Great Southern and Western Railway had introduced express passenger locomotives with a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement, and the GNRI wanted to do the same. However, the lifting shop in the GNRI Dundalk works was too short to build or overhaul a 4-6-0, so the company persisted with 4-4-0 locomotives for even the heaviest and fastest passenger trains. This led to the GNRI to order a very modern and powerful class of 4-4-0's, the Class V three cylinder compound locomotives built by Beyer, Peacock in 1932. This class has been compared with another notable V class, that introduced by the Southern Railway in England in 1930. The Partition of Ireland in 1921 created a border through the GNRI's territory. The new border crossed all three of its main lines and some of its secondary lines. The imposition of border controls caused some service disruption, with main line trains having to stop at both Dundalk and Goraghwood stations. This was not eased until 1947 when customs and immigration facilities for Dublin–Belfast expresses were opened at Dublin Amiens Street station (renamed in 1966) and station. Nationalisation and division GNR loco sheds at Adelaide, 1959 A combination of the increasing road competition facing all railways and a change in patterns of economic activity caused by the partition of Ireland reduced the GNRI's prosperity. The company modernised and reduced its costs by introducing modern diesel multiple units on an increasing number of services in the 1940s and 1950s and by making Dublin–Belfast expresses non- stop from 1948. In Dundalk at the GNR Works the railway engineers developed railbuses for use on sections of the rural network. Nevertheless, by the 1950s the GNRI had ceased to be profitable and in 1953 the company was jointly nationalised by the governments of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The two governments ran the railway jointly under a Great Northern Railway Board until 1958. Preserved GNRI Class S no. 171 Slieve Gullion at Lisburn In May 1958 the Government of Northern Ireland's wish to close many lines led to the GNRI Board being dissolved and the assets divided between the two territories. At midnight on 30 September 1958 all lines in Northern Ireland were transferred to the (nationalised) Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) and all lines in the Republic of Ireland were transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ). CIÉ had been formed as a private company in 1945 but had been nationalised in 1950. In an attempt at fairness, all classes of locomotive and rolling stock were also divided equally between the transport operators of the two new owners. Most classes of GNRI locomotive had been built in small classes, so this division left both railways with an operational and maintenance difficulty of many different designs all in small numbers. The Northern Ireland Government, which had a very anti-rail policy, rapidly closed most of the GNRI lines in Northern Ireland.The closures started several years before the Beeching cuts, which implemented widespread rationalisations of the railway network in Britain. Exceptions were the Belfast–Dundalk and Portadown–Derry main lines and the Newry–Warrenpoint and – branches. It made the Lisburn–Antrim branch freight- only from 1960 and closed the Portadown–Derry and Newry–Warrenpoint lines to all traffic in 1965. The Republic of Ireland government tried briefly to maintain services on lines closed at the border by the Northern Ireland government, but this was impractical, and the Republic had to follow suit in closing most GNRI lines south of the border. Since 1960 the –Navan branch has survived for freight traffic only. The Fintona horse tram circa 1930 The GNR's north western main line between Dundalk and Derry bypassed the small County Tyrone town of Fintona, which was instead served by a branch line from Fintona Junction station. The service was operated by the double-deck Fintona horse tram until the line's closure in 1957. CIÉ also acquired the Hill of Howth Tramway, in the northern suburbs of Dublin, in the 1958 dissolution of the GNRI Board. CIÉ closed the tramway about a year later. Today, the GNR routes remaining consist of the main line from Dublin to Belfast, the Howth branch, electrified for Dublin commuter services since 1984, the Drogheda - Navan (Tara Mines) line, which carries only freight traffic associated with that mine, passenger traffic having ceased with the closure of the line beyond there to Oldcastle in 1963, and the Lisburn to Antrim branch, now mothballed but retained in operational order for the time being.  Preservation =Rolling stock No.85 taking on water on the former Northern Counties Committee line at Ballymena railway station. Four GNRI steam locomotives are preserved. The Railway Preservation Society of Ireland at Whitehead owns two of its 4-4-0s (one each of classes S and Q) and has custodianship of a third 4-4-0, (V class) which is on loan from the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Cultra. The RPSI periodically operates one or more of them on special excursion trains on Northern Ireland Railways and Iarnród Éireann (successor to CIÉ) routes. A 2-4-2T (JT class) locomotive is preserved at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Cultra. Some of its coaching stock has also been preserved. 1938 built dining car No.88 still sees use as part of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland's Dublin based \\"heritage set\\" of coaches. Also operating in this set is a 1954 built brake coach No.9, although it currently carries the number 1949.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and antidepressant properties. Adinazolam was developed by Dr. Jackson B. Hester, who was seeking to enhance the antidepressant properties of alprazolam, which he also developed. Adinazolam was never FDA approved and never made available to the public market, however it has been sold as a designer drug. Side effects Overdose may include muscle weakness, ataxia, dysarthria and particularly in children paradoxical excitement, as well as diminished reflexes, confusion and coma may ensue in more severe cases. A human study comparing the subjective effects and abuse potential of adinazolam (30 mg and 50 mg) with diazepam, lorazepam and a placebo showed that adinazolam causes the most \\"mental and physical sedation\\" and the greatest \\"mental unpleasantness\\". Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics Adinazolam binds to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors that interact allosterically with GABA receptors as an agonist to produce inhibitory effects. Metabolism Adinazolam was reported to have active metabolites in the August 1984 issue of The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology. The main metabolite is N-desmethyladinazolam. NDMAD has an approximately 25-fold high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors as compared to its precursor, accounting for the benzodiazepine-like effects after oral administration. Multiple N-dealkylations lead to the removal of the dimethylaminomethyl side chain, leading to the difference in its potency. The other two metabolites are alpha-hydroxyalprazolam and estazolam. In the August 1986 issue of that same journal, Sethy, Francis and Day reported that proadifen inhibited the formation of N-desmethyladinazolam.

Purpose Nose up, tail down attitude of vehicle without self-levelling suspension Many vehicle systems on a conventional vehicle are negatively affected by the change in attitude coming from changes in load - specifically a heavy load in the rear seat or luggage compartment.http://www.equipmentworld.com/understanding-your-pickups-max- payload-capacity-and-how-helper-springs-make-a-smooth-ride-of-a-heavy-load/ This change in attitude affects aerodynamic properties, headlight aim, braking, bumpers, shock absorption from the suspension and the vehicle's performance in a collision.http://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/technology/technology_guide/articles/self_levelling.html?source=categories&article;=self_levelling Most of the braking power is on the front wheels of a vehicle, which means you will have more effective braking when more weight is over the front wheels. When the rear end has a heavy load, the braking is not as effective. The weight is concentrated on the rear end of the vehicle, and the rear brakes need to do all of the work. When braking quickly in this situation, the front brakes will be easier to lock up because of the lack of weight transfer to the front of the vehicle. Self-levelling suspension lifts the rear end of the vehicle up to spread out the weight more evenly. This puts the weight back onto the front end of the vehicle, which lets the brakes do their job more effectively.https://racingrebel.com/5-reasons-why-air-lift-1000-air-bags-are- amazing/ There is an inherent conflict in suspension design - if the springs are soft, the car will be comfortable but dramatically affected by load.http://papers.sae.org/2004-01-1078/ If the springs are hard, the car will be uncomfortable, but less affected by load. Numerous manufacturers realize this conflict and have pursued different avenues to achieve both comfort and load capacity simultaneously. History In France in 1954, Citroën introduced the first self-levelling rear suspension on a production car, and then in 1955 pioneered self-levelling of all four wheels, using its hydropneumatic system. These cars maintain an exact height over the road when the engine is on - height control valves attached to the roll bars via linkages would open to add or drain fluid from the suspension, and when the desired height was reached the valve would automatically close due to its design. Later models would use electronic height sensors and motors so adjustment could be achieved with the engine off. This system allowed the suspension to achieve an unusually soft ride quality.http://www.autoevolution.com/news/citroen-hydropneumatic-suspension- explained-49954.html Since then, millions of fairly inexpensive Citroën cars have been equipped with self-levelling as an unobtrusive, but integral design feature. The Citroën's dashboard (later console or fascia mounted controls) includes a position lever which allows the driver to select whether the car would sit with the body in high, intermediate, normal or low positions, the extremes used for maintenance such as changing wheels or hydraulic system work. Up until 1995 when they added \\"antisink\\" to the range when the engine was turned off, the suspension slowly lost pressure until the car rested on the bump stops. When the engine was restarted it rose back to its pre-selected height. The addition of anti-sink added 2 non-return valves and an extra accumulator so that when hydraulic pressure was lost the valves would close and keep the remaining fluid in the system, and leaving the car resting at a normal height when parked. In the United States, William D. Allison developed Torsion-Level Suspension used on 1955-1956 model Packards. This was an interconnected suspension, with torsion bars that ran along each side of the frame, connecting the front wheel to the rear (on the same side). Because this system is so affected by load, a supplemental, electronic leveling system was added, which uses a level sensor and a single motor to load/unload a pair of auxiliary bars to adjust vehicle attitude, but not overall ride height.http://packardinfo.com/xoops/html/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=58253http://justacarguy.blogspot.com/2014/05/packards- torsion-level-suspension.html This early attempt was an important step on the road to self-leveling, even if a full load would cause the whole car to lower evenly, rather than maintain height. In 1957, Cadillac introduced the Eldorado Brougham, a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud competitor, featuring a new Air suspension with a self leveling feature.https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/1957_%26_58_Cadillac_Eldorado_Brougham In 1966, Rolls-Royce licensed Citroën's hydropneumatic system to fit to the rear axle of the Silver Shadow. At first, both the front and rear of the car were controlled by the levelling system; the front levelling was removed in 1969 as it had been determined that the rear levelling did almost all the work. Rolls-Royce achieved a high degree of ride quality with this arrangement.http://www.rrsilvershadow.com/Emenu/hydr.htm Land Rover developed a different system for the Range Rover in the early 1970s. The Range Rover was intended to be as comfortable on the road as a normal saloon car yet as capable of heavy off-road use as a traditional Land Rover. This highlighted the contradiction in suspension design as the Range Rover used all-round long- travel coil springs. If these were kept soft to maintain comfort they would compress too much under a heavy payload, restricting axle travel when off-road and compromising handling. Land Rover developed a self-levelling rear suspension using the \\"Boge Hydromat\\" self-energising hydraulic strut.http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/specifications/land_rover/1972_range_rover.htm Of similar construction to a hydraulic shock absorber the strut used the motion of the suspension travelling over bumps to pump itself back up to a pre-set height. It was sufficiently powerful to regain up to 85% of normal ride height with a full load over the rear axle, and had the advantage of requiring no external power source or a dedicated hydraulic system in the vehicle. The same system was applied to the Land Rover in the 1980s when these vehicles adopted the Range Rover's coil spring suspension. In the 1990s Land Rover, in pursuit of the same blend of on- and off-road ability, developed an air suspension system that was both self-levelling and height adjustable. Originally this was in conjunction with live axles but it is now used with fully independent suspension using wishbones. The original coil-springs-with- hydraulic-strut system is still used on certain models of the current Land Rover Defender. BMW, Ford, GMC, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Scania AB, Subaru and Volvo have each pursued numerous avenues to address this issue, including air suspension and rear axle mechanical devices.

It features a cook of a destroyed spaceship marooned on an alien world. It was originally published on the 3DO console in 1995 and was then re-released on the Sony PlayStation in May 1996. A version for PC was also developed, but not released. Gameplay 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version screenshot. PO'ed is a first-person shooter using primitive weapons such as a frying pan and a drill. The player must advance through 26 levels filled with alien monsters. A jet-pack is also available to facilitate the player's exploration of levels. Plot The plot of PO'ed revolves around a chef whose ship has crash-landed on an alien world, from which it is the player's task to escape. Development PO'ed began development in October 1993, initially as a spare- time project. Russel Pflughaupt of Any Channel recalled, \\"We looked at games like Doom, Marathon, and Dark Forces, and took what we felt were their best elements. But we wanted to get away from the tunnel-based feel of those games, so we made the environments in PO'ed very open, and not formulaic at all.\\" The team originally wanted to include a motorcycle and a tank for the player character to ride in addition to the jet pack, but couldn't find a way to incorporate their use into the level designs. Reception PO'ed met with polarizing opinions among critics. Reviewing the 3DO version, Scary Larry of GamePro commented that the game has serious control problems, with the character often careening off edges or failing to turn at crucial moments. He nonetheless concluded that the game sufficiently fills the role of first- person shooter for the 3DO, citing the unique assortment of weapons, aggressive enemy AI, sense of humor, and relatively strong graphics. Maximum summarized the game as the \\"worst 3D action title ever seen on any format, with the exception of PlayStation Crime Crackers and some early PC public domain games (indeed, the graphics and gameplay are very reminiscent of such past atrocities).\\" They elaborated that the 3D environments constantly glitch, the floors are untextured, the attempts at humor are feeble, enemies show heavy pixelation even at medium distances, and the controls are extremely poor. A reviewer for Next Generation noted that PO'ed began as an independent project by a small group of programmers, and said that its \\"labor of love\\" nature \\"is both a blessing and a curse.\\" He elaborated that the game plays smoothly, doesn't limit the player to just walking to get around, and generally stands out from other first person shooters, but that \\"the meticulously over designed level layouts\\" and intricate textures often make the game confusing to the point of frustration. He concluded, \\"It's well done, very well done, but too tricky for its own good.\\" Reviewing the PlayStation version, most of the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt that PO'ed was a dull first-person shooter with nothing to set it apart from other games in the genre save for its sense of humor, which quickly wears thin. Mark Lefebvre also criticized the lack of improvement over the 3DO version. Mike Desmond, in a dissenting opinion, called PO'ed \\"an all-around good title that ranks highly among titles such as Doom and Duke Nukem 3D.\\" He praised the detailed graphics, variety of \\"topsy turvy\\" level designs, and large selection of weapons. In GamePro, Slo Mo said that the game lacks the terror and atmosphere of games like Doom and Alien Trilogy, but \\"does a nice job of tip- toeing between fierce and funny.\\" He particularly commented on the aggressive enemy AI and unique weapons. Next Generation said that the PlayStation version retains the bizarre style and overall experience of the 3DO original while making it easier to play, due to better controls and graphics while more clearly delineate the extremely intricate levels.

Development 2000 Today was conceived as part of the Millennium celebrations, given the numerical significance of the change from 1999 to 2000. 2000 Today was commissioned by the BBC as one of the five main millennium projects that were broadcast across TV, radio and online services throughout 1999 and 2000. Most nations that observe the Islamic calendar were not involved in 2000 Today. However, a few predominantly Muslim nations were represented among the programme's worldwide broadcasters such as Egypt (ERTU) and Indonesia (RCTI). Africa was minimally represented in 2000 Today. The only participating nations from that continent were Egypt and South Africa. Portugal-based RTP África distributed the programme to some African nations. Antarctica was mentioned on the programme schedule, although it was unclear if 2000 Today coverage was recorded or live.

Each participant financed and produced its own contributions and shared the core costs proportionately to its size and wealth. It is estimated to have cost $6 million to produce and broadcast. 2000 Today was nominated for \\"Best Visual Effects and Graphic Design\\" at the 2000 British Academy Television Craft Awards. Program timeline 2000 Today's core international broadcast was 28 hours long, following the beginning of the New Year 2000 across the world's time zones. The programme was tailored by individual broadcasters to provide local content and hosts. The broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom started on 31 December 1999 at 09:15 UTC. 2000 Today started its international feed at 09:40 UTC, with the Kiribati Line Islands celebrating the arrival of 2000 at 10:00 UTC. Most of Europe celebrated midnight at 23:00 UTC. Broadcasting celebrations from many countries under Central European Time posed a particularly complex broadcast challenge. 2000 Today chose to rapidly air each nation's midnight observances in succession, using tape delays in most cases. This hour of the broadcast included a blessing by Pope John Paul II from Vatican City and the pyrotechnic display of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. ABC 2000 however decided to use Paris for its broadcast in the United States while French broadcasters TF1 and France 2 covered the festivities live from the Eiffel Tower. In addition, Italian broadcaster Rai used the pope's blessing for its Millennium - La Notte Del 2000 broadcast. 2000 Today's international feed finished shortly after midnight celebrations were broadcast from Samoa on 1 January 2000 at 11:00 UTC. BBC One in the United Kingdom continued to broadcast with national features until 13:30. Later the same evening, it aired a two-hour highlights programme, The Best of 2000 Today.

The province bordered Kirman in the west, Spahan in the north west, Kushanshahr in the north east, and Turan in the south east. The governor of the province held the title of marzban. The governor also held the title of \\"Sakanshah\\" (king of the Saka) until the title was abolished in ca. 459/60.  Etymology  The word \\"Sakastan\\" means \\"the land of the Saka\\", a Scythian group which from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century migrated to the Iranian Plateau and India, where they carved a kingdom known as the Indo-Scythian Kingdom. In the Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian scripture written in Pahlavi, the province is written as \\"Seyansih\\". After the Arab conquest of Iran, the province became known as \\"Sijistan\\" and later as \\"Sistan\\", which still remains a province to this day in Iran (Sistan and Baluchestan Province).  History  The province was formed in ca. 240, during the reign of Shapur I (r. 240–270), as part of his intention to centralise his empire - before that, the province was under the rule of the Parthian Suren Kingdom, whose ruler Ardashir Sakanshah became a Sasanian vassal during the reign of Shapur's father Ardashir I (r. 224–242), who also had the ancient city Zrang rebuilt, which became the capital of the province. Shapur's son Narseh was the first to be appointed as the governor of the province, which he would govern until 271, when the Sasanian prince Hormizd was appointed as the new governor. Later in ca. 281, Hormizd revolted against his cousin Bahram II (r. 274–293). During the revolt, the people of Sakastan was one of his supporters. Nevertheless, Bahram II managed to suppress the revolt in 283, and appointed his son Bahram III as the governor of the province. During the early reign of Shapur II (r. 309-379), he appointed his brother Shapur Sakanshah as the governor of Sakastan. Peroz I (r. 459–484), during his early reign, put an end to dynastic rule in province by appointing a Karenid as its governor. The reason behind the appointment was to avoid further family conflict in the province, and in order to gain more direct control of the province. Silver coin of Yazdegerd III, struck in Sakastan, dated 651 During the Muslim conquest of Persia, the last Sasanian king Yazdegerd III fled to Sakastan in the mid-640s, where its governor Aparviz (who was more or less independent), helped him. However, Yazdegerd III quickly ended this support when he demanded tax money that he had failed to pay. In 650/1, Abd-Allah ibn Amir, who had recently conquered Kirman, sent Rabi ibn Ziyad Harithi to an expedition in Sakastan. After some time, he reached Zaliq, a border town between Kirman and Sakastan, where he forced the dehqan of the town to acknowledge Rashidun authority. He then did the same at the fortress of Karkuya, which had a famous fire temple, which is mentioned in the Tarikh-i Sistan. He then continued to seize more land in the province. He thereafter besieged Zrang, and after a heavy battle outside the city, Aparviz and his men surrendered. When Aparviz went to Rabi to discuss about the conditions of a treaty, he saw that he was using the bodies of two dead soldiers as a chair. This horrified Aparviz, who in order to spare the inhabitants of Sakastan from the Arabs, made peace with the Arabs in return for heavy tribute, which included a tribute of 1,000 slave boys bearing 1,000 golden vessels. Sakastan was thus under the control of the Rashidun Caliphate.  Population and religion  During the Achaemenid period, Sakastan (then known as Drangiana), was populated by a Persianized east Iranian group known as the Drangians. From the 2nd century BC to the 1st century, Sakastan saw a huge influx of Saka tribesmen and also some Parthians, which, in the words of Brunner, \\"reshaped the region's older population pattern\\". The inhabitants of Sakastan were mainly Zoroastrian, while a minority of them were Nestorian Christians.  House of Suren  The House of Suren, a Parthian noble family that served the Parthian and later the Sasanian Empire, was part of the seven Parthian clans of the Sasanian Empire—each family owned land in different parts of the empire, the Surens owning land in parts of Sakastan.  Mint  Under Shapur II, a Sasanian mint was established in Sakastan (mint-mark: SKSTN, S, SK). From the first reign of Kavad I (r. 488–496) onwards, this mint was located at the provincial capital Zrang (mint-mark: ZR, ZRN, ZRNG).

Rumors were circulated that it was the initial design for the MKI MR2, but, though sharing an engine, it bears very little resemblance to the mid-engine roadster. The project was the last one overseen by Lotus founder Colin Chapman before his death in 1982. In 1981, Oliver Winterbottom was brought back to Lotus, after a stint developing the Tasmin for TVR, to design a new car to complement the Excel and the Esprit and bring some profitability to the lineup. The new car was to resurrect the Elan name which had not been used since 1975 and, like the Excel, make use of the company's close relationship with Toyota to use already well-engineered suspension and engine components. Initial designs were a coupé that didn't get much of an enthusiastic response from the board of the company. The project stalled when company founder Colin Chapman died in 1982, as Lotus found itself in financial trouble. David Wickens of British Car Auctions ended up taking a controlling interest in the company, and the project was started up again, but renamed to the X100 (the Elan later being known as the M100). After redesigning the car to be a convertible the go ahead was given in 1984 to make a single prototype. It was built to a high level of finish, but by that time most of the company's engineers were concentrating on the new front-wheel- drive Elan, and the prototype was warehoused at the company's factory. In 1998 it was auctioned off along with several other rare Lotus cars, and sold to a private collector, and shipped to the United States. The M90 makes use of a front-mounted 1.6L 4-cylinder Toyota engine, as well as a Toyota-built 5-speed transmission and final drive. The suspension uses the same setup as is found in the Lotus Excel. The instrument cluster is from an Opel Monza and the radiator is from an Austin Allegro. The rear lights are borrowed from the Aston Martin Lagonda and the indicators are from the Ford Fiesta. The body is made of fibreglass and the roof is lowered in two pieces. The top is removed separately and fits in the boot, to create a 'targa' style roof, and the rear portion folds down like a typical convertible. This car is featured in a book released in June 2017 by Oliver Winterbottom titled A Life in Car Design, in which the author provides insight into the design and construction of the M90 along with photographs and related documentation.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Pinazepam and its metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam are transferred to the developing fetus in utero, but the plasma drug level in the mother is usually significantly higher than in the fetus. Pinazepam differs from other benzodiazepines in that it has a propargyl group at the N-1 position of the benzodiazepine structure. It is less toxic than diazepam and in animal studies it appears to produce anxiolytic and anti-agitation properties with limited hypnotic and motor coordination impairing properties. Pinazepam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The main active metabolites of pinazepam are depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam, nordazepam) and oxazepam. In humans pinazepam acts as a pure anxiolytic agent in that it does not possess to any significant degree the other pharmacological characteristics of benzodiazepines. Its lack of intellectual, motor and hypnotic impairing effects makes it more appropriate than other benzodiazepines for day time use. The elimination half-life is longer in the elderly.

The Electric Palace cinema, Harwich, is one of the oldest purpose-built cinemas to survive complete with its silent screen, original projection room and ornamental frontage still intact. It was designed by the architect Harold Ridley Hooper of Ipswich, Suffolk and opened on 29 November 1911. Other interesting features include an open plan entrance lobby complete with paybox, and a small stage plus dressing rooms although the latter are now unusable. The original Crossley gas engine, which provided, in conjunction with a 100 V DC generator, the electricity for the \\"Electric\\" Palace until 1925 is also still present. Unfortunately it is neither practical to restore, or remove, this engine. The cinema closed in 1956 after being damaged in the 1953 East Coast floods, but re-opened in 1981, retaining the original screen, projection room and frontage as well as much of the original interior. It is now a community cinema and until 2006, when a Wednesday screening programme was introduced, films were shown at weekends only. The building also hosts regular jazz and folk concerts. The cinema is a Grade II* listed building and in 2009 was removed from the Buildings at Risk Register: English Heritage : English Heritage maintained by English Heritage following structural refurbishment, the completion of which, was celebrated on 15 July 2009.: Daily Gazette 15 July 2009 In November 2006, British actor Clive Owen became patron of the cinema and at his first official visit he helped launch an appeal to raise funds to repair this historic building. History=1911–1956 The Electric Palace in 1912 In the early years of the 20th century the travelling fairground Showman Charles Thurston was touring East Anglia with his Bioscope shows.http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/bioscopes/presenters/thurston.html . Such travelling 'moving picture' shows were common at the time, but with the introduction of the Cinematograph Act 1909, which imposed strict fire prevention regulations on any venue in which films were shown to the public, it became effectively impossible to put on a legal film show in a fairground tent. Hence Thurston decided to build a permanent \\"Picture Palace\\" in which he could continue to screen films to the public. In 1911 he was able to obtain a lease on a site in Kings Quay Street, Harwich which had become vacant due to the previous building on the site being destroyed by fire. He engaged the young architect Harold Hooper to design the building, which was to be known as the Electric Palace, for him. Hooper was a dynamic young man of 26 years who demonstrated his imaginative flair with this his first major building.: Electric Palace : Introduction The Electric Palace was built in 18 weeks at a cost of £1,500 and opened on Wednesday, 29 November 1911, the first film being \\"The Battle of Trafalgar and The Death of Nelson\\". The cinema was an immediate success and continued to be financially successful through WW1 thanks to the presence of Navy personnel in the port of Harwich. However almost as soon as the war was over business at the \\"Palace\\", as the cinema was now called, went into decline due to the loss of population from Harwich to nearby Dovercourt and competition from the newer, plusher, cinemas there. For nearly four decades the Palace struggled on, never doing badly enough to close, but never doing well enough to justify enlargement or a major facelift. The coming of sound in 1930 gave a boost, but it was short-lived. Then in 1953 the cinema was inundated by seawater due to the East-Coast flood of that year, which forced it to close. Although it was dried-out, repaired and reopened, the floods had affected more than just the cinema, nearby housing had also been affected reducing further the local population. This proved to be the 'last nail in the coffin', and the Palace closed after 45 years of operation, following a final showing of the Glynis Johns comedy: \\"Mad about Men\\", on 3 November 1956. 1972–present Electric Palace Cinema in 2009 Electric Palace Cinema Interior For the next 16 years the building lay abandoned and largely forgotten until in 1972 it was \\"discovered\\" by Gordon Miller of Kingston Polytechnic, who was leading a group of students on a survey of Harwich. He was amazed to find this virtually unaltered relic of the early period of cinema architecture lying forgotten in a Harwich side-street. He was also disturbed to discover that the town council was intending to demolish the entire block of which the cinema was a part to provide additional parking space for lorries. With the aid of the Harwich Society he obtained a listing for the cinema as being \\"a building of sociological interest\\" in September of that year.\\"Old Cinema Listed for Preservation\\" – Harwich and Manningtree Standard, 29 September 1972 This action infuriated the council, and split opinion in the town. The local newspaper carried letters variously describing the building as \\"a derelict flea-pit of no interest\\", or as \\"a potential asset to the town\\". An unknown wit wrote: They came from Kingston to survey the town, and stopped us from pulling the old Palace down. If they like it so much, this tumbledown shack, to Kingston-on-Thames may they carry it back. For a couple of years the arguments flew, it even made the national newspapers.Kenneth Allsop: \\"The Electric Palace Saga\\" – Sunday Times, 10 December 1972 Meanwhile, Gordon Miller researched the history of the building from the council archives, contemporary newspaper reports and interviews with surviving members of the Electric Palace staff. In April 1975 the Electric Palace Trust was formed with the avowed aim of restoring the building so that it could, again, be used as a fully operational cinema. The council granted a \\"repairing lease\\" to the Trust in May of that year and restoration started, initially using mostly volunteer labour.\\"The Harwich Electric Palace\\" by C.S. Strachan, published 1979. Later the council was to sell the freehold to the Trust. The cinema, having reverted to its original name of Electric Palace, re-opened in 1981. The grand re-opening on 29 November 1981, the 70th anniversary of the original opening, was filmed by the BBC for their children's programme \\"Blue Peter\\". The Electric Palace now runs as a community cinema showing films every weekend. Typically, there are five film shows each weekend including matinees. The Sunday evening slot is frequently given over to world cinema, arthouse cinema or classic films, while more mainstream movies occupy the other slots. Special films can be booked for groups such as local schools of relevance to their school curriculum, or societies with a specific interest. Live events include regular jazz concerts and productions by amateur drama groups. Patrons of the Electric Palace Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman was Patron from 1975 until his death in 1984 whilst film historian, and lecturer on the art of cinema, John Huntley was Patron from 1985–2003. The current Patron Clive Owen made his first official visit to the Electric Palace on 10 November 2006 when he helped launch the Electric Palace Appeal. Entertainment in the early days In its heyday between 1912 and the 1920s the Electric Palace was the centre of entertainment in Harwich. From the beginning the programmes were full of variety and often the major part of the bill would be taken up with vaudeville rather than films. The venue was regularly played by a wide spectrum of entertainers including acrobats, burlesques, conjurors, hypnotists, impersonators, singers, patterers, knockabouts mimics, dancers and comedians. Notable among this latter group was the young Scottish comedian Will Fyffe who was stationed at Felixstowe during the First World War. Billy Good, who was later the resident pianist, remembered well Will Fyffe's appearances at the Palace and it seems that they were an exception since most of the variety acts between 1915 and 1918 were either juveniles or those too old for active service in the World War. In the golden age of the Electric Palace society was still fairly rigidly stratified into classes and this reflected in the seating arrangements. Entry to the better seats was through the front entrance foyer, the prices being sixpence for good seats and one shilling for the very best. The cheaper seats were simply wooden benches and entry to these was past another paybox down an alley at the side. This entrance was known as the 'tuppenny rush.' One doorman remembered the rush being so great that he ended up flat on his back with the children stampeding over him as in a Mack Sennett comedy – and most of them getting in for nothing! The programme advertisements in the local paper, the Harwich and Dovercourt Standard, of 1912 and 1913 are full of fun and exclamation marks. Great play is made of the superb ventilation, the regular disinfection of the auditorium, the sedate and orderly composure of the clientele, and the exclusiveness of the films. From the outset the films and vaudeville acts were accompanied at the piano. Billy Good, the pianist from 1920–1922 recalled the very long hours worked by all the staff and particularly himself arduously craning up at the screen from the rather dingy pit recessed into the floor in front of the stage. However, the 'pit neck ache' didn't matter since he was 100% engrossed in the music and loved every minute of it playing two houses every night except Sunday for £1-15s–0d. a week. Billy's career changed course in 1922 when one day a potato chip machine took slices from his fingers rather than the potato. He carried on playing 'with left thumb and little finger 'hors-de-combat' but it didn't take 'old Gilbert', the manager, long to notice the difference. He poked his head over the pit rail and said \\"You young rascal, you've got a bloody cheek\\" which under the circumstances was rather appropriate, and possibly literally true. So Billy went off to sea to harden up his injured fingers and when the cinema reopened in 1981 Billy Good, by then in his eighties, returned to the cinema to provide musical accompaniment once again to the occasional silent film. Operations and finance Since reopening in 1981, the cinema has been managed by a limited company which is a subsidiary of the Harwich Electric Palace Trust that owns the building. Almost all the staff of the limited company work as volunteers, including the directors, projectionists, managers and sales people. The limited company usually makes a small profit which is then paid over to the charitable trust and thereby used for the maintenance and upgrading of the building. The cinema runs on a club basis and most of the club membership income is used to pay for insurance – one of its chief expenses.: Electric Palace : A Community Cinema The cinema has no subsidies except for very special events when a grant makes it was possible to present a gala screening, for example of a silent classic with live orchestral accompaniment. The motivation for the project has been the saving and restoration of the building and the renaissance of cinema in a community that had had no cinema for many years. Projectors at the Electric Palace A Gaumont Kalee projector from the 1930s 1911 The Electric Palace opened with a single projector, probably a Kalee. Soon after a Gaumont machine was provided as a standby. In those days films were short and it was not necessary to use two machines together to allow feature-length films to be shown.: Electric Palace : Projectors at the electric palace 1927 A second Gaumont was installed replacing the Kalee. By this time the two projectors were being used together to allow feature-length films to be screened without a break. 1930 Sound-on-disc playback equipment from \\"Syntok Talking Films Ltd.\\" was installed to allow Vitaphone films to be screened. The first 'talking picture' shown was Warner Brothers' \\"The Singing Fool\\", starring Al Jolson, screened on 10 March 1930. 1931 The Syntok equipment had proved to be unsatisfactory, it was both unreliable and had poor sound quality. Consequently, it was replaced by a new Western Electric sound-on-film sound system. This consisted of standard Western Electric soundheads together with the Western Electric 4A amplifier system. The 4A was the smallest of the Western Electric cinema amplifier systems available at the time and was intended for small cinemas. Two Western Electric 12A full-range horn loudspeakers were employed, hung from a substantial wooden structure behind the screen. The high efficiency of these speakers made the most of the limited output power (about 5 watts) of the 4A amplifier system. At the same time the two Gaumont projectors were replaced by new Kalee model 7 machines. 1956 The cinema closed. The projection equipment was left to its fate in the abandoned cinema. 1972 When the cinema was \\"discovered\\" in 1972 the projection room equipment was found to have been wrecked by a combination of theft, vandalism and corrosion. When the restoration began what was left of it was stripped-out and disposed of. 1981 As part of the restoration of the cinema Kalee 'Dragon' projectors were installed. These came from the Admiralty Cinema, Whitehall where Churchill used to watch the rushes of the war newsreels. The lamps were Vulcan arcs from the Regent Cinema in nearby Dovercourt. The sound system was initially driven by a Kalee model 522 valve amplifier. This equipment was used at the re-opening of the cinema on 29 November 1981. 1985 Kalee 20s and Peerless carbon arcs were installed replacing the Kalee Dragons. The projectors came from the Odeon Cinema in Clacton in Essex and the Peerless carbon arcs came from the Regal Cinema in Stowmarket, Suffolk. The Kalee valve amplifier was replaced by a DIY stereo sound system that consisted of two mono Dolby A cinema systems (Dolby 364 with E2 equaliser) which came from the ABC Cinema in Ipswich Suffolk, together with Quad 606 amplifiers and Celestion SR1/SR2 loudspeakers. 1998 With the help of an Arts Council of England lottery grant the projection system was refurbished. Xenon arc bulbs replaced the carbon arcs and new rectifiers were fitted. A new sound system based around a Dolby CP500 processor was installed. This can play films with mono or Dolby Stereo analogue soundtracks as well as those with a 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack. The reel arms were extended to take 6000 foot reels and inverters were installed for the drive motors. New Isco wide screen and anamorphic lenses were installed. A Sanyo PLC-XF12B multimedia projector was also provided for use with a computer or for showing DVDs or Blu-ray discs. 2011 Digital projection equipment comprising a Christie CP2220 digital projector and a Doremi DCP-2k4 server was installed. Which can project up to full hd 1080p Palace Digital Fund A campaign was launched in 2010 to bring the iconic cinema into the digital age. The cost of the new digital equipment was estimated at £55,000 and the Electric Palace Trust aimed to raise the money by November 2011 when the cinema celebrated its centenary. This aim was realised with the aid of funding from the Digital Funding Partnership, a joint venture between the Cinema Exhibitors Association and the Belgian company XDC, and with the help of grants from local government and other grant-making bodies. This equipment was first used on the evening of the centenary, 29 November 2011, to screen the new Terence Davies film \\"The Deep Blue Sea\\". The cinema will retain the two 60-year-old Kalee model 20 projectors so that in future, when new releases are all digital, it will still be possible to screen pre-digital-age films such as those from the National Archive of the British Film Institute. Over the years the Electric Palace has built up a very good working relationship with the BFI because it can project these historic films on the class of machines on which they were projected at first release.

The adjacent Hudson's Bay department store abuts the Freiman Mall on both its north and south sides, and can be accessed from the Freiman Mall interior. History A.J. Freiman on Rideau, 1938 Mosgrove Street, from Rideau, 1938 The current location of the Freiman Mall was once a public street called Mosgrove Street, located immediately to the east of the Freimans department store which was adjacent to the ByWard Market and the former Metropolitan department store. The street was later renamed Freiman Street after the department store and its founder, Archibald Jacob Freiman. The Freimans department store was acquired by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1972 and rebranded as an outlet of the company's (then) \\"The Bay\\" chain. In conjunction with the development of the Rideau Centre across the street, the City of Ottawa agreed in 1981 to close Freiman Street and to lease the land to the HBC for a term of 99 years in exchange for the construction of an enclosed, public pedestrian passageway connecting Rideau Street to George Street and the ByWard Market, to be open 24 hours per day. Under the terms of the lease, HBC was entitled to install three kiosks related to its store within the new Freiman Mall. The company and the city would share operating and security costs, with the City's share based on the proportion of public (non-retail) floor area and the amount of time the mall would be open past the store's operating hours. The Freiman Mall was officially opened by Ottawa mayor Marion Dewar on May 12, 1983, at which time a commemorative plaque was unveiled within the mall honouring A. J. Freiman and his family. In order to reduce the City's share of the operating and security costs, the lease was amended in 1992 to allow HBC to encroach into the Freiman Mall with its merchandise displays, as long as a minimum -wide public passageway was maintained. So as to reduce security costs, the lease amendment also allowed the company to close the Freiman Mall during a portion of the night.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Therapeutic uses It is used for the treatment of anxiety and has similar effectiveness compared to diazepam. Ketazolam also appears to produce a reduced level of side effects such as sedation compared with diazepam and the side effects when they occur tend to be milder. Ketazolam is also an effective antispasmodic drug and is used for the treatment of spasticity. Availability Ketazolam is not approved for sale in Australia, United Kingdom or the United States. In South Africa, GlaxoSmithKline markets ketazolam under its Solatran brand name. In Canada, ketazolam is listed in schedule IV of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, along with other benzodiazepines.http://laws- lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/page-26.html#h-29 Tolerance and physical dependence Chronic use of ketazolam as with other benzodiazepines can lead to physical dependence and the appearance of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome upon cessation of use or decrease in dose. Tolerance to ketazolam's therapeutic effects occurs over a period of 15 days. Contraindications and special caution Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Pharmacokinetics Ketazolam breaks down in the blood to diazepam which breaks down to demoxepam which breaks down to desmethyldiazepam. Warnings The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that in Spain, ketazolam marketed as Marcen may sometimes be mistakenly confused with Narcan. Legal status Ketazolam is a List 3 drug under the Betäubungsmittelgesetz, like almost all benzodiazepines in Germany. Ketazolam is a List II drugs of the Opium Law in the Netherlands. Ketazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Controlled Substances Act in the US.

Marcus was one of the three most common Roman given names. Meaning and history Mark is a form of the name Marcus. Mark the Evangelist is the traditionally ascribed eponymous author of the second Gospel in the New Testament. He is the patron saint of Venice, where he is supposedly buried. Though in use during the Middle Ages, Mark was not common in the English- speaking world until the 19th century, when it began to be used alongside the classical form Marcus. In the Celtic legend of Tristan and Isolde this was the name of a king of Cornwall. It was also borne by the American author Mark Twain (1835–1910), real name Samuel Clemens, the author of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He actually took his pen name from a call used by riverboat workers on the Mississippi River to indicate a depth of two fathoms. This is also the usual English spelling of the name of the 1st-century BC Roman triumvir Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony).Behind the Name - Mark In other languages                 Academics * Mark Adler (born 1959), American software engineer * Mark Azadovsky (1888–1954), Russian scholar of folk-tales and Russian literature * Mark Benecke (born 1970), German forensic biologist * Mark Blaug (1927–2011), Dutch-born British economist * Mark Buchanan (born 1961), American physicist * Mark Catesby (1682–1749), English naturalist * Mark Wayne Chase (born 1951), American-born British botanist * Mark R.

History The station opened by British Rail on 3 October 1983 to serve the new suburbs of Runcorn New Town. It is situated a short distance from the site of the former Norton station (closed by the British Transport Commission in 1952) and the nearby signal box still bears this name. The station was formally adopted by the North Cheshire Rail Users group on 16 May 2008, under the Arriva Trains Wales Adopt a Station Initiative. Facilities Arriva began looking into the possibility of installing scrolling information screens on the platforms, with train running information in 2008. An initial site survey was carried out on 30 May 2008 with a follow up on 20 September 2008. A third site survey was carried out in January 2010; this also included a PA system being installed, looking at improving CCTV coverage over the station and improvements for disabled access to the station. On 17 January 2011 site work started on the installation of information screens on both platforms - these are now completed and operational (as of May 2011). The station has a staffed ticket office - this is staffed six days per week (not Sundays) from the start of the morning peak until early afternoon. At other times tickets can be purchased from a self- service ticket machine (card payments only) near the main entrance, or on the train. Waiting shelters and bench seating is provided at platform level. Step- free access to both platforms is via ramps from the footbridge that links the ticket office and car park.Runcorn East station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 24 February 2017 Services Runcorn East is served by an hourly Transport for Wales service to Manchester Piccadilly via Warrington Bank Quay.

It was released in the United Kingdom as Esma's Secret: Grbavica, and in US as Grbavica: Land of My Dreams. The film shows, through the eyes of the main character Esma, her teenage daughter Sara, and others, how everyday life is still being shaped by the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. The film was an international co-production between companies from Bosnia, Austria, Croatia, and Germany; it received funding from the German television companies ZDF and Arte. Grbavica received an enthusiastic response from critics, earning a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It won the Golden Bear at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival and it was Bosnia-Herzegovina's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards but it was not nominated. Background The title refers to the neighbourhood of Sarajevo where Esma lives, which was one of the most traumatized neighbourhoods in the city. According to the director, > ...in 1992 everything changed and I realized that I was living in a war in > which sex was used as part of a war strategy to humiliate women and thereby > cause the destruction of an ethnic group. 20,000 women were systematically > raped in Bosnia during the war. In the film, the Serb perpetrators of sex acts are referred to as Chetniks, a derogatory term which some of the population of Sarajevo (mostly Bosnian Muslims and Croats) used for the besieging Serb troops. Plot Single mother Esma lives with her 12-year-old daughter Sara in post-war Sarajevo. Sara wants to go on a school field trip and her mother starts working as a waitress at a nightclub to earn the money for the trip. Sara befriends Samir, who, like Sara, has no father. Both of their fathers allegedly died as war heroes. Samir is surprised to find out that Sara does not know the circumstances of her father's death. Samir's own father was killed by Serbian military near Žuč when he refused to leave the trench he was defending. Whenever Sara and her mother discuss this delicate topic, however, Esma's responses are always vague. The situation grows more complicated when students who can provide a certificate proving that they are the offspring of war heroes can go on the field trip for free. Esma explains to Sara that her father's corpse was never found and that she has no certificate. She promises to try to obtain the document. Secretly, however, Esma attempts to borrow the money Sara needs from her friend Sabina, her aunt and her boss. Sara is haunted by a nagging feeling that something is not right. Shocked and bewildered when she discovers she is not mentioned as the child of a war hero on the list of pupils going on the school trip, Sara lashes out at Samir. At home, however, she confronts her mother and demands to know the truth. Esma breaks down and finally admits that she was raped at a prisoner camp and forced to have the child who resulted from this violation. Sara realizes she is the child of a Serbian soldier. This discovery brings her closer to her mother and helps overcome her trauma. In the end, Sara leaves for the field trip, not waving to her mother until the last moment. On the bus, the students sing a popular song about Sarajevo (\\"Land of My Dreams\\"), and Sara joins in.

History Lambton Shores was formed in 2001 when the Township of Bosanquet was amalgamated with the town of Forest, and the villages of Thedford, Arkona, Ipperwash, Port Franks, Ravenswood and Grand Bend. Climate Lambton Shores is one of the more southerly municipalities in Canada, and therefore receives relatively warmer temperatures. It has an average high of in July and in January. As for precipitation, it receives an average of of rain in July and an average of of snow in January. Communities The main communities in Lambton Shores are Arkona, Forest, Grand Bend, Port Franks and Thedford. Smaller communities include Cedarview, Glendale Beach, Kettle and Stoney Point, Ipperwash Beach, Lake Valley Grove, Jericho, Jura, Kinnaird, Northville, Ravenswood, Southcott Pines, Springvale, Sunnidale, Walden Place and Walker Woods. The administrative offices of the township are located in Thedford. Arkona Arkona is a community located in the municipality of Lambton Shores in southwestern Ontario near the Lambton-Middlesex county line, situated beside the Ausable River, on Former Kings Highway 79 (now Lambton County Road 79), Arkona is roughly halfway between Thedford, and Watford. Arkona, Ontario, Canada Forest Forest, Ontario, Canada Forest is situated on what was once dense forest. When the Grand Trunk Railway was built through where the town now sits, the station was named for the dense forest. Hickory Creek, which meanders through the town, provided water for the station in those days when wood and water were essential to the operation of steam locomotives. Grand Bend Main Street in Grand Bend The settlement began in the 1830s when a group of English and Scottish settlers bought lots from the Canada Company, a land development firm. One of the original settlers, Benjamin Brewster gave his name to the village after he and his business partner David Smart secured rights to dam the Ausable River and started a sawmill in 1832. The villagers were mainly the families of the millhands and fisherman. Their homesteads were situated on the south side of the present village. Thedford Thedford, Ontario, Canada Thedford is a small community in northwestern Lambton County, Ontario Canada, situated 8 km south of Kings Highway 21, along Lambton CR 79 (Former Kings Highway 79). The community began in the 1860s when farmer Nelson Southworth, a native of Vermont, agreed to donate land for the construction of a Grand Trunk Railway station, with the condition that he would be able to name it. Southworth chose the name \\"Thetford\\", as a way of honouring Thetford, Vermont, a community in his home state in the United States. A local clerk's poor hand writing was mistaken for the current spelling, which is how it first appeared on official records. The Thedford Raiders Hockey Team once held the World Record for Longest Continuous Hockey Game, which was also a fundraiser for juvenile diabetes. A plaque at the entrance of the town heralds it as the \\"Onion Capital of Canada\\".

Early life Mackenzie was born in Coul, Ross-shire, Scotland, fourth son of Sir George Steuart Mackenzie, and wife Mary, fifth daughter of Donald Macleod of Geanies, Ross-shire. New South Wales In April 1832 Mackenzie arrived on the Wave in Sydney, New South Wales, with £750 joining his brother James. He purchased sheep for £500 and grazed them at Riddlesdale (near Dungog, New South Wales). After land speculation with his brother James, Robert Mackenzie bought a station, got into debt and borrowed money from his Scottish relatives. His financial situation worsened and he was declared bankrupt in 1844. In 1846 he was discharged from bankruptcy and was appointed a magistrate in 1847, living in Clifton, New England. Political career Queensland was declared a separate colony in 1859, Mackenzie entered politics and became Colonial Treasurer on 15 December 1859 in the ministry of Robert Herbert. Mackenzie represented Burnett in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland 1860–1869.

Puckett, InfoWorld, 13 Apr 1981, Page 46 The SS-50 motherboard would have around seven 50-pin connectors for CPU and memory boards plus eight 30-pin connectors for I/O boards. The I/O section was sometimes called the SS-30 bus. Southwest Technical Products Corporation introduced this bus in November 1975 and soon other companies were selling add-in boards. Some of the early boards were floppy disk systems from Midwest Scientific Instruments, Smoke Signal Broadcasting, and PerCom Data; an EPROM programmer from the Micro Works; video display boards from Gimix; memory boards from Seals. By 1978 there were a dozen SS-50 board suppliers and several compatible SS-50 computers. In 1979 SWTPC modified the SS-50 bus to support the new Motorola MC6809 processor. These changes were compatible with most existing boards and this upgrade gave the SS-50 Bus a long life. SS-50 based computers were made until the late 1980s. The SS-50C bus, the S/09 version of the SS-50 bus, extended the address by four address lines to 20 address lines to allow up to a megabyte of memory in a system. \\"The S/09 version of the SS-50 and SS-30 busses\\" \\"Digital Research / Tanner 64K SS-50C Memory Board\\" Boards for the SS-50 bus were typically 9 inches wide and 5.5 inches high. The board had Molex 0.156 inch connectors while the motherboard had the pins. This arrangement made for low cost printed circuit boards that did not need gold plated edge connectors. The tin plated Molex connectors were only rated for a few insertions and were sometimes a problem in hobbyist systems where the boards were being swapped often. Later systems would often come with gold plated Molex connectors. The SS-30 I/O Bus had the address decoding on the motherboard. Each slot was allocated 4 address (the later MC6809 version upped this to 16 address.) This made for very simple I/O boards, the Motorola peripheral chips connected directly to this bus.http://www.corshamtech.com/ss-50-faqs/ SS-50 and SS-30 gallery Click the images to enlarge.

Step-free access is available to both platforms, although the footbridge between them has stairs.Frodsham station facilities National Rail Enquiries Services The station is served by an hourly Transport for Wales service to Manchester Airport via Warrington Bank Quay and an hourly service to Liverpool Lime Street. In the other direction, services run to Chester, with trains from Manchester often continuing along the North Wales Coast Line as far as Llandudno, while trains from Liverpool currently terminate at Chester save for a single service to Wrexham on weekday and Saturday evenings. On Sundays trains only run between Manchester and Chester and Liverpool and Chester. Frodsham is also served by the infrequent (one train per day, now northbound only) Northern Trains- operated service between Leeds and Ellesmere Port. This does not run on Saturdays and Sundays.

This line was, until September 2018, served by just one \\"parliamentary\\" passenger train a week (which operated on summer Saturdays only) to fulfil legal and contractual obligations and keep the line \\"open\\" in accordance with Government legislation. The curve had lost its regular service in May 1975, but continued to be used by seasonal passenger trains between Liverpool Lime Street and Llandudno until 1994 (hence the summer-only service requirement). The train started from Chester and ran non- stop to Runcorn, passing through Frodsham without calling. In May 2019 regular service was reintroduced between Liverpool Lime Street and Chester, via Runcorn, with one train per hour every day. TfW Rail also run two trains a day from Wrexham General to Liverpool Lime Street with one in the opposite direction. These services where originally planned to start in December 2018, however this was delayed due to a shortage of available rolling stock.

Known as Gagik II King of Ani (Ani being the capital of the kingdom at the time), a juvenile at the time, he was enthroned as Gagik II and ruled for a brief period from 1042 to 1045 before the Bagratid dynasty rule collapsed in Armenia. Historical background During the reign of Hovhannes- Smbat (John-Smbat), a feudal lord, David, who owned Taik during his battles against the Muslims, gained a large area which stretched all the way to Manzikert. David was a subject of Byzantium and when he died his entire territory was occupied by Basil II, who had resumed the policy of, bit by bit, annexing Armenia to his empire. This policy of occupation and expansion was also pursued by the successors of Basil II. By the death of Hovhannes-Smbat around 1040 and that of Ashot IV shortly after, Michael V, one of the successors of Basil II, was the emperor cornering Armenia. Michael claimed that the Kingdom of Ani by virtue of the will of Hovhannes-Smbat, was bequeathed to the Byzantine Empire upon his death. When the Armenian sparapet, Vahram Pahlavuni, prepared the coronation of the successor to Hovhannes-Smbat, the king's nephew, Gagik II, who at that time was only fourteen years old, the Byzantine emperor began supporting vestes Sargis Haykazn, a pro-Byzantine Armenian prince and minister of the former king, who had initially been appointed regent.Garsoïan, Nina G. (1997). \\"The Byzantine Annexation of the Armenian Kingdoms in the Eleventh Century,\\" in The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. New York: St. Martin's Press, pp. 192-93. After this the kingdom of Ani resisted three assaults of the Byzantine Empire, forcing them to retreat. Byzantium exerted its forces to the utmost in order to conquer Armenia and once and for all annexing it to the empire. To this end, they sent a great army to the southern part of Armenia and at the same time convinced the king of Tashir-Dzoraget to attack Ani from the east. At the fierce battle that was fought by the walls of Ani, general Vahram Pahlavuni heavily defeated the Byzantine army, forcing them to leave 20,000 dead behind, according to contemporary Armenian chroniclers. This victory allowed Vahram Pahlavuni along with Catholicos Petros I Getadardz to crown Gagik II king of Armenia and subsequently take the fortress of Ani, which was in the hands of Vest Sargis. Sargis fled to the fortress of St. Mary and was eventually captured. Bartikyan, Hrach (1976), \\"Բագրատունյաց թագավորության անկումը,\\" [The fall of the Bagratuni kingdom] in Հայ Ժողովրդի Պատմություն [History of the Armenian People], eds. Tsatur Aghayan et al. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, vol. 3, pp. 149-52. After this victory, the new Armenian king, together with Vahram, turned toward their second enemy, the Seljuq Turks, who were still intent on conquering the kingdom. In the following two years Gagik reinforced the army and fought against Seljuq hordes. Gregory Pahlavuni nephew of Vahram, defended the fortress of Bjni.Bedrosian, Robert. \\"Armenian during the Seljuk and Mongol Periods,\\" in The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, p. 245. The Armenian army hurried to confront the enemy at the location of the present-day Lake Sevan, where the king and his commander split the Armenian army into two units. The first division engaged in a battle with the Seljuq Turks and then pretended to retreat, drawing the Turks in pursuit toward the second army that was lying in ambush. The battle ended with a catastrophic defeat for the Seljuq Turks. In the Kingdom of Vaspurakan, formerly under the protection of the Byzantine Empire where the population had been deserted by the imperial army, the people eagerly anticipated the Armenian king would be driving the Seljuq Turks out of their homeland. Under leadership of Gagik II, known for his courage as \\"the Lion,\\" the Armenians revolted and the Turks were forced to retreat to Khoy and Salmas. Deceit of Gagik II Gagik submits to Constantine IX Monomachus. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. Vahram began negotiations with the new Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachus. Gagik II offered to be a vassal of the emperor, but the Byzantines did not accept it and prepared a new expedition entrusted to the Duke of Iberia, Michael Iasites, but he failed in the face of Armenian resistance. Emperor Constantine wished to continue the policy of his predecessors and therefore sent an army to conquer Armenia, whilst inciting the Arab emir of Dvin, Abu'l-Aswar, to attack Armenia from the east. King Gagik II, however, managed to placate Abu'l-Aswar by sending him gifts. This allowed Gagik to concentrate his forces against the Byzantines, eventually forcing them to flee. Gagik II proved his worth for the throne and the reputation of a fighting king, which had passed on to him from the very first kings in the Bagratuni dynasty. The Byzantines soon realized that if Armenia could not be conquered by force, it could be taken by treachery. Gagik pardoned Vest Sargis, whose loyalties, however, remained with Byzantium, fostering the hope of being appointed as king of Armenia if Byzantium was to conquer Armenia. With the assistance of Vest Sargis, the Byzantine emperor invited Gagik II to Constantinople to sign an allegedly permanent peace- treaty. Gagik II was invited to visit Constantinople. There the emperor demanded that the Armenian king abdicate and hand over the throne to him, and as he refused to do so was thrown into jail. The Byzantines promptly sent an army to Armenia, which was now leaderless.Greenwood, Tim W. (2008), \\"Armenian Neighbours (600-1045),\\" in The Cambridge History of The Byzantine Empire c. 500-1492, ed. Jonathan Shepard. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 362-64. In lieu of its rightful king, Armenians considered offering the throne of Ani to David I Anhoghin of Lori or to the emir of Dvin, Abu'l-Aswar, married to the sister of David Anhoghin. Even Bagrat IV of Georgia was considered but surprisingly not the Bagratuni King Gagik-Abas of Kars.See Aram Ter-Ghevondyan (1976), The Arab Emirates in Bagratid Armenia, trans. Nina G. Garsoïan. Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, pp. 102-03. The patriarch Petros did not approve of any of the three candidates and finally conceded the delivery to the Byzantines of the city of Ani and other fortresses. With his connivance, the Byzantines were finally able to occupy Ani in 1045. The country was incorporated into the empire. Exile years Gagik received as compensation for his kingdom the district of Lycandus in Asia Minor and the town of Pizu (also spelled Bizou), in the vicinity of Caesarea. He was also granted the use of a palace on the Bosphorus in Constantinople and a pension from the imperial treasury. Several seals testify \\"Kakikios Aniotes\\" (Gagik of Ani) as duke of the thema of Charsianon.

New Rochelle, NY: Artistide D. Caratzas, pp. 159-68. During his time in exile, according to Matthew of Edessa, Gagik also took part in a theological debate between him and the Byzantine emperor in Constantinople, defending the Armenian Church and its tradition and rites. Gouillard, J., \\"Gagik II défenseur de la foi arménienne,\\" Travaux et Memoires 7 (1979), 399-418. The Metropolitan of Caesarea, named Markos, lost no occasion to express his scorn toward Gagik, whom he considered a heretic. After several insults by Markos directed against him, Gagik eventually murdered the bishop, an act that made Gagik even more unpopular among the locals. As the story goes, it is said the Bishop had a dog named Armen, so as to scorn the Armenians. One day, Gagik visited the bishop, had the dog put in a canvas bag and beat with sticks. He then had the Bishop seized and placed in the same bag with the dog, now maddened by pain. The bishop died in pain from the wounds inflicted by his own dog.Macler, Frédéric. \\"Armenia: The Kingdom of the Bagratides\\" in The Cambridge Medieval History: The Eastern Roman Empire (717-1453), ed. John Bury. Cambridge: The University Press, 1927, vol. 4, p. 166. Gagik was captured and later killed on May 5/November 24, 1079 by the Byzantine governors (three brothers) of Kyzistra, who had his body mutilated and hanged from the fort for others to see. His body was later buried outside the fort but was later said to have been secretly conveyed by an Armenian from Ani named Banik to a convent he had built in a city called Pizu.Manuk-Khaloyan, Armen, \\"In the Cemetery of their Ancestors: The Royal Burial Tombs of the Bagratuni Kings of Greater Armenia (890-1073/79),\\" Revue des Études Arméniennes 35 (2013), pp. 152-53, 156. Shortly after Gagik was killed, his youngest son David was poisoned by his father-in-law for suspected treachery. Gagik's eldest son Hovhannes had married the daughter of Ablgharib, the Byzantine-appointed Orthodox Armenian governor of Tarsus and Mamistra.T.S.R Boarse The Cilician Kingdom of Armenia, p3. Hovhannes had a son Ashot who was poisoned and his body brought to Pizu. Hovhannes did not survive his son by long, at which time the posterity of the senior male Bagratian line of kings of Armenia was extinct. During the reign of Thoros I of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia the death of king Gagik II was avenged by the Armenian forces who took the fortress of Kyzistra and executed the three Byzantines who had killed the last Armenian King of Ani.Dédéyan, Gérard (2008). \\"The Founding and Coalescence of the Rubenian Principality, 1073-1129,\\" in Armenian Cilicia, eds.

There are also hybrid pocket/carom games such as English billiards. Definitions and language The term \\"\\" is sometimes used to refer to all of the cue sports, to a specific class of them, or to specific ones such as English billiards; this article uses the term in its most generic sense unless otherwise noted. The labels \\"British\\" and \\"UK\\" as applied to entries in this glossary refer to terms originating in the UK and also used in countries that were fairly recently part of the British Empire and/or are part of the Commonwealth of Nations, as opposed to US (and, often, Canadian) terminology. The terms \\"American\\" or \\"US\\" as applied here refer generally to North American usage. However, due to the predominance of US-originating terminology in most internationally competitive pool (as opposed to snooker), US terms are also common in the pool context in other countries in which English is at least a minority language, and US (and borrowed French) terms predominate in carom billiards. Similarly, British terms predominate in the world of snooker, English billiards and blackball, regardless of the players' nationalities. The term \\"blackball\\" is used in this glossary to refer to both blackball and eight-ball pool as played in the UK as a shorthand. Blackball was chosen because it is less ambiguous (\\"eight-ball pool\\" is too easily confused with the international standard \\"eight-ball\\"), and blackball is globally standardized by an International Olympic Committee-recognized governing body, the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA); meanwhile, its ancestor, eight-ball pool, is largely a folk game, like North American , and to the extent that its rules have been codified, they have been done so by competing authorities with different rulesets. (For the same reason, the glossary's information on eight-ball and nine-ball draws principally on the stable WPA rules, because there are many competing amateur leagues and even professional tours with divergent rules for these games.) Foreign-language terms are generally not within the scope of this list, unless they have become an integral part of billiards terminology in English (e.g. ), or they are crucial to meaningful discussion of a game not widely known in the English- speaking world. 1–9A :Also Parker's box.

It is the dimethyl carbamate ester of temazepam, a metabolite of diazepam. While it possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant and hypnotic properties it differs from other benzodiazepines in that its anxiolytic properties are particularly prominent but has comparatively limited anticonvulsant, hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.  Pharmacology  Camazepam, like others benzodiazepines, produce a variety of therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating the function of the GABA receptor, the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of camazepam on the nervous system. Compared to other benzodiazepines, it has reduced side effects such as impaired cognition, reaction times and coordination, which makes it best suited as an anxiolytic because of these reduced sides effects. Animal studies have shown camazepam and its active metabolites possess anticonvulsant properties. Unlike other benzodiazepines it does not disrupt normal sleep patterns. Camazepam has been shown in animal experiments to have a very low affinity for benzodiazepine receptors compared to other benzodiazepines. Compared to temazepam, camazepam has shown roughly equal anxiolytic properties, and less anticonvulsant, sedative and motor-impairing properties.  Pharmacokinetics  Following oral administration, camazepam is almost completely absorbed into the bloodstream, with 90 percent bioavailability achieved in humans. In the human camazepam is metabolised into the active metabolite temazepam. Studies in dogs have shown that the half-life of the terminal elimination phase ranged from 6.4 to 10.5 h.  Medical uses  Camazepam is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia and anxiety. As with other benzodiazepines, its use should be reserved for patients in which the sleep disorder is severe, disabling, or causes marked distress.  Adverse effects  With higher doses, such as 40 mg of camazepam, impairments similar to those caused by other benzodiazepines manifest as disrupted sleep patterns and impaired cognitive performance. Skin disorders have been reported with use of camazepam however. One study has shown that camazepam may increase attention.  Contraindications  Use of camazepam is contraindicated in subjects with known hypersensitivity to drug or allergy to other drugs in the benzodiazepine class or any excipients contained in the pharmaceutical form. Use of camazepam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with the following conditions: myasthenia gravis, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression or cronic pulmonary insufficiency.

Division1854 map titled \\"The Mesilla Valley\\". Surveyed under the direction of BVT Captain J. Pope, Corps of Engineers. was a United States military fortification established by Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner in September 1851 near Mesilla in what is now New Mexico, primarily for the purpose of protecting settlers and traders traveling to California. Early frontier migrants were under constant threat from attack by local Native Americans, and a network of forts was eventually created by the U.S. government to protect and encourage westward expansion. Fort Fillmore was intended to protect a corridor plagued by hostile Apaches, where several migration routes converged between El Paso and Tucson to take advantage of Apache Pass. Construction Fort Fillmore was originally constructed in the jacal style with upright wood posts plastered over with adobe; later, more substantial adobe walls were erected. Much of the work on the fort was done by the soldiers with the assistance of local Mexican laborers who made the adobe bricks. The post was built on sand hills above the Rio Grande. The Rio Grande would later change its course, making the fort about 1 mile from the river. This forced the army to use water wagons to supply the post with water and made it hard to defend in the event of attack. Fort Fillmore served as an operating base for units of the 1st Dragoons, briefly the 2nd Dragoons, Regiment of Mounted Rifles, and the 3rd and briefly the 8th Infantry Regiments. It was for a time the headquarters of the 3rd Infantry Regiment. The troops were active in the Gila Expedition of 1857 and in operations against the Apaches in the Sacramento Mountains. In one foray, Captain Henry W. Stanton, namesake of Fort Stanton, New Mexico, was killed near the Rio Penasco. His grave was one of the few to be identified when the abandoned post was inspected in 1869. Most of the soldiers and civilians interred in the fort's cemetery are still buried there on a sand ridge southeast of the remains of the fort. A fence and flagpole are now located on the cemetery's site. Possibly the most famous soldier who served at Fort Fillmore was Captain George Pickett. Pickett is best remembered for leading the fateful charge on July 3, 1863 at the Battle of Gettysburg. In 1855, Union General Ambrose Burnside used the fort as a supply point when he drilled geothermal wells about fifteen miles west of the post.. Abandonment Two days after the Union's unsuccessful attack on Confederate soldiers under the command of Lt. Col. John Baylor at the First Battle of Mesilla on July 25, 1861, Fort Fillmore was set afire and abandoned by the Union army. As they retreated back to Fort Stanton under Major Isaac Lynde, they became desperately thirsty and exhausted. When 300 Confederate soldiers approached the 500 retreating Union soldiers, Lynde surrendered his demoralized troops without firing a shot. On August 7, 1862, federal troops near Fort Fillmore engaged in a skirmish with Confederate troops retreating from Santa Fe, defeating them. The fort was officially closed by the Union in October 1862, but sources continue to mention Fort Fillmore as a waypoint along several major routes throughout the period of westward expansion. The Upper and Lower Emigrant Trails converged in El Paso and, along with the Butterfield, Pacific and Overland Trails, passed through the corridor Fort Fillmore was erected to defend. The remains of the fort were leveled at some later date after a failed attempt by the owner to sell or trade it to the State of New Mexico as a park. A grove of pecan trees now stands on the approximate location of the fort.

A 1 kilometre-long part of the beach was officially recognized by the city in 2002 as being clothing optional. History A naturist walking into the water at Hanlan's Point Beach. Hanlan's Point was a popular summer destination in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. It featured a popular amusement park from the 1880s until the late 1920s, the Hanlan's Hotel, built by Edward Hanlan in 1880,https://tayloronhistory.com/2015/12/29/the-lost-hanlans-hotel- on-the-toronto-islands/ and Hanlan's Point Stadium from 1897 until 1937. The hotel burned down in 1909 and was not replaced. The amusement park was unable to compete with the Sunnyside Amusement Park after it opened on the mainland in 1925, and closed in the late 1920s,https://www.blogto.com/city/2014/07/the_lost_amusement_parks_of_toronto/ and the stadium lost its main tenant, the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team to Maple Leaf Stadium in 1926, and eventually closed in 1937.https://tayloronhistory.com/tag/maple-leaf-stadium-toronto/ https://torontoist.com/2015/04/historicist-opening-day-at-maple-leaf-stadium/ Hanlan's Point Beach became a traditional site for nude sunbathing in subsequent decades. In 1999, Toronto City Council approved a one-year pilot project for a nude beach at Hanlan's Point following a proposal by naturist organization and Councillor Kyle Rae. In 2000, the council extended the project for another two years. Finally in 2002, the clothing-optional beach was made permanent. The Toronto City Council decision was met with strong opposition from conservative councillors such as Giorgio Mammoliti. It was also an infrequent target of police crackdowns for nude sunbathing. Its official status has resulted in a distinct increase in ferry traffic, and it appears to be a profitable component of public- and private-sector advertising campaigns, since it draws visitors to Toronto. Police and park officials now work in partnership with the beachgoers to maintain the friendly atmosphere. Some nudists have advocated to make the clothing optional side of Hanlan's Point Beach a nude beach due to what they see as an excessive amount of clothed people on the clothing optional side of the beach. Background Hanlan's Beach can be reached most directly by taking the Hanlan's Point ferry at the foot of Bay Street at Queens Quay. Aside from the cost of the ferry there is no admission fee. It is the second officially recognized clothing- optional beach in Canada and the only one created by a municipal bylaw. Canada's only other official clothing-optional beach is Wreck Beach in Vancouver, British Columbia. The effective beach season starts in late May and ends in late September, while actual swimming off the beach is possible only well within this period. In recent years, the beach and islands as a whole have experienced flooding due to high water levels in the early summer. As is common for most public nudist-friendly venues, males make up a large percentage of the users of the beach, but women can make up to one quarter of the total on popular weekends. Recent years continue to see an increase in the number of families who attend. The beach is a popular destination for the city's gay community. The beach is also the regular site of day trips by several local nudist organizations. Despite its proximity to Toronto Harbour, the beach can boast extremely good water quality since it faces southwest and away from the mainland. Water quality is monitored daily (on weekdays) during the summer and meets a Blue Flag standard set by the Foundation for Environmental Education. The section of the beach closest to the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (YTZ) is also becoming a very popular spot for kiteboarding.

Founded in 1855, Thompson & Morgan offer English plants, seeds and sundries worldwide through their websites. The U.S. division of the company was sold to Gardens Alive in 2009.  Overview  The company distributes their products through its mail order catalogues, the Internet and retail outlets. Their various websites feature over 8,000 products, showcasing the entire Thompson and Morgan range. Seed catalogues are distributed to 163 countries worldwide. Thompson and Morgan seeds are stocked in the following countries: Great Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, USA, Canada, Korea, and Japan.  History  Thompson & Morgan (T&M;) had its origins in a small garden behind a baker's shop in Ipswich, where a young William Thompson's passion for botany grew. His speciality was growing rare and unusual plants whose seeds were sent from countries all over the world. Not only did it provide a sense of adventure for Thompson, it also established friendships with such scientists as Charles Darwin, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Sir Michael Foster. From the back garden he moved to a nursery at the edge of Ipswich and then to an even larger one. Eventually, there were three of Thompson’s nurseries in the town. At this time, Thompson began to publish a magazine called The English Flower Garden. In 1855, after moving from that small 'starter' garden, Thompson issued his first catalogue. He specialised in growing rare and unusual plants, seeds of which were sent to him from many overseas countries. His efforts made him one of the most distinguished plantsmen of his day and he was honoured by the Royal Horticultural Society with the Victoria Medal of Honour in 1897. With the seed-raising firm expanding, William Thompson started his partnership with John Morgan. John provided the business acumen that enabled Thompson & Morgan's continued solid growth. Thompson died in July 1903 at the age of 80, having lived to see Thompson & Morgan become one of the country's greatest seed firms with a reputation for introducing more species and varieties to the British gardening public than any other company. John Morgan spent the next ten years as sole owner until he partnered with Joseph Sangster in 1913. Sangster was a brilliant horticulturalist who was to add 4,000 plant names to the 2,000 already offered in the T&M; catalogue. He took full control of the company upon John's death in 1921. Joseph's son Murray joined the company in 1933 and the following year Joseph was elected president of the Horticultural Trades Association of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1939, T&M; became a limited company and when Joseph died in 1952, Murray Sangster took control. His two sons, Keith and Bruce, joined Murray later. In 1973, they decided to expand their distribution centre in Poplar Lane, Ipswich from where the company still operates. In 1982, Bruce Sangster headed the company's expansion in the U.S. after previously having a distribution base in Jackson, New Jersey. In 1995 this was followed up by the creation of a young plants division in Guernsey in the Channel Islands. The Sangster brothers subsequently relinquished control of the business in December 1999 for £17.5 million. In May 2002, Thompson & Morgan returned to independent private ownership by Primary Capital Partners, the Sangster brothers and key management. The company was sold to BVG Group in March 2017 through the acquisition of their parent company, Branded Garden Products for an undisclosed amount, however the sale price was estimated at £10 million. The new group has a combined turnover of £140 million, with an in the region of £13.5 million.  Awards  In the RHS Chelsea Flower Show 2018's 'plant of the year' competition, Thompson & Morgan plants were awarded first and third place. * First place: 'Hydrangea Runaway Bride Snow White' * Third place: 'Helianthus Sunbelievable Brown Eyed Girl'  Catalogue  The first Thompson and Morgan catalogue was created in 1855. They now produce over 20 different catalogues that are distributed in the UK, US, French and German markets. Catalogues are distributed by mail and can be requested directly from the company by telephone or via their websites.

Árpád Szenes- Vieira da Silva Foundation. fasvs.pt. Retrieved 2016-10-31. Biography :hu:Szenes %C3%81rp%C3%A1d In 1897, Szenes was born into a petty bourgeois family in Budapest. Many artists including Arthur Bárdos, Ignotus, Lajos Hatvany were guests in the family's home. He went to the Munkácsy Mihály Street Secondary Grammar School and was taught among others by Milán Füst. He was passionate about drawing. He served in World War I, but he did not come to the front; he painted portraits on the graves of heroic fallen soldiers from photos. Here he was recognized by the sculptor Dezső Bokros Birman, who directed him towards modern art. He enrolled in the free school of József Rippl-Rónai, where Béla Iványi-Grünwald and Károly Kernstok had great influence on him. In 1919 he worked with his fellow painters at the Artist Colony of Kecskemét. Since they did not receive money, they had to do agricultural work. He painted together among others with Gyula Derkovits, Béla Iványi-Grünwald, János Kmetty, Róbert Emil Novotny and Pál Pátzay. He was ill with hard physical work, and moved with two friends to a business premise in Városmajor Street in Budapest. At that time, he met István Beöthy, with whom they studied Buddhism and Oriental art. His style was not mature yet: in 1922 he exhibited abstract artwork at a group exhibition of young artists at Ernst Museum, but his other paintings of the same year reflect the traditions of the Hungarian painting of the turn of the century and the influence of his masters. He went on a European study trip; the first station was in Germany in 1924, where he met with the works of Kandinsky and Klee, and then studied the paintings of Giotto and Piero della Francesca in Italy. He first visited Paris in 1924, then only for three months, then again in the autumn of 1925 for staying. The money that he received from his uncle was gone, and for months he was in extreme poverty, and as advised by László Ney lived on cartoons made from guests at Montmartre cafés. Many Hungarians lived in Paris, in addition to his mother, György Marton, Zsigmond Kolozsvári and Gábor Peterdi helped Szenes artistically. At this time he already had exhibitions, and while he was having a bohemian lifestyle with many affairs, he was also attending the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. Here he met in 1929 with Portuguese Maria Helena Vieira da Silva and they married in 1930, his wife became a Hungarian citizen, and remained until 1956. After marriage, he lived a more restrained life. In 1930, the couple visited the Artist Colony of Nagybánya. They lived and worked in a dead end called rue des Camelias in Paris, where many artists lived. They met Lajos Tihanyi's friend, Kokoschka and Varèse, but Jacques Lipchitz also visited them. Later they moved to boulevard Saint Jacques where their studio was above a cardboard factory. Through their patron and gallery owner, Jeanne Bucher, they were in close contact with Joan Miró and Max Ernst. At that time Szenes visited the café gatherings of Les Amis du Monde, a group of young left-wing artists including Étienne Hajdú, Maurice Estève, Édouard Pignon, André Breton, Louis Aragon. Through his wife, he contacted the Stanley William Hayter-led Atelier 17 studio which inspired his surrealist works from the 1930s. At the outbreak of World War II they left Paris, leaving Jeanne Bucher their studio and pictures. They spent a few months in Lisbon, where Szenes had an independent exhibition, and then went to Brazil in 1940. They lived in Rio de Janeiro for some time, then settled in nearby Santa Teresa. The art community in Rio was less inspirational than in Paris; although they met Dr. Atl and some other painters, they were more involved with poets and writers at this time. He painted nature, portraits of writers, poets and illustrated books. He founded a painting school called Sylvestre, taught amateurs and young Brazilian modernists. In 1947 they returned to Paris, regained the boulevard Saint Jacques studio and Szenes continued to teach. At that time he started working on perhaps his most significant series of geometric and organic shapes, repetitive motifs called 'Bankett' made of various techniques (watercolor, gouache, oil, pastel and chalk). Meanwhile, he painted portraits of Vieira da Silva, making hundreds of paintings altogether. The French state bought from his paintings for the first time in 1949, followed by several state purchases. From the mid-1950s his expression became cleaner. On his landscapes the vertical-horizontal relationship is of great significance, his color scale has been reduced to a few pale colors. From then on, his wife Vieira da Silva became more and more renowned while his popularity diminished. In 1979 he donated seven works made between 1942 and 1970 to the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest and the Janus Pannonius Museum in Pécs. After his death and the end of communism in Hungary, Vieira da Silva established a foundation in 1990 in Lisbon with their names for the promotion of young artists. The museum building in Praça das Amoreiras 58 was previously a silk factory. He died at age 87 from a pulmonary edema, in 1985.

It opened in Leicester Square in February 1781. Described by the media of his day as \\"Moving Pictures, representing Phenomena of Nature\\", the Eidophusikon can be considered an early form of movie making. The effect was achieved by mirrors and pulleys. A small exhibition centered on his Eidophusikon can currently be seen at The Huntington Library. A full Eidophusikon, described also as a \\"small, mechanical theatre\\", was exhibited from June to November 2014 at the exhibition \\"Underworlds\\" (Unterwelten) in Dortmund, Germany. The Eidophusikon consisted of a large-scale miniature theatre that let experiment the try of creating the perfect illusion of the moving nature: sunrise scenes, sunsets, moonlight images, storms, and volcanoes from all over the world with sound and music effects. The sound and light effects of the Eidophusikon, compared with the shows seen until that time, were specially inventive by their realism.  Reconstructions  The first reconstruction was the year 2004 by Wolkenbilder at the Altonaer Museum Exhibition (cloud images) at Jenisch Has, Hamburg. It was a full-sized theater with two scenes on the basis of Loutherbourg: from dawn to sunset over Royal Naval College in Greenwich and a Mediterranean scene with a lighthouse, moonlight, storms and wrecks. The second Eidophusikon was created in 2005 by the Yale Center for British Art, New Connecticut and California Huntington Library by the English painter Gainsborough for his collection 'Sensation and sensibility. Gainsborough was a great admirer of Eidophusikon. This full-size version was built in conjunction with Kevin Derkin and the Yale technical department under Rick Johnson. The scene, this time, was 'Satan and the Creation of the Pandemonium Palace in Hell', by Milton of the \\"lost paradise.\\" In 2006, a third Eidophusikon was created by Robert Poulter for the Nouveau Musée National de Monaco. Another Mediterranean scene was created with a volcano, the moonlight, the storm and the shipwreck. This Eidophusikon is part and the permanent collection of the museum.

Singa is an apotropaic figure from the mythology of the Batak people of North Sumatra, Indonesia. The singa represents a benevolent and protective power. The singa is described as \\"part human, part water buffalo, and part crocodile or lizard\\". It is variedly represented, but always has an elongated face, with big bulging eyes, a well-defined nose, and long spiralling beard. It is often represented only with its head, but sometimes it may also be represented full body. Other figures - such as other protective deity or ancestral figures - may also be represented standing or sitting on top of the head of the singa.Sibeth 1991: 119, 122 Etymology The word singa is derived from the Sanskrit singa, \\"lion\\". The Batak term of singa has a predominantly magical, rather than zoological, so singa does not symbolize a lion. Instead, the singa represents the Nāga or Boru Saniang Naga, the primeval water serpent from the Hindu-Buddhist mythology. It is not fully understood why the name singa is attributed to this figure. As ornaments A figure of singa as parchment holder. Images of singa are carved in various objects such as domestic utensils, medicine containers, jewelries, amulets, wood coffins, stone sarcophagi, barns and Batak traditional houses. Its frequent use made the singa a symbol of the Batak culture. Carving of singa on a Batak house is called singa ni ruma, or \\"singa of the house\\". The apotropaic use of a singa may stem from the Hindu-Buddhism period of Batak during the ninth century (the Batak people are predominantly Christian or Muslim community). One of the major features of Hindu-Buddhist architecture in Java and Bali is the ubiquitous kirtimukha over arches and doorways. It was during the period of the Aparajita style at the beginning of the ninth century, that these Batak version of kirtimukha - called singhamugam - appeared in full relief.

Life Born in Exeter, Devon, son of John Hakewill and his wife Thomasine (née Periam). Educated, according to Anthony Wood at Exeter College, Oxford (though he did not take a degree), he later studied law at Lincoln's Inn. Hakewill became Member of Parliament for Bossiney in Cornwall in 1601, probably nominated for the seat by its patron, his maternal uncle Sir William Peryam, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Though a tyro MP Hakewill was active and spoke out against the excessive granting of monopolies. He also delivered speeches against allowing the export of ordnance to Spain and in favour of keeping a strong navy. Hakewill was called to the bar in 1606, was a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn by 1616 and Lent Reader in 1625. Described by the antiquarian Anthony Wood as \\"a grave and judicious counsellor\\" but \\"always a puritan\\", Hakewill was a friend of William Prynne and an associate of John Selden whose critical views on the royal prerogative he shared. Despite his puritan connections Hakewill was appointed Solicitor General to Queen Anne, the wife of James I in 1617. Unfortunately she died in 1619 and his benefactor Sir Francis Bacon was disgraced in 1621. Hakewill was also an early member of the Society of Antiquaries, a friend of Sir Robert Cotton, a kinsman and executor of Sir Thomas Bodley and the elder brother of the author and divine George Hakewill. In 1617 he married Elizabeth Woodhouse, a daughter of Sir Henry Woodhouse of Waxham, Norfolk, by his second wife Cecily Gresham. Her elder half-sister Ann was the third wife of Sir Julius Caesar, Master of the Rolls, to whom Hakewill addressed gratulatory Latin verses (now in the British Library). Although originally elected to parliament for Cornish seats he sat in the parliaments of 1624 and 1628/9 for Amersham in Bucks. As a result of his researches three Buckinghamshire boroughs were re-enfranchised in 1624 (Wendover, Amersham and Marlow). Hakewill was elected as one of Amersham's two MP's and his distant relative the famous John Hampden was elected for Wendover. He leased Chequers (now the country home of British Prime Ministers) near Ellesborough in 1619. In the latter part of his life Hakewill lived at The Hale in Wendover, Buckinghamshire and was survived by at least two sons, William and Robert. His will left instructions that expenditure on his funeral was not to exceed £40. He is buried in the Church at Wendover under a commemorative stone that still survives. Works He published The Liberty of the Subject against the pretended Power of Impositions (1641), The manner how Statutes are enacted in Parliament by Passing of Bills(1641) and Modus tenendi Parliamentum; or, the old Manner of holding Parliaments in England(1659).

It is predominantly awarded for a defensive infringement in the penalty circle or for a deliberate infringement within the defensive 23-metre area. They are eagerly sought by attacking players and provide an excellent opportunity to score. There are particular rules for that only apply at penalty corners and players develop specialist skills, such as the drag flick, for this particular phase in the game. The penalty corner has always been an important part of the game, that importance has become more pronounced since artificial turf became mandatory for top- level competitions in the 1970s. The Netherlands' Paul Litjens was the former leading international scorer with 267 goals in 177 matches and was a specialist in hitting goals from penalty corners. Litjens and early specialists were accurate, hard-hitters of the ball; however, the introduction of the drag flick to counter the goalkeepers that lie down during the hit became the favoured technique. This led to the introduction of experts in this skill and Litjens' record was surpassed by Pakistani player Sohail Abbas who is often described as the \\"world's best\\" penalty corner and drag flick specialist. India's Sandeep Singh is also regarded as one of the best and has the fastest drag-flick at . The importance of penalty corners has drawn criticism, with the proportion of field goals scored through open play reduced as attackers look to create a foul in the penalty circle, particularly from defenders' feet, rather than shooting directly. Awarding a penalty corner There are five ways a penalty corner may be awarded:Rule 12.3, FIH Rules of Hockey *For an offence by a defending player in their penalty circle that does not prevent the \\"probable scoring of a goal\\". *For an intentional offence by a defending player outside their penalty circle but within the 23-metre (25-yard) area they are defending *For deliberately playing the ball over the backline. However, a goalkeeper is permitted to deflect the ball over the backline. *For an intentional offence by a defender in their penalty circle against an opponent who \\"does not have possession of the ball or an opportunity to play the ball.\\" *When the ball becomes lodged in a defending player's clothing or equipment within the penalty circle. Procedure Simon Gougnard prepares to take a penalty corner from the 10 m mark. The 5 m line above demarcates the closest position a defender may stand. To award a penalty corner, the umpire points both arms horizontally towards the respective goal.Rule 4.6d, FIH Rules of Hockey Although time in the match is not stopped, it may be prolonged beyond half-time or full-time to allow for the completion of a penalty corner, or any subsequent penalty corner or penalty stroke.Rule 13.4, FIH Rules of Hockey However, , an intended rule change will give a 40-second timeout for a penalty corner. When a penalty corner is awarded, a maximum of five defending players (including the goalkeeper) line up behind the back line either in the goal or on the back line at least five metres from the ball. All other players on the defending team must be behind the centre line. One attacking player places themselves on the back line, with the ball in the circle at least 10 metres from the nearest goal post on either side of the goal. The remainder of the attacking team players place themselves on the field outside of the shooting circle. All players other than the attacking player on the back line must not have any part of their body or stick touch the ground inside the circle or over the centre line until the ball is in play. The attacking player on the back line is allowed one foot within the circle, but the other foot must remain behind the back line.Rule 13.3a-g, FIH Rules of Hockey If any player enters the circle or crosses the centre line prematurely, or the attacking player on the back line does not have one foot outside the circle, the penalty corner is reset and taken again.Rule 13.7, FIH Rules of Hockey When the attacking player on the back line pushes the ball into play, the players may then enter the shooting circle or cross the centre line. Before a shot at goal can be taken, the ball must first travel outside the circle.Rule 13.3h-j, FIH Rules of Hockey In a typical penalty corner, the attacking player on the back line will push the ball to a player at the top of the circle who will stop the ball just outside the circle. Another player will take the stopped ball and push or drag it back into the circle before attempting to shoot at goal (as per normal rules, the ball must be last played by an attacking player within the shooting circle for a goal to countRule 8.1, FIH Rules of Hockey). If the first attempt at goal in a penalty corner is hit, as opposed to a flick, scoop or push, the ball must be hit so that it will be travelling no higher than the backboard in the goal () at the point when it crosses the goal line, for the goal to count. This must be assessed regardless of any deflections, so for example, if the ball is hit on a trajectory that would see it crossing the goal line below the required height then a goal will be awarded even if it is deflected over this height and into the goal. Conversely, it does not matter that the ball travels above 460 mm in its flight, provided it does not constitute dangerous play, so long as it drops below 460 mm under its own accord (i.e. not as a result of a deflection) before crossing the goal line, it is still counted as a goal.Rule 13.3k, FIH Rules of Hockey Flicks, scoops, pushes, deflections and hits on second and subsequent attempts at goal may cross the goal line at any height, provided it does not constitute dangerous play.Rule 13.3l, FIH Rules of Hockey The penalty corner ends when a goal is scored, the ball is played over the back line and another penalty corner is not awarded, a penalty stroke is awarded, the defending team is awarded a free hit, or the ball travels more than 5 metres outside the circle (i.e. beyond the dotted line outside the shooting circle).Rule 13.5, FIH Rules of Hockey History The penalty corner was introduced in 1908, and required all attacking players to be outside the penalty circle and all defenders behind the goalline. Early penalty corners only required the ball to be stopped before a shot and was not required to be stopped or travel outside the penalty circle. In the first set of hockey rules (1886) the use of hands and feet was permitted to stop the ball; the use of feet was outlawed in 1938 but hands could still be used to stop the ball. As such, a hand stop became a large part of early penalty corners; one player would inject, a second would hand stop and the third would shoot. In 1961, the number of defenders behind the goalline was reduced to six; the remainder had to stand beyond the 25-yard line and two years later this became the halfway line. There were too many goals from penalty corners and the use of the hands to stop the ball, and thus the hand stop, were prohibited from 1982; a result was that the same player at a penalty corner would stop and strike the ball. A few years later, in 1987, the number of defenders was reduced to the current quota of five. Additionally, it was required that the first hit at goal could must cross the goalline at a height no greater than for a goal to be awarded - this rule ceased to apply once the ball had travelled more than 5 yards outside (i.e. away from) the penalty circle. In 1998, the location where the ball was injected was metricised to at least 10 metres from the goal post (as opposed to the previous rule which stated it must be at least 10 yards); a specific mark inside the circle was introduced in 2000. Additionally, for a period from 1995, substitutions were permitted at penalty corners. This rule caused the development of specialist penalty corner takers who just came on for this and was abolished three years later. In 1996, a penalty corner required that the ball was stopped outside the circle before a goal could be scored. From 2003, it did not need to be stopped but did have to travel outside the circle.

Some of these are theoretical in origin and some of them concern the inability of orthodox economic theory to explain an empirical observation. Capital theory *Cambridge capital controversy: The Cambridge capital controversy is a dispute in economics that started in the 1950s. The debate concerned the nature and role of capital goods and a critique of the neoclassical vision of aggregate production and distribution. The question of whether the natural growth rate is exogenous, or endogenous to demand (and whether it is input growth that causes output growth, or vice versa), lies at the heart of the debate. The resolution of the debate has not been agreed upon by economists. *Transformation problem: The transformation problem is the problem specific to Marxist Economics, and not to Economics in general, of finding a general rule by which to transform the values of commodities based on socially necessary labor time into the competitive prices of the marketplace. The essential difficulty is how to reconcile profit in the form of surplus value from direct labour inputs and the ratio of direct labour input to capital input that vary widely between commodities, with the tendency toward an average rate of profit on all capital invested. *Formalist–substantivist debate: The opposition between substantivist and formalist economic models was first proposed by Karl Polanyi in his work The Great Transformation (1944). The formalist vs. substantivist debate was a disciplinary debate largely confined to the journal Research in Economic Anthropology. Formalists such as Raymond Firth and Harold K. Schneider asserted that the neoclassical model of economics could be applied to any society if appropriate modifications are made, arguing that its principles have universal validity. Critics of the formalist position question its central assumptions, in particular that the universality of rational choice and utility maximization can be assumed across all cultures. The premise of utility maximization is tautological; whatever a person does, may it be work or leisure, is declared to be utility maximization, a premise that can never be contradicted or disproven. If he or she does not maximize money then it must be pleasure or some other value. To quote: \\"This post hoc reasoning back to a priori assumptions has minimal scientific value as it is not readily subject to falsification.\\" (1989:212). For example, a person may sacrifice their own time, finances, or even health to help others. Formalists would then pronounce that they do so because they value helping others, and so sacrifice other goals in order to maximize this value (e.g. meaning, satisfaction of having helped, approval from others etc.), even though it contradicts formalists usual dictum of profit maximization. Behavioral economics *Revealed preference: Does revealed preference theory truly reveal consumer preference when the consumer is able to afford all of the available options? For example, if a consumer is confronted with three goods and they can afford to purchase all three (A, B, and C) and they choose to first purchase A, then C, and then B - does this suggest that the consumer preference for the goods is A > C > B? The debate rests on the fact that since the consumer can afford all three goods and does not need to make a preferential decision, does the order of consumption reflect any preference? *Tâtonnement: The act of tâtonnement plays a key role in the formulation of general equilibrium theory. The claim is that if an initial contract does not lead to an equilibrium, it is ended and new contracts are formulated. If the initial contract is not called off, it will likely lead to a different set of prices, depending on the degree of error in the original process. The question is whether successive re-contracting continues with the parties forgetting the previously planned positions taken or whether the parties engage in a form of tâtonnement to achieve optimality. See also Hill climbing and Walrasian auction. *Unified models of human biases: Neoclassical economics has concentrated on the development of models that reflect an idealized economic agent, sometimes referred to as Homo economicus, as a way of studying economics. In the period spanning the 1970s to the 1990s, research began to emerge that suggested that people were subject to cognitive biases such as the framing effect, loss aversion, the gambler's fallacy, confirmation bias, and many others. Further, these effects could produce anomalies such as herd behavior or momentum investing inconsistent with economic models that did not incorporate human psychological limitations. While some models have begun to include bounded rationality and risk aversion, such as prospect theory, there still remains to be seen a unified model that can make useful predictions that incorporates the entirety of cognitive biases and rational limitations in most humans. Further, there even exists debate as to whether it is necessary to incorporate such psychological limitations into economic models. While some economists insist they are necessary to fully appreciate the complexity of the market, others still contend that a model that incorporates human biases is either unrealistic or question its usefulness arguing that a model that doesn't approximate agents as being perfectly rational, with the possibility of minimal exceptions, is unlikely to be successful. Financial economics * Equity premium puzzle: The equity premium puzzle is thought to be one of the most important outstanding questions in neoclassical economics. It is founded on the basis that over the last one hundred years or so the average real return to stocks in the US has been substantially higher than that of bonds. The puzzle lies in explaining the causes behind this equity premium. While there are a number of different theories regarding the puzzle, there still exists no definitive agreement on its cause. *Dividend puzzle: The dividend puzzle is the empirically observed phenomenon that companies that pay dividends tend to be rewarded by investors with higher valuations. At present, there is no explanation widely accepted by economists. The Modigliani–Miller theorem suggests that the puzzle can (only) be explained by some combination of taxes, bankruptcy costs, market inefficiency (including that due to investor psychology), and asymmetric information. *Improved Black–Scholes and binomial options pricing models: The Black–Scholes model and the more general binomial options pricing models are a collection of equations that seek to model and price equity and call options. While the models are widely used, they have many significant limitations. Chief among them are the model's inability to account for historical market movements and their frequent overpricing of options, with the overpricing increasing with the time to maturity. The development of a model that can properly account for the pricing of call options on an asset with stochastic volatility is considered an open problem in financial economics. *Problems with the American option: Is there a closed form for American put options? Is there a forward partial differential equation for the American Option in a local volatility model? International economics * Home bias in trade puzzle: The home bias in trade puzzle is an empirical observation that even when factors such as economic size of trading partners and the distance between them are considered, trade between regions within a given country is substantially greater than trade between regions in different countries, even when there are no substantial legal barriers. There is currently no framework to explain this observation. * Equity home bias puzzle: This puzzle concerns the observation that individuals and institutions in many countries only hold modest amounts of foreign equity, despite the ability for vast diversification of their portfolios in the global economy. While some explanations do exist, such as that local individuals and firms have greater access to information about local firms and economic conditions, these explanations are not accepted by the majority of economists and have been mostly refuted. * Backus–Kehoe–Kydland puzzle: The Backus–Kehoe–Kydland consumption correlation puzzle is the empirical observation that consumption is much less correlated across countries than output. Standard economic theory suggests that country-specific output risks should be collective and domestic consumption growth should not depend strongly on country-specific income shocks. Thus, we should not see the observation that consumption is much less correlated across countries than output; and yet we do. *Feldstein–Horioka puzzle: The Feldstein-Horioka puzzle originates from an article in the 1980s that found that among OECD countries, averages of long-term national savings rates are highly correlated with similar averages of domestic investment rates. Standard economic theory suggests that in relatively open international financial markets, the savings of any country would flow to countries with the most productive investment opportunities; hence, saving rates and domestic investment rates would be uncorrelated, contrary to the empirical evidence suggested by Martin Feldstein and Charles Horioka. While numerous articles regarding the puzzle have been published, none of the explanations put forth have adequate empirical support. *PPP Puzzle: The PPP puzzle, considered one of the two real exchange rate puzzles, concerns the observation that real exchange rates are both more volatile and more persistent than most models would suggest. The only clear way to understand this volatility would be to assign substantial roles to monetary and financial shocks. However, if shocks play such a large role the challenge becomes finding what source, if one even exists, of nominal rigidity that could be so persistent to explain the long- term prolonged nature of real exchange rate deviations. *The exchange rate disconnect puzzle: The exchange rate disconnect puzzle, also one of the so- called real exchange rate puzzles, concerns the weak short-term feedback link between exchange rates and the rest of the economy. In most economies, the exchange rate is the most important relative price, so it is surprising, and thus far unexplained entirely, that the correlations are not stronger.

Festival of the liberation of Rabbi Shneur Zalman=History The date is significant within the Chabad Hasidic movement. Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (), the first Rebbe of Chabad (also known as the \\"Alter Rebbe\\" in Yiddish) was informed upon by a misnaged named Avigdor and arrested on charges of supporting the Ottoman Empire by urging his followers to send money to the Land of Israel as \\"evidence\\" of his alleged insurrectionist aspirations (in fact, the money was sent to support poor Jews). At the time, the Land of Israel was a part of the Ottoman Empire, which was at war with Russia. Shneur Zalman was charged with treason, and released in the secular year 1798 on the Jewish date of Tuesday, 19 Kislev. The fifty-three days of Rabbi Shneur Zalman's imprisonment are said to correspond to the fifty-three chapters of the first section of the Tanya. Commemoration  This day is regarded in the Chabad movement as a divine vindication, and is celebrated by Chabad Chasidim with farbrengens. It is regarded as \\"the New Year of Chassidus (Hasidism),\\" when each Chassid wishes the other, \\"may you be signed and sealed for a good year in the study and ways of Chassidus.\\" Tachanun is not recited.Kollel Chabad entry for month of Kislev The last verses of Psalm 55, \\"He has redeemed my soul in peace,\\" are traditionally sung on this day. These verses are a reference to the experienced by the Alter Rebbe on this day. Rabbi Shneur Zalman said: \\"Whoever participates in my celebration will merit to see nachas from his descendants.\\"Zichron Livnei Yisroel p. 119 The day is also marked by many other non-Chabad Chassidic groups. =20 Kislev= When the Alter Rebbe left prison he was mistakenly brought to the home of a misnaged (one opposed to Chassidus), who caused him to suffer with his questions. Afterwards, the Alter Rebbe said that the three hours he spent at the misnaged's home were more difficult than all the time he had spent in prison. In commemoration of the fact that the Alter Rebbe's liberation was not complete until he left the misnaged's house, Chassidim mark 20 Kislev as a day of liberation as well.Sicha of 19 Kislev 5738 Incidents during imprisonment During Rabbi Shneur Zalman's imprisonment he was questioned by an erudite government minister, who posed the following question: \\"The verse states that G-d called to man and said to him, 'Where are you?' Didn't G-d know where Adam was?\\" Rabbi Shneur Zalman answered him in accordance with Rashi's explanation that God asked Adam the question \\"Where are you?\\" in order to gently begin conversing with Adam, so that Adam would not become startled and disconcerted by God's sudden appearance. The minister indicated that he was aware of that answer, but he wanted to hear Rabbi Shneur Zalman's explanation. After ascertaining that the minister believed in the eternality of the Torah and its directives, Rabbi Shneur Zalman replied: \\"When a person is, for example, so and so many years old (mentioning the exact age of his questioner), G-d asks him: Where are you? Are you aware of why you were created on this earth? Are you aware of what you are expected to do and how much you actually have done?\\"The Chassidic Dimension – Festivals 1: Yud-Tes Kislev Chasidic lore tells that the spirits of the Maggid of Mezeritch and the Baal Shem Tov came to visit Rabbi Shneur Zalman in prison. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn is reputed to have once visited the cell (when he was in Saint Petersburg in the summer of 1911), and when he returned, his father, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, the fifth Chabad Rebbe, asked him if the cell had enough room for three people, which implies that Rabbi Sholom Dovber believed that they had appeared as souls in bodies.Sicha of 19 Kislev 5711 Other significant events Rabbi Yaakov of Marvege (Korebil), a twelfth- century Tosafist and Kabbalist, wrote a book called \\"Responsa from Heaven,\\" in which he recorded halachic responsa he had heard from Heaven. After discussing the concept that one should only study Torah after immersion in a mikveh, he describes 19 Kislev as \\"a day that will herald good tidings.\\" On this Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson commented: 19 Kislev, 1744 - considered to mark the day upon which Rabbi Shneur Zalman was conceived, for he was born exactly nine months later, on 18 Elul.Shemu'os VeSippurim, Refoel Kahn, Vol. 1, p. 39 19 Kislev, 1772 - the date of the Yom Hillula (passing) of the Maggid of Mezritch, the successor of the Baal Shem Tov (the founder of Hasidism). 19 Kislev, 1809 - the birth date of the Alter Rebbe of Chasidei Zychlin, HaRebi Shmuel Abba (ZT\\"L). It was celebrated as the birth date of the Zychlin (Hasidic dynasty)Zychlin Chasidut until 95% of the followers were murdered in the Holocaust. 19 Kislev, 2003 - the day that Saddam Hussein was captured. 19 Kislev, 2011 - the day that the Iraq War came to an end. 19th of Kislev, 2017 - (at 8:07 P.M.

Plot Senior college student Katie Burke (Holmes) is struggling to deal with the stress of completing her thesis and succeeding in an upcoming rigorous interview process. To make matters even more complicated, Detective Wade Handler (Bratt), a recovering alcoholic, reopens the two-year-old police investigation into the disappearance of her boyfriend, Embry Larkin (Hunnam). An orphaned young man of considerable means, Embry had purchased two tickets to Athens, Greece before his disappearance; the tickets had never been used and Embry's financial assets had not been touched since his disappearance. With the official reopening of the Larkin case, however, Katie begins to see Embry lurking around campus, seemingly stalking her. Reporting this back to Detective Handler, who dismisses her as he believes Embry to be dead, Katie is not convinced but nevertheless returns to school. Falling asleep in the college library while studying, upon waking she finds a number carved into the wood of the desk. Upon investigation, she discovers it references a library book: The Inferno. There she finds Embry staring back at her from the other side of the book stack. Confiding these troubling events to her friends, most notably her roommate Samantha (Deschanel), Katie learns that during her relationship with Embry, he had acted extremely jealous and even violent toward another of Katie's admirers, Harrison (Mann), for whom Katie held only platonic feelings. Shortly thereafter, Harrison seemingly disappears from campus. Convinced that Embry is responsible, Katie confronts him at a local restaurant, only to be asked to meet him at his family's country house. Once at the Larkin family's country house, however, a violent confrontation ensues between Katie and Embry. Fleeing from the house and finding comfort in Handler, Katie begins an affair with the detective which spurs her to complete her thesis. With Handler closing the investigation, citing that Embry Larkin was indeed alive, and resigning from his job as a detective, he and Katie plan on temporarily retreating to Handler's cabin in New Hampshire. Meanwhile, however, Handler learns from a forensic expert that a note which had supposedly only recently been written by Embry to Katie was, in fact, two years old. Waiting for Handler on campus, Katie is once again attacked by Embry, who promises to find her wherever she goes before running off. Informing Handler of her encounter with Embry, Katie asks him if the two of them can just leave, but Handler insists on putting a stop to Embry's threats. Following Katie's direction to where Embry ran off, Handler and Katie venture into Embry's former dormitory, which is now abandoned due to the building's derelict structure. As they walk into one of the building's old tunnels, a former spot for Katie and Embry's trysts, Katie begins to interact with Embry, but Handler sees no one. Through flashbacks, Katie and Embry have been in the same location two years prior, with Embry cruelly breaking up with her and calling off their planned trip to Greece. It is subsequently revealed that as a repercussion of her father's abandonment of her at a young age, Katie possesses severe psychotic tendencies surrounding abandonment. Distraught over Embry's disposal of her, Katie picks up a rock and strikes him from behind repeatedly, killing him. Attempting to reason with Katie before telling her she cannot come with him to New Hampshire, Handler takes notice of something at the bottom of the water. Realizing that it is the skeleton of Embry Larkin, Handler is suddenly struck from behind and falls into the water, echoing Embry's murder two years prior. The epilogue reveals that the dormitory is to be demolished for the construction of a new structure on the site, thus cementing the permanent disappearance of Embry Larkin and Wade Handler. Katie Burke has graduated, and finally gets the job she has always wanted. But co-worker Robert Hanson informs her that he has been promoted and that their relationship must end; a familiar look passes over Katie's face.

Candida krusei is an emerging fungal nosocomial pathogen primarily found in the immunocompromised and those with hematological malignancies. It has natural resistance to fluconazole, a standard antifungal agent. It is most often found in patients who have had prior fluconazole exposure, sparking debate and conflicting evidence as to whether fluconazole should be used prophylactically. Mortality due to C. krusei fungemia is much higher than the more common C. albicans. Other Candida species that also fit this profile are C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. guillermondii and C. rugosa. Candida krusei can be successfully treated with voriconazole, amphotericin B, and the echinocandins micafungin, caspofungin, and anidulafungin. Role in chocolate production Cacao beans have to be fermented to remove the bitter taste and break them down. This takes place with two fungi, C. krusei, and Geotrichum. Most of the time, the two fungi are already present on the seed pods and seeds of the cacao plant, but in modern chocolate making, specific strains are used. Each chocolate company uses its own strains, which have been selected to provide optimum flavor and aroma to the chocolate. The yeasts reproduce every few hours, and soon there are thousands of individual yeast cells in a small area, which produce enzymes to break down the pulp on the outside of the beans. This makes acetic acid, killing the cacao embryo inside the seed, developing a chocolatey aroma and eliminating the bitterness in the beans. Growth and Metabolism C. krusei grows at a maximum temperature of 43–45 °C. Although most of the medically important Candida spp. require biotin for growth and some have additional vitamin requirements, only C. krusei can grow in vitamin-free media. However, of the medically important Candida spp., C. krusei is perhaps the only species which grows on Sabouraud's dextrose agar as spreading colonies with a matte or a rough whitish yellow surface, in contrast to the convex colonies of other Candida spp. This characteristic, together with its \\"long grain rice\\" appearance on microscopy, helps the definitive identification of the species. A complex variety of fatty acids has been demonstrated as metabolites when C. krusei is grown in culture media containing lactose, it is also able to produce a number of short-chain carboxylic acids when cultured in saliva supplemented with glucose; these include acetate, pyruvate, succinate, propionate, formate and lactate. The biological role of these, if any, is as yet unknown. Candida krusei is a very interesting type of fungus due to the fact that patients that obtain this fungus, result in the lowest 90-day survival period among all Candida species that have been currently found.

The premise of this type of marketing is that purchase decisions are made at an emotional level, to enhance self-concept. Target audience An important characteristic of an aspirational product is that the part of its exposure audience that is at present economically unable to purchase it, but thinks of itself as having a fair probability of at a certain point in the future being able to do so - see Premium pricing. This part of the exposure audience is referred to as the aspirational audience, whereas the part of the exposure audience that already can afford the product is called the consumption audience. Consumption audience and aspirational audience together form the aspirational product's target audience, which typically represents 30%-60% of the exposure audience - see Audience measurement. Weak aspirational brands have target audiences that are almost as large as their exposure audiences (e.g. MP3 player brands), and are thus slowly becoming commodity brands (whose consumption audiences coincide with their exposure audiences, thereby lacking an aspiring audience). Pricing As a general rule, an aspirational brand and its products can command Premium pricing in the marketplace over a commodity brand. This ability can to a large extent be explained by the consumer's need for conspicuous consumption for which he is willing to pay a Price premium. The smaller the size of the product's target audience compared to the exposure audience, the more the product satisfies this need, and the higher the premium that such a consumer is prepared to pay. The larger the ratio of aspirational to consumption consumers in the target audience, the higher the brand's premium, e.g. Mercedes-Benz cars. To keep the premium level of a brand high, the consumption portion of the audience should not exceed 30% of the aspirational audience. Quadrants Researchers Niraj Dawar and Charan K. Bagga at Harvard University analyze market quadrants on a \\"X=Centrality (sales volume)/Y=Distinctiveness\\" scale, with Aspirational Brands occupying the most coveted quadrant, with high sales volumes and premium pricing. Aspirational models in fashion magazines The \\"aspirational model\\" employed in fashion magazines is to offer readers continuing (and continually changing) fashion, beauty, and physical ideals they can aspire to, but perhaps never actually achieve. Criticized for this approach, magazine editors have claimed that their readers do not want to see \\"real-life\\" models or the way that beauty products and clothes look on \\"real women\\"; that they buy the magazines in the first place because they prefer the aspirational fantasies, and in the second, because they continually hope that by following the advice or buying the products, they will achieve the ever- changing looks that the magazine promotes via the models and photographic/technological wizardry. Aspirational brand strategy Aspirational brand strategies are employed to re-position a brand within a marketplace. The idea is that brand can lead organizational change and lead consumer opinion about a brand. Aspirational brand strategies are used when the current image of the brand is either negative or no longer relevant to the company. Companies have to take great care in employing an aspirational brand strategy. The company needs to be structured around truly delivering on the promise and must have employees who understand the brand goals and actively and daily work to achieve them. BP learned the dangers of aspirational branding during the summer of 2010 during the BP/Deepwater Oil Spill disaster. As the article BP: Disingenuously Branding explains, the aspiration of the company to be environmentally friendly and \\"Beyond Petroleum\\" backfired in a big way.

He was Minister for Health and Minister for Repatriation from 1931 to 1932, holding office in the government of his brother-in-law James Scullin. Early life McNeill was born in Tantanoola, South Australia. After achieving a primary school education, McNeill worked as a shearer and then became a selector at Woosang. He sold his farm to prospect for gold during the Coolgardie, Western Australia gold rush and then returned to Victoria to farm at Macarthur before becoming an organiser for the Australian Workers' Union (AWU) in western Victoria and the Riverina of New South Wales. He married Mary Ann Mills in 1896, but she died in 1905. McNeill contested the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Glenelg for Australian Labor Party in 1906.

He won it back in 1929. On 2 March 1931, dissatisfaction with the economic performance of the Scullin Government and internal rivalries within the Labor Caucus resulted in the Caucus declaring all ministerial positions vacant and subsequently a new ministry was elected. McNeill was elected to cabinet and was allocated the portfolios of Health and Repatriation. He kept these positions until the Scullin Government resigned on 6 January 1932. He lost his parliamentary seat at the December 1931 general election.

After completing his secondary schooling at the Oberschule, Seidl started law study. After three semesters, he interrupted his studies and took on various odd jobs. From 1935 until 1938, Seidl studied history and German studies at the University of Vienna. He obtained his PhD in 1941. This title was taken away from him in 1947 after he was convicted as a war criminal. On 2 March 1939 Seidl married Elisabeth Stieber, a former teacher in a kindergarten. She was a member of the NSDAP (Nazi Party) and its NS-Frauenschaft (NSF: National Socialist Women's League, literally NS-Womanship), and supporting member of the SS. Nazi career On 15 October 1930 Seidl joined the Nazi Party (registered as member number 300,738). From September 1931 until May 1932, he was active in the SA. The same day that he left the SA, Seidl was assigned to the 11th SS-Standarte (SS-regiment) as Oberscharführer (equivalent to Staff Sergeant (US) or Sergeant (UK)) (member number 46,106). In late 1939, Seidl was called into the police as a result of his SS membership. As of January 1940, he was attached to the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) – Department IVB4 under Adolf Eichmann's command – and posted to the SS lead section in Posen. On 30 October 1941, Seidl was charged by Adolf Eichmann with establishing the Theresienstadt ghetto and concentration camp, Czechoslovakia. From November 1941 until 3 July 1943, he was the ghetto's Commandant. He was responsible for thousands of people being ill treated and murdered.

Günther in turn reported to Adolf Eichmann at the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) IV B 4 in Berlin. On orders of Eichmann, Seidl was on 3 July 1943 reassigned as Commandant of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He was succeeded at Theresienstadt by SS-Obersturmführer Anton Burger. In March 1944 Seidl met with the Wehrmacht in Budapest, where he joined the 5th Einsatzgruppe SS paramilitary death squad. As leader of the Debrecen outpost, Seidl was part of the Sondereinsatzkommando-Eichmann (SEK). The SEK organised the largest and quickest deportation of the Holocaust.

Modularity is observed in all model systems, and can be studied at nearly every scale of biological organization, from molecular interactions all the way up to the whole organism. Evolution of Modularity The exact evolutionary origins of biological modularity has been debated since the 1990s. In the mid 1990s, Günter WagnerGP Wagner. 1996. \\"Homologues, Natural Kinds and the Evolution of Modularity\\". American Zoologist. 36:36-43 argued that modularity could have arisen and been maintained through the interaction of four evolutionary modes of action: [1] Selection for the rate of adaptation: If different complexes evolve at different rates, then those evolving more quickly reach fixation in a population faster than other complexes. Thus, common evolutionary rates could be forcing the genes for certain proteins to evolve together while preventing other genes from being co-opted unless there is a shift in evolutionary rate. [2] Constructional selection: When a gene exists in many duplicated copies, it may be maintained because of the many connections it has (also termed pleiotropy). There is evidence that this is so following whole genome duplication, or duplication at a single locus. However, the direct relationship that duplication processes have with modularity has yet to be directly examined. [3] Stabilizing selection: While seeming antithetical to forming novel modules, Wagner maintains that it is important to consider the effects of stabilizing selection as it may be \\"an important counter force against the evolution of modularity\\". Stabilizing selection, if ubiquitously spread across the network, could then be a \\"wall\\" that makes the formation of novel interactions more difficult and maintains previously established interactions. Against such strong positive selection, other evolutionary forces acting on the network must exist, with gaps of relaxed selection, to allow focused reorganization to occur. [4] Compounded effect of stabilizing and directional selection: This is the explanation seemingly favored by Wagner and his contemporaries as it provides a model through which modularity is constricted, but still able to unidirectionally explore different evolutionary outcomes. The semi-antagonistic relationship is best illustrated using the corridor model, whereby stabilizing selection forms barriers in phenotype space that only allow the system to move towards the optimum along a single path. This allows directional selection to act and inch the system closer to optimum through this evolutionary corridor. For over a decade, researchers examined the dynamics of selection on network modularity. However, in 2013 Clune and colleaguesJ Clune, JB Mouret, and H Lipson. 2013. \\"The evolutionary origins of modularity\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society B. 280: 20122863. challenged the sole focus on selective forces, and instead provided evidence that there are inherent \\"connectivity costs\\" that limit the number of connections between nodes to maximize efficiency of transmission. This hypothesis originated from neurological studies that found that there is an inverse relationship between the number of neural connections and the overall efficiency (more connections seemed to limit the overall performance speed/precision of the network). This connectivity cost had yet to be applied to evolutionary analyses. Clune et al. created a series of models that compared the efficiency of various evolved network topologies in an environment where performance, their only metric for selection, was taken into account, and another treatment where performance as well as the connectivity cost were factored together. The results show not only that modularity formed ubiquitously in the models that factored in connection cost, but that these models also outperformed the performance-only based counterparts in every task. This suggests a potential model for module evolution whereby modules form from a system’s tendency to resist maximizing connections to create more efficient and compartmentalized network topologies.

Likewise, a stenosis of greater than 90% may not be heard, as the flow may be too low. Many carotid bruits are discovered incidentally in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. The presence of a carotid bruit alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of stenosis, and the physical examination cannot be used to estimate the degree of stenosis, if present; therefore, any bruit must be evaluated by ultrasound or imaging.DeGowin's Diagnostic Examination, 9th Edition, Chapter 8; Richard F.

Within the Zuni community, these carvings serve ceremonial purposes for their creators and depict animals and icons integral to their culture. As a form of contemporary Native American art, they are sold with secular intentions to collectors worldwide.  Directions and typology  The main source for academic information on Zuni fetishes is the Second Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology submitted in 1881 by Frank Hamilton Cushing and posthumously published as Zuni Fetishes in 1966, with several later reprints. Cushing reports that the Zuni divided the world into six regions or directions: north, west, south, east, above, and below. At the center of each region is a great mountain peak that is a very sacred place. Yellow mountain to the north, blue mountain to the west, red mountain to the south, white mountain to the east, the multicolored mountain above, and the black mountain below.Cushing, 1994:17 Each direction is represented by a Prey God, or guardian animal, and are listed by Cushing as follows: *north: yellow mountain lion *west: black bear (represented by the color blue), *south: red badger, *east: white wolf, *above or the sky: multicolored eagle, *below or underground: black shrew (often misnamed \\"mole,\\" but moles do not live in the Southwest). Each prey god is the “guardian and master” of their region, with the yellow mountain lion being the elder brother of all animals and the master and guardian of all regions. Each one of these regions contains an order of all the guardian animals, but the \\"guardian and master\\" of a particular region is the elder brother to all animals of that region. These guardians are considered as having protective and healing powers. They are held by the priests of the medicine orders as if \\"in captivity\\" and act as mediators between the priests and the animals they represent.Cushing, 1994:17-19 A second group of fetishes, the Prey Gods of the Hunt, belonging to the Hunter Order, or Society, are given in the “prayer songs of the Sa-ni-a-kia-kwe”. These guardian animals are the same as the original regions with the exception of the coyote, which replaces the bear; and the wildcat (or bobcat), which replaces the red badger.Cushing, 1994:20 Sa-ni-a-kia is the awakening of the fetish and subsequently the power of the hunter.Cushing, 1994:15 In addition to the animals mentioned above, typical Zuni fetishes depict animals such as the wolf, badger, bear, mountain lion, eagle, mole, frog, deer, ram, and others. Contemporary carvers many produce images of exotic subjects - dinosaurs, for example - or some insects and reptiles that are customary but more integral to petroglyphs, symbolism, and the patterns of design in pottery - dragonflies, butterflies, water spiders, and lizards for example.see Bunzel, 1929; Young, 1988 Other animals, such as the horse, were carved in the past mainly for trade. The Zuni was not a horse culture, but their horse carvings were considered by the horse cultures to the north as having great power for the protection of their herds.Cushing, 1994, Bahti’s Introduction.  Materials  Historical, carvers used locally sourced materials or item procured by trade or pilgrimages. The most important of these materials was turquoise which the Zuni regard as the sacred stone. Jet, shell (primarily mother-of-pearl), and coral are also frequently used. These materials and their associated colors are principle in the Zuni sunface, a cultural symbol which is present in Zuni jewelry and fetishes and represents their Sun Father . Other materials used are travertine or \\"Zuni rock\\", fishrock, jasper, pipestone, marble, or organic items such as fossilized ivory, bone, and deer or elk antler. Even artificial substances such as slag glass are used. But historically the most-used stone has been serpentine, a local soft stone found abundantly in the Zuni Mountains and also in Arizona. In recent years Zuni carvings, or fetishes, have become popular collectibles and Zuni artisans have familiarized themselves with materials available from all parts of the world in order to serve the aesthetic tastes of collectors.McManis, 1998  Sacredness  In Zuni cosmology and those of neighboring tribes, each animal is believed to have inherent powers or qualities that may aid the owner. The Navajo, for example, treasured and bartered for figures of horses, sheep, cattle or goats to protect their herd from disease and to ensure fertility. The Zuni hunter, or \\"Prey brother,\\" was required to have his fetishes (prey gods of the hunt) with a \\"Keeper\\" and practice a ceremony of worship when procuring a favorite or proper fetish to aid in a successful hunt. In the ceremony of the hunt the Keeper presented a clay pot containing the fetishes to the hunter. Facing in the direction appropriate to the chosen fetish the pot was sprinkled with medicine meal and a prayer was recited. The fetish was placed in a buckskin bag and carried by the hunter over his heart (Cushing, 1994:33). The fetish aids in the chase and represents \\"the roar of the animal\\" and is also fed on the blood of the slain prey.Cushing, 1994:35 In addition to the Prey Gods of the Six Regions with their guardian and medicinal powers, and the Prey Gods of the Hunt that aid in the chase, Cushing names three Prey Gods of the Priesthood of the Bow, a society of which he was a member, that aid a Priest of the Bow when traveling in a region where he may be captured by the enemy. These are the mountain lion and great white bear, which belong to the \\"skies\\", as well as a prey god of human form adorned with \\"flint knife-feather pinions and tail\\". An arrowhead, \\"emblematic of Sa-wa-ni-kia\\", or the \\"medicine of war\\", on the back or side of either of these animals prevented a warrior from being taken by surprise by his enemy, and an arrowhead on the belly or feet erased the tracks of the carrier so that they could not be followed by the enemy. Unlike the Prey Gods of the Hunt these fetishes were never deposited with a keeper, but like the Prey Gods of the Hunt they were fed on the blood of the slain and their ceremony involved depositing sacred flour to the four directions and reciting a prayer, and like the Prey Gods of the Six Regions they were protective of the carrier.Cushing, 1994:40–43 On the subject of feeding, within Zuni culture it is believes fetishes require periodic meals of cornmeal and ground turquoise. Fetishes may be kept in a clay pot as it is the tradition, although collectors usually like to keep theirs somewhere where they can be admired. Any but the very delicate fetishes could be carried by the owner in a pocket, pouch or bag. While the Zuni fetish carvings available for sale online are considered \\"Zuni fetishes,\\" carved by a variety of well-known Zuni carvers, true Zuni fetishes do not leave the village and are blessed by a spiritual leader and used by the carver himself or a special recipient.  Religion as art  Animal effigies of the Zuni, fired clay, before 1880. From a Bureau of American Ethnology report Zuni fetish carvings have been around for centuries. Ancient Pueblo effigies were an earlier form of a Zuni fetish carving. It has only been in recent times that the fetishes have been carved to sell, and have left the village. While the Zuni fetish carvings you see for sale on the internet are considered Zuni fetishes, carved by a variety of well known Zuni carvers, true Zuni fetishes do not leave the village and are blessed by a Shaman or Medicine Man and used by the carver himself or a special recipient. The artist's styles are as unique as the artists themselves, and there are many whose works are highly sought after by collectors. Some collectors prefer a figure that is more realistic in appearance, while others prefer the more classical styles that are intrinsic to Zuni belief. The customary Zuni perspective is that the least modification of the original material maintains, or heightens, the power of the fetish as a \\"natural concretion.\\"Cushing, 1994:12. Realism in carving style is a matter relative to the beliefs of its owner, and the realism in contemporary carving is a product of collector request and demand and the intent of Zuni carvers to raise the level of their art form through participation in the world of contemporary art. The enigma, or apparent paradox relevant to Zuni belief and realism in art is resolved in the notion that carvings for sale and collection are produced without religious intent. For this reason some carvers prefer the term \\"carvings\\" rather than the term \\"fetishes\\" when referring to offerings for collectors. A fetish may be signed by the carver, or not. Personalization by signing a piece of art violates the historic Zuni notion of community purpose, and the signing of artwork is a concept introduced to the Zuni by Anglo collectors at the beginning of the 20th century (c. 1915). Often, though, a Zuni carver feels that their own unique style is readily identifiable and the fetish's style will be enough to identify the carver as surely as would any other mark. Most carvers are the recipients of a family practice and have learned their skill from parents, grand parents, or siblings, and have passed the art to their own children as well. Besides being made from various stones and other materials (each material has unique properties), the contemporary fetish may carry an offering of a smaller animal or a prayer bundle of carved arrowheads with small beads of heishe. It may be adorned with a heishe necklace, feathers, etchings representing ancient petroglyphs, or an etched or inlaid heartline. These small items, although colorful to the eye, are intended to protect and feed the fetish itself.Cushing, 1994 Notes References  *Bahti, Mark (1999, 2016) Spirit in the Stone: A Handbook of Southwest Indian Animal Carvings and Beliefs *Bunzel, Ruth L.

The 16-story building, which is 208 ft (63m) to the roof, held the title of tallest building in Arizona for over 30 years until the completion of the Meridian Bank Tower in 1960. The building primarily served as a hotel from its grand opening in 1928 until its official closure on April 7, 1980. The facility also housed several offices and restaurants, including one on the 16th floor called Top of the Ho. There were also several gathering rooms in the hotel, the Turquoise Room on the 2nd floor where many marriage receptions were held, and a large convention center adjacent to the main hotel which could seat 1,600 called the Thunderbird Room where many of Phoenix's big events took place. After the hotel closed in 1980, the new owners converted the building into a subsidized housing complex for the elderly and mobility impaired. Currently, the facility houses as many as 320 residents in 289 rooms which were recently renovated to make them more accessible for apartment residents.

The project was financed by Sutherlin-Barry & Company of New Orleans, Louisiana, for owner G. L. Johnson of Chicago, Illinois.

The hotel was to be operated by Johnson's Pacific Hotel Company.\\"New Roosevelt Hotel In Phoenix Uses Brass Pipe\\" Winslow Daily Mail [Winslow, Arizona] Aug 24, 1927, page 4 Work came to a halt in early 1928 with only 6-stories completed.

According to librarian at the Sun City Museum developer Del Webb got his start hanging doors at the hotel during its construction. His namesake company would go on to build an expansion to the hotel. A 5-story annex was built west of the original structure by the Del E. Webb Construction Company in 1948. The steel tower and antenna on top of the building were erected in 1949 to broadcast Phoenix's first television station, KPHO-TV CBS-5. In 1960, KPHO moved to its new transmitter on South Mountain. After use in the 1970s by KXTC 92.3 FM, the antenna on Westward Ho now functions as a cell tower. In 1982, the National Register of Historic Places recognized the Westward Ho as a historic building. In 2003, the building was acquired by the Phoenix Preservation Partnership, a Rhode Island-based group of investors. Hotel Westward Ho The building has had quite a few owners in its time, beginning with G. L. Johnson in 1927, who sold it to Charles V. Bob and August Heckscher in 1928 while still under-construction. Heckscher took over full control of the Westward Ho in the early 1930s, and after many years of successful ownership died April 26, 1941, leaving his life's real estate to his wife Virginia Henry Curtiss, who died just a few months later. The hotel was put up for sale and eventually purchased by partners John B. Mills and R. H. Hawn of Federal Underwriters, Inc, Dallas, Texas in 1943.\\"Westward Ho Hotel Is Sold\\" Arizona Independent Republic [Phoenix, Arizona] November 16, 1943 They purchased the hotel without ever actually seeing it in person, persuaded by W.

They already owned several other large hotels in Texas, including the former William Penn Hotel in Houston, Texas, which was demolished in 2006, Cliff Towers Hotel in Dallas, and the Hotel Hawn in Temple, Texas. There was no change in management or policy following the change of ownership. In December 1972, after nearly 30 years of ownership by the Mills family, the hotel was sold to Leisure Inns and Resorts Inc. of Cleveland, Ohio.

The former Arizona Bank Building (under-construction) can be seen just west of Hotel San Carlos, and Camelback Mountain can be seen in the background. When the camera pans south to the right you can see the Heard Building in the foreground with its antenna, which was often confused to be the Westward Ho antenna. Behind the Heard Building you can see the Professional Building. In the 1998 Gus Van Sant remake of Psycho, the camera zooms into a window on the 8th floor of the Westward Ho. In the 1972 film Pocket Money, actor Paul Newman throws a television set off the 4th story balcony of a hotel room in the J wing of the Westward Ho. Lee Marvin and Strother Martin can also be seen inside the same hotel room. Other areas of the hotel used in the film included the lobby, patio, J Wing stair and walkways, and the hotel barber shop. In the film, the hotel was supposed to be located in Mexico. In the 1956 film Bus Stop starring Marilyn Monroe, the parade scenes were filmed on Central Ave in front of the entrance.

It is most commonly used by Outlook Express. It was introduced with Internet Explorer 3 in 1996 and improved in subsequent versions. The Windows Address Book API can query LDAP servers or read/write data to a local file. In Windows Vista, Windows Address Book was replaced with Windows Contacts. Overview The Windows Address Book is an application that has a local database and user interface for finding and editing information about people, making it possible to query network directory servers using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. Other applications can also use the WAB. Microsoft Office Outlook uses its own store for email messages. However, it can import contacts from the format. Microsoft Exchange / Windows Messaging uses file for Personal Address Book. Features * Can store comprehensive contact information in tabs including personal and business information * Integrates with Outlook Express. * Programmable API to work with other applications. Applications can also extend functionality such as adding more tabs and fields to store additional custom information, or customizing the toolbar. * Can store contacts inside contact groups and folders. * Can selectively send email to contacts only in plain text for additional security. * Can export and import cards to and from vCard 2.1 and CSV formats. Can also import from LDIF and other formats. * Search for entries in the contact database, arrange contacts by first name or last name. * Automatically add contacts from received email. * Prints contact lists as memo, business card or phone list styles. Security risk In May 2000 the ILOVEYOU virus showed how the Windows Address Book could be part of an exploit to spread malicious software by accessing and sending email to a user's contacts. This approach has since been adopted by many commercial spammers. Outlook integration One of the undocumented features of the Windows Address Book is integration with Microsoft Office Outlook. A registry value has to be set at the following registry key location: Note: Users should back up the registry before making changes. :\`HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\WAB\\\\WAB4\` A value named \\"UseOutlook\\" (if not present already) can be created with its value set to 1. After setting this value, Outlook Contacts are shared with the Windows Address Book. This feature works only up to Windows XP and Outlook 2003. Windows Contacts introduced with Windows Vista does not support sharing contacts with Outlook. The above method works with any version of Outlook up to Outlook 2003, despite newer versions not including it as a configurable option in the user interface.

They are found in forested areas and shrublands throughout Australia and New Guinea. Characteristics Physically, they appear very similar to the pygmy possums, except for their greater size. Even so, they are relatively small animals, with the largest being cat-sized, and they weigh between 200 grams and 2 kilograms. They have grasping hands and feet with opposable first toes on their hindfeet, and, in all species save the greater glider, a prehensile tail. They are nocturnal, with large eyes. All species feed almost entirely on leaves. To enable them to digest this tough and fibrous food, they have an enlarged cecum containing fermenting bacteria, and, like rabbits, they are coprophagous, passing food through their digestive tracts twice. Their teeth include a battery of grinding molars, and they lack lower canines.

The acceptor substrate can be another sugar such as the transfer of a fucose to a core GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) sugar as in the case of N-linked glycosylation, or to a protein, as in the case of O-linked glycosylation produced by O-fucosyltransferase. There are various fucosyltransferases in mammals, the vast majority of which, are located in the Golgi apparatus. The O-fucosyltransferases have recently been shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Some of the proteins in this group are responsible for the molecular basis of the blood group antigens, surface markers on the outside of the red blood cell membrane. Most of these markers are proteins, but some are carbohydrates attached to lipids or proteins [Reid M.E., Lomas-Francis C. The Blood Group Antigen FactsBook Academic Press, London / San Diego, (1997)]. Galactoside 3(4)-L-fucosyltransferase () belongs to the Lewis blood group system and is associated with Le(a/b) antigen. Classification Glycosyltransferase family 10 CAZY GT_10 comprises enzymes with two known activities; galactoside 3(4)-L-fucosyltransferase () and galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase (). The galactoside 3-fucosyltransferases display similarities with the alpha-2 and alpha-6-fucosyltranferases. The biosynthesis of the carbohydrate antigen sialyl Lewis X (sLe(x)) is dependent on the activity of an galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase. This enzyme catalyses the transfer of fucose from GDP-beta-fucose to the 3-OH of N-acetylglucosamine present in lactosamine acceptors. Role in preventing UTIs Robust fucosyltransferase activity discourages bacterial adherence in the urethra of women. This is also mediated by the presence of few bacterial adhesion sites in the bladder and urethra. Women with these receptors who do not have mucosal secretion of the fucosyltransferase enzyme to help block bacterial adherence are more likely to have colonization of E coli and other coliforms from the rectum and less likely to have lactobacilli in the periurethral area, resulting in frequent episodes of cystitis.

The series adapts numerous elements from previous installments of both the Getter Robo manga and anime entries, in addition to other elements from Ken Ishikawa's library of work, but is an independent story from any other installments. Plot The plot opens some time after the Moon Wars, where things for the original cast have taken a turn for the worse. The main character and pilot of Getter-1, Ryōma Nagare, has been framed for the murder of the Getter Machine builder Dr. Saotome after the death of Saotome's daughter, Michiru. However, he is released from jail and is reunited on Earth—unhappily—with his old allies, Hayato Jin and Musashi Tomoe, to fight none other than Dr. Saotome himself, who has seemingly risen from the grave to threaten humanity with his ultimate creation—and most dangerous weapon, the Shin Getter Dragon. The Shin Getter Dragon is a massive weapon powered by the same cosmic Getter Rays which gave life to their machines. However, their efforts to stop Dr. Saotome (not to mention an overzealous Japanese Defense Force), are in vain, as nuclear weapons are used on Shin Dragon. The resulting explosion and shock wave of Getter Rays wipes out 99% of the human population worldwide. Thirteen years after this catastrophe, as humanity clings desperately to life, the re-emerged extraterrestrial invaders threaten planet Earth once more. The only safeguard against this alien threat is a giant robot that emerges from the wreckage of the nuclear blast—Shin Getter Robo—piloted by an artificially created human named Gō. With the help of Hayato's Super Robot Army and Gō's co-pilots Kei and Gai, Shin Getter fights to keep humanity's dreams alive. Later, Ryōma returns piloting the Black Getter Robo to aid the new Getter team against Dr. Saotome, who returns with Stinger and Corwen when Shin Getter Dragon re-activates and continues its evolution. It was also revealed that Kei was Dr. Saotome's younger daughter and Michiru's younger sister, who was adopted by Benkei. Soon the invaders put their true plan into action by transforming Jupiter into a Getter Ray Sun and Ganymede, one of its moons, would soon go on a collision course with Earth, prompting both the old and new Getter teams to spring into action to save the planet. Characters=Old Getter Team * – Former leader of the Getter team and pilot of Getter-1, he was framed some time before the events of the OVA for the death of Dr. Saotome. However, when Dr. Saotome seemingly returns from the dead and threatens to start the end of the world, he is released from jail to commit the very murder he was put in jail for, which he is all too happy to do. After the nuclear explosion he seems to have disappeared, but in reality he was transported 13 years into the future, and then returned from the moon piloting the Black Getter. : * – Former member of the Getter team and pilot of Getter-2, Hayato is manipulative and seems to have ulterior motives. He was the one who helped Dr. Saotome with his plan. He claims to regret helping Dr. Saotome and 13 years after the nuclear fallout, he reappears as the commander of a massive ground battleship called the Tower along with a small army of Super Robots to fight the resurfaced Invaders. : * – Former member of the Getter team and pilot of Getter-3. After Saotome's supposed death, he took care of Genki, Saotome's daughter. However circumstances forced him back in a Getter, where he was killed by Invaders early in the story. : * – In the Armageddon story Musashi and Benkei have met and are friends, he raises Genki as his own daughter (giving her the name Kei) to protect her identity after the fallout. He plays the mentor role during most of the series but eventually returns to pilot Shin Getter. : New Getter Team * – Pilot of Shin Getter-1, he is an artificial human created by Dr. Saotome in order to control Shin Dragon. After the nuclear fallout he realizes Kei is Dr. Saotome's daughter and devotes himself to protecting her. He does not seem to age, as he stays exactly the same after 13 years. Although based on the character of Go Ichimonji from Ken Ishikawa's Getter Robo Go manga, the two characters bear little similarity. : * – The younger daughter of Dr. Saotome, she becomes traumatized after witnessing what truly happened to her older sister. When the nuclear bomb exploded, the trauma of everything caused her to become amnesic, where she began life fresh as , Benkei's tomboyish daughter. As Kei, she pilots Shin Getter-2. Genki's character is a departure from the TV series, as Genki is a boy in that series as the tag-along happy-go-lucky character. Kei is based on the character of Kei Minamikaze from the Getter Robo Go manga, but aside from their appearance and involvement with the Getter Team, they are otherwise unrelated. : * – A large but good-natured guy, he was part of Benkei's group when they ventured to the outside world after 13 years. After Benkei is injured by Invaders, he becomes pilot of Shin Getter-3. He is friends with Kei and seems to have a small crush on her. : Antagonists * – The father of Getter technology, he was supposedly killed by Hayato but mysteriously returned from the dead. He takes a departure from the traditional role by being the antagonist throughout most of the story. He holds a grudge against Ryoma and Hayato because of the death of Michiru, his daughter, and it is this grudge that starts his plans for the end of the world. : * – Two mysterious scientists who worked with Dr. Saotome on Getter Energy in the past. However, because of their desire for evolution they have allowed Invaders into their bodies and believe the Invaders are the only ones for the Earth, and therefore the Getter Energy. Along with Dr. Saotome, they are the antagonists of the story. Stinger and Cowen are both based on two characters from Ken Ishikawa's Majuu Sensen. Stinger is based on Dr. Barbia, and Cowen is based on Dr. Shot. * – The amorphous creatures which were eradicated in the Moon Wars. However they seem to have resurfaced on Earth, with the intention of reaching Shin Dragon. After the nuclear explosion the Invaders have thrived and spread rapidly across the surface. Invaders have the power to possess humans, mutating them into hideous creatures, as well as survive even if reduced to tiny pieces. They can also assume any shape they want, as they are amorphous in nature. However their one weakness lies in the fact that Getter Rays cause their overevolution, destroying them with enough exposure. Their most distinctive features are their many eyeballs and protruding spikes. Other * – Dr. Saotome's oldest daughter who was killed in a Getter combining accident involving Ryouma and Hayato. Dr. Saotome believes it was on purpose and holds an intense grudge against them, which starts the events of Armageddon. : * – A creepy and odd scientist with a deformed face, he is always beside Hayato and is extremely interested in Shin Dragon's evolution and Go. : * – An American Super Robot pilot in Hayato's army, he usually leads the attacks. It is implied his girlfriend was killed by Invaders in the past. He also has a hatred for the Japanese due to their hiding from the outside world, this causes him to dislike the new Getter Team. However he learns to respect the team after they save his life. He pilots the Stilva, which is a black humanoid robot capable of changing into a stealth fighter. : * – The Armageddon continuity's versions of Emperor Gore and Emperor Burai, the main antagonists from the original Getter Robo and Getter Robo G, respectively. In this setting they're cloned humans, made from Ryouma and Hayato's DNA and infused with Getter Rays, in order to control Shin Dragon. However, for unknown reasons became horrible monsters that rampage once awakened, eventually fusing into a giant monster (resembling Burai's Combined Hundred Oni Robot).

Burns for 35 years beginning in 1936. Biography Haynes was born near Knoxville, Tennessee on July 29, 1920. He met Kenneth Burns during a WNOX-AM audition in 1936 when they were both 16 years old. Haynes strummed the guitar and Burns played the mandolin. Known as Junior and Dude (pronounced \\"dood'-ee\\"), the duo was rechristened Homer and Jethro when WNOX Program Director Lowell Blanchard forgot their nicknames during a 1936 broadcast. In 1939 they became regulars on the Renfro Valley Barn Dance radio program. Haynes was drafted into the US Army and served in the medical corps in the Pacific. He reunited in Knoxville in 1945 with Burns, who had served in Europe. In 1947, the duo moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and were working at WLW-AM on the station's Midwestern Hayride. They signed with King Records, where they worked as a house band and recorded singles on their own, and two years later signed with RCA Records. The pair was fired along with several other stars by new management at WLW in 1948 and, after a brief tour, they moved to Springfield, Missouri and performed on KWTO- AM with Chet Atkins, the Carter Family and Slim Wilson.. In 1949 they moved to Chicago and appeared on National Barn Dance on WLS-AM; and later appeared on television programs including Ozark Jubilee, The Beverly Hillbillies, The Johnny Cash Show and The Tonight Show. The pair recorded more than 50 albums during their career and won a Grammy for the best comedy performance in 1959 for \\"The Battle of Kookamonga,\\" a parody of Johnny Horton's \\"Battle of New Orleans.\\" Haynes, who owned Fender Stratocaster serial number 0001, died on August 7, 1971 of a heart attack in Hammond, Indiana. He had lived the last decade of his life just across the state line in Lansing, Illinois, although his neighbors there were unaware of who he was, as he never talked about being a musician. He and Burns were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001 as Homer and Jethro. NotesReferences *Homer and Jethro biography at Britannica.com * *.

At the start of the game, one person is designated the 'hare' and everyone else in the group are the 'hounds'. The 'hare' starts off ahead of everyone else leaving behind themselves a trail of paper shreds (or chalk marks in an urban environment) which represents the scent of the hare. Just as scent is carried on the wind, so too are the bits of paper, sometimes making for a difficult game. After some designated time, the hounds must chase after the hare and attempt to catch them before they reach the ending point of the race. It is generally done over a long distance, but shorter courses can be set. If the hare makes it to the finish line, they get to choose the next hare, or to be the hare themselves. Similarly, the person who catches the hare gets to choose the next hare. History A game called \\"Hunt the Fox\\" or \\"Hunt the Hare\\" had been played in English schools at least since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare appears to make reference to it in Hamlet, when he eludes the guards at Elsinore he cries \\"Hide, fox, and all after\\". Around 1800 the game was organised at Shrewsbury School into an outdoor game called \\"the Hunt\\" or \\"the Hounds\\", to prepare the young gentlemen for their future pastime of fox hunting. The two runners making the trail with paper were called \\"foxes\\", those chasing them were called \\"hounds\\". Hare coursing rather than fox hunting was used as an analogy when the game spread to Bath School, so the trail-makers were called \\"hares\\". This term was made popular by the paper chase scene in Tom Brown's School Days and is still used in modern hashing and in club names like Thames Hare and Hounds, but Shrewsbury continues to use fox hunting terms as evidenced in The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler (see below) - \\"in this case the hare was a couple of boys who were called foxes\\". The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt is the oldest cross- country club in the world, with written records going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819. The club officers are the Huntsman, Senior and Junior Whips whilst the runners are Hounds, who start most races paired into \\"couples\\"; the winner of a race is said to \\"kill\\". The main inter- house cross-country races are still called the Junior and Senior Paperchase, although no paper is dropped and urban development means the historical course can no longer be followed. In 1938, British army officers started the Hash House Harriers in Kuala Lampur based on this game. Literary & cinema references Tom Brown's School Days by Thomas Hughes published in 1857 depicted a meet by the Big-Side Hare and Hounds. Students busily tore up old newspapers copybooks and magazines into small pieces to fill four large bags with the paper ‘scent’. Forty or fifty boys gathered and two good runners were chosen as hares who carried the bags and started across the fields laying the trail. When scent (paper) was located the member of the pack calls \\"Forward!\\" - hashers now call “ON! ON!”. Members of the pack worked together finding scent and straining to keep up. In chapter 39 of his semi-autobiographical novel The Way of All Flesh of 1903, Samuel Butler describes a school based on his alma mater of Shrewsbury. The main protagonist's favourite recreation is running with \\"the Hounds\\" so \\"a run of six or seven miles across country was no more than he was used to\\". In the book The Railway Children, written by Edith Nesbit in 1906, the children observe a game of paper chase. The book was made into a television series four times and into a movie twice, the most recent of which was in 2000. In the novel Daddy Long Legs, written in 1912 by Jean Webster, the girls play a game of paper chase where the hares cheat: they leave a paper trail indicating they entered a locked barn through a high window, while in actuality they went around the building. In by H.P. Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of Madness, first published in 1936, the narrator references the game when using paper to blaze a trail through an unexplored city: \\"Fortunately we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare specimen bag, and use on the ancient principle of hare and hounds for marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to penetrate.\\" In the 1946 Orson Welles movie, The Stranger, Rankin's students are in the midst of a paper chase through the woods as Rankin kills his former colleague. Rankin mis-directs the \\"hounds\\" to keep them from finding the body by moving the shreds of paper. In the 1954 memoir by Vyvyan Holland, Son of Oscar Wilde, he describes playing paper chase at Neuenheim College in Heidelberg, Germany in 1896. \\"[W]hen the river was frozen and the snow lay thick upon the ground, so that it was impossible either to row or to play football, paper chases were organised by the master in charge of games. No form of exercise is quite so utterly pointless and boring as a paper chase, and we used to try to slink off and get lost and find our way home by ourselves; though this, if discovered, was apt to lead to a painful interview with the games master.\\" In the 1975 Disney movie, One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing, the nannies notice a trail of paper scraps on the ground while trying to hide a dinosaur skeleton in a wood. They remark that it must be a paper chase at which point a group of school boys crash through the wood following the trail.

The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies. The nodes of a computer network may be classified by many means as personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or general purpose hosts. They are identified by hostnames and network addresses. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes, rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol. Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, for example, the transmission medium used to carry signals, bandwidth, communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network size, the topology, traffic control mechanism, and organizational intent. Computer networks support many applications and services, such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video, digital audio, shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications.  History  Computer networking may be considered a branch of computer science, computer engineering, and telecommunications, since it relies on the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines. Computer networking was influenced by a wide array of technology developments and historical milestones. * In the late 1950s, early networks of computers included the U.S. military radar system Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE). * In 1959, Christopher Strachey filed a patent application for time-sharing and John McCarthy initiated the first project to implement time-sharing of user programs at MIT.F. J. Corbató, et al., The Compatible Time-Sharing System A Programmer's Guide (MIT Press, 1963) . \\"Shortly after the first paper on time- shared computers by C. Strachey at the June 1959 UNESCO Information Processing conference, H. M. Teager and J. McCarthy at MIT delivered an unpublished paper \\"Time-shared Program Testing\\" at the August 1959 ACM Meeting.\\" Stratchey passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider at the inaugural UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris that year. McCarthy was instrumental in the creation of three of the earliest time-sharing systems (Compatible Time-Sharing System in 1961, BBN Time-Sharing System in 1962, and Dartmouth Time Sharing System in 1963). * In 1959, Anatolii Ivanovich Kitov proposed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union a detailed plan for the re-organisation of the control of the Soviet armed forces and of the Soviet economy on the basis of a network of computing centres, the OGAS. * In 1959, the MOS transistor was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs. It later became one of the basic building blocks and \\"work horses\\" of virtually any element of communications infrastructure. * In 1960, the commercial airline reservation system semi- automatic business research environment (SABRE) went online with two connected mainframes. * In 1963, J. C. R. Licklider sent a memorandum to office colleagues discussing the concept of the \\"Intergalactic Computer Network\\", a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer users. * Throughout the 1960s, Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently developed the concept of packet switching to transfer information between computers over a network. Davies pioneered the implementation of the concept with the NPL network, a local area network at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) using a line speed of 768 kbit/s. * In 1965, Western Electric introduced the first widely used telephone switch that implemented computer control in the switching fabric. * In 1969, the first four nodes of the ARPANET were connected using 50 kbit/s circuits between the University of California at Los Angeles, the Stanford Research Institute, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. In the 1970s, Leonard Kleinrock carried out mathematical work to model the performance of packet- switched networks, which underpinned the development of the ARPANET. His theoretical work on hierarchical routing in the late 1970s with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today. * In 1972, commercial services using X.25 were deployed, and later used as an underlying infrastructure for expanding TCP/IP networks. * In 1973, the French CYCLADES network was the first to make the hosts responsible for the reliable delivery of data, rather than this being a centralized service of the network itself. * In 1973, Robert Metcalfe wrote a formal memo at Xerox PARC describing Ethernet, a networking system that was based on the Aloha network, developed in the 1960s by Norman Abramson and colleagues at the University of Hawaii. In July 1976, Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs published their paper \\"Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks\\" and collaborated on several patents received in 1977 and 1978. * In 1974, Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine published the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specification, , coining the term Internet as a shorthand for internetworking.Cerf, Vinton; Dalal, Yogen; Sunshine, Carl (December 1974), , Specification of Internet Transmission Control Protocol * In 1976, John Murphy of Datapoint Corporation created ARCNET, a token-passing network first used to share storage devices. * In 1977, the first long-distance fiber network was deployed by GTE in Long Beach, California. * In 1977, Xerox Network Systems (XNS) was developed by Robert Metcalfe and Yogen Dalal at Xerox. * In 1979, Robert Metcalfe pursued making Ethernet an open standard. * In 1980, Ethernet was upgraded from the original 2.94 Mbit/s protocol to the 10 Mbit/s protocol, which was developed by Ron Crane, Bob Garner, Roy Ogus, and Yogen Dalal. *In 1995, the transmission speed capacity for Ethernet increased from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. By 1998, Ethernet supported transmission speeds of a Gigabit. Subsequently, higher speeds of up to 400 Gbit/s were added (). The scaling of Ethernet has been a contributing factor to its continued use. Use A computer network extends interpersonal communications by electronic means with various technologies, such as email, instant messaging, online chat, voice and video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks. Network packet Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. The physical link technologies of packet network typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message is fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message. Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between. With packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free. Network topology Common network topologies Network topology is the layout, pattern, or organizational hierarchy of the interconnection of network hosts, in contrast to their physical or geographic location. Typically, most diagrams describing networks are arranged by their topology. The network topology can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install. Common layouts are: * Bus network: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original Ethernet, called 10BASE5 and 10BASE2. This is still a common topology on the data link layer, although modern physical layer variants use point-to-point links instead. * Star network: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a Wireless LAN, where each wireless client connects to the central Wireless access point. * Ring network: each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) made use of such a topology. * Mesh network: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other. * Fully connected network: each node is connected to every other node in the network. * Tree network: nodes are arranged hierarchically. The physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with FDDI, the network topology is a ring, but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding. Overlay network A sample overlay network An overlay network is a virtual network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links. Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many peer-to-peer networks are overlay networks. They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet. Overlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using modems, before any data network existed. The most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the telephone network. Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. Address resolution and routing are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network. Another example of an overlay network is a distributed hash table, which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a map) indexed by keys. Overlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through quality of service guarantees to achieve higher-quality streaming media. Previous proposals such as IntServ, DiffServ, and IP Multicast have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all routers in the network. On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from Internet service providers. The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination. For example, Akamai Technologies manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of multicast). Academic research includes end system multicast, resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.  Network links  The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the physical medium) used to link devices to form a computer network include electrical cable, optical fiber, and free space. In the OSI model, the software to handle the media are defined at layers 1 and 2 — the physical layer and the data link layer. A widely adopted family that uses copper and fiber media in local area network (LAN) technology is collectively known as Ethernet. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by IEEE 802.3. Wireless LAN standards use radio waves, others use infrared signals as a transmission medium. Power line communication uses a building's power cabling to transmit data.  Wired technologies  Fiber optic cables are used to transmit light from one computer/network node to another The following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking. *Coaxial cable is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second. *ITU-T G.hn technology uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high- speed local area network. *Twisted pair cabling is used for wired Ethernet and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios. 2007 map showing submarine optical fiber telecommunication cables around the world. *An optical fiber is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and optical amplifiers. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense wave division multiplexing, optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for undersea cables to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, single-mode optical fiber (SMF) and multi-mode optical fiber (MMF). Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.  Wireless technologies  Computers are very often connected to networks using wireless links Network connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication. *Terrestrial microwave – Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately apart. *Communications satellites – Satellites also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals. *Cellular networks use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power transceiver. *Radio and spread spectrum technologies – Wireless LANs use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as Wi-Fi. *Free-space optical communication uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.  Exotic technologies  There have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media. * IP over Avian Carriers was a humorous April fool's Request for Comments, issued as . It was implemented in real life in 2001. * Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves, the Interplanetary Internet. Both cases have a large round-trip delay time, which gives slow two-way communication but doesn't prevent sending large amounts of information.  Network nodes  Apart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic system building blocks, such as network interface controllers (NICs), repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, modems, and firewalls. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.  Network interfaces  ATM network interface in the form of an accessory card. A lot of network interfaces are built-in. A network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that connects the computer to the network media and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry. In Ethernet networks, each network interface controller has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address—usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.  Repeaters and hubs  A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is retransmitted at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart. Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet 5-4-3 rule. An Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub. In addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a repeater hub assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern network switches.  Bridges  A network bridge opeates at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model and connects and filters traffic between two network segments to form a single network. This divides the network's collision domain but maintains a single broadcast domain. Network segmentation through bridging breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.  Switches  A network switch is a device that forwards and frames of data between ports based on the destination MAC address in each frame. A switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the ports involved in the communication whereas a hub forwards to all ports. A switch can be thought of as a multi-port bridge. A switch learns the association of physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination MAC is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and for cascading additional switches.  Routers  A typical home or small office router showing the ADSL telephone line and Ethernet network cable connections A router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing the addressing or routing information included in the packet. The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table. A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets.  Modems  Modems (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more carrier signals are modulated by the digital signal to produce an analog signal that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a digital subscriber line technology.  Firewalls  A firewall is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in cyber attacks.  Communication protocols  The TCP/IP model or Internet layering scheme and its relation to common protocols often layered on top of it. Message flows (A-B) in the presence of a router (R), red flows are effective communication paths, black paths are across the actual network links. A communication protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. In a protocol stack (also see the OSI model), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol layer below it, until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is HTTP (the World Wide Web protocol) running over TCP over IP (the Internet protocols) over IEEE 802.11 (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the wireless router and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web. Communication protocols have various characteristics. They may be connection-oriented or connectionless, they may use circuit mode or packet switching, and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing. There are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.  IEEE 802  IEEE 802 is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at levels 1 and 2 of the OSI model. For example, MAC bridging (IEEE 802.1D) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a Spanning Tree Protocol. IEEE 802.1Q describes VLANs, and IEEE 802.1X defines a port-based Network Access Control protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs) – it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \\"wireless access key\\". = Ethernet = Ethernet, sometimes simply called LAN, is a family of protocols used in wired LANs, described by a set of standards together called IEEE 802.3 published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. = Wireless LAN = Wireless LAN, also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the IEEE 802 protocol family for home users today. It is standardized by IEEE 802.11 and shares many properties with wired Ethernet.  Internet Protocol Suite  The Internet Protocol Suite, also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less as well as connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission at the Internet protocol (IP) level. At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability. The Internet Protocol Suite is the defining set of protocols for the Internet. Although many computers communicate via the Internet, it is actually a network of networks, as elaborated by Andrew Tannenbaum.Andrew S. Tannenbaum, Computer Networks, 4th Edition, Prentice Hall (2003)  SONET/SDH  Synchronous optical networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized multiplexing protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice encoded in PCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames.  Asynchronous Transfer Mode  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks. It uses asynchronous time-division multiplexing and encodes data into small, fixed-sized cells. This differs from other protocols such as the Internet Protocol Suite or Ethernet that use variable sized packets or frames. ATM has similarity with both circuit and packet switched networking. This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, low-latency content such as voice and video. ATM uses a connection- oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins. While the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of next-generation networks, it still plays a role in the last mile, which is the connection between an Internet service provider and the home user.For an interesting write-up of the technologies involved, including the deep stacking of communication protocols used, see.  Cellular standards  There are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), Digital AMPS (IS-136/TDMA), and Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN).  Geographic scale  Networks may be characterized by many properties or features, such as physical capacity, organizational purpose, user authorization, access rights, and others. Another distinct classification method is that of physical extent, or geographic scale. ;Nanoscale network A nanoscale communication network has key components implemented at the nanoscale including message carriers and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication. ;Personal area network A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among computer and different information technological devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters. A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN. ;Local area network A local area network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network is a node. Wired LANs are most likely based on Ethernet technology. Newer standards such as ITU-T G.hn also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines. The defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a wide area network (WAN), include higher data transfer rates, limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on leased lines to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other IEEE 802.3 LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to 100 Gbit/s, standardized by IEEE in 2010. Currently, 400 Gbit/s Ethernet is being developed. A LAN can be connected to a WAN using a router. ;Home area network A home area network (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable TV or digital subscriber line (DSL) provider. ;Storage area network A storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments. ;Campus area network A campus area network (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant, Cat5 cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.). For example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls. ;Backbone network A backbone network is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks. A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area. For example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone. When designing a network backbone, network performance and network congestion are critical factors to take into account. Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it. Another example of a backbone network is the Internet backbone, which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between wide area networks (WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks. ;Metropolitan area network A Metropolitan area network (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus. ;Wide area network A wide area network (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances. A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and air waves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the OSI reference model: the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer. ;Enterprise private network An enterprise private network is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources. ;Virtual private network A virtual private network (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features. VPN may have best-effort performance, or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point. ;Global area network A global area network (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial wireless LANs.  Organizational scope  Networks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the Internet, which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.  Intranet  An intranet is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity. The intranet uses the IP protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.  Extranet  An extranet is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization, but supports a limited connection to a specific external network. For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers. These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint. Network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.  Internetwork  An internetwork is the connection of multiple different types of computer networks to form a single computer network by layering on top of the different networking software and connecting them together using routers.  Internet  Partial map of the Internet, based on the January 15, 2005 data found on opte.org. Each line is drawn between two nodes, representing two IP addresses. The length of the lines are indicative of the delay between those two nodes. This graph represents less than 30% of the Class C networks reachable. The Internet is the largest example of an internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the Internet Protocol Suite. It is the successor of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) developed by DARPA of the United States Department of Defense. The Internet utilizes copper communications and the optical networking backbone to enable the World Wide Web (WWW), the Internet of Things, video transfer and a broad range of information services. Participants in the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet Protocol Suite and an addressing system (IP addresses) administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority and address registries. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the reachability of their address spaces through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.  Darknet  A darknet is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. A darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers — sometimes called \\"friends\\" (F2F) — using non-standard protocols and ports. Darknets are distinct from other distributed peer-to-peer networks as sharing is anonymous (that is, IP addresses are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.  Routing  Routing calculates good paths through a network for information to take. For example, from node 1 to node 6 the best routes are likely to be 1-8-7-6 or 1-8-10-6, as this has the thickest routes. Routing is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including circuit switching networks and packet switched networks. In packet-switched networks, routing directs packet forwarding (the transit of logically addressed network packets from their source toward their ultimate destination) through intermediate nodes. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or switches. General-purpose computers can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router's memory, is very important for efficient routing. There are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority): #Prefix- Length: where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent if it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol) #Metric: where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol) #Administrative distance: where a lower distance is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols) Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. Multipath routing techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths. Routing, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with bridging in its assumption that network addresses are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices. In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.  Network service  Network services are applications hosted by servers on a computer network, to provide some functionality for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate. The World Wide Web, E-mail,, \\"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\\", J. Klensin (October 2008) printing and network file sharing are examples of well-known network services. Network services such as DNS (Domain Name System) give names for IP and MAC addresses (people remember names like “nm.lan” better than numbers like “210.121.67.18”),, \\"Domain names – Implementation and Specification\\", P. Mockapetris (November 1987) and DHCP to ensure that the equipment on the network has a valid IP address. Services are usually based on a service protocol that defines the format and sequencing of messages between clients and servers of that network service.  Network performance = Bandwidth  Bandwidth in bit/s may refer to consumed bandwidth, corresponding to achieved throughput or goodput, i.e., the average rate of successful data transfer through a communication path. The throughput is affected by technologies such as bandwidth shaping, bandwidth management, bandwidth throttling, bandwidth cap, bandwidth allocation (for example bandwidth allocation protocol and dynamic bandwidth allocation), etc. A bit stream's bandwidth is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in hertz (the average spectral bandwidth of the analog signal representing the bit stream) during a studied time interval. Network delay Any data sent across a network requires time to travel from source to destination. Depending on the application, the one-way delay or the round-trip time can have a significant impact on performance.  Quality of service  Depending on the installation requirements, network performance is usually measured by the quality of service of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include throughput, jitter, bit error rate and latency. The following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit- switched network and one type of packet-switched network, viz. ATM: *Circuit- switched networks: In circuit switched networks, network performance is synonymous with the grade of service. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads. Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo. *ATM: In an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, quality of service (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.Telecommunications Magazine Online, Americas January 2003, Issue Highlights, Online Exclusive: Broadband Access Maximum Performance, Retrieved on February 13, 2005. There are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modelled instead of measured. For example, state transition diagrams are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.  Network congestion  Network congestion occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its quality of service. Typical effects include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections. A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in offered load lead either to only a small increase in network throughput, or to a reduction in network throughput. Network protocols that use aggressive retransmissions to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion—even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as congestive collapse. Modern networks use congestion control, congestion avoidance and traffic control techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include: exponential backoff in protocols such as 802.11's CSMA/CA and the original Ethernet, window reduction in TCP, and fair queueing in devices such as routers. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is 802.1p. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) Local area networking over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables). For the Internet, addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.  Network resilience  Network resilience is \\"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation.”  Security  Computer networks are also used by security hackers to deploy computer viruses or computer worms on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a denial-of-service attack.  Network security  Network security consists of provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources. Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority. Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals.  Network surveillance  Network surveillance is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the Internet. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency. Computer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity. Surveillance is very useful to governments and law enforcement to maintain social control, recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate criminal activity. With the advent of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program, technologies such as high-speed surveillance computers and biometrics software, and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens. However, many civil rights and privacy groups—such as Reporters Without Borders, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union—have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a mass surveillance society, with limited political and personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as Hepting v. AT&T.; The hacktivist group Anonymous has hacked into government websites in protest of what it considers \\"draconian surveillance\\".  End to end encryption  End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a digital communications paradigm of uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties. It involves the originating party encrypting data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as Internet providers or application service providers, from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both confidentiality and integrity. Examples of end-to-end encryption include HTTPS for web traffic, PGP for email, OTR for instant messaging, ZRTP for telephony, and TETRA for radio. Typical server-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between clients and servers, not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are Google Talk, Yahoo Messenger, Facebook, and Dropbox. Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering \\"end-to-end\\" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a back door that subverts negotiation of the encryption key between the communicating parties, for example Skype or Hushmail. The end- to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the technical exploitation of clients, poor quality random number generators, or key escrow. E2EE also does not address traffic analysis, which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.  SSL/TLS  The introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. Netscape took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was Netscape Navigator. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of CA root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.  Views of networks  Users and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running. A community of interest has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via peer-to-peer technologies. Network administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., routers, bridges and application layer gateways) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, subnets, map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using virtual LAN (VLAN) technology. Both users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an intranet is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees)., \\"BGP/MPLS VPNs\\", E. Rosen; Y. Rekhter (March 1999) Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection. An extranet is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers). Unofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by Internet Service Providers (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the Internet is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, that share the registered IP address space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the Border Gateway Protocol. Typically, the human-readable names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the Domain Name System (DNS). Over the Internet, there can be business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of communications security mechanism. Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology.

He slowly gained a strong cult following during the 1980s and 1990s, and in the early 2000s became active again. As of 2020, he has released fourteen full- length albums. Biography= Early life  Born on The North Side of Endicott, New York, Gary Wilson was one of four siblings, the others being Larry, David and Patti. The children kept several ducks as pets. His father worked for IBM during the day, and by night played stand-up bass in a lounge band whose act played the same hotel approximately four nights a week for 25 years. Gary was a self-taught musician, and musical prodigy, being proficient in guitar, bass, drums, piano and cello by the time he entered grade school. He has credited his earliest influences to be Fabian, Bobby Rydell and most of all Dion. His mother would curl the front of his hair for him every morning so that he could look like his teen heart-throb idols. At age 9, Gary Wilson joined his school band, playing stand-up bass. The following year, he wrote his first song. At 12, Wilson started acquiring tape machines and began recording songs in his parents' basement. Around this time, he became fascinated by The Beatles and rock and roll (he attended The Beatles' famous 1965 Shea Stadium concert). About a year later, he began playing keyboards in a band called Lourde Fuzz. They cut a single when he was only in eighth grade. The group even earned a spot on a bill opening for The 1910 Fruitgum Company. When the band's lead singer left, Wilson took over vocals and songwriting, but quickly proved to be too strange for the other members. In 1969, Wilson discovered the music of aleatoric composer John Cage. When sought out, Cage surprisingly invited the 14-year-old musician into his home to discuss and critique music for several days. Wilson was also given advice by the composer, such as if your music/performance \\"doesn't irritate people, you aren't doing your job.\\" This experience is deemed by many to be a significant event in Wilson's life, and his songs became increasingly experimental after this point. Wilson has also cited avant-garde composer David Tudor as a major influence during this time. Upon graduation from high school in 1970, he moved to New York City for several weeks, but quickly returned to his parents' home in Endicott, New York. Around this time, Wilson \\"fell right into\\" playing lounge music on the side, just as his father had.  You Think You Really Know Me  Gary Wilson went to Albert Grossman's Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York in 1976, a well-known recording studio that has played host to sessions by Bob Dylan, R.E.M., Patti Smith, The Rolling Stones and many other notable acts. There, Wilson recorded versions of \\"6.4 = Make Out\\", \\"Chromium Bitch\\", \\"Groovy Girls\\", and \\"I Want To Lose Control\\". He eventually decided that he would prefer to record at his familiar home studio and finished recording You Think You Really Know Me, his first album, in his parents' basement. On this recording, Wilson sometimes played solo and was other times accompanied by a backing band, The Blind Dates. He pressed, distributed, funded and released the album himself. Wilson pressed 300 copies in 1977 and a further 300 copies in 1979 (he now claims that he only has two original copies left in his personal possession from these pressings). In 1991, Cry Baby Records re-released the album, pressing about 1000 copies. His 1970s concert performances were cited as bizarre and outrageous, a \\"show that included cellophane, duct tape, bed sheets, fake blood, flour, and milk.\\"Interview with Gary Wilson So outlandish were the shows that often they would have their electricity cut in attempts to get them to leave the stage. After receiving a small amount of radio play, Wilson decided to try and pursue landing a record deal and moved west to California in 1978. There he recorded three singles, In the Midnight Hour/When I Spoke of Love (1978), Forgotten Lovers E.P. (1979) and Invasion of Privacy (1980). Although he did have some supporters (receiving fanmail during the period from the band The Residents), viable commercial success did not find Wilson. Rediscovery and documentary After a 1981 American tour, he retired from the experimental music scene and dropped off the public radar. Wilson then lapsed into obscurity until around 1996, when Beck was heard citing him as an influence in concerts, at award ceremonies, and on his album, Odelay. Beck also namechecked the musician in his hit single \\"Where It's At\\": \\"Passin' the dutchie from coast to coast/like my man Gary Wilson rocks the most.\\" Around the same time, he was cited by the people behind Sub Pop Records as a major influence on their company. In the early 2000s, Motel Records began a search to find the reclusive musician, but were unsuccessful (even after hiring a private detective). He was eventually found through contacting ex-band members. He was nearly 50 years old, working part-time at The Jolar Cinema adult theater, playing keyboard in a weekly jazz act called Donnie Finnell & Company East at the Rancho Bernardino Lounge and living with his girlfriend (an experimental artist who had studied at UCSD in the 1980s) in San Diego.Donnie Finnell He gave Motel Records his permission to repress You Think You Really Know Me, and also offered to play a handful of shows to promote the rerelease. On May 16, 2002 Gary Wilson returned to the stage after a 20-year absence, playing two shows at Joe's Pub in downtown Manhattan. A documentary about Wilson's career and his return to the public stage was filmed by Michael Wolk, titled You Think You Really Know Me: The Gary Wilson Story. The film recorded the musician's long and emotional train ride (due to his fear of flying) from the west coast back to his native New York for his first concert in decades. The film was screened at several theaters in 2005, and was released on home video by Plexifilm in June 2008. Wilson said attending the film's premier at the Lincoln Center in New York was \\"one of the highlights of my life.\\" Motel Records soon after put out Forgotten Lovers, a collection of singles, b-sides, rare and unreleased songs dating back to 1974. In 2004, Wilson released Mary Had Brown Hair on Stones Throw Records, his first album of original material in almost 30 years. In 2005 he played instruments and co-produced \\"Rain of Earth\\" as one of the 'Stones Throw Singers' on a tribute album to Bruce Haack titled Dimension Mix. In 2006, his website stated that a greatest hits album was in the works, supposedly to feature tracks from You Think You Really Know Me and Forgotten Lovers; however, no further plans for the album have been revealed and it may have been scrapped. Wilson continues to occasionally perform live, though usually in southern California, sometimes unannounced and typically unpromoted. He has not toured since his rebirth in popularity, apparently due to his dislike of traveling and aerophobia. According to Wilson's MySpace account, the musician resided in San Diego, California. As of mid 2008, his lounge act band was still together, playing their regular Friday and Saturday night slot at Bistro 221 in Escondido, as well as playing for- hire at special events and country clubs, covering songs by Nat King Cole, Lou Rawls, Wayne Newton, Johnny Mathis, etc. He also stated that he had recently come back in to email contact with the infamous \\"Linda\\" featured in many of his songs. Although they were able to resolve some old issues, the woman is now married and Wilson said of the situation, \\"I don't think it's cool to get between people.\\" 2000s–2010s In May 2008, Wilson's website announced that a new album, Lisa Wants To Talk To You, was in the works. The record was set to be released on Human Ear Music on August 15, 2008 but the release was delayed for unknown reasons until September 15. Western Vinyl released Gary Wilson's new album Electric Endicott in the fall of 2010.Blurt article: \\"New Gary Wilson Album .\\"Western Vinyl artist page: \\"Gary Wilson .\\" The album is available on CD, vinyl, and MP3. To promote his new album, Wilson performed on the October 27, 2010 episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon with members of the Roots acting as his backing band. In July 2011 Stones Throw Records released a direct-to-vinyl live recording from a performance earlier that year. Gary Wilson direct to disc LP, Video Wilson was slated in November 2011 to release a new digital album, \\"Feel the Beat,\\" on Tip Records, a music- business incubator created by rock critic Robert Duncan as an exploratory arm of Duncan/Channon True Story: Gary Wilson signs with Tip Records. A limited number of copies are to be released on CD and vinyl as well. In 2012, Wilson was featured on the song \\"Sweden\\" from rapper/producer Pyramid Vritra's album \\"Pyramid\\", Sweden (ft. Gary Wilson). and in 2013 he was featured on the song \\"Sandy Kissed Gary Wilson Last Night\\" from production duo They Hate Change's album \\"Today.\\" Sandy Kissed Gary Wilson Last Night. In May 2013, Wilson made his first appearance outside the US for a European tour with The Blind Dates of TX playing the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, UK, Belgium, and the Villette Sonique Festival in Paris.. Wilson and the TX Blind Dates returned abroad for a second European tour in 2014 where they played Czech Republic, Germany, France, Belgium, and headlined Sunday night at the OFF Fest in Katowice, Poland. The touring band consisted of Patrick Healy (percussion, vocals), Chef Pittman (drums), Sam Vandelinder (guitar, organ, synthesizer), Paul Millar (bass guitar, synthesizer), and T.W.Bond (keyboards). In 2014, Electric Six recorded a cover of \\"Gary's in the Park\\" as part of a pledge package for their Absolute Treasure Kickstarter campaign. The cover was subsequently released online. In January 2014, Wilson and long-time contemporary (also one-time art mail exchange colleague back in 1970's) R Stevie Moore finally received the chance to share the same stage for two nights in Brooklyn, NY. On January 24, 2014, both were invited as guest artists at Issue Project Room where R Stevie performed a solo set and Gary debuted a rarely performed piece titled \\"Gary Saw Linda Kissing John Cage\\". The performance piece paid much respect to WIlson's avant garde and cable access roots involving light arrangements of prerecorded Musique Conrete/electronic noise style samples, Wilson improvising on a baby grand piano, and the improvisational accompaniment of the TX Blind Dates Electronic Choir (Paul Millar, Chef Pittman, Sam Vandelinder, Patrick Healy, and T.W. Bond). In 2015, Wilson made a surprise guest appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! during a performance by Earl Sweatshirt and BadBadNotGood. Early that year, Earl sampled Wilson's song \\"You Were Too Good to Be True\\" on his song \\"Grief\\" from the album I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside.

An extended form begins further south in Seville and reaches north to the Bay of Biscay at Gijón. The path is used by the modern A-66 and AP-66 freeways, as well as by the older N-630 national road. Name The term Vía de la Plata is commonly thought to derive from the modern Spanish word for silver, plata. The name actually derives from the Arabic word al-balat, which means cobbled paving and described the road as engineered by the Romans.Antonio Migu Nogues-Pedregal, \\"When the Desirable and the Feasible Converge Through Tourism Space,\\" in Antonio Migu Nogues-Pedregal, ed., Culture and Society in Tourism Contexts (Emerald Group Publishing, 2012), 82, available online, accessed May 27, 2013 The Silver Route, despite its name, was never a road for the circulation of silver trade. Such denomination is due, as in other occasions, to a popular evolution due to a phonetic confusion. In the Andalusian period, this route was called al-Balat (the paved road), a word very frequent in other areas of Spain and the origin of place names such as Albalat and Albalate. It is possible that this pronunciation led people to transfer the sound to that of the precious metal, and that is why it began to be called the Via de la Plata on an indeterminate date, but before 1504 and 1507, when it was first documented with Christopher Columbus and Antonio de Nebrija, respectively. In the first it appears simply as the Plata and in the second in this form: > Est praeterea eiusdem Lusitanie via nobilissima: Argentea vulgo dicitur. > Quod Licinius pontifex primum stravit, deinde Traianus Caesar refecit, et > deinceps Aelius Pertinax aliiqui imperatores restituerunt, id quod ex > lapidibus intelligitur: quibus millia passuum distinguuntur. The path is from Emerita Augusta to Castra Caecilia Salmanticam usque, ubi primum in extima pontis parte incipit evanescere, neque ulterius ullum viae illius vestigium cernit. Another hypothesis about the name is that it could have come from a late via Delapidata, even though it poses some problems, such as the absence on this road of real silices or stones, i.e., cobblestones, which were not usual on non-urban roads.El tipo de zahorra o gravilla apisonada que remataba las calzadas no urbanas, tenía su propia denominación en latín: glareae. To solve this difficulty, a new hypothesis explains the meaning of the last via delapidata as \\"a road marked with milestones\\" (from the classical and medieval Latin lapis, \\"milestone\\"). Pre-Roman era The historical origin of this communication route is uncertain. During the protohistoric period, coinciding with the presence of the Tartessos culture in the south of the peninsula, there are reports of the existence of commercial contacts with the Hispanic west thanks to various archaeological discoveries, along a route known by some scholars as the \\"Via del Estaño\\", since it is assumed that a large part of this metal would circulate in the peninsula. In the following centuries it continued to be frequented, without its specific name being known, becoming, until the arrival of Rome, one of the main routes of communication of the Hispanic towns next to the so-called Via Heraclea, which ran through the whole of the Levant, from Cadiz to cross the Pyrenees. Vía de la Plata. ito nuevo en obra Puerto de los Castaños. Anverso Modern times The suitability of the route's layout is demonstrated even today. It is used by modern A-66 and AP-66 freeways as well as by older N-630 national road. Some stretches, however, pass through urban areas like Seville, where the Vía de la Plata runs along the Guadalquivir. The Vía de la Plata has become increasingly popular as an alternative to the French Way for pilgrims walking, cycling, or riding to Santiago de Compostela. Large sections are more or less the same as they were two thousand years ago.

His holdings were the smallest among the brothers (although William, the youngest, received no land and entered the church instead). Stephen and Theobald did homage to their older brother. In 1169, a delegation led by Archbishop Frederick de la Roche arrived in France to seek a husband for Sibylla, the daughter of King Amalric I of Jerusalem. Stephen accepted the offer and travelled east with Duke Hugh III of Burgundy in 1170. He brought with him the monies raised by King Louis VII's tax of 1166, which had been levied for four or five years. Stephen's account of how Louis raised the money may have influenced the general tax levied in Jerusalem in 1183.Benjamin Z. Kedar, \\"The General Tax of 1183 in the Crusading Kingdom of Jerusalem: Innovation or Adaptation?\\" The English Historical Review, vol. 89, no. 351 (1974), pp. 339–45. Since it was anticipated that Stephen might someday be king in right of his wife—Amalric's only son, Baldwin, was a leper—the Haute Cour of Jerusalem invited Stephen to decide the case of the division of the estate of the sonless Henry the Buffalo among his three daughters. Stephen divided it up equally, but ordered the younger two to do homage to the eldest. After several months in the Holy Land, Stephen refused to marry Sibylla and returned home. In Sancerre, Stephen built a six-towered castle on the local hill and strengthened the fortifications of the town of Sancerre itself. In 1153, he married the daughter of Godfrey of Donzy, named Adelaide, Alice, or Matilda. In 1155, he granted the Customs of Lorris to the merchants of the town and probably seven others. He was the de facto leader among a group of powerful baronial rebels against King Philip Augustus between 1181 and 1185. In 1184, he and a band of Brabançon mercenaries were defeated by the king and his Confrères de la Paix, an organisation of warriors formed in 1182 in Le Puy dedicated to curbing feudal warfare. In 1190, he commenced the abolition of serfdom in his domains, a trend in his family it seems, for his nephew Louis I of Blois did the same in 1196. Stephen and his brothers went to the Orient (his second time) on the Third Crusade in 1190. He died before 21 October 1190 at the Siege of Acre, and Theobald died there a few months later in January 1191. His son by Alice-Matilda, William I, succeeded him. NotesSources *Bernard Hamilton.

It was from his wife's cousin, Sir Watkin Williams- Wynn, that Gaskell bought in 1857 the site of Wenlock Priory, whose ruins he restored and whose Prior's Lodge he made into a family home. He died at 28 Norfolk Street, Park Lane, London on 5 February 1873, aged sixty-two, and was buried in the parish churchyard at Much Wenlock.

The film was directed by Zhang Yimou and, as in many of his films, stars Gong Li in the title role. The screenplay is an adaption of Chen Yuanbin's (陈源斌) novella The Wan Family's Lawsuit (万家诉讼). The film tells the story of a peasant woman, Qiu Ju, who lives in a rural area of China. When her husband is kicked in the groin by the village head, Qiu Ju, despite her pregnancy, travels to a nearby town, and later a big city to deal with its bureaucrats and find justice. The film was selected as the Chinese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 65th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The film was a hit at film festivals and won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival in 1992.  Plot  Qiu Ju is a peasant who lives in a small farming enclave with her husband Qinglai. She is in the final trimester of her pregnancy. One day while her husband is conversing to Wang Shantang, the head of the community, a miscommunication ensues. The leader feels insulted and beats Qinglai, kicking him so severely in the groin that he must see a doctor and be absent from work. Qiu Ju goes to the local police office and complains. The policeman makes the village chief pay 200 yuan to Qinglai. When Qiu Ju goes to the headman, he insultingly throws the 200 yuan notes onto the ground and refuses to apologize. Qiu Ju then goes to the provincial capital accompanied by her husbands' younger sister, Meizi. By luck the two women find lodging at a cheap hotel. The two women meet the district police chief and he promises them that their case will be reviewed. The new verdict from the district police is that this time the village headman must pay 250 yuan. He still refuses to apologize and so Qiu Ju goes back to the big city and finds a lawyer who takes the case and files suit under a new law. The case is judged by the court as having been correctly resolved by the district, and so the fine remains at 250 yuan. Qiu Ju is unhappy but all she can do is make yet another appeal to an even higher level of police investigation. As part of the suit, officials come to the village and Qiu Ju's husband is X-rayed at the local hospital. It's now the middle of winter, and Qiu Ju goes into labor. When sought for help, the headman, together with a group of local men, carries Qiu Ju to the hospital, where she gives birth safely to a healthy baby boy. A month later the whole village is invited to the \\"one-month party\\" for the baby. Qiu Ju and her husband invite the village chief too for his help in saving Qiu Ju's life. However, he doesn't come, and the new parents are worried that he has not accepted their attempt at burying the hatchet. This is proven to not be the case, as the local policeman shows up to tell Qiu Ju that the X-rays has revealed that her husband suffered a broken rib. As a result, the village chief has been arrested, and been sent to jail on a fifteen-day-term. Qiu Ju tries to stop the police from taking the headman away but never even sees them, and the movie ends with Qiu Ju looking anguished. Production The film was set in present-day China (1992) in northwest Shaanxi province (an area which the director would return to in his film The Road Home). Many of the street scenes in the cities were filmed with a hidden camera so the images are a sort of documentary of China during the time of Deng Xiaoping. As film critic Roger Ebert said \\"along the way we absorb more information about the lives of ordinary people in everyday China than in any other film I've seen.\\" Home media The Story of Qiu Ju has been released several times on DVD. In the United States, the first release on Region 1 DVD was by Columbia/TriStar Studio on July 20, 2000. More recently, the film was re-released by Sony Pictures Classics as part of their Zhang Yimou collection (which also included new versions of Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern) on March 28, 2006. Both versions include subtitles in English. An older VHS cassette version of the film was also released in the United States by Sony Pictures on January 17, 1995.

The role of Molehusband was played by Ian Gardiner. No copy of the film is known to still exist. Molehusband was depicted as the country's worst driver when it came to parallel-parking his Austin 1100 car. The film concluded with Reginald finally able to park the car successfully and so demonstrate the technique for the benefit of viewers. The script reads: :This is the story of Reginald Molehusband, married, two children, whose reverse parking was a public danger. People came from miles just to see it. Bets were laid on his performance. What he managed to miss at the back, he was sure to make up for at the front. Bus drivers and taxis changed their routes to avoid him. Until the day that Reginald Molehusband did it right. Not too close, far enough forward... come on Reggie... and reverse in slowly... come on.... and watching traffic... and park perfectly! Well done Reginald Molehusband, the safest parker in town. The name of Reginald Molehusband entered common parlance in the United Kingdom to refer to any inexpert or timid driver, and, \\"Well done, Reginald\\" became a humorous catchphrase uttered in mock congratulation to someone successfully completing a modest task. Because the original film was lost, a new version was made by the BBC in 2006, again starring Gardiner, who played Reginald in the original film.

Retrieved February 8, 2017) is an obligate, neogregarine protozoan parasite that infects monarch (Danaus plexippus) and queen (Danaus gilippus) butterflies. There are no other known hosts. The species was first discovered in Florida, around the late 1960s. Since then, it has been found in every monarch population examined to date, including monarchs sampled in North America, Hawaii, Australia, Cuba, and Central and South America. Dormant spores occur on the cuticles of butterflies, in between the butterfly's scales. They are small, brown or black objects about 1/100th the width of a butterfly scale. The only currently known way of treating the Ophryocystis parasite is by soaking the host's eggs in a light bleach solution, which kills the spores that are present on the eggs' surface. Life cycle Ophryocystis elektroscirrha is usually transmitted from females to their offspring when the females scatter spores on their egg chorions and surfaces of milkweed leaves, the host plant of monarchs and queens, during oviposition (egg laying). Male butterflies can also have O.e. disease, and will scatter the dormant spores onto Milkweed leaves as they fly around, and can scatter spores onto a female butterfly during mating.The female that has spores scattered onto her during mating does not have the disease, but now can scatter those dormant spores onto the eggs she lays or onto Milkweed leaves. Milkweeds contains toxins that partially protect monarch larvae. The spores are ingested by the larvae. After they enter a host's gut, the spores open and emerging sporozoites penetrate a larva's gut wall and migrate to its hypoderm (the layer of cells that secrete the larva's cuticle), where they undergo two phases of vegetative reproduction. After the caterpillar pupates, O. elektroscirrha starts reproducing sexually. Three days before adults emerge, developing parasite spores can be seen through their pupal integuments. The adult butterflies emerge covered with spores, mostly on their abdomens. Parasites do not continue to replicate on adult butterflies and spores must be eaten by larvae before they can cause new infections. Effects O. elektroscirrha is geographically widespread, and may have a long history of occurrence with monarch butterflies. Infection by O. elektroscirrha causes monarchs to have lower survival rates. O. elektroscirrha has negative effects on survival and fitness. This is more severe when larvae ingest a larger number of spores, and are infected at earlier instars. Statistically significant infection rates result in abnormal adult eclosion. High infection can result in smaller wingspans and lower weights. Mating success decreases with higher parasite loads though females that mate and lay eggs have a shorter lifespan but have no decrease in egg-laying. Spores are passed from female to caterpillar. Parasite levels vary between geographical populations ranging from 70% to 3%. This is not the case in laboratory rearing, where after a few generations, all individuals can be infected. Infection with this parasite results in culling. Migrating monarchs that are infected are less likely to complete the migration. Populations which migrate have lower parasite loads than those which are non-migratory. Infection rates The prevalence (proportion of butterflies infected) with O. elektroscirrha is highly variable and it varies inversely with host migration distances. Non-migratory populations can have an infection rate of up to 70%. 30% of the western migratory population are also infected. Less than 8% of monarchs from the eastern migratory population are heavily infected.

The word derives from the French raban, Dutch ra-band, from ra 'yard-beam' + band. Originally it was the rope that ties the sail to the yard, but soon came to mean a whip made of leather or tarred hemp, used to punish sailors (compare rope's end). Especially in Argentina, it is the traditional riding, fighting, and punishing whip of the gaucho (the Argentine, Uruguayan and Southern Brazilian cowboy). It consists of a rawhide wrapped wooden handle about long with a thong made of a wide rawhide strap a little longer than the handle. The handle is topped by a knob, and have a wrist strap. It can be embellished with gold and silver. Types The basic rebenque is composed of a rawhide covered wooden handle long, and differently from other riding whips, a rawhide strap about wide and a little longer than the handle. The strap can be double, sewn at the edges, and could have the point unsown, for making a slapper. It has a wrist strap at the top of the handle. The wide strap made the rebenque an instrument less severe on the horse than the European riding crop. As the gaucho was never far from the horse, the rebenque was always on him. When not in use, he made a knot with the strap and held the rebenque lazily by the wrist strap with the middle fingers of his hand, or hung it from the handle of his facón knife (as he used the large knife almost horizontally at his back, held by the belt or waistband, the handle protruded from his right side). The rebenque was used also for fighting, as a weapon by itself, when the fight did not merit a knife, or with the strap rolled on his left hand and the handle hanging, as a secondary weapon to the knife in his right hand. Of course, it was also used for domestic punishments, and for quasi-judicial chastisement (corporal punishments were outlawed in Argentina, at least in the books, from 1813 on, but the country was very large, sparsely populated and not totally under government control, not unlike the American West). A couple of lashes with the rebenque on the bare legs were widely used as a punishment for children, even in the urban areas. As an equestrian culture, not only the poor gauchos used the rebenque, and there were (and still are) elaborate versions, with silver knobs and ferrules for the ranch owners (estancieros) and prominent citizens, the cost of the Besides the common rebenque described above, there were several other types. *Rebenque de argolla (Spanish) (Argentina) is a short handled rebenque with a large ring (\\"argolla\\" in Spanish) for holding it. The strap is very wide and a little longer than the handle plus the ring. *Talero is a cheap rebenque, perhaps the original, with the wooden handle uncovered *Guacha (in Brazil mango) with a short and very thick handle of lightwood, and a very wide strap is used for breaking in horses. Being less severe and noisier than the regular rebenque, it can be generously used on the animal, scaring it without actual damage. *Work rebenque had a handle simply covered with the leather of a cow tail. *The arreador (literally \\"for herding\\"), also arriador, in Brazil also enchiqueirador or relhador, is originally the whip used to drive cattle. As a symbol of authority for prominent persons, a costly and elaborate baton version was used, as various staffs in other cultures. To its handle, about two feet long, when made as a symbol, of fine wood with silver or golden ferrules, topped by a carved silver or gold head in the form of an animal head, or other figure, as on walking canes, a round braided leather thong of about two to three feet was attached. The handle ended in a ferrule (also silver or gold) with a ring, to which the thong—was attached which had also a ring at its point, to which it was attached a short leather fall, with a total length between a yard and . *Cola de tatú (in Brazil, rabo- de-tatú), literally it means “armadillo tail” (but never made from that animal) is a short whip with the handle covered in a special braiding called “caracol” (snail), becoming a thin braided thong, finished by a short fall. *Chasquero (from the Quechua chasqui 'messenger') has a hollowed handle to hide letters, or a blade, like some gentlemen's walking canes. *Lagarto (literally \\"lizard\\"), for driving the horse teams in a coach, was just a long tapering braided leather whip, with handle nor fall, but could hurt very severely. *Polca (Córdoba province, Argentina) has a longer and thinner handle than the talero, sometimes made with a piece of iron, covered with a rawhide cow leather or braided thin rawhide strips *Rebenque de Argolla 'Ring Rebenque' has a large metal ring (in Spanish “argolla”) instead of the wrist strap. The strap used to be wider than in the common rebenque.

A calavera [plural: calaveras] (Spanish – for \\"skull\\") is a representation of a human skull. The term is most often applied to edible or decorative skulls made (usually by hand) from either sugar (called Alfeñiques) or clay that are used in the Mexican celebration of the Day of the Dead () and the Roman Catholic holiday All Souls' Day. Calavera can also refer to any artistic representations of skulls, such as the lithographs of José Guadalupe Posada. The most widely known calaveras are created with cane sugar and are decorated with items such as colored foil, icing, beads, and feathers. Traditional methods for producing calaveras have been in use since the 1630s. The skulls are created either for children or as offerings to be placed on altars known as ofrendas for the Día de Muertos, which has roots in the Aztec, Mayan, and Toltec cultural celebration of the Day of the Dead. The tradition of sugar skulls is for families to decorate their loved ones' ofrendas with both large and small handmade sugar skulls. Children who have died, represented by small sugar skulls, are celebrated on November 1. The larger sugar skulls represent the adults, whose celebration takes place on November 2. It is believed that the departed return home to enjoy the offering on the altar. In pre-Columbian times the images of skulls and skeletons were shown often in paintings, pottery, etc. representing rebirth into the next stage of life. During the 20th century a political caricaturist named José Guadalupe Posada became famous for making Calaveras as vain skeletons dressed in the clothing of the wealthy. The most famous one was Catrina, wearing a feathery hat, fancy shoes and a long dress. Catrina is considered to be the personification of The Day of the Dead. These skeletons are created from many materials such as wood, sugar paste varieties, types of nuts, chocolate, etc. When used as offerings, the name of the deceased is written across the forehead of the skull on colored foil. Production Traditional production methods have been in use since roughly the 15th century. The process involves using molds to cast the calaveras. Production can be a lengthy process: a craftsman will usually spend roughly four to six months producing the skulls for a season. Traditionally made sugar skulls are considered folk art and are not meant to be consumed. The production process is more focused on the aesthetic appeal of the skull than on the taste or food safety of the product. Furthermore, many calaveras feature inedible decorations, such as beads, feathers, and foil. Some skulls were formerly decorated with sombreros, although these designs have mostly disappeared since the 1970s. The calaveras are traditionally sold at outdoor market stalls beginning two weeks before the Day of the Dead. Other calaveras are produced to be edible. Most are cast as one piece from cane sugar, which can either be left unflavored or else flavored with vanilla. Some calaveras are also made from chocolate. The calaveras are typically colored with vegetable dyes. As with the more decorative calaveras, these will sometimes have names written on the foreheads, as well. Calaveras may be eaten, or kept for a few days and then thrown away. Clay skulls Clay toy variations of calaveras also resemble the shape of human skulls. These toys are often painted a metallic silver color, but they may also be found in colors such as white, black, and red. Beaded eyes of many colors may also be added for decoration. Literary calaveras Poetry written for the Day of the Dead are known as literary calaveras, and are intended to humorously criticize the living while reminding them of their mortality. Literary calaveras appeared during the second half of the 19th century, when drawings critical of important politicians began to be published in the press. Living personalities were depicted as skeletons exhibiting recognizable traits, making them easily identifiable. Additionally, drawings of dead personalities often contained text elements providing details of the deaths of various individuals.  Face painting  Sometimes known as \\"sugar skull\\" make-up, or Catrina make-up, facepainting a skull with ornate elements is a popular element of Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico. Its use as a Halloween costume has been criticised as cultural appropriation. File:Díademuertos2014 02.jpgGirl has face painted in Mexico City, celebrating Day of the Dead, 2014.

Gran Fury organized as an autonomous collective, describing themselves as a “...band of individuals united in anger and dedicated to exploiting the power of art to end the AIDS crisis.” The contribution of recycling historical images of homoerotic pleasure contributed to the pictorial landscape of the AIDS activist movement. By recycling the title of the Plymouth sedan used by New York Police Department, Richard Meyer writes “[i]nscribed within the group’s name...” references “...both a subjective experience (rage) and a tool of State power (police squad cars), to both an internal sensation and an external force.” Action, not art, was the aim of the collective. Producing posters and agitprop in alliance with ACT UP to accompany the larger group's demonstration, Adam Rolston and Douglas Crimp articulate how Gran Fury served as ACT UP's “unofficial propaganda ministry and guerrilla graphic designers.”  Methods  Gran Fury, Let Them Die in the Streets, 1990, enamel signage. Gran Fury's appropriation of “...commercial language for political ends became the hallmark of the artists involved.” By re-purposing, reframing and re- circulating images to underscore their political agenda, Gran Fury was able to reach a plurality of identities and communities. AIDS does not discriminate, so there was an urgency to circulate information about this disease to the masses. Gran Fury member Loring McAplin observed the collectives mass-market ambition to “...fight for attention as hard as Coca-Cola fights for attention.” Before social media, the collective's appropriation of mass-media language and use of various materials including: fliers, posters, stickers, T-shirts, billboards, photographs and postcards, simultaneously produced provocative, informative, stylish, political and satirical public projects. By placing “...political information into environments where people are less accustomed to finding it…” articulates member Avram Finkelstein, catches the viewer off guard, revealing a new vocabulary and a new perspective on the AIDS health crisis. In Heywood's “The Crime of Being Posi+ive,” a person can be charged under the HIV Assault Act regardless of whether or not he or she infected or intended to infect another with HIV. In 1989, nine states had AIDS/HIV criminal laws, but by 2013, 32 states had these types of laws in place. Some legislatures believe that these laws are outdated since there were so many misconceived notions in the 1980s and “there was a general belief that this was potentially an epidemic that was going to spread into the general population, that was sort of a guaranteed death sentence, that was extremely transmissible.” 2013, Heywood, Todd A., \\"The Crime of Being Posi+ive,\\" \\"Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost.\\" An example of a work that provokes curiosity is their public intervention project where they swapped copies of The New York Times in coin-operated dispensers with their own The New York Crimes which resembled “...The New York Times but was full of information relating to the AIDS crisis.” Selected works= \\"Let the Record Show\\"  In July 1987, William Olander (1950 - 1989), an ACTUP member and curator of the New Museum in New York City, invited ACTUP to make an installation in \\"...the window by the museum entrance on Broadway\\". A neon SILENCE=DEATH symbol crowned the display, with a pink triangle below. The pink triangle was appropriated from the Nazi marker for gay men imprisoned at death camps furthering the analogy between the AIDS crisis and the Holocaust. The neon piece became part of the New Museum's permanent collection, and the SILENCE = DEATH graphic was widely disseminated through T-shirts, wheatpastes, and other printed ephemera. The graphic was a reaction to a 1985 editorial in the New York Times written by William F. Buckley as well as the silence by the Reagan government. Entitled Let the Record Show the work featured cardboard silhouettes of six public figures—televangelist Jerry Falwell, columnist William F. Buckley Jr., US Senator Jesse Helms, Cory Servaas of the Presidential AIDS Commission, an anonymous surgeon, and President Ronald Reagan—posited as AIDS criminals and set against a mural-sized photograph of the Nuremberg trials. Concrete slabs positioned under each figure offered evidence of their crimes, from misrepresentations of AIDS to ignoring the issue altogether as in the case of Reagan's notorious public silence, in the form of personal quotes. One reacted, for example, to a 1986 New York Times editorial by notorious arch-conservative William Buckley, who proposed that all persons with AIDS “...should be tattooed in the upper forearm, to protect common-needle users, and on the buttocks, to protect the victimization of other homosexuals.”  \\"Kissing Doesn't Kill\\"  The first high-stakes opportunity for Gran Fury came as part of a public-art project called \\"Art Against AIDS/On the Road\\" in 1989. As part of the project, Gran Fury presented a poster showing 3 couples, of which one featured Gran Fury member Robert Vazquez-Pacheco. The couples were of varying races, sexual orientation, and genders, kissing below the line, \\"Kissing Doesn't Kill: Greed and Indifference Do.\\" Within a year, the poster was found on buses and subway platforms in San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Washington, DC. With the presentation of this piece, Gran Fury began to distance itself from ACT UP's general membership, eventually organizing themselves as a closed group. Venice Biennale In 1990, the group became notorious for its contribution to the Venice Biennale, a.k.a. the “Pope Piece”: “The artwork paired two billboard-sized panels: one coupled the image of the Pope John Paul II with a text about the church’s anti-safe-sex rhetoric; the other a two-foot-high erect penis with texts about women and condom use.” Typical of media indifference to the underlying issue, a May 28 New York Times report on the piece wrote \\"In fact, much of the talk about the Aperto among the hundreds of artists, curators, dealers and critics who have converged on this city during the last week has focused on two entries from the United States that have stirred interest more for their apparent capacity to shock than for anything else. Mr. Koons' entry is the first. The other, and for political reasons more important, is a set of posters by Gran Fury, a collective dedicated to issues involving AIDS. One poster features a photograph of the Pope flanked by a text condemning the Roman Catholic Church's policy toward sex and contraception. A week prior, Giovanni Carandente, the event's director of visual arts, said they considered excluding the poster. They told the Aperto's selection committee that they considered it to be blasphemous. Aggravating the problem was its proximity to a Gran Fury poster featuring a photograph of an erect penis (an image that would have caused more of a storm in the United States than a poster of the Pope). By Thursday, Mr. Carandente apparently reconsidered, and the posters were hanging at the Aperto. But on Saturday, the Vatican was reportedly deliberating about whether to ask the Italian Government to have the posters removed.\\" Sexism Rears Its Unprotected Head Installation Practicing Art/Activism Gran Fury purposefully intervened into public and advertising spaces to disrupt the flow of normal thoughts with their own agenda. Notably, most of their work was directly exhibited to the public outside of traditional art spaces through fliers, posters, and billboards. They often recycled their own images and texts to circulate their message beyond its initial viewers. The collective aimed to push various individuals such as Ronald Reagan, then New York Mayor Ed Koch, and John Cardinal O'Connor to address the AIDS pandemic in a more practical, open way, as well as to inform the public on the importance of safer sex and clean needles. When asked about their approach of their work, Gran Fury said: “We want the art world to recognize that collective direct action will bring an end to the AIDS crisis. . . . Whenever we can, we steer the art world projects into public spaces so that we can address audiences other than museum-going audiences or the readership of art magazines.” By the mid-1990s, Gran Fury found it hard to make simple works surrounding the AIDS pandemic, and started using more text - a necessity that made it hard for the group to relay messages as effectively as before. Gran Fury's final piece was entitled “Good Luck… Miss You, Gran Fury,” and was produced in 1995, a year before the death of member Mark Simpson. In the piece, presented at the New Museum, Gran Fury stated that the original agitprop art strategies they were using were ‘unable to communicate the complexities of AIDS issues'.  Participants  The 11 main members of Gran Fury:  Legacy  From January to March, 2012, the 80 WSE gallery at NYU presented the exhibition, Gran Fury: Read My Lips. The exhibition consisted of 15 pieces, most of which were re-created by Gran Fury from archival documentation. The show was accompanied by an 88-page catalogue, which was the first publication devoted to the group's production. Works in Gran Fury: Read My Lips. included, \\"Kissing Doesn't Kill,\\" \\"Welcome to America,\\" and \\"Women Don't Get Aids,\\" reproduced in large-scale mural formats. There were also projections of \\"Kissing Doesn't Kills\\" video public service announcements, and several give-aways including \\"Men use Condoms\\" stickers in an edition of 3000 and postcards from the \\"Read My Lips\\" series.

Early years Born Norma Larsen on a dairy farm in Shoshone County, Idaho, she grew up in Seattle, Washington after her father moved the family west when she was 2 years old. Her father was a violin teacher, and Zimmer had hoped to play that instrument until he told her that her hands were too small. She was offered a scholarship to Seattle University but chose to continue vocal studies. Zimmer was singing in a church choir when a guest artist suggested she travel to Los Angeles, California and audition for a musical group. When she turned 18, she did just that, singing with a succession of top vocal groups, including the Norman Luboff Choir and the Ken Darby Singers, among others. Radio Zimmer's radio network debut as a soloist came February 28, 1947, on Sparkle Time. At that time, she performed weekly on the program as a member of The Singers vocal group. She later became the soloist on Standard School. Television She appeared on most of the popular television variety shows during the 1950s. She landed a small singing part in the Bing Crosby movie Mr. Music (1950), and provided the singing voice for the White Rose in the Disney film Alice in Wonderland (1951). She worked as a studio singer and performed on Welk's 1956 Thanksgiving album. Lawrence Welk Show In 1959, the previous Champagne Lady Alice Lon left the show because of monetary and scheduling disagreements. Because of protests, Welk tried (and failed) to get Lon back. After a year of the show's trying out several different singers, Zimmer officially joined The Lawrence Welk Show as his Champagne Lady on New Year's Eve, 1960. Zimmer stayed on the show and traveled with Welk and the band on personal appearances for three years. As her two sons were growing up, Norma decided to leave show business to raise her children. Welk told her it was all right for her to quit the road tours, but he asked her to stay on the television show until he could find another singer. Each week, a new girl came on as a possible replacement, but Welk kept asking Zimmer to come back the following week. That went on for twenty years. As the show's Champagne Lady, Zimmer sang one solo and often a duet (usually with Jimmy Roberts); she frequently danced with Welk at the end of the show. Recordings Zimmer sang as lead soprano with the Norman Luboff Choir, Voices of Walter Schumann, Pete King Chorale, and the Ken Darby Singers. She also sang with a quartet, The Girlfriends, along with Betty Allan and others. They sang backup for Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Perry Como, and others. Their group sang backup for the famous Bing Crosby version of Irving Berlin's \\"White Christmas\\". Zimmer also recorded solo albums for Word Records. Christian music In 1972, Zimmer \\"traveled about 80,000 miles singing God's praises at religious concerts.\\" She sang with the Billy Graham Crusade and on the Hour of Power and was a soloist at a White House service during the Nixon Administration. In addition, Zimmer recorded a number of albums devoted to traditional Christian music. Other activities Zimmer painted as a hobby. She created more than 100 paintings, primarily portraits. In business matters, she and her husband owned the ski lodge at Kratka Ridge and had a mobile home park with more than 100 spaces. Death In 2011 Zimmer died at her home in Brea, California at the age of 87. She was survived by her two sons, Ron and Mark, as well as three grandchildren, from her 1944 marriage to Randy Zimmer.

He later was a co-founder of the Congregation of Our Lady of Sion, a religious congregation dedicated to the conversion of Jews to the Catholic faith.  Biography  He was born 1 May 1814 in Strasbourg, Alsace, France, the eleventh of the thirteen children born to Auguste Ratisbonne and his wife, Adelaide Cerfbeer,Notre Dame de Sion- Ein Kerem \\"History\\" members of the famed family of Jewish bankers. His father was the president of the Provincial Council of Alsace.Encyclopedia Judaica, Ratisbonne Brothers, Volume 13, pp.1570-1571, Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem, 1972 His mother died when he was 4 years old, but his natural charm drew his wider family to take charge of his upbringing. The family was assimilated into the secular society of France, but had a strong sense of social justice, with which value he was raised. An older brother, Théodor, converted to Catholicism in 1827 and went on to become a Catholic priest in 1830.  Religious conversion  After studying law in Paris, Alphonse joined the family bank and announced his engagement to his 16-year-old niece. In January 1842, with the postponement of the marriage due to the bride's age,Catholic Encyclopedia: Maria Alphonse Ratisbonne he traveled to Rome for a pleasure trip. On 20 January, he entered the Church of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte, where he experienced a vision of the Virgin Mary. Due to this experience, he was led to be converted to Catholicism. At his baptism, he added Marie (Mary) to his name to reflect the role he felt she had played in his life. Alphonse returned to Paris to proclaim his new-found faith to his fiancée, and invited her to share it with him. His niece tearfully rejected this. In June of that same year he entered the Society of Jesus and was ordained as a priest in 1848.  Missionary work  Marie-Alphonse Ratisbonne's tomb in Ein Karem After his own conversion, Théodor Ratisbonne had been drawn to work for the conversion of his fellow Jews to the Christian faith. This proposed ministry, also the inspiration of Alphonse, was blessed by Pope Gregory XVI in the course of a visit by Théodor Ratisbonne to Rome in 1842. Théodor then took up the suggestion made to him by Alphonse to establish a school for Jewish children in a Christian setting. At this time, two Jewish sisters came to him for spiritual advice, and eventually also converted to Christianity. They became the nucleus for the Congregation of Our Lady of Sion, founded in 1847.Sisters of Our Lady of Sion Australia, Philippines Province \\"Our History\\" In 1850 Alphonse became engaged in mission work among convicts in the prisons of Brest, but two years later he felt called to join his brother in this mission to their own people, writing that he > recognized that the will of God in my Conversion and in my vocation to the > priesthood obviously destined me to work for the salvation of Israel. With the authorization of the Jesuit Superior General, Jan Philipp Roothaan, and the blessing of Pope Pius IX,Mondésert, Claude, Les religieuses de Notre- Dame de Sion, Lyon, Lescuyer, 1956, p.21 Alphonse left the Society of Jesus to join his brother. The two brothers, with several other priests drawn to their mission, formed the male branch of the Congregation in 1852. Alphonse moved to Palestine in 1855 to open a convent for the Sisters of the congregation. He would spend the rest of his life there. In 1858 Ratisbonne established the Convent of Ecce Homo in the Old City of Jerusalem for the Sisters of Sion. In 1860, he built the Convent of St. John on a hilltop in Ein Karem, then a village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. In 1874, he founded the Ratisbonne Monastery for the priests of the congregation. (It is now a Salesian study center in Jerusalem's Rehavia neighborhood.) Ratisbonne died in Ein Karem on May 6, 1884 and is buried in the cemetery of the convent.

He was a member of the SS Division Leibstandarte before he became Adolf Hitler's personal adjutant. Günsche was taken prisoner by soldiers of the Red Army in Berlin on 2 May 1945. After being held in various prisons and labour camps in the USSR, he was released from Bautzen Penitentiary on 2 May 1956. Biography Otto Günsche was born in Jena in Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. After leaving secondary school at 16 he volunteered for the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and joined the Nazi Party on 1 July 1934. He first met Adolf Hitler in 1936. He was Hitler's SS adjutant from 1940 to 1941. From 1 January 1941 to 30 April 1942, he attended the SS officer's academy. He then had front-line combat service as a Panzer Grenadier company commander with the LSSAH. On 12 January 1943, Günsche became a personal adjutant for Hitler. From August 1943 to 5 February 1944, Günsche served on the Eastern Front and in France. In March 1944 he was again appointed a personal adjutant for Hitler. As a personal SS adjutant (Persönlicher Adjutant) to Hitler, Günsche was also a member of the Führerbegleitkommando which provided security protection for Hitler. During the war, one or two were always present with Hitler during the military situation conferences. He was present at the 20 July 1944 attempt to kill Hitler at the Wolf's Lair in Rastenburg. The bomb explosion burst Günsche's eardrums and caused him to receive a number of contusions. With the end of Nazi Germany imminent, Günsche was tasked by Hitler on 30 April 1945 with ensuring the cremation of his body after his death. That afternoon, he stood guard outside the room in the Führerbunker where Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Martin Bormann at his side. The two men entered the study with Günsche right behind them. Günsche then left the study and announced that Hitler was dead. Later, having ensured that the bodies were burnt using gasoline supplied by Hitler's chauffeur Erich Kempka, Günsche left the Führerbunker after midnight on 1 May. On 2 May 1945, Günsche was taken prisoner by Soviet Red Army troops that were encircling the city and flown to Moscow for sharp interrogation by the NKVD. Post-war and death He was imprisoned in Moscow and Bautzen in East Germany and released on 2 May 1956. During imprisonment, Günsche and Linge were primary sources for Operation Myth, the biography of Hitler which was prepared for Joseph Stalin. The dossier was edited by officers of the Soviet NKVD (later superseded by the MVD, separate from the agency of the KGB, formed in 1954). The report was received by Stalin on 30 December 1949. The report was published in book form in 2005 under the title: The Hitler Book: The Secret Dossier Prepared for Stalin from the Interrogations of Hitler's Personal Aides.

It was opened as a small lunch wagon in 1895 and was one of the first places in the U.S. to serve steak sandwiches. According to Louis' Lunch, the hamburger was created in 1900 in response to a customer's hurried request for a lunch to go. In 1917, Louis moved the business into a square-shaped brick building that had once been a tannery. In 1975, the restaurant was moved four blocks down to 263 Crown Street. Hamburgers cooked in the restaurant are made on the original cast iron vertical gas broilersen from 1898, and the toast is made in a 1929 Savory Appliance Radiant Gas Toaster. Lassen's restaurant is recognized in the Library of Congress as the origin of the hamburger, but other claimants and detractors exist. History Louis Lassen's lunch wagon, circa 1907–1916 Louis Lassen (1865 – March 20, 1935) was a \\"blacksmith by trade and preacher by vocation\\" and immigrated to New Haven from Denmark in 1886. He became a food peddler, selling butter and eggs from a wooden cart. He purchased a home at 45 Elliot Street and stored his cart in a shed in the backyard. In 1895, he began adding lunch items to his cart. A local businessman dashed into the small New Haven lunch wagon one day in 1900, and he pleaded for a lunch to go. According to the Lassen family, the customer exclaimed \\"Louie! I'm in a rush, slap a meatpuck between two planks and step on it!\\". Lassen placed his own blend of ground steak trimmings between two slices of toast and sent the gentleman on his way, so the story goes, with America's alleged first hamburger being served. In 1917, Lassen moved into a square brick building that had once been a tannery. Louis' Lunch was forced to move to make way for development in 1975, so it moved two blocks down to 263 Crown Street in New Haven. In the 1950s, Ken Lassen added cheese spread to the hamburger. The fourth generation of Lassens owns and operates Louis' Lunch today.  Operations  The Louis' Lunch menu consists of \\"The Burger,\\" potato salad, potato chips, and homemade pie. Louis' Lunch makes their hamburger sandwiches from ground steak made from a blend of five cuts of beef. The hamburgers are then flame broiled vertically. The hamburgers are prepared with cheese, tomato or onion, then served on two square pieces of toasted white bread.

The gridirons were made by Luigi Pieragostini and patented in 1938.https://aht.seriouseats.com/images/20080630LLflip.jpg A sharp cheese spread is used, as opposed to sliced cheese.

Hamburger claims  Cheeseburger (with onions and tomatoes) served at Louis' Lunch Many others claim to be the creator of the hamburger, including Charlie Nagreen, brothers Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, and Fletcher Davis.Sam Gazdziak (August 1, 2006). \\"Giving the BURGER its due: the hamburger's origins are somewhat shrouded in mystery, but there is no doubt as to its impact on American dining habits and culture.(Editorial).\\" The National Provisioner.

However, it gained national recognition at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when the New-York Tribune namelessly attributed the hamburger as \\"the innovation of a food vendor on the pike.\\" In 2000, the Library of Congress recognized Louis' Lunch as the creator of the hamburger after being backed by United States Representative Rosa L. DeLauro. The Library of Congress stated that Louis Lassen sold the first hamburger and steak sandwich in the U.S. in 1900.Louis' Lunch A Local Legacy. Library of Congress. Americaslibrary.gov. Retrieved on April 21, 2013.U.S. Library of Congress Folklife Center Local Legacies Project retrieved on April 13, 2009 Louis' Lunch A Local Legacy New York magazine states, \\"The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later,\\" noting also that this claim is subject to dispute. Detractors of the Louis' Lunch claim include Josh Ozersky, a food editor for New York Magazine. In Ozersky's book, The Hamburger: A History, Ozersky denies the claim based on the definition of a hamburger and told the New Haven Register, \\"If you say it can be on toast, you're essentially redefining the hamburger out of existence. The hamburger as the world knows it means a sandwich of ground beef on a bun.\\" However, Motz's Hamburger America notes that the hamburger bun did not exist in 1900 nor did so for another 20 years. Ozersky's book also notes earlier claimants and recognizes Walter Anderson for creating the modern hamburger. In 2006, a \\"mock trial\\" was held by the Hamburger Festival in Akron, Ohio. Louis' Lunch was noted to have taken the event seriously, in contrast to other representatives of other hamburger creator claimants. Renny Loisel, public relations director of the Greater New Haven Convention and Visitors Bureau, submitted an affidavit and letter from the New Haven Preservation Trust and noted that the Library of Congress recognizes Louis' Lunch for creating the first hamburger, but the evidence was denied. According to an internet poll, Louis' Lunch placed third and Loisel noted that despite the evidence it was more about theatrics than truth. An article from ABC News sums up the problems of identifying the origins of the hamburger by stating, \\"One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the spread of the burger happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went in an instant. And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country.\\"  Reception  The restaurant has been the subject of shows on \\"the Travel Channel, the Food Network, the History Channel and even Oprah.\\" On Travel Channel's Chowdown Countdown, Louis' Lunch was rated #1. Episode 10 of Burger Land, A Burger is Born, highlights the claim and history of Louis' Lunch. According to Raichlen's book, BBQ USA, patrons of Louis' Lunch include United States presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, Charles Lindbergh, and Artie Shaw. Food & Wine's website named Louis' Lunch as one of the \\"Best Burgers in the U.S.\\" Roadfood notes that it is an \\"essential stop on America's burger trail.\\" Critics of the restaurant hinge on its dislike of condiments, particularly ketchup. In episode 10 of Burger Land, the \\"no ketchup\\" sign is visible hanging in the restaurant and an informative caption pops up to read \\"Yale students who try to sneak in ketchup are asked to leave.\\" According to \\"American Food Roots,\\" signage and an exchange of stories confirms the policy. Tom Gilbert wrote, \\"Louis’ Lunch is a very friendly place as long as you get with the program, which always has been about serving quality beef and making sure that nothing ruins or upstages it. As Jeff [Lassen] will tell you, that means no puffy, sweet bun, no well-done meat and no ketchup...\\" Both Connecticut Museum Quest and American Food Roots note the strong presence for the restaurant's way and Menuism goes so far as to note it the #2 of \\"the 5 Least Welcome Places for Ketchup.\\" Even Esquire affirms, \\"You can get your hamburger sandwich topped with onions, tomato, and a squirt of Cheez-Wiz.

Gear has a younger brother Hosea Gear who plays wing for the Chiefs. In June 2007 Gear was signed by Guinness Premiership side Worcester Warriors. Gear was regarded as one of the most dangerous and clinical wingers in world rugby and carved up defenses in the Guinness Premiership during the 2008/09 campaign. He became one of the biggest signings in the club's long history after agreeing a three-year deal that kept him at Sixways until 2010. Gear started his Warriors career with four tries in a match on his full debut – equalling the competition record – as Warriors punished Gran Parma and he continued to rack up the tries. He scored one of the most memorable individual tries ever seen at Sixways Stadium with his solo stunner against Bucuresti and also scored a breathtaking one-handed effort against Harlequins at The Stoop. Despite being hit by a number of injuries towards the end of the campaign, Gear still finished the season with a staggering record of 12 tries in only 19 appearances for the club and vowing he would show his real form in the 2008/09 term. After Worcester Warriors got relegated after the 2009–2010 season, he signed with Japanese Top League team Kintetsu Liners in April 2010. International career Gear made his international debut on 10 July 2004 in a match against the Pacific Islanders, where he also scored a try. He went on to play in numerous matches against the British and Irish Lions in their 2005 tour of New Zealand. He scored his first All Blacks hat-trick against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in 2005. He also played in the 2006 Tri Nations. He won a Commonwealth Games gold medal when he was part of the New Zealand Sevens side and also has World Cup Sevens medals. In spite of appearances in the All Blacks in the 2007 season, Gear was omitted from the Rugby World Cup squad, announced on 22 July 2007. Doug Howlett was selected in his place. In all he scored 11 tries in 19 tests for the All Blacks including a hat trick against Wales at Cardiff and 2 against Scotland on the same tour.

It worked with Whitehall departments and public bodies to produce information campaigns on issues that affected the lives of British citizens, from health and education to benefits, rights and welfare. COI celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2006 with several events including a film season at the National Film Theatre and a poll to find Britain's favourite public information film on the BBC website. From 2010, governmental spending on marketing fell considerably. This was because of the Coalition Government's policy to support only essential campaigns.

He was best known to television audiences as part of The Lawrence Welk Show as a featured singer and pianist in Welk's orchestra. Born in Independence, Missouri and raised in Lebanon, Missouri, he joined the Welk band in 1948 when they were doing evening performances at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. His popularity was largely due to his basso profondo voice, renditions of \\"This Old House\\" and \\"Asleep In The Deep,\\" and his sense of humor. He also achieved success with songs like \\"Oh Happy Day\\" (Hooper's 1953 recording of the song with the Welk orchestra was a top-5 hit for the orchestra), \\"Ding Dong Daddy\\" and \\"Minnie the Mermaid\\", a duet sung with Jo Ann Castle. Plagued with health problems for years, he left the show on sick leave in 1969 due to a heart condition, occasionally filling in with the orchestra when one of the other keyboardists got sick during that time frame. He returned full-time for the first show of the 1973-74 season (the \\"Tribute to Disney\\" episode, singing \\"Oh Happy Day\\"). It drew a huge emotional standing ovation from the audience and cast. He left the show for the final time in 1980 when his health began to fail again. Three years later, he died of kidney failure. In recent years, Hooper received new interest because of a video tape-loop played before Howie Mandel's stand-up shows of his singing \\"Oh Happy Day\\" for 20 minutes.

It receives almost 300,000 visitors per year and has been called \\"no doubt the most important Catholic pilgrimage center in the United States.\\"Wroth, William H., \\"Santuario de Chimayo\\", New Mexico Office of the State Historian  Description  Front with acequia (irrigation ditch) The Santuario is on Juan Medina Drive in Chimayó. It is entered through a walled courtyard. Built of adobe with a bell tower on each side, the church is long and wide with walls more than 3 feet (about 1 m) thick. Includes photographs of the interior and exterior. Pointed caps on the towers and a metal pitched roof (blocking the clerestory) were added after 1917, probably in the 1920s. The \\"elegant\\" doors were carved by the 19th-century carpenter Pedro Domínguez. An unusual feature is two side-by-side rooms at the entrance forming a vestibule or narthex, once used for storage. The nave contains a crucifix representing Christ of Esquipulas, tall. Other notable folk-art decorations include five reredoses and a small sculpture of St. James the Great. A small room called el pocitoPocito is the Academic spelling; posito and pozito are also used. (the little well) contains a round pit, the source of \\"holy dirt\\" (tierra bendita) that is believed to have healing powers. An adjacent Prayer Room displays many ex-votos as well as photographs, discarded crutches, and other testimonials of those purportedly healed. History Interior In the early 19th Century, nineteen families lived in what was then called El Potrero de Chimayó (potrero means pasture). The land where the Santuario now stands belonged to Don Bernardo Abeyta, one of the first members of Los Hermanos de la Fraternidad Piadosa de Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno (the Penitentes) in the area. Also, he was probably devoted to the Christ of Esquipulas, a pilgrimage site in Guatemala where the clay is ascribed healing power. A nephew of Don Bernardo was christened Juan de Esquipulas in 1805. Bernardo Abeyta built a small chapel to the Christ of Esquipulas on the present site around 1810. On November 15, 1813, he wrote to Father Sebastián Álvarez, the parish priest of Santa Cruz de la Cañada, asking him to write to the Episcopal See of Durango for permission to build a bigger church in which the people of El Potrero could worship Jesus as he appeared at Esquipulas and could hear Mass. The next day, Fr. Álvarez wrote the letter, mentioning that cures were reported and many pilgrims were arriving. On February 8, 1814, Francisco Fernández Valentín, Vicar General of the Diocese of Durango, wrote back with permission. By 1816 the chapel was replaced by the present church. Abeyta's daughter, Carmen Abeyta de Chaves, inherited the property and kept it despite an attempt to force her to give it to the Church; a major source of her income was donations from pilgrims. Her daughter, María de los Ángeles Chaves, inherited it in turn and was the owner as of 1915. In 1929, when the owners were in financial trouble, Includes a photograph of a person taking dirt from the pocito. members of the newly formed Spanish Colonial Arts Society bought the property and donated it to the Archdiocese of Santa Fe. El Santuario de Chimayó was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.A National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination document should be available upon request from the National Park Service for this site, but it appears not to be available on-line from the NPS Focus search site. Current observances El Pocito room showing hole containing \\"holy dirt\\" Each year some 300,000 people from all over the world make pilgrimages to the Santuario de Chimayó during Holy Week, especially on Holy Thursday and Good Friday, some seeking blessings and some in fulfillment of a vow. Includes some advice to prospective pilgrims. Walking is traditional; some pilgrims walk from as far away as Albuquerque, about 90 miles (150 km). Many visitors to the church take a small amount of the \\"holy dirt\\", often in hopes of a miraculous cure for themselves or someone who could not make the trip. Formerly, at least, they often ate the dirt. (Likewise pilgrims to the original shrine of Esquipulas eat the supposedly curative clay found there.) Now seekers of cures more commonly rub themselves with the dirt or simply keep it. The Church replaces the dirt in the pocito from the nearby hillsides, sometimes more than once a day, for a total of about 25 or 30 tons a year. The Church takes no position on whether miracles have occurred at the Santuario. The feast of Our Lord of Esquipulas is celebrated on January 15 or on the Sunday nearest that date. The feast of St. James the Great (Santiago) is celebrated on the fourth weekend of July. Legends Some say that before the Spaniards arrived, a hot spring that then flowed near the site was sacred to the Tewa Indians for its healing powers. One version of the legend says that during Holy Week, Abeyta (or a friar) saw a light shining from the hillside and dug the crucifix up with his bare hands. He turned it over to Fr. Álvarez, who took it to the Santa Cruz church, but the crucifix mysteriously returned to the spot where Abeyta found it. After the third time this happened, Álvarez and Abeyta decided to build a chapel on the spot to house the crucifix. Another version says Abeyta was watching his sheep and contemplating his blessings, though he was sick, when a vision of his patron saint, San Esquipula [sic], beckoned to him. He went to the place where the saint had appeared and knelt; he was cured immediately. Other people also were cured there, and Abeyta built the chapel in thanks. Yet another version says that the crucifix had belonged to a priest from Esquipulas who accompanied the first Spanish settlers in Chimayó. He was killed by Indians and buried in Chimayó. A flood of the Santa Cruz River (a small tributary of the Rio Grande) in the spring of 1810 uncovered the body and the crucifix. People who remembered the priest dedicated the shrine to the Christ of Esquipulas. Skeptical reception In 2013, skeptical investigator Joe Nickell wrote that \\"claims made for holy dirt at Chimayó are unwarranted. Despite borrowed and contrived legends that the site is miraculous, the soil is actually an ordinary variety trucked in from elsewhere and merely blessed.\\"\\"Miracle Dirt of Chimayó\\". Skeptical Inquirer. Researcher Benjamin Radford reported finding little evidence to corroborate claims of miraculous cures in his 2014 book Mysterious New Mexico.

It opened in 1953 and closed in 2010, its functions being absorbed into Roma Mitchell Secondary College. History When Enfield High School opened in 1953 in its present site, but on the eastern boundary, it was the first high school in the northern suburbs. Until then the only options were Adelaide High and Nailsworth Technical School. Even though the school was at Gepps Cross, it was called Enfield High School because it was in the Enfield Council area. Students travelled from as far away as Virginia and Salisbury. These students came by train to Kilburn and then on to the school by bus or on foot. It has been said that some intrepid students came all the way on horseback and tied their horses up to the water troughs on the western side, where the main building once stood. Originally the school consisted of two brick buildings, toilets and shelter areas, and two 'temporary' portable wooden buildings. One of these contained the staff room, headmaster's office, sickroom, library, science laboratory and a canteen in the second unused science laboratory. The other building on the lower level contained four classrooms: each was painted in a different colour. The two wooden buildings, with new cladding, and one of the brick toilets which remained until the schools demolition. On the first day, 10 February, there were 95 students – 49 boys and 46 girls – and a staff of six. There were only three classes: 1A had only boys and 1B had only girls. Unusually for those times 1C was a mixed class. Boys and girls came together for subjects like Latin or French. The headmaster, Mr Pyne, had one senior master, Mr Frick, one senior mistress, Mrs Peart, and four other teachers. The school expected enough students to stay at school to make one Year 10 class in 1955: all the rest would have left for work. But in fact 48 students sat for the Intermediate Examination. Of these, 44 were original students.  Fire  In the early hours of Friday morning (approx 3.20am) on 24 March 2017, the majority of the former Enfield High site was destroyed by Fire. Smoke erupted from the top level of the vacated school that was due to be demolished the following week to make way for a new housing development. Fire fighting efforts were hampered by corrugated metal sheeting secured to the structure resulting in a fire visible from the Adelaide metropolitan area and requiring approximately 60 Fire Fighters in attendance. The remaining structures were demolished later that year and the former site is now occupied by residential development.

Early life and career Kamm is the son of translator Anthea Bell and publisher Antony Kamm. Kamm is the grandson of Adrian Bell and nephew of Martin Bell. While his mother was not Jewish, he lost family members on his father's side in the Holocaust. After attending Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys, he studied PPE at New College, Oxford and Birkbeck College, University of London. He began his career at the Bank of England and worked in the securities industry and investment banking. Career Kamm joined the Times staff in 2008. He has also contributed to The Jewish Chronicle, for which he writes regularly, Prospect magazine, and The Guardian.. Views Kamm was a consistent supporter of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the foreign policies of his government. According to John Lloyd in 2005, Kamm viewed Blair's policies \\"as the expression of true social-democratic values\\". At its launch in 2005, Kamm subscribed to the founding principles of the Henry Jackson Society and was an initial signatory. In 2006 Oliver Kamm wrote a blog post titled \\"The Islamphobia Scam\\" in which he said \\"if any reader wishes to nominate me [for an \\"Islamophobia\\" award] and I am successful, you can be sure I'll turn up to collect the award and express my reasons for pride in it. He states that he is a friend and admirer of Israel ‘whose pluralist ethos will be fulfilled when there is an eventual two- state solution with a sovereign Palestine’. Kamm was an opponent of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. He told Liam Hoare writing for The Forward magazine in September 2015, that \\"the left has incorporated the attitudes of the nativist far-right. Corbyn's alliances with reactionary, misogynistic, theocratic, and anti-Semitic movements bear out what we’ve said\\". Commentator Peter Wilby asserted that, while Kamm and Stephen Pollard of the Jewish Chronicle claim \\"to be left-wing\\", they hold \\"no discernible left-wing views\\". When interviewed by politics academic Norman Geras in 2003, Kamm said that he wrote to \\"express a militant liberalism that I feel ought to be part of public debate but which isn't often articulated, or at least not where I can find it, in the communications media that I read or listen to\\" and that he felt that \\"the crucial distinction in politics is not between Left and Right, as I had once tribally thought, but between the defenders and the enemies of an open society.\\" Books Kamm has written two books. In Anti- Totalitarianism, he argued that military intervention against totalitarian regimes to support democratic values in other countries, can be expression of left wing values; he supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq under this rubric and seemed to focus his argument against foreign policies stances based narrowly on the national interest that are typical of the traditional right. On his book on usage, Accidence Will Happen, he argued against linguistic prescription and in favour of linguistic description. In August 2018, The Bookseller reported on Kamm's new book In Mending the Mind: The Art and Science of Treating Clinical Depression, in which he \\"draws on his own experience of the illness as a jumping off point to investigate depression\\" and \\"makes a case for embracing both art and science to better understand and treat the condition.\\" Bibliography * * References Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Alumni of Birkbeck, University of London Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford Category:British bloggers Category:British male journalists Category:The Times people Category:Labour Party (UK) people Category:Male bloggers ","title":"Oliver Kamm"},{"id":"4122905","text":"The Smart Roadster (W452) is a two-door, two-seater sports car (S-segment in Europe) first introduced in 2003 by Smart GmbH. Sales of the Roadster and Roadster Coupé met expectations, however, warranty claims resulted in a halt of production of both models in November 2005 after 43,091 Roadsters were made. The last one built now resides in the Mercedes-Benz Museum.  History  At the 1998 Paris Motor Show, the two-seat, 2.5 m (98 in)-long Smart City- Coupe (later named Smart Fortwo) was launched. This was the beginning of a new car brand and one of the more radical vehicle concepts to hit the European market since the bubble cars of the 1950s. It was also the beginning of a difficult period for Smart. The City Coupe had stability problems that were discovered only immediately prior to launch. These forced a package of alterations to be made that were both expensive and compromised the car's handling, ride, and gear shift. Public concerns over the car's stability, combined with Smart's elitist marketing and the sheer radicality of the car's design, proved damaging to initial sales. Production projections were slashed from 200,000 per year to 80,000, close to disastrous for a new brand with just one product. Inside the company, the evangelical buzz surrounding the launch of the radical City-Coupe quickly evaporated. With new management, new marketing initiatives, and continuing revisions to the car's engineering to answer public concerns, future vehicle plans, including the development of a four-seat model, had not been far advanced.  Design and development  Roadster rear Under design director Jens Manske in autumn 1998, Smart's 14 person design and engineering team began to sketch possible future Smart cars. They soon realised that the powertrain of the City-Coupe was ideal for a small sports car, with a compact turbo engine driving the rear wheels via a 6-speed automated manual gearbox. Following Smart's ‘reduce to the max’ philosophy and general innovative approach, a concept for a super compact, practical, and pure sports car was generated. Two quarter-scale exterior and two quarter- scale interior models were made in February 1999 with Volker Leutz's exterior and Christoph Machinek's interior proposals selected for development into full-size development models. The design of the car had progressed considerably by the time Michael Mauer officially arrived from Mercedes-Benz's Japan design centre to take over Menske's position in May 1999. Mauer worked closely with the design team to quickly develop the roadster, with the intention now of producing a show car for the upcoming 1999 IAA motor show in Frankfurt. By June the full-size models of the roadster were handed over to Stola in Italy for production of the show car model, which was produced in about three months for the car's debut at the Frankfurt show. The Roadster concept was well received at Frankfurt and helped to convince management that the car should be developed for production. At the same time, a decision was made to develop Mauer's idea for a coupe version as a concept car for the Paris motor show a year later. As the development of the coupe concept began, so the roadster show car was developed over the following year with both exterior and interior designs completed by November 2000. However, colour and trim design continued until a year later. By early 2000, the Smart City-Coupe had finally started to gain sales momentum, with its Cabrio version making a significant addition to total Smart sales. In March Mauer left Smart for Saab, succeeded by Hartmut Sinkwitz in May. As the third design director of Smart during the Roadster's development, Sinkwitz had to bring the concept to production in a very short time. This task may have been made somewhat easier by the Roadster having been designed from the start to use existing powertrain and other City-Coupe components. Given some of the advanced design features, it is a credit to the design team that so much of the concept car made it to production.  Concept car  The ‘Roadster Coupe’ as shown at the 2000 Paris Motor Show was already on its way to production form. It shared the design of the Roadster from the doors forward but had a glass Targa roof and rear structure resembling a small shooting-brake in the same way as the BMW Z3 coupe and the Saab 9X concept car developed under Mauer at Saab a few years later. Production versions of both Roadster and Roadster Coupe debuted together at the 2002 Paris Motor Show and were available to buy within a few months. Both cars were unique in the market, being significantly smaller than the Toyota MR2, MG TF, Fiat Barchetta and Mazda MX-5, but offering similar performance and practicality to the base versions of these cars while being significantly more fuel-efficient, albeit at a similar price point.  Production  Interior Smart Roadster. A Smart Roadster Coupé convertible. The Smart Roadster and Roadster Coupé were introduced in 2003, based on a stretched platform of the Fortwo with a full length of 3427 mm. The two variants are meant to be reminiscent of the British roadster of yore, such as the Triumph Spitfire or the MG B. Both the Roadster and Roadster Coupé are available with a removable Targa roof or an electrical softtop. The Roadster is powered by 45 or 60 kW (61 or 82 PS) versions of the turbocharged 698cc 3-cylinder Suprex engine in the rear, which is engineered by Mercedes-Benz. The Roadster Coupé has only the more powerful engine. A steering wheel with Formula 1-style paddle-shifters, to control the single-clutch automated manual transmission, is optional. Weighing as little as , the Roadster is intended to provide the emotion of driving a sports car at an affordable cost. Both the Roadster and Roadster Coupé are available in Brabus-tuned versions with power increased to . The Brabus versions have a different twin sports exhaust, lower suspension, polished six-spoke aluminum alloy Monoblock VI 17\\" wheels (205/40 ZR17 at the front and 225/35 ZR17 at the rear), front spoiler, side skirts and radiator grille. Exclusive Brabus (Xclusive) interior includes a leather- trimmed dashboard, alloy-effect accent parts, instrument graphics, leather/aluminium gearshift with Brabus labelled starter button, aluminium handbrake handle (which fouls the central armrest), aluminium pedals and Brabus labeled floor mats. The Brabus version also features stronger clamping of the clutch plates and a faster gearchange. The Monoblock wheels are known to be very soft and as a result, are very easy to buckle. The lacquer on these wheels is also very poor, and corrosion can occur very early in the life of the wheel. Despite a projected break-even of only 8-10,000 units per year, first-year sales almost doubled this estimate. However, some Smart Roadsters leaked and production ceased due to the warranty work and other costs reaching an average of €3000 per vehicle. While a critical success, the Smart Roadster was, due to these costs, an economic failure for the company. Influential British motoring television show and magazine Top Gear praised the Roadster, awarding it Fun Car Of The Year for 2005. 43,091 Roadsters were built and put on the shop fronts, with chassis numbers ranging from 00,001 to around 43,400.  Brabus V6 Bi-Turbo prototypes  Smart Roadster Coupe Brabus. Brabus Coupe, rear In 2003, German tuninghouse Brabus created a prototype version of the Roadster Coupé with two merged 3-cylinder engines to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Solituderennen. This V6 bi-turbo powerplant had a maximum power of for a weight of only , giving it the same power-to-weight ratio as a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S. Smart claimed the car could accelerate to in under five seconds. Since the twin-turbo V6 engine occupies almost twice as much space as their 3-cylinder engines, the fuel tank had to be relocated to the nose of the car, where a luggage compartment used to be. It comes in the form of a Formula 1-type foam-rubber fuel bladder. The bigger engine also forced a change from separate coil springs and dampers to concentric units to support the de Dion rear suspension. Ten cars were built and presented at the Castle Solitude. They are not available for sale and are not even allowed to be driven on public roads in Germany. Some of Mercedes' race drivers, like Markus Winkelhock, drove guests around the event's race track.  Special editions  Smart Roadster Collector's Edition.Smart Roadster Collector's Edition. In March 2006 Smart unveiled the final variant of the Roadster at the Geneva Motor Show: a limited collector's edition. It was based on the top model Brabus Xclusive with and came with a satin brown-metallic paint job. The interior had brown leather and higher quality materials were used extensively. It had the new Runline aluminium wheels and Brabus exhaust, front spoiler, and side fenders. Of 50 planned cars only 30 were made. A limited-edition Roadster Coupe Racing edition (RCR) was released in 2005 in the UK. Only 50 in the world were made and featured all the Brabus trimmings plus special black Alcantara and leather seats with red diamond pattern stitching. The seats were not heated as they are in the main Brabus model. The black Alcantara and red stitching also featured on the dash and door panels. Interior door handles and clock surrounds were finished in red to match the exterior paintwork. Each comes with a numbered plaque on the glovebox - stating the build number - RCR UK #/50. These cars were finished in Ferrari Red with matching light surrounds and bumper sections, the Tridion safety cell being all silver. They were made to look like the V6 bi-turbo and came with a free optional SB2 power upgrade kit for the engine, which raised the standard to . The reason they were not fitted with the engine is that the cars came off the production line in 2004 as normal engined roadsters before being given the Brabus makeover. The SB2 upgrade was optional to allow customers the option for lower insurance and road tax/CO2 emissions. So some RCRs did not have the SB2 upgrade carried out when new. There were 50 right-hand drive cars (RCR 90) built especially for the UK with the SB2 kit and . Additionally, BRABUS built 7 left-handed cars (RCR 90) for the rest of Europe and only 12 cars of the RCR 101 were altogether built left-handed by BRABUS with the real BRABUS 101 HP engine. One prototype and 11 numbered cars. Bluewave: It seems customers could not wait for the Brabus model to come along, so Smart released this version in the UK. Effectively it has all the parts of the later released Brabus model but without the Brabus engine and without the Brabus suspension. Smart later upset those who purchased the Bluewave by releasing the Brabus for the same price with those extra items. Some Bluewave owners were given the choice of having their car purchased back or a free SB2 upgrade. An additional, UK and Sweden- only 'Finale Edition' was unveiled in April 2006. This model came in a variety of colour combinations, including an exclusive speed silver and black Tridion with 17-inch Runline alloys and 'flow silver' interior components. It also featured leather door and cockpit trim and central armrest.  Project Kimber  In 2006, David James initiated Project Kimber, an attempt to restart production of the Smart Roadster in the United Kingdom. Initially intended to be rebadged as an MG model, after an unsuccessful bid for the MG marque, the revised Roadster was later referred to as the AC Ace. However, as of 2013, the project appears to be dormant.  Knight and Day  In the 2010 movie Knight and Day, the Smart Roadster appears in the final chase scene. These vehicles were retrofitted with an engine from a Suzuki GSX-R motorcycle to improve power and throttle response, which was accomplished with a kit made by British company \\"Smartuki\\". Three of the cars were bike-powered, and three more had conventionally tuned 698cc 3 cylinder engines featuring ECU remap, cold air intake/filter, performance exhaust, stiffer engine mounts, improved brakes, and lowered suspension by a Smart specialist in Hampshire, England.

Murphey is an author. Producer At the age of 23 she became a producer for the BBC World Service, producing the current affairs program 24 Hours and the magazine program, Outlook. A year later, she moved over to BBC Radio 4 and was appointed a producer to their flagship news and current events program, The World At One. During her five-year tenure there, she rose to the position of program editor, specializing in the inner workings of Great Britain’s Labour Party and in the coverage of the United States. In 1982, she joined BBC1 Television as a news and current affairs producer, working on the daily evening news program, Nationwide, and then on the team who developed Britain’s first-ever morning show, Breakfast Time. In 1984, Murphey was invited by ITV to establish their American news operation for Good Morning Britain, the then-sister program to Good Morning America. She moved to New York City in 1985, where she met her husband, photographer Greg Murphey, a year later. The couple moved to Chicago, Illinois at the end of her contract. Murphey continued to work as a British journalist, writing investigative features for the London Observer, the Daily Mail and IPC Magazines. She also served as contributing editor on The Chicago Times Magazine and was published in The Utne Reader. Writer In 1991, she moved to Brown County, Indiana, where she wrote her first book, Bean Blossom Dreams - A City Family’s Search for a Simple Country Life, which was published by William Morrow in 1994. The book received national acclaim and, a year later, she was selected to write the first work of original fiction ever commissioned by Hallmark and Better Homes and Gardens, who published her short story, \\"Emma’s Christmas Wish,\\" in 1996. Indiana University Press will be publishing an updated edition of Bean Blossom Dreams in Spring 2008. Two years later, Putnam Berkley published The Zen of Food - a Philosophy of Nourishment, a collection of essays which uses our attitudes to food as a metaphor for our attitudes to life. Murphey’s work, The Metcalfe Family Album - Six Generations of Traditions and Memories, was published by Chronicle Books in 1999. Nominally a work of fiction in which six generations of women from the same family keep a record of their lives, it is tightly tied to American & Indiana history from 1835 to 1996. Ms Murphey has appeared on Oprah, Good Morning America, and National Public Radio.

Highway extends from Cordova along the old railbed of the Copper River and Northwestern Railway. Construction began in 1945, and was originally intended to link Cordova with the state highway system at Chitina. The Million Dollar Bridge, which had carried trains until the CR&NW; shut down, was converted for highway use. It is one of two discontinuous segments of Alaska Route 10. The road extended only slightly beyond the bridge when the Good Friday earthquake of 1964 halted construction and severely damaged the Million Dollar Bridge, collapsing the north span. Temporary repairs were made, and the bridge continued to be used. Permanent repairs were not completed until 2005. The first of the highway is paved; the rest is gravel. A primitive four-wheel-drive road continues for beyond the end of the highway to the Allen River. The highway past mile 36 has been de facto abandoned since 2011 due to erosion of the approach to Bridge 339. Route description The Copper River Highway begins at the Alaska Marine Highway ferry terminal in Cordova. From there, the highway proceeds through central Cordova, intersecting several small roads and passing residential and commercial buildings. The road exits Cordova, and passes the large Eyak Lake, proceeding to the Merle K. (Mudhole) Smith Airport. The highway proceeds through Chugach National Forest, and passes over the Copper River, and several small sloughs. The roadway continues north, passing through several miles of Chugach National Forest, before reaching the Million Dollar Bridge, the highway's northern terminus.

It is commonly known as the common spadefoot, garlic toad, the common spadefoot toad and the European common spadefoot. The common spadefoot grows to a length of approximately for males and for females. The skin colouration varies depending upon habitat, gender and region, but is usually light-grey to beige-brown on the dorsal surface. The skin is mottled by darker marks that differ between individuals. The belly is white, sometimes with grey mottling. Albino specimens have been observed. Two subspecies are traditionally recognised: Pelobates fuscus fuscus (from central Europe) and Pelobates fuscus insubricus (from Northern Italy). In reality there is no physical or behavioural character allowing to distinguish these supposed subspecies. A recent study showed that there is no haplotype segregation for the populations of Northern Italy, that, therefore, are not to be ascribed to a different subspecies. Haplotypes from some Northern Italian valleys are very characteristic and support a different conception in terms of conservation: not for a different taxonomic position but, instead, for a peculiar differentiation. Populations from eastern Europe appear sufficiently different that they may warrant a separate species status (Pelobates vespertinus). When alarmed, it emits a very loud call (alarm call) and it can exude a noxious secretion which smells like garlic, hence the common name \\"garlic toad\\". Locations Pelobates fuscus are seen in the Posavina region. The first findings of tadpoles and the reproductive site of the common spadefoot toad in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In the first book, Sigismundo is an adolescent in Naples, Italy, where his uncle introduces him to the teaching of the Freemasons. In the second book Sigismundo has been banished from Naples because of a lovers' duel. He lives in Paris and is taken captive twice. The first time he is imprisoned in the Bastille, from which he escapes using Masonic techniques of concentration to help distract himself from the pain involved in climbing down from his tower.

It was listed on the Phoenix Historic Property Register in 1990. It was built by local businessman George H. N. Luhrs, an original Phoenix City Council member from 1881–85, at a cost of $553,000 USD, and opened on May 17, 1924. At the time, it was the tallest building in Phoenix and was said to be the largest building between El Paso and Los Angeles. In 2009, the building was renovated with the help of a $500,000 historic preservation grant. Architecture The L-shaped Luhrs Building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by the El Paso architectural firm of Trost & Trost. The building is faced with brown brick, with elaborate marble ornamentation on the uppermost two floors, and a heavy cornice at the top. The building's ground floor was leased by the US Treasury Dept. from 1924–1935. The 7th-10th floors were the original location of the Arizona Club, including dining rooms, lounges, a library, and bedrooms for club members. When the Arizona Club moved out of the Luhrs Building in 1971, the upper floors were also converted to office floor space. The 6th floor was originally occupied by Standard Oil.

This folder is supposed to be a personal area where users store their personal non-shared documents. However, many software developers have ignored this convention and as a result, this folder has become a repository for the application data such as files containing settings and saved games. Usually, users cannot delete, move or organize these files without causing unwanted behavior in their software. Until Windows XP, it contained other subfolders such as \\"My Pictures\\", \\"My Music\\" and \\"My Videos\\". Starting with Windows Vista, these subfolders were moved out of My Documents and were made its siblings.  Overview  Microsoft first introduced the \\"My Documents\\" folder in Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2, as a standard location for storing user-created files. The folder, located under the root directory of the boot volume. A shortcut to it is displayed directly on the user's desktop. The Windows NT family of operating systems set up the \\"My Documents\\" folder in the user's profile folder. In Windows XP and earlier, the path is \`\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\[user name]\\\\My Documents\\\\\` (alias \`%USERPROFILE%\\\\My Documents\\\\\`) on boot volume. A user can later change the physical location of \\"My Documents\\". However, \\"My Documents\\" in Windows Explorer (and file dialog boxes) doesn't appear as an absolute path. In addition to translation, the display name of the folder might change depending on owner of the folder. For example, if a user who has logged on to Windows XP and later with user account A look at the personal folders of user account B via Windows Explorer, instead of \\"My Documents\\", \\"B's Documents\\" is seen. This customization is achieved using \`desktop.ini\` file. Windows Vista made many changes to this folder. Dropping \\"My\\" in its name, it is stored in \`\\\\Users\\\\[user name]\\\\Documents\` regardless of the Windows language. Windows Explorer, however, shows a different display name for it, depending on the chosen language. For instance, an English copy of Windows shows \\"My Documents\\", a French copy shows \\"Mes documents\\" and a German copy shows \\"Eigene Dokumente\\" (changed from \\"Eigene Dateien\\" in Windows XP). Additionally, \\"My Pictures\\", \\"My Music\\" and \\"My Videos\\" are no longer stored within it; they are now called \\"Pictures\\", \\"Music\\" and \\"Videos\\" and are now its siblings.  Perversion of purpose  This folder is supposed to be a personal area where users store their personal non-shared documents. Users are supposed to be sole authority of what is stored in this folder. Creating, renaming, moving, or deleting the contents of this folder is not supposed to impact the proper execution of installed software. However, many software developers have ignored this convention and as a result, this folder has become a dumping ground for the application data such as files containing settings and saved games. For example: * Remote Desktop Connection creates a hidden \`Default.rdp\` file. * Windows PowerShell creates a \`WindowsPowerShell\` subfolder. * Microsoft Office creates a \`Custom Office Templates\` subfolder. * Fiddler creates a \`Fiddler2\` subfolder. * Calibre creates a \`Calibre library\` subfolder. * AutoCAD 2016 creates two subfolders: \`AutoCAD Sheet Sets\` and \`Inventor Server SDK ACAD 2016\`. Users cannot delete, move or organize these files without causing unwanted behavior in their software. Their options are to either live with this chaos, hide the offending folders, or simply store their files elsewhere.  Other \\"My\\" folders  Windows 98 introduced two additional folders with a \\"My\\" prefix: \\"My Music\\" and \\"My Pictures\\". They are not present in Windows Server 2003 by default, unless enabled using the Start menu customization. Running Windows Movie Maker or installing Windows Media Player 10 or 11 on Windows XP adds a \\"My Videos\\" folder which Windows Media Player uses to store video files that are shown in its media library. In Windows Vista, \\"My\\" prefix is removed and these three folders are expelled out of what is now called \\"Documents\\". In addition, other user folders are added: \\"Contacts\\", \\"Downloads\\", \\"Favorites\\", \\"Links\\", \\"Saved Games\\" and \\"Searches\\". Windows 10 adds \\"OneDrive\\" and \\"3D Objects\\". In Windows 7, under the Public user folder there is a Recorded TV library, that can be added on the libraries list. Installing Visio 2003 adds a My Shapes folder.  Group Policy  On Windows machines which operate as part of a Windows Server domain, administrators can configure the location of \\"My Documents\\" (and other Special Folders) through Group Policy. Corporate desktop deployments commonly redirect \\"My Documents\\" to a folder on a file server.

It was established in 2003 as a government-owned company comprising a number of print, radio and TV channels under its umbrella including: Dubai TV, Al Bayan, Sama Dubai TV, Dubai One, Dubai Sports, Dubai Racing, Dubai Zaman, Dubai Drama, Noor Dubai Radio & Noor Dubai TV, Dubai FM, Emarat Al Youm, Emirates 24/7, Tawseel and Masar Printing Press. The chairman of the board of directors of DMI, Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is also the deputy ruler of Dubai.  History  Before DMI was established, the government-owned media outlets were a part of the Dubai Department of Media. These included a number of TV channels which were launched and closed over many years prior to the establishment of DMI. These included Dubai TV, Dubai 33, Dubai Business Channel, Al Bayan Newspaper, Dubai 92 and Dubai FM. After the establishment of Arab Media Group (AMG) in 2005, which is a part of TECOM Investments, the technology and media holdings management arm of Dubai Holding, all of the radio stations and newspapers were transferred under AMG, leaving DMI with only four TV channels (Dubai TV, Sama Dubai, Dubai One and Dubai Sports) and began, essentially, privatizing the media outlets of Dubai. 2003 channel structure Soon after DMI was established, and with a renewed concentration on television, the organization began relaunching the TV channels as part of a new strategy to target wider audiences, to compete on a pan-Arab level like MBC Group and to complement the ongoing developments of Dubai as a global tourism and investment hub. This included relaunching Dubai TV as a general entertainment and news channel targeting the Arab world, the launch of Sama Dubai as local news and entertainment channel targeting Emirati and Gulf nationals. DMI also replaced the dated Channel 33 and relaunched it as Dubai One, with subtitled Western content targeting Arabs and expatriates living in Dubai and around the Arab world. 2009 AMG-DMI merger As a direct impact of the Late-2000s financial crisis, after considerable layoffs of the workforce, Arab Media Group's newly established Noor Dubai TV (and Radio), along with the print media and publishing outlets were merged with Dubai Media Incorporated in late 2009. This expanded DMI's ownership into radio, print and online media which made it one of the largest media companies in the Middle East. The company also benefited from the newly transferred employees from AMG with their expertise in radio and for-profit media. 2010 expansion With the platform of Noor Dubai radio, DMI launched Dubai FM in September 2011 to target Emirati youth with a variety of news programs and talk shows. There are also plans to launch a magazine called ARA Dubai. On 23 April 2015, the Dubai Media Incorporated was rebranded as Dubai Channels Network. On 22 May 2017, the Dubai Channels Network reverted its name back to Dubai Media Incorporated.  TV Channels  DMI has a number of TV channels, some of which extend into multiple broadcasts (Like Dubai Sports 1, 2HD. 3HD, 4HD & 5HD). While most of the production is centralized at DMI's own studios, each channel has its own management, team, structure and strategy.  Dubai TV  Dubai TV replaced Emirates Dubai Television in June 2004. Dubai TV broadcasts programmes predominantly in Arabic, with some additional subtitled Western movies and documentary series. The programming caters to family Arab audiences around the MENA region and is also available in Australia, Europe, North America and the rest of Asia. A majority of its programming is produced locally, either through DMI's own in-house productions or by commissioning various production houses throughout the Arab world, whereby DMI acts as the \\"executive producer\\". The channel has cosmopolitan shows along with conservative religious programming as well as international formats to cater to the various types of people in the Arab world. Official Site : http://www.dubaitv.ae/  Sama Dubai  Sama Dubai was launched on 20 June 2005 to cater to the Emirati and Gulf audience, with a deep concentration on traditions and culture, specifically targeting the youth of the region. The popularity of the channel is attributed to its view on Gulf culture, while maintaining authenticity in the old traditions, there is always a foreword thinking view through the empowerment of women and the modernization of old culture, specifically with the highly successful reality series Al Meydan, which took the traditional Yowla dancing (which was not widely known at the time) and created competition similar to the format American Idol whereby viewers can vote on the best dancers. Official Site : http://www.samadubai.ae/  Dubai One  Dubai 33 (also called \\"Channel 33\\") was originally a terrestrial Analog television channel which catered, mostly, to the expatriate community living in Dubai. Through a number of Western cartoons, series, soap operas and films, as well as weekly Hindi cinema along with a nightly local news broadcast. Since the expansion of pay TV networks like Showtime Arabia along with Free-to-air channels like MBC 2 which provided newer Western content, the popularity of Channel 33 declined heavily. In 2004, DMI launched One TV (which later became Dubai One) as a 24-hour free-to-air Digital satellite channel targeting a pan-Arab audience interested in Western content, this was done by subtitling content in Arabic and creating mostly Arabic and English (with an Arabic accent) on-air promotions. The channel did not include any of the previous content like soap operas, Bollywood cinema or local news. The channel was intended to compete with MBC Group's MBC 2, which was a considerably successful strategy, until MBC launched a number of other Western-content channels, with newer films and TV series than Dubai One. Since the channel was launched, many of the labouring class expatriates living in Dubai were disappointed with removal of some of their most popular shows including The Bold and the Beautiful and the local news broadcast in English (which was, at the time, the only one of its kind in the UAE). The complaints were done through directly contacting DMI along with letters featured in local newspapers like Gulf News. Due to these shifts in market share, audience requests, as well as the Dubai government's strategy to make the channel promote the events and developments of the city, a daily news program called Emirates News was launched in 2007. The program was similar to the old format local news of Channel 33, but it was based in DMI's State of the art News Center in Dubai Media City which was also used for Dubai TV's and Sama Dubai's news broadcasts (as well as Dubai Sports' news as of the 2010 relaunch), the program managed to successfully produce local news by sharing resources and news content with the other channels. Dubai One soon began launching more locally produced programs like Out & About, Studio One, World of Sports (TV series), Understanding Islam and Emirates 24/7 which was co-branded with the online news website. The channel also brought back The Bold and the Beautiful and began featuring more Hindi cinema along with its Westen content, which became more targeted to offer films and TV shows that were not available on competing free-to-air channels. =Emirates 24/7= Emirates 24/7 is a 30-minute segment broadcast weekly, as well as the name of their news website.  Noor Dubai  In 2008, AMG launched Noor Dubai TV on the first day of Ramadan that year, solidifying its Islamic views. The channel was originally an experimental radio and television hybrid, with a limited budget, significantly lower production values than competing Dubai-owned channels and with dual-broadcasts of radio programs on television along with new television-only shows. While the radio station was only available in Dubai, the TV channel was a pan-Arab satellite broadcast, so its popularity grew far beyond the intended audience with a significant following of conservative Muslims living around the Middle East due to the heavy Islamic content, which was based on the radio station format. After the 2009 AMG-DMI merger, the new channel, along with the radio station, joined DMI and the offices and studios were moved from Dubai Studio City to DMI's headquarters next to Al Maktoum Bridge. DMI relaunched the TV channel in an attempt to separate it from the radio channel and to suppress the ultra-conservative brand. The new target audience was similar to Sama Dubai's Emirati and Gulf target, but instead was an older audience. This was done through programming about cultural and traditional topics as well as a re-broadcasting of decades-old series and programs from the DMI library. DMI also gave Noor Dubai its own broadcast of Emirates news, from DMI's News Center using the same news content that's broadcast on Sama Dubai and Dubai TV's Emirates news.  Dubai Sports  Dubai Sports Channel was launched in 1998 to cover local sports events in the UAE and to have exclusive Middle East broadcast rights for some of Dubai's sports events like the Dubai World Cup. It was later expanded to include international sports by acquiring Middle East broadcast rights for events like the Olympic Games and Wimbledon Championships. The popularity of the channel grew as it increased coverage of the UAE Football League, with live broadcast of matches and complementary shows like Dawrina and the popular Al Jamahir, which interviewed fans of teams during and after matches with all of their emotional outbursts when their teams lost. Due to the development of the UAE Football League and the increasing number of events taking place simultaneously, Dubai Sports expanded to include Dubai Sports 2 & 3, which act as a simulcast except during multiple live events. The expansion of the channels has also been an attempt to compete with other pan-Arab sports channels like Abu Dhabi Sports Channel (for local events), Al Jazeera Sports and ShowSports (for international events). But due to budget limitations, the channel has not been able to fully compete and has since lost some of its popularity. Official Site : http://www.dubaisports.ae/  Dubai Racing  In essence, an extension of Dubai Sports, but with its own brand and identity, Dubai Racing is the only horse racing and camel racing TV channel in the Middle East. Specifically dedicated to coverage of horse racing events in the UAE like the Dubai World Cup, various camel races and accompanying programs. The channel originally took all of its content from Dubai Sports and larger sporting events are simulcast on Dubai Sports.  Dubai Zaman  Dubai Zaman was launched on 23 April 2015 to show old programs and films from 80's and 90's.  Dubai Drama  Dubai Drama was launched on 23 April 2015 (the same day Dubai Zaman was launched) to show dramatic shows in Arabic or English (with Arabic subtitles) language.  Radio Stations = Noor Dubai  Noor Dubai (FM 93.9) was originally launched by Arab Media Group in 2005, replacing Dubai FM which had the same frequency. The channel's slogan was \\"A community channel with an Islamic perspective\\", it was intended to be a conservative radio station which did not air any music, while still serving the community through talk shows about various topics facing the community along with religious programming and Anasheed (instead of music). The most popular program was a morning call-in show called Al Bath Al Mubashar (\\"The Live Broadcast\\") which allowed anyone in the community to call in with their thoughts, opinions or complaints on almost any topic, but it was predominantly government-related service issues, the host would then call up the responsible agency to find solutions to the issues.  Dubai Radio  On 30 August 2011, the same day as Eid al-Fitr, DMI launched Dubai FM on the frequency 93. The channel expanded DMI's radio stations, utilizing the infrastructure and expertise of the Noor Dubai station. Dubai FM is a youth-oriented channel with talk shows and music aimed at the more liberal Emirati youth market. Official Site : http://www.dubairadiofm.ae/ Newspapers Printing, publishing & Distribution= Al Bayan  Al Bayan was established in 1980 by the government of Dubai as a part of the Dubai Media Department. It reported on local news, Arab news and some international news, it was known for its critical coverage and political views of events in Arab world, but in essence it was considered the official news paper of government of Dubai and so was very popular among local readers working in the government sector. It later moved to Arab Media Group where it was rebranded, giving it a new look and making the whole newspaper in full color. This was an attempt to target a younger audience, but was ultimately unsuccessful as there was not a significant change in the content. Now Daily Al Bayan Pakistan also launched in Pakistan. Since the 2009 AMG-DMI merger, the newspaper is a part of Dubai Media Incorporated.  Emarat Al Youm  Emarat Al Youm (Emirates Today) was launched in 2005 by Arab Media Group. The newspaper was part of an experimental structure in which its sister newspaper, the English-language Emirates Today, had the same team of reporters, in essence the same news paper but in two languages. While the popularity of Emarat Al Youm grew amongst the younger readers, Emirates Today proved unpopular amongst the expatriate population compared to the already established English-language newspapers and was ultimately shut down. The popularity of Emarat Al Youm is attributed to its concentration on community issues and news, rather than politics and governmental issues. In 2009, the newspaper was suspended from publication for 20 days from 6 July on the instructions of an Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal ruling, upheld by the Supreme Federal Court of the UAE. The newspaper had been sued by the owners of the Warsan Stables (the Abu Dhabi Royal Family) for publishing a story in 2006 claiming their horses had been drugged with steroids.

Pageants In 1970, Shelton competed in the Miss Virginia USA pageant to spite her then boyfriend. She won the title and represented Virginia in the Miss USA 1970 pageant held in Miami, Florida in May 1970. At the pageant, Shelton won the Miss Pixable award and was subsequently crowned Miss USA 1970. She was crowned by former titleholder Wendy Dascomb, also of Virginia; this was the first time that a state had won the Miss USA title back to back. Shelton then went on to the Miss Universe contest in Miami, Florida in July where she placed first runner-up to Marisol Malaret of Puerto Rico. She described competing at Miss Universe as \\"perhaps her greatest experience\\". During her reign, Shelton travelled across the United States and internationally, including visits to Japan, Spain, Portugal, Brazil and Puerto Rico. For winning Miss USA, she received $5,000 in cash, a $5,000 mink coat and made another $5,000 from personal appearances. Education and career Shelton was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Norfolk, Virginia. She graduated from Norview High School and attended Old Dominion University. She was a junior studying art at the time she won the Miss USA title. Prior to winning her first pageant title, Shelton was enrolled in a pre-medical [curriculum]. After college, she moved to New York City where she studied acting, modeled, and appeared on television commercials. In March 1974, she appeared on the cover of Playboy Magazine. She starred in the feature film Blood Tide alongside legendary stage and screen actors José Ferrer and James Earl Jones. Filmed on location in the Greek islands, the 1982 film featured her singing a song during the end credits co-written with Shuki Levy, her second husband. She later starred in the 1984 film Body Double although her dialogue was dubbed by actress Helen Shaver because the director, Brian de Palma didn't like how she sounded when he was editing the film. Shelton made frequent guest appearances on television series such as Fantasy Island, The A-Team, T. J. Hooker, The Fall Guy, Cheers, The Love Boat, Riptide, and Get a Life. In 2008, she was cast to play a rich housewife in the American television series Nip/Tuck. Shelton is widely known for her television role as Mandy Winger, one of J. R. Ewing's mistresses on Dallas. After the character left the show, an outpouring of fan mail convinced the producers to bring the character back. Shelton appeared in the series from 1984 to 1987. She also had a role on The Yellow Rose, a \\"critically acclaimed flop\\". In 1991 and 1992, Shelton returned to the Miss USA stage, offering commentary during the pageant. During 2012, Shelton made a guest appearance on the newly revived Dallas - she portrayed her old character Mandy Winger for J.R. Ewing's memorial service. Personal life Shelton married Vici Castro, a Cuban exile in 1971, less than a month after passing-on the Miss USA title. The couple had a son, Christopher, but the marriage ended within five years. In 1977 she married Shuki Levy, a Jewish Israeli music producer, and they later had a daughter, Tamara. Shelton collaborated on his music. One of their songs \\"Magdelena\\" appeared on a Julio Iglesias album. She has since divorced her second husband.

During his tenure, amendments to the Standing Orders of the Senate extended the powers of the Speaker. Chabonneau was born in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. He received his Bachelor of Arts from the Université de Montréal, and pursued further studies in economics at McGill University. He served during World War II in the Royal Canadian Air Force. After being demobilized, he joined the insurance industry. He rose to the position of vice-president and director of Peerless Insurance Agencies in 1948. He became president in 1963. He later served as Chief Executive Officer of the firm of Charbonneau, Dulude and Associates Ltd., Insurance Brokers, and became a limited partner in the Mer Banco Group of Calgary. Charbonneau served on the board of directors of Canadian National Railway from 1961 to 1964. He was summoned to the Senate on September 27, 1979 on the advice of Prime Minister Joe Clark, and sat as a Progressive Conservative. When Brian Mulroney became prime minister following the 1984 federal election, he recommended Charbonneau for the position of Speaker. During much of Charbonneau's tenure, the Liberal Party held a majority in the Senate despite the fact that the Progressive Conservatives formed the government. This resulted in a number of occasions where the Senate defeated or delayed legislation passed by the House of Commons of Canada - a relatively rare occurrence in Canadian politics. Opposition to the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 1990 resulted in Prime Minister Mulroney using a never-before-utilized section of the Constitution of Canada that allowed him to recommend to the Queen the appointment of eight additional Senators (two per region) beyond the usual maximum number of occupants of the upper chamber. This extraordinary appointment gave the Progressive Conservatives control of the Senate for the first time in decades. The measure resulted in an especially tumultuous debate in the usually staid upper house, providing a challenge to Charbonneau to maintain decorum. This resulted in what opposition parties and outsiders viewed as abuses of his power as Speaker, including locking the Opposition out of voting sessions, turning off the bells that call Senators to votes, ramming through motions without debate, moving for divisions without the presence of Party Whips, and actually voting himself on many motions to help them carry. In June 1991, the Senate adopted a major overhaul to the standing rules of the Senate giving the Speaker of the Senate powers more consistent with those of the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, previously the Senate Speaker enjoyed far less control over the upper house. Charbonneau stepped down as Speaker following the defeat of the Progressive Conservatives in the 1993 federal election. As is customary for former Speakers, he was elevated to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada (in 1996). He retired from the Senate in 1997 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.

Plot The main plot focuses on Shrek and his friends attempting to help Donkey put the Dronkeys to sleep in order to watch Survivor: Sherwood Forest together at the Dragon's Keep. When one of the Dronkeys inadvertently destroys the family's storybook, the group takes turns creating their own stories. After telling enough stories, the Dronkeys do fall asleep only to be woken up after Shrek yells at the game's announcer for talking too much in epilogue. Overview Shrek SuperSlam is a 3D-environment multiplayer fighting game in which two to four fighter characters battle in a variety of arena stages attempting to beat each other up and charge a special move called a \\"Slam\\" attack. When a \\"Slam\\" is successfully used on other fighters, the player gains points while continually (and creatively) destroying the arena in the process. Whoever gains the most \\"Slam\\" points will win when the round is over. Gameplay The game features three multiplayer modes: \\"Melee\\", \\"King of the Hill\\", and \\"Slammageddon\\". In \\"Melee\\", the objective is to earn as many slam points within a two-minute time period. For attack, a word bank that says \\"Slam\\" will fill up. Once the bank has filled up, the player can unleash a Slam Attack which can hit multiple opponents. For each opponent who's hit, the player will receive a Slam Point, but if a player get slammed, they'll lose one. The player with the most slam points after the time limit stops wins. In \\"King of the Hill\\", the object of the game is to stay atop of a hill the longest, while opponents try and knock each other off. The first player to reach 30 points wins. The longer the player stays on the hill, the more points she/he will receive. In \\"Slammageddon\\", each single attack counts as a Slam. Every character \\"Slam\\" attack have different effects and range. For example, Shrek's \\"Green Storm\\" attack will send his opponents flying as he undergoes flatulence at close range, while Robin Hood's \\"Arrow Swarm\\" has him commanding his band of Merry Men to litter the battlefield in raining arrows from the sky. Other examples include Pinocchio's \\"Buzz Bomber\\" in which his nose grows and he flies across the arena at opponents or Fiona Ogre uses \\"Ogre Aria\\" to blast her enemies with floating projectile singing notes. Cast The game features 20 playable characters total, with 10 of these needing to be unlocked through gameplay progression. Each character has an array of various costumes/skins to change their appearance. Most of the characters have their own distinct fighting style and moves, with only one or two characters being very similar \\"clone fighters\\". ;Starting characters * Shrek (voiced by Michael Gough) * Donkey (voiced by Mark Moseley) * Gingerbread Man (voiced by Conrad Vernon) * Princess Fiona (voiced by Holly Fields) * Fiona (as an ogre) * Puss in Boots (voiced by André Sogliuzzo) * Prince Charming (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) * Pinocchio (voiced by Cody Cameron) * Red Riding Hood (voiced by Tara Strong) * The Black Knight (voiced by Max Koch) ;Unlockable characters * Big Bad Wolf (voiced by Michael Gough) * Anthrax the Unicorn (voiced by Tara Strong) * Cyclops (voiced by Max Koch) * Robin Hood (voiced by André Sogliuzzo) * G-nome (voiced by Max Koch) * Dronkey (voiced by Tara Strong) * Quasimodo (voiced by Nolan North) * Luna the Witch (voiced by Tara Strong) * Captain Hook (voiced by Max Koch) * Humpty Dumpty (voice by James Arnold Taylor) John Kassir voices the game's announcer.

Life and work Davidson has written eight books of poetry as well as numerous historical, cultural and critical works. He has been affiliated with the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) since 1974 and as a professor of American literature since 1988 with areas of study and research in Modern Poetry, Cultural Studies, Gender Studies, and Disability Studies. Davidson served as the first curator of the Mandeville Department of Special Collections (UCSD) where the George Oppen papers are stored. The Archive for New Poetry is now a major campus, community and international resource for studying post-1945 English-language poetry, and is one of the four largest American poetry collections in the U.S. The archive contains holdings that emphasize the ongoing “countertradition” in recent American writing – particularly the Objectivist poets, the Black Mountain poets, the San Francisco Renaissance, the New York School, and the Language School. Davidson, who recently became Deaf, has written extensively on disability issues, most recently \\"Hearing Things: The Scandal of Speech in Deaf Performance,\\" in Disability Studies: Enabling the Humanities, \\"Phantom Limbs: Film Noir and the Disabled Body,\\" GLQ 9:1-2 (2003), and \\"Strange Blood: Hemophobia and the Unexplored Boundaries of Queer Nation,\\" in Beyond the Boundary: Reconstructing Cultural Identity in a Multicultural Context. A collection of essays on disability was published as Concerto for the Left Hand: Disability and the Defamiliar Body (University of Michigan). Another recent critical work, On the Outskirts of Form: Practicing Cultural Poetics, was published in 2011 by Wesleyan University Press. This latter book gathered his essays concerning formally innovative poetry from modernists such as Mina Loy, George Oppen, and Wallace Stevens to current practitioners such as Cristina Rivera-Garza, Heriberto Yépez, Lisa Robertson, and Mark Nowak. In addition to being a widely published poet and poetry editor (he is represented in the 2004 edition of Best American Poetry by a poem entitled \\"Bad Modernism\\"), Davidson is known for insightful literary criticism, his work in disability studies, and for the meticulous editing of the monumental George Oppen, New Collected Poems.

NBC suits are designed to provide protection against direct contact with and contamination by radioactive, biological or chemical substances, and provide protection from contamination with radioactive materials and some types of radiation, depending on the design. They are generally designed to be worn for extended periods to allow the wearer to fight (or generally function) while under threat of or under actual nuclear, biological, or chemical attack. The civilian equivalent is the hazmat suit. The term NBC has been replaced by CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear), with the addition of a new threat, radiological, meaning radiological weapon.  Use  Smock of British military NBC suit in Disruptive Pattern Material. Overboots to be worn over combat boots NBC stands for nuclear, biological, and chemical. It is a term used in the armed forces and in health and safety, mostly in the context of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) clean-up in overseas conflict or protection of emergency services during the response to a terrorist attack, though there are civilian and common-use applications (such as recovery and clean up efforts after industrial accidents). In military operations, NBC suits are intended to be quickly donned over a soldier’s uniform and can continuously protect the user for up to several days. Most are made of impermeable material such as rubber, but some incorporate a filter, allowing air, sweat and condensation to slowly pass through. An example of this is the Canadian military NBC suit. The older Soviet suit was impermeable rubber-coated canvas. Now known as the CBRN suit, the British Armed Forces suit is reinforced nylon with charcoal impregnated felt. It is more comfortable because of the breathability but has a shorter useful life, and must be replaced often. The British Armed Forces suit is known as a \\"Noddy suit\\" because some of them had a pointed hood like the hat worn by the fictional character Noddy. The Soviet style suit will protect the wearer at higher concentrations than the British suit but is less comfortable due to the build-up of moisture within it. A Soviet suit was known as a \\"Womble\\" because of its long faced respirator with round visor glasses. In Canadian terminology, an NBC suit or any kind of similar protective over-suit is also known as a \\"Bunnysuit\\".

This system makes it possible to have both cosmically-powered characters and ordinary human characters meaningfully interact within the same universe. For example, in DC Heroes, the first game to use MEGS, Superman's strength is several orders of magnitude more than Batman's. With the MEGS system, however, this large difference in strength is scaled down. So, while Superman would still have a clear advantage in a brawl, Batman is at least able to hold out for a while, mirroring how superhero combat often operates in comic books. History MEGS was originally developed for the company Mayfair Games for the modern superhero RPG DC Heroes. The system was heavily modified for Mayfair's cyberpunk war veteran RPG Underground. The original incarnation of Pulsar Games licensed MEGS from Mayfair Games and used it in their modern superhero RPG Blood of Heroes. Blood of Heroes is very similar to DC Heroes, mostly replacing the superheroes created by DC Comics with new ones for the Blood of Heroes universe. Mechanics All measurements in MEGS are done using a logarithmic scale. The units on this scale are called \\"Attribute Points\\" or \\"APs\\" in the superhero games and simply \\"Units\\" in Underground, with each unit on the scale represents exponentially increasing values for length, weight, time, etc. Because of the nature of logarithms and exponents, 0 APs/Units is a meaningful, positive value. Indeed, even negative APs/Units still represent positive values, though exponentially smaller, down to -100 APs, which is defined as absolute zero for all units. In the superhero games, 1 AP corresponds to 8 seconds, , , , $50, or a typed page of information. A single increase of an AP roughly doubles the value, so 2 APs of weight is about 200 pounds, while 6 APs of weight is about 3200 pounds, or about 1.5 tons. In Underground, 1 Unit corresponds to 5 seconds, , , , or a bit more than a paragraph of text. An increase of 3 Units represents a doubling of the related value, so 4 Units of weight is about 250 pounds, while 7 Units of weight is about 500 pounds. Multiplication and division of raw values are simplified to addition and subtraction on a logarithmic scale, so the MEGS scale functions essentially the same way that slide rules do. For example, raw distance travelled is normally calculated by multiplying raw speed by raw time. In MEGS, speed and time in APs/Units are simply added together to yield the distance travelled in APs/Units. So a car traveling at a speed of 5 APs (about 55 MPH) for 9 APs of time (about 34 minutes) will travel 5+9=14 APs of distance (about 31 miles). The results of other important game events can be determined in similar ways, such as calculating the distance an object can be thrown (the PC's strength score minus the weight of the object).

The word Withy means \\"willow\\". The civil parish, known as Withypool and Hawkridge, covers , includes the village of Hawkridge and has a population around 201. Withypool is in the Barle Valley on the River Barle. The village lies on the route of the Two Moors Way and the Celtic Way Exmoor Option. To the southwest of the village lie Withypool Common and Withypool Hill. History The area around Withypool has been inhabited since the Bronze Age and the Withypool Stone Circle can still be seen on top of Withypool Hill. The Brightworthy barrows lie on the Common; of three original, two survive. Withypool is mentioned in the Domesday Book as being tended by three foresters: Dodo, Almer and Godric. The parishes of Hawkridge and Withypool were part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred. In the 14th century, Geoffrey Chaucer was in charge of the village in his duties as forester of North Petherton. The red sandstone Withypool Bridge (or New Bridge) carries a small road over the River Barle. It was built in the 19th century and is a Grade II* listed building. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Dulverton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. As Withypool falls within the Exmoor National Park some functions normally administered by district or county councils have, since 1997, fallen under the Exmoor National Park Authority, which is known as a ‘single purpose’ authority, which aims to \\"conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks\\" and \\"promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public\\", including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Landmarks 2 miles upstream of the village, the River Barle passes under a late medieval five-arch stone Landacre Bridge. The Royal Oak Inn The village's Royal Oak Inn has seen its share of history since its construction in the late 17th century. R. D. Blackmore wrote part of Lorna Doone in the bar, and artist Alfred Munnings had a studio in the loft. In the 1930s, the inn was owned by Gwladys and Maxwell Knight, a spy- ring leader and radio broadcaster upon whom Ian Fleming based the character of James Bond's boss, M. During World War II, the nearby Woolacombe beach was used to simulate the invasion of Normandy, and General Dwight Eisenhower planned some of the operation from the Royal Oak. Religious sites The late medieval Church of St Andrew is a Grade II* listed building. The tower was rebuilt in the early 17th century, restored and refitted in 1887, and restored extensively and rebuilt again in 1902. The Norman Church of St Giles in Hawkridge has 14th-century origins.

Closely linked to the family of Pompey, he is noted for being one of the consular generals who led Roman legions against the slave armies of Spartacus in the Third Servile War. Biography Although born into the plebeian Claudii Marcelli family, Clodianus was adopted into the patrician Cornelii Lentuli,Anthon & Smith, pg. 429; Syme, pg. 44 possibly as the adoptive son of Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus.Broughton, T., The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol III, pg. 61 A partisan of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, he possibly served under Pompey during Pompey’s special commission in Hispania.Syme, pg. 44 Elected Praetor around 75 BC,Broughton, pg. 96 his connections with Pompey ensured that he was elected consul in 72 BC .Syme, pg. 66 Clodianus soon was involved in protecting Pompey’s interests, pushing a bill to validate grants of citizenship by Pompey in Hispania. He and his colleague also ensured that no Roman citizen in the provinces could be tried in absentia on a capital charge – an attempt to restrict the ravages of Gaius Verres in Sicily.Broughton, pg. 115 Finally, Clodianus proposed a bill for recovering payment, which Lucius Cornelius Sulla had remitted, from those who had bought the confiscated property of those who suffered under the Sullan proscriptions.Broughton, pg. 115; Holmes, pg. 155 However, the major event of his consulship was the revolt of Spartacus and the eruption of the Third Servile War. Having won a number of victories against ill-prepared Roman forces, the Senate now recognised Spartacus as a serious threat and sent both the consuls to confront the slave armies at the head of four legions.Holmes, pgs. 157-158 Clodianus moved to block Spartacus’s march northward, while his colleague Publicola moved in behind, hoping to catch the rebels between the two armies. However, Spartacus’s slave army destroyed Clodianus' legions in the Apennine Mountains (near modern Pistoia) in the valley named Lentula,Strauss, Barry S., The Spartacus War, Simon & Schuster, 2009, pg. 101 and then turned and defeated the oncoming legions of Publicola.Holmes, pg. 158 Gathering their shattered forces, both consuls gave chase but were once again defeated at a battle near Picenum.Holmes, pgs. 386-387; Broughton, pg. 115 Humiliated by these defeats, shortly afterward, in early autumn, Clodianus and Publicola were withdrawn as commanders by the Roman senate, and command of the war given to Marcus Licinius Crassus.Holmes, pg. 159; Broughton, pg. 115 This setback to Clodianus’s career was only temporary; with the support of Pompey, both Clodianus and Publicola were appointed censor in 70 BC.Anthon & Smith, pg. 724 They began a systematic purge of the senate, removing some sixty-four senators, among them a number of individuals connected to the trial of Oppianicus, as well as some important individuals such as Gaius Antonius Hybrida and Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura.Broughton, pg. 125; Syme, pg. 66; Anthon & Smith, pg. 429 However, the majority of those expelled were acquitted by the courts and restored to their former position.Anthon & Smith, pgs 429-430 They also identified 910,000 citizens and possibly named Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus as Princeps Senatus.Broughton, pg. 125 In 70 BC, Clodianus helped contribute to Cicero's famous prosecution of the corrupt governor Verres by submitting evidence in support of Cicero's case. By 67 BC, Clodianus was serving as a legate with praetorian imperium under Pompey, who had received an extraordinary command to rid the Mediterranean Sea of pirates. Clodianus was given command of the east coast of Italy, with his fleet patrolling the coast of the Adriatic Sea.Broughton, pg. 147 By 66 BC he was back in Rome, where he gave his support to the Lex Manilia, which gave Pompey command of the war against King Mithridates VI of Pontus.Anthon & Smith, pg. 430 Although Clodianus was a noted orator, it was said that he hid his lack of talent through showmanship and the possession of a good voice.

The building stands on the original site of the 1832 Ponce de León ranch. Anson Mills hired Henry C. Trost of the Trost and Trost architectural firm to design and construct the building. Trost was the area's foremost pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete. Built in 1910-1911, the building was only the second concrete-frame skyscraper in the United States, and one of the largest all-concrete buildings. At 145 feet (44 m), the 12-story Mills Building was the tallest building in El Paso when completed. The architectural firm of Trost and Trost moved its offices to the building upon completion, where they remained until 1920. The Mills family sold the building in 1965. The building stands on a corner site opposite San Jacinto Plaza, with a gracefully curved street facade that wraps around the south and east sides. Like many of Trost's designs, the Anson Mills Building's overall form and strong verticality, as well as details of the ornamentation and cornice, are reminiscent of the Chicago School work of Louis Sullivan. In 1974, the Mills Building's windows were replaced with vertical bands of mirrored glass, radically altering its appearance.

The locality includes the headland named Finniss Point which separates the mouths of Currency Creek and the Finniss River. History Parts of Lake Alexandrina near to Currency Creek were initially explored by Charles Sturt in an open boat in 1830 but he did not sight the creek. In December 1837, while exploring the Lake and Murray Mouth looking for other outlets to the sea, a party lead by Thomas Bewes Strangways and Young Bingham Hutchinson discovered the waterway while using a whaleboat borrowed from the Encounter Bay fishery. The whaleboat, which in September 1837 had been sold off the schooner Currency Lass at Adelaide, bore the same name as its mother ship, and they named the creek in honour of this boat. They reported on the good grassland in the area and its potential for agriculture. The township was surveyed in the Currency Creek Special Survey of 1840 but it never really thrived due to the nearness of Goolwa. During the later 1800s the district supported many market gardens along the fertile river flats. The Currency Creek Cemetery contains many historic gravestones. It is notably large compared to the township for the reason that it has serviced the entire district for well over a century. Boundaries for the locality were created on 31 August 2000 for the \\"long established name\\" and include the Government Town of Currency Creek Wine industry Currency Creek lends its name to a wine region that stretches from Port Elliot in the west, to Lake Alexandrina to the east, and includes Hindmarsh Island. The main grape varieties grown are Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz. Vineyards were first established in the area in 1969, with the region producing its first vintage in 1972. Currency Creek Arboretum The Currency Creek Arboretum is named after the nearby geographical feature and town.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The fort is adjacent to the Venetian Isles community, now legally within the city limits of New Orleans, Louisiana. This community was some miles distant from the city when first built and is still distant from the main developed portion of the city. History Ruins of Fort Macomb, Louisiana Chef Menteur Pass is a water route from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Pontchartrain and the lakeshore of New Orleans. (The other route is the Rigolets; both straits connect Pontchartrain to the Gulf via Lake Borgne.) An earlier fort at the site was called Fort Chef Menteur. The United States built the current brick fort in 1822, just seven years after British forces invaded the New Orleans area from the sea, at the close of the War of 1812. It was named Fort Wood in 1827 renamed Fort Macomb in 1851, for General Alexander Macomb, former Chief of Engineers and the second Commanding General of the United States Army. The small fort shaped like a pie wedge has a curved front facing the channel; the curve overlaps the two straight walls, forming demi- bastions. At the salient of the two straight walls is a full bastion facing landward. The fort was surrounded by two wet ditches (moats) with extensive outworks between the ditches. On the parade stands a citadel, a defensive barracks. A Confederate States Army garrison took control of and occupied the fort starting on 28 January 1861 early in the American Civil War. In 1862 the Union Army regained control of the fort and also occupied New Orleans. In 1867 the barracks caught fire, after which the fort was largely abandoned by the U.S. Army. It was decommissioned in 1871. Preservation  The fort and its land are now owned by the State of Louisiana. While some efforts were made to open it to limited tourism in the late 20th century, the decaying condition of the fort was judged too hazardous for public visits. The similar but better preserved Fort Pike, some away at the Rigolets, is the regional coastal fort that is open to visitors. (currently closed for budget reasons.) Fort Macomb 2016A portion of the fort's old moat had been turned into a canal as part of a small marina. The wakes from incoming and outgoing boats were wearing away the outer wall of the fort and accelerating the structural damage. Hurricane Katrina destroyed the marina in 2005. The fort is now protected by riprap. It needs structural stabilization to reverse the previous damage.

This game was not released outside Japan. Under the name of \\"Battle Station\\", the arcade game was featured a number of times in episodes of the Rockman EXE Beast+ anime series. Gameplay The game features much of the same gameplay found in the Battle Network series and was updated near monthly with new characters and attacks, as well as updating the hardware. Machines could be linked to allow players to face each other in NetBattles, showing their abilities over NetNavis. NetNavis featured included the so-called \\"Link Navis\\" from Rockman EXE 6, with the inclusion of other, exclusive NetNavis like Colonel, Falzar-Beast Forte and Dark Rockman. After inserting the play cost of 100 yen, battling was started by slotting up to three merchandise Battle Chips into the machine per turn. Attacking was engaged by pressing a button, with the chips inserted having a chance of being successful, unsuccessful or critical (inflicting extra damage); this was made so to not make the game too easy by using potentially overpowered chips. Winning a round of the game dispensed a new, randomly picked Battle Chip from stock contained inside the arcade machine. Battle Chips given as prizes changed over time in 'volumes' and later versions/revisions of the game; not surprisingly, most of the Battle Chip range was obtainable from the game, including an amount of exclusives. Battle Chips won during play could also have a different colour casing. Although most characters were playable, another way to use Battle Chips was slotting in a different kind of chip, the Navi Data Chip, through a separately marked chip port. Navi Data Chips could be leveled by gaining experience inside the arcade game or through using the LiNK PET_EX from the Beast lineup of merchandise. Using a Navi Data Chip allowed play with a leveled and hence stronger version of that Navi, when compared to the default in character select, or characters not present on the roster. Levels in the PET were proportional to levels in the game and in use with specific features in Battle Network 6. The Program Advance system seen in the Rockman EXE series was expanded upon greatly for Battle Chip Stadium, with over 125 different sequences available. Use of Program Advances were governed by the same rules as all other chips, in whether they were a successful attack or not. Program Advances in Battle Chip Stadium were grouped in Mega-, Giga- and Tera- classes. To facilitate for performing these combination's, Capcom and Takara Tomy released specialized booster packs for the game containing specific Battle Chips in order to perform specific Program Advances.

A close order formation is a military tactical formation in which soldiers are close together and regularly arranged for the tactical concentration of force. It was used by heavy infantry in ancient warfare, as the basis for shield wall and phalanx tactics, to multiply their effective weight of arms by their weight of numbers. In the Late Middle Ages, Swiss pikemen and German Landsknechts used close order formations that were similar to ancient phalanxes. Around the American Civil War (1861–1865), such organizations of soldiers became uncommon since improvements in firearms and artillery had made any such dense formation increasingly hazardous and less effective. The technological concentration of increased firepower to fewer soldiers had rendered the close order formation obsolete by the end of the 19th century. Modern infantry now use skirmish order, which is effectively the opposite of close order. Pre-gunpowder era=Antiquity Close order formation: Greek hoplites marching in phalanx formation. Images from the Sumerian kingdom from the 3rd millennium BC clearly show men with spears in close order formation. That tradition continued in the ancient world with the phalanx formation of the Greeks and later the Ancient Macedonians. The Greek phalanx fought with the aspis, a large round bronze faced shield and a large spear. The frontage per man was the width of the shield (about 3 ft), and the normal formation depth was four to eight men. The later Macedonian phalanx used a smaller shield but replaced the spear with a sarissa, a long pike used in two hands. The normal frontage per man remained the same but normal depth grew to 16 ranks. An innovation was the introduction of a \\"locked shield order\\" (synaspismos), with a frontage of only about 18 in.Warry (1980), pp. 72-3 The Roman legions also fought in close order by using the pilum and the gladius on a similar frontage per man to the phalanx. Middle Ages In close formation, Swiss pikemen confront Holy Roman imperial cavalry at the Battle of Dornach, 1499. In the early Middle Ages, infantry used the shieldwall, a formation in which shields were held edge-to-edge or overlapped. Close order was routinely used by infantry in the later Middle Ages, the intention being to avoid the enemy penetrating and disrupting their formation. A common literary image was that an apple should not be able to pass between their lances. In the 15th century, the Swiss developed pike tactics that used closely packed deep columns. A reconstruction of the deployment of Zürich forces in 1443 gives a formation 56 men wide by 20 deep, the formation having a width of 168 ft and a depth of 140 ft. The Swiss main formation at the Battle of Morat consisted of 10,000 men, and experiments have estimated its area of as little as 60 m by 60 m. The knightly cavalry of the Middle Ages could also fight in close order, stirrup to stirrup.Rogers (2007), p. 191 Growth in firepower=16th century From 1490 to 1520 saw the emergence of a consensus in military thinking that armies should be increasingly ordered on the battlefield and that neat, rectilinear formations were the key. The uniform bodies of pikes would be ordered based on an area occupied by a soldier of three paces frontage and seven paces depth, the soldier being positioned at the centre of the rectangle.Arnold (2001), p.71 Pikes did not stand alone on the battlefield, however, and new formations of horns or sleeves of shot were developed to support the pikeblocks with firearms. In the late 16th century, a system called countermarching was developed to enable an exchange of ranks of shooters. That led to the development of thinner formations and set tacticians on the road to developing the linear fire tactics of the 18th century.Arnold (2001), pp.78-81 On horseback, the old knightly tactics slowly gave way to new tactics involving firearms, which led to the development of pistol-armed cavalry known as reiters, who specialised in manoeuvring in deep, close formations and practiced a tactic known as the caracole in which successive ranks of men rode forward, shot and retired to reload.Arnold (2001), pp. 98-100 Prussian infantry in close order linear formation attack at the Battle of Hohenfriedberg, 1745. 17th and 18th centuries In the 17th century, European armies expanded their use of firearms, which were at first matchlock weapons like arquebuses. They were later supplanted by unrifled muskets fired by a flintlock mechanism, which became the weapon of choice because it could be fired relatively rapidly (six shots per minute). Because of their poor accuracy, such weapons were typically used in line formations in which a commanding officer would order volley fire to increase the chances of inflicting casualties on the enemy. Such tactics were used throughout the 18th century. Line formations were, however, not without risks. Line commanders and other field officers were often highly visible targets and became the target of sniper attacks as rifling technology, which significantly increased the range and accuracy of firearms at the expense of a substantially reduced rate of fire, began to see increased use in the late 18th century. Fortifications were designed to break up formations by reducing the effectiveness of volley fire or to expose them to enfilading fire. In the latter, an enemy that could fire down the length of a line with an inaccurate weapon or cannons loaded with anti-personnel grapeshot greatly increased their chances of hitting something. Another formation that saw use was the infantry square. Designed to defend against cavalry charges, an infantry battalion would form a square with the unit's standard in the center, along with reserve forces. That formation enabled the defenders to fire on cavalry on all sides of the formation although there was some risk that fire from one square might reach other squares formed nearby. The effectiveness of a square depended on the ability of the infantry to hold their ground against cavalry charges. Eclipse In the 19th century, advances in firearms technology rendered the use of close formations obsolete. The widespread use of rifled guns, such as cannons, and the advent of reliable breech-loading weapons and automated weapons, such as the Gatling gun, altered the tactical landscape. The new weapons fired at greater range with accuracy, and technological improvements in aiming them also simplified the targeting of large bodies of enemy forces. A major exception was in the Anglo-Zulu War after the Battle of Isandlwana. After that humiliating defeat, the British army found that close-order infantry formations were necessary to concentrate firepower to break the Zulu warriors' formidable massed charges. One of the last occasions involving the deployment in the face of the enemy of substantial numbers of British troops in close order occurred at the Battle of Magersfontein during the, South African War. The Scottish Brigade, consisting of 3,500 men shoulder to shoulder in 90 lines with a front of only 45 yards, moved forward in pre-dawn darkness to attack the entrenched Boer positions. Two of the four Highland regiments kept their tight formation with long ropes carried by the left hand man of each file. The result was a rout of the brigade after nine hours fighting, with nearly a quarter of the Scottish soldiers killed or wounded. In peace-time the major European armies persisted in training their infantry in close-order tactics that were to ensure very heavy casualties in August 1914. During the Battle of the Frontiers and the Battle of the Sambre the French attacked in shoulder to shoulder masses while at the Battle of Mons the German regiments went forward \\"as if advancing on a parade ground\\". Military parades Though of no military value under modern conditions, military parades still feature soldiers standing and marching in close order formations for ceremonial purposes. Many armies maintain special ceremonial units, whose soldiers hold rigorous training in holding such formations, including armies established in the 20th century, which themselves have no experience of using such formations on the battlefield.

Written by Lou Reed, it was first released on their 1967 debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico. In various reviews, it is described as \\"tough garage rock\\", \\"proto-punk, and \\"one of the all-time classic rock songs\\", with renditions by a number of artists. Composition and recording A row of tenements on the Lower East Side The song is about waiting on a streetcorner in Harlem, near the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street, in New York City and purchasing $26 worth of heroin (), sung from the point of view of the purchaser, who has presumably traveled to Harlem from another part of the city; the \\"man\\" in the title is a drug dealer. Along with traditional guitars, bass, and drums, the song also features pounding, percussive rock-and-roll barrelhouse-style piano. It is one of the band's more popular songs, and one of their many compositions featuring drugs as subject matter. Reception and legacy In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song number 161 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It noted: In a song review for AllMusic, Dave Thompson called it \\"one of the all-time classic rock songs... Over chunky guitar, clunking piano, and jackhammer drums, Reed half-sings, half-intones what he would once describe as a love song about a man and the subway.\\" He notes that it has been recorded by numerous artists, including \\"David Bowie and the Stooges [who] both cut fascinating takes on the song\\". Bowie's later 1977 song \\"'Heroes'\\" was influenced by Reed's writing. Each member of the Velvet Underground have performed the song based on their own interpretations.

From Through the Looking-Glass, illustration by John Tenniel. An unbirthday (originally written un-birthday) is an event that is typically celebrated on any or all of the 364 (365 on leap years) days in which it is not a person's birthday. It is a neologism coined by Lewis Carroll in his 1871 novel Through the Looking-Glass,Lewis Carroll (1871). Through the Looking-Glass. Chapter VI, \\"Humpty Dumpty\\", written as \\"un-birthday\\".Oxford English Dictionary vol. 10/1 (1926). p.

Retrieved on 20 September 2008. One's unbirthday should not be confused with one's half- birthday, which only occurs once a year. In Through the Looking-Glass, Humpty Dumpty is wearing a cravat (which Alice at first mistakes for a belt) which he says was given to him as an \\"un-birthday present\\" by the White King and Queen. He then has Alice calculate the number of unbirthdays in a year. In the Disney animated film Alice in Wonderland, Alice stumbles upon the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse having an unbirthday party and singing \\"The Unbirthday Song\\" (music and lyrics by Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston). Alice at first doesn't realize what an unbirthday is; when the Mad Hatter explains it to her, she realizes it is her unbirthday as well, and receives an unbirthday cake from the Mad Hatter. The scene from the film combines the idea of an unbirthday introduced in Through the Looking-Glass with the \\"Mad Tea Party\\" described in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.Lewis Carroll (1865). Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Chapter VII, \\"A Mad Tea Party\\". Later in the film; the Mad Hatter mentions this unbirthday party when he is summoned as a witness at Alice's trial. The King of Hearts realizes that it's the Queen of Hearts' unbirthday as well, and the trial is abruptly halted to celebrate. The unbirthday party is also the subject of a 1951 comic released to coincide with the film.Walt Disney Productions (1951). Walt Disney's Unbirthday Party with Alice in Wonderland. Dell Four Color Comics No. 341. The comic version is substantially longer (32 pages) than the scene in the animated film, and has Alice being invited to the unbirthday party of Tweedledum and Tweedledee (who are not actually present at the unbirthday party).

Company press releases (www.mplayer.com/company/press/). Retrieved on 1998-12-05. was a free online PC gaming service and community that operated from late 1996 until early 2001. The service at its peak was host to a community of more than 20 million visitors each month and offered more than 100 games. Some of the more popular titles available were action games like Quake, Command & Conquer, and Rogue Spear, as well as classic card and board for more casual gamers. Servers and matchmaking was provided through a proprietary client. Initially, the service was subscription-based, but by early 1997, they became the first major multiplayer community to offer games to be played online through their network for free. This was done by relying on advertisement-based revenues. Mplayer was a unit of Mpath Interactive, a Silicon Valley-based startup. The demand for online gaming in the late 1990s resulted in huge growth for the service. They became known for supplying a range of features integrated through their software, including their very successful voice chat feature. This feature proved so popular that it was later split off as a VoIP service to cater to non-gamers, dubbed HearMe, which would eventually become the new name of the company. The company was listed on NASDAQ as MPTH and later HEAR. Despite the growth of their gaming unit, Mplayer was never profitable. HearMe continued to refocus themselves on VoIP technologies and, in late 2000, had sold off Mplayer to competitor GameSpy. In addition, some technologies were sold to 4anything.com. HearMe survived the buyout and continued to operate independently. Mplayer was taken offline and integrated into GameSpy Arcade in 2001. HearMe shut-down in mid 2000. Company The company first began as Mpath Interactive, a venture capital start-up co-founded in early 1995 by Brian Apgar, Jeff Rothschild and Brian Moriarty, based in Cupertino, California. It was later renamed to HearMe. Mpath Interactive later moved to Mountain View, California, after acquiring Catapult Entertainment, Inc., and their online gaming service XBAND. Mplayer began as a division in October 1996 to provide online gaming to subscribed users. A few months prior to launching Mplayer, Mpath announced their goal for the service in a job description: > Not only will people go to the Internet for information, they will also go > to it to meet and interact with other people. Mplayer, scheduled to debut > 1996, will bring the excitement of real-time multi-player gaming to the > Internet's World Wide Web for the first time. It will feature popular PC- > based games from well-known game publishers. Mplayer's features will include > voice-capable games and chat rooms where players can converse as they play > the games, watch games in progress and choose teams or opponents. In February 1997, they began to offer internet play for free for their major commercial games such as Quake, as well as card and board games such as Scrabble and Spades. In this, they were one of the first major commercial communities on the internet to offer such a service. They continued to add many new games to their offering. The slogan that was used from its founding was \\"Wanna Play?\\" By the end of 1998, the company had a staff of 111 employees, and about 80 by late 2000. The company was listed on NASDAQ beginning April 29, 1999 as MPTH, which changed to HEAR by late September of the same year. Revenues Games first offered over Mplayer were by subscription. In addition to the Gaming Service, Mpath also launched a \\"preferred\\" ISP service, WebBullet, reselling InterRamp ISP accounts on the PSINet network, the very backbone which Mplayer.com's production services were hosted on. By 1997, their growth allowed the service to be offered for free through support of its advertising network, which eventually became known as the Mplayer Entertainment Network. However, the subscription model was retained, known as Plus, and gave special privileges to these member who subscribed. The yearly rate was USD $39.95, or $29.95 for two years; this gave access to certain games, their rating and ranking system in Quake and Quake II, as well as online tournaments.Mplayer.com. Get Plus (www.mplayer.com/plus/). Retrieved on 1998-12-05. Subscriptions had previously been $20 per month, but upon changing their business model to offer many services for free, MPlayer decided to switch to a yearly rate so that they would not have to market to their subscribers every month in order to keep them. While certain releases were kept as \\"Plus Only\\" features for a brief time, in many cases the Plus game rooms were simply games hosted by Mplayer's own servers. With the rapid growth of Quake fans, and the increased server load, Mplayer opened the door to the QuakeWorld network, exponentially increasing the number of available game servers, and offering someone a chance to get a faster connection to a game. The downside was that there was very little control of cheat codes in these systems. Mplayer tried to increase the appeal of the Plus subscription, offering a \\"secure\\" Mplayer owned Server hosted Game, and offering Rankings and customizable Clan Skins. With the Internet user demographic changing, a growing market emerged for classic games, with Scrabble and Battleship leading the charge. Mplayer turned more into an aggregator, hoping to attract as many users as possible with free, ad- supported games and software, including Checkers, Othello, and Chess. Despite this, the company had been losing money, $11.9 million in 1998 alone, and by late 1999, had yet to break even. MPath was forced to look toward different venues. Proprietary technologies that were developed as features for Mplayer, known internally as POP.X, were later licensed to third parties. This was meant to help other companies create their own internet communities using existing technology. Third parties that licensed this technology included companies like Electronic Arts and Fujitsu. HearMe, the internal audio chat feature in Mplayer that was later split off, eventually accounted for 50% of all of the company's revenues. Growth Mplayer began as online gaming was still in its infancy. That along with their initial subscription fee that was required to use its service limited its early growth. Mplayer gained popularity after making its service available for free to all users in early 1997, and by early 1998 had attracted more than 125,000 monthly visitors and 400,000 total members. The entire network had averaged 800,000 hours of gameplay each month, with each member averaging 15 sessions a month for 35 minutes each time. By the end of that year, Mplayer had 2 million total registered users. By March 1999, Mplayer had over 3 million total users, and over 80,000 unique daily visitors, averaging over 300 minutes of gameplay each. Mplayer saw some of its biggest growth during this period, with more than 200 million total minutes of gameplay per month beginning in 1999. According to internal data from HearMe at the time, Mplayer.com was the tenth most popular site on the internet in terms of total monthly usage time. The huge growth of Mplayer was closely associated with the growth in the internet in the late 1990s that culminated in the dot com boom. This was seen in their first day of being publicly traded when their IPO nearly doubled. By the time of the buyout by GameSpy not long after, the service had over 10 million registered members, and 20 million unique visitors per month. HearMe HearMe.com was launched in January 1999 following the success of Mplayer. Mpath intended to expand their market from entertainment using money that was being made through Mplayer to create a VOIP communications network. The technology used was based on the lucrative audio chat software used within Mplayer. HearMe.com's website featured gratis voice and video-conferencing chatrooms, as well as free HTML (ActiveX) code that would allow one to add a voice-chat module directly to their own website and speak with visitors in realtime. The new business became successful to the point where the entire company decided to refocus itself on this market, and this unit was not part of the buyout. In late September 1999, Mpath Interactive bought Resounding Technology, Inc, maker of Roger Wilco, another audio chat program. HearMe continued to release updates of the software until mid 2000 when HearMe saw its end and went out of business. However, in late 2000 a deal with PalTalk emerged, where PalTalk assumed all rights to HearMe's technology. It was later implemented into GameSpy Arcade. Games Mplayer offered a variety of game types to play online, including fast-paced action games, sports games, card and board games, amongst other types of games. Until late 1997, Mplayer had a lineup of about 20 games, with some of their more popular ones being Quake, Red Alert, Diablo, and Scrabble. In October 1997, it was announced that they would add more than 30 new games to their roster, making it the largest offering of any online gaming service at the time. The company wanted to diversify their market, and brought in many new types of games, such as Cavedog's Total Annihilation and a host of new card games to attract more casual gamers. In a deal with Sports Illustrated, Mpath introduced an entirely new section of games dedicated to sports. The new section was meant to accommodate sports gamers, as well as online tournaments and sport news and statistics. The main commercial games were divided by channels into action, strategy, sims, and role-playing. Their popularity generally came down to the individual game rather than the type of game. Indeed, some games would often be too underpopulated to support matchmaking, while other more popular games would have a thriving community of hundreds or thousands of gamers. Competition of online matchmaking services for computer games had been increasing by the late 1990s. Mpath attempted to ensure that it stay up to date with the latest and most popular games being released. Some games like Quake II, Daikatana and Unreal were all heavily promoted as being available for online play even before their launch. A popular feature was the ability to download shareware versions of some games and play them online. For some games, this was supported by publishers as a means to promote their games at retail. In other cases, Mplayer arranged deals with developers to attract gamers with demos of popular games such as Quake and Unreal. The card and board games offered were supplied straight from Mplayer for free through their own software. Game community and market=Competition When Mplayer launched, there were few major online gaming services, but in the late 1990s, it had numerous competitors. Notable competitors were Heat.net (built on a licensed version of Mplayer's core technology), Total Entertainment Network, Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone (later MSN Gaming Zone), GameSpy3D, Kali, Blizzard's Battle.net, and Sierra's Won.net. Furthermore, Mplayer's offering of card and board games had been countered by numerous sites across the internet, including by services like from Yahoo! and GameStorm. Marketing Mplayer's first business model in online gaming was to charge gamers to play. However success was limited, and the company shortly after changed their marketing direction toward offering online play for free with supported advertising. The CEO of Mpath Interactive at the time, Paul Matteucci, put it: \\"It wasn't until we really got it - that it was about building a community around the games - that Mplayer.com took off,\\" speaking on making the games free. It was from here that their model would begin to be based more around the actual community of gamers, and Mplayer would see its number of players climb several-fold. Soon after, Mplayer had become a well- known player in the online gaming industry. As such, most of their marketing was geared toward attracting new gamers through a broader offering of games, as well as taking advantage of the large community they already had. The former can be seen in the hype surrounding the release of high-profile games of the time such as Unreal and Quake II, both of which were to be offered online through Mplayer.com. The company built a family-friendly image in order to appeal to both kids and adults, with chat rooms which were monitored to limit profanity. They also used their Plus service to cater to the more hardcore gamers who did not mind the extra fee. One source describes their presence at E3 2000: > E-3 2000, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, held at the Los Angeles > Convention Center in May 2000, was a multimedia extravaganza. Nowhere was > this more apparent than at the room-sized exhibit housing Mplayer.com, the > premier on-line multiplayer gaming service. And, if the multimedia > electronic action didn't grab your attention, the exhibit itself was sure > to. Here was a mega multimedia presentation all its own. The exhibit, > costing tens of thousands of dollars to design, fabricate, and install, > occupied on three raised floors, where fanatic gamers battled it out on a > dozen big-screen overhead monitors...The design and construction represented > an engineering marvel. Nothing had been left to chance in the exhibit's > design. By creating such an extravagant exhibit at e3, the largest gaming exposition, they sent a message that Mplayer was a major player in the gaming industry. Even at this late date, months before the buyout by GameSpy, Mpath was still aggressively marketing Mplayer. This was despite criticisms that splitting off HearMe took the company's focus away from gaming. Software Mplayer gizmo in a game lobby. Toward the top are user portraits, while the top left is the audio chat. Service was provided through proprietary software, a channel-based lobby and matchmaking client known as gizmo. The design and interface of gizmo was outsourced to two design companies, Good Dog Design and Naima Productions. Upon launching the program, users would choose from a list of games, that would then take them to a universal lobby for that game. From there, users could create their own game channel that would be displayed to everyone. They could also join a created game. The lobby would show a list of rooms, ordered from least to most latency. Green rooms indicate games that were fast enough to be playable, while red rooms were unplayable. The rocket icon indicated the game had been launched. This would bring them to a second private chatroom before entering the game. The channel creator acted as the moderator, who could launch the game and ban players in the lobby as well as change game settings, but could also make someone else a moderator. In some games like Quake, players could join the game after it was launched, but for most this was not possible. Features Mpath integrated many features into Mplayer in an attempt to stay competitive and support its community. Most of these features came with an update to Gizmo in December 1997, among them were voice chat, a chalkboard system in game channels that anyone could view known as ScribbleTalk, a built-in browser known as WebViewer, personal messaging, as well a ratings and rankings system for Plus members. The voice chat only allowed one person to speak at a time, but became extremely successful to the point where half of all Mplayer's service usage was from voice chat. Mpath soon after split off a division to focus on VoIP technologies in early 1999 catering to non-gamers. Ranked games were played in a separate lobby than normal games. Ranking was determined how well you played relative to your opponent's rank. In some games, this rank was only provisional until you played a certain number of games. Later on, the rank icon only appeared after enough games were played. Users could also customize their profiles by choosing a portrait from a set of pictures and edit their profile with HTML, however this feature was removed in later versions of gizmo. GameSpy buyout Despite its success in attracting users, Mplayer was still in financial trouble in late 2000, and it had been speculated the division would be sold off, possibly to Sega, owner of Heat.net. However it was announced in December 2000 that GameSpy, an Irvine-based gaming site founded in 1996, made a deal to acquire Mplayer from HearMe. The two companies had fully merged by June 2001. Included in the deal was the Mplayer POP.X business unit and gaming service, as well as its Globalrankings system, which ranked players in game, and the Mplayer Entertainment Network, their advertising network. This was all sold off by HearMe for USD $20 million and a 10% stake in GameSpy. HearMe was willing to sell off its entertainment division to focus on its more profitable VoIP unit, while GameSpy wanted Mplayer's userbase for its own multiplayer gaming community. There was also the belief at GameSpy that HearMe had been neglecting the service in favor of its other ventures. At the time, GameSpy was looking to start over from its GameSpy3D service with GameSpy Arcade, which was then in beta. Only a few months after the acquisition, many features from Mplayer had been added to their new service.

It ran for seven episodes, each 30 minutes long. The show was a dark science fiction comedy, focusing on the end of the human race on Earth. The title comes from the last line of T. S. Eliot's poem The Hollow Men \\"not with a bang, but a whimper\\"; The concept for the series originates from a self-contained 1986 Radio 4 afternoon play of the same title, from which Mike Grady was the only cast member to reprise his role in the television series. Premise The pilot episode of Not with a Bang begins with a spoof episode of the iconic BBC show Tomorrow's World, (which is also a nod to the opening titles of apocalyptic drama series Survivors) where Judith Hann is presenting a story on how scientists have apparently isolated the hormone that causes aging in humans. The chemical is then accidentally released from a vial and the effect spreads almost instantly, annihilating virtually all human life on Earth, turning people into little piles of an ash-like compound, before dissipating harmlessly. The show then follows the plight of the four human survivors - three male, one female - who survive due to various far-fetched reasons - for example being sealed in a sound-proof booth during a pub quiz when the agent strikes the vicinity. The four characters are united by chance about one year after the event, and set up a base of operations in a country cottage. They then spend the next six episodes looking for other survivors, adjusting to life after the end of the world, and deliberating over the repopulation of the human race. The show relies heavily on a small cast of esoteric characters, including: rugby league fanatic Colin; everyman Brian, who comes closest to being the group's leader; and Graham and Janet, a bland couple who struggle over the issue of having children. Conversation between Graham and Janet frequently features Graham's reluctance and Janet's determination to have children, as well as Graham's extraordinarily low sperm count. The pub name is never mentioned in the show, but the shots from the outside are of the White Hart in the village of Bouth in Cumbria.

Headquartered in Philadelphia, the company's annual local season features six programs of classic favorites and new works, including the Philadelphia holiday tradition, George Balanchine's The Nutcracker™. The company's artistic director is Ángel Corella. Company history Pennsylvania Ballet was established in 1963 by Barbara Weisberger, a protégée of George Balanchine, through a Ford Foundation initiative to develop regional professional dance companies. A Philadelphia cultural institution, the company is noted for its focus on Balanchine repertoire. The company performed in the national spotlight for the first time in 1968 at New York City Center, a debut that led to a decade of national touring, appearances on PBS’s “Dance in America” series, and a stint as the official company of the Brooklyn Academy of Music during the 1970s. In 1982, Pennsylvania Ballet became the first major American ballet company to promote an African-American woman, Debra Austin, to the rank of principal dancer. From 1987 to 1989, Pennsylvania Ballet forged an alliance with Milwaukee Ballet in an unprecedented venture to create one company. The new organization, with 43 dancers, was the first in the country to offer its dancers year-round employment. In 1995, the trustees of Pennsylvania Ballet selected its first home-grown artistic director, Roy Kaiser. A former principal, Kaiser had been hired as a company member in 1979 by Barbara Weisberger. Following his retirement from the stage in 1992, Kaiser served as principal ballet master and associate artistic director under Christopher d'Amboise before being named to his current position. Under Kaiser's leadership, the company has expanded its Balanchine-based repertoire to include new works from both established and emerging choreographers. New works have included premieres of original ballets from choreographers Merce Cunningham, Christopher d'Amboise, Trey McIntyre, Matthew Neenan, David Parsons, Val Caniparoli, Benjamin Millepied, and Christopher Wheeldon, as well as the highly acclaimed 40th anniversary commission of Swan Lake by Christopher Wheeldon and the 2007 world premiere of Matthew Neenan's Carmina Burana. Currently employing 37 dancers, Pennsylvania Ballet annually presents a season of six programs (including George Balanchine's The Nutcracker™ ) that balance classic ballets with new works that challenge the dancers and attract a diverse audience. The company also tours throughout Pennsylvania and the East Coast to venues such as New York City Center and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. It made its international debut at the Edinburgh International Festival in August 2005. In September 2014, Ángel Corella came on as artistic director. Present Fourteen members of Pennsylvania Ballet appeared as the corps in the 2010 film Black Swan. In the 2012–2013 season, the Pennsylvania Ballet performed six productions. These will be performed at the Academy of Music and the Merriam Theater. The company planned to tour to The McCarter Theater in October 2012 and to The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for the Ballet Across America program in June 2013. Along with these performances the Pennsylvania Ballet II, the company's second company, performed outreach and educational performances.

History Seaspeak originated at the International Maritime Lecturers Association (IMLA) Workshop on Maritime English in 1985 in La Spezia (WOME 3), in a project led by Captain Fred Weeks, and was updated in the following years. After the M/S Scandinavian Star disaster in 1990, in which communication errors played a part, an effort was made by the International Maritime Organization to update Seaspeak and the Standard Maritime Communication Vocabulary (SMCV). This resulted in the development of the Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP), which were adopted by the IMO as resolution A.198(22) in November 2001 at their 22nd Assembly.  Example phrase \\"Say again\\"  A good example of the benefit of seaspeak is the use of a single short and carefully crafted phrase to replace a multitude of phrases. Thus the phrase \\"say again\\" could replace any of the following: * Could not hear what you said, please repeat! * I did not understand, say that again. * Too much noise, repeat what you said! * I am having difficulty hearing what you are saying! Please repeat what you were trying to say. * There is too much noise on the line - I cannot understand you. * What did you say?

The company is led by David Devan, who was appointed general director in 2011. History The Opera Company of Philadelphia was established in 1975 with the merger of the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company (PLOC) and the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company (PGOC); two organizations which had competed with one another for many years. Adele W. Paxson, who headed the PLOC, was appointed the first president of the company's board, a position she held for many years. Max Leon, conductor and general manager of the PGOC, became the company's first general manager, and Carl Suppa became the company's first artistic director. All three individuals were largely responsible for arranging, planning, and executing the merger. In 1976 the company presented the world premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti's The Hero.Music: Souvenir Opera, Time, William Bender, June 14, 1976 At the end of the 1977–1978 season both Leon and Suppa left the company. As a result, J. Edward Corn was appointed the company's second general manager; subsequently Julius Rudel became an artistic consultant for the company. In 1980, Corn left the company to become the director of the National Endowment for the Arts' new opera and musical theater program. Margaret Anne Everett, the OCP's director of educational and community services since 1977, was initially appointed the company's acting manager and then officially became the company's third general manager. She remained in that position for fourteen years. In March 1990 Everett resigned from her post and Jane Grey Nemeth, the then director of the OCP's Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition, became the company's acting general director. In January 1991 the company named Robert B. Driver its general director. The company's management structure has changed several times during Driver's time with the company, he previously served as the title artistic director from 2000 to 2004 and general and artistic director from 2004 to 2009. On March 31, 2009 it was announced that Driver would return to the post of artistic director, and David B. Devan, the OCP's managing director since January 2006, would serve as the OCP's executive director. Devan was appointed general director in February 2011. In 2013 the OCP renamed itself Opera Philadelphia and adopted a new logo.

Route description The highway is unusual in that it follows both a north-south and east-west routing (though it is signed as north-south for its entire route). The highway follows the former routing of US 82 and formerly followed the former routing of US 11. Thus, it does not act as a true bypass for either route. Even more strangely, the north-south section parallels US 82, an even-numbered (and therefore east-west) US highway, while the east-west section follows US 11, which is odd-numbered and thus follows a north-south route. The north-south section is named Old Montgomery Highway and Greensboro Avenue while the east-west section was formerly routed on University Boulevard. In 2015, in order to divert traffic from the campus of the University of Alabama, the east-west segment of the route was removed from University Boulevard and diverted onto Veterans Memorial Parkway, which becomes 15th Street at its intersection with US 82.

The illusion occurs when a person underestimates the weight of a larger object (e.g. a box) when compared to a smaller object of the same mass. The illusion also occurs when the objects are not lifted against gravity, but accelerated horizontally, so it should be called a size-mass illusion. Similar illusions occurs with differences in material and colour: metal containers feel lighter than wooden containers of the same size and mass, and darker objects feel heavier than brighter objects of the same size and mass. These illusions have all been described as contrast with the expected weight, although the size-weight illusion occurs independent of visual estimates of the volume of material and the illusion does not depend on expectations, but occurs also if visual size information is only provided while already lifting. The expected weight or density can be measured by matching visible and hidden weights, lifted in the same manner. This gives an expected density of about 1.7 for metal canisters and 0.14 for polystyrene blocks. Density expectations may assist in selecting suitable objects to throw. An early explanation of these illusions was that people judge the weight of an object from its appearance and then lift it with a pre-determined force. They expect a larger object to be heavier and therefore lift it with greater force: the larger object is then lifted more easily than the smaller one, causing it to be perceived as lighter.Müller GE, Schumann F. Über die psychologischen Grundlagen der Vergleichung gehobener Gewichte. Pflügers Arch XLV: 37–112, 1889. This hypothesis was disproved by an experiment in which two objects of the same mass, same cross section, but different height were placed on observers' supported hands, and produced a passive size–weight illusion. Recent studies have also shown that the lifting force quickly adapts to the true mass of the objects, but the size–weight illusion remains. The illusion therefore cannot be explained by the manner of lifting, and must be due to some perceptual rescaling based on prior expectations. The rescaling has been described as sub-optimal (anti-Bayesian), in that the central nervous system integrates prior expectations with current proprioceptive information in a way that emphasises the unexpected information rather than taking an average of all information. It has also recently been suggested that the illusion may not be anti-Bayesian, but may instead rely on more complex yet still optimal inference processes than traditionally suggested. Other models describe the rescaling as partly beneficial, in that it enhances discrimination. Contrast effects are common in many perceptual modalities, and are similar to physiological adaptation. Adaptation can be explained as a change in the gain of the system, the gain being set to the appropriate level for maximum discrimination and for protection against sensory overload. Contrast effects may similarly be related to efficient neural coding. If the selected range is either too high or too low, as in the size–weight illusion, there is both a contrast illusion and a loss of discrimination. It has been found that weight discrimination deteriorates if objects are lighter than their expected density, or heavier than their expected density. Models of this type can account for perceptual rescaling without involving the manner of lifting. It has also been demonstrated that, taking three empty matchboxes, and put a weight in one of them. The weighted box lifted on its own feels heavier than all three boxes lifted together with the heavy one on top.

He founded the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia in 1874. Gilchrist was born in Jersey City, New Jersey to William Wallace Gilchrist and Redelia Ann (Cox) Gilchrist. At the age of eleven months he moved with his family to Philadelphia. His father's business suffered during the Civil War, so young Gilchrist turned to the law and to business for his own living, but eventually decided to take up music as a career. From 1865-68 Gilchrist studied privately with Hugh Archibald Clarke, later a Professor of Music at the University of Pennsylvania.Mendelssohn Club of America website, http://www.mcchorus.org/wp/history With the exception of a short period in Cincinnati, Ohio (1871–1872), he lived in Philadelphia, where he was active as church organist, teacher, and leader of musical clubs. During this time was active as a baritone soloist at Holy Trinity Church on Rittenhouse Square and St. Mark’s Church on Locust Street, soloist with the Handel and Haydn Society in productions of Messiah, Moses in Egypt and Judas Maccabaeus, and participant in a series of light operettas presented by the Amateur Drawing Room. In 1871 he was appointed organist and choirmaster at St. Clement’s Church, and he drew the original Mendelssohn Club members from the choir there. In 1882 Gilchrist won the Cincinnati Festival Prize for his setting of the 46th Psalm, for soprano solo, chorus, and orchestra May Festival website, http://www.mayfestival.com/search-detail.php?N_ID=1561 where the judges included Camille Saint-Saëns and Carl Reinecke. Among his other choral works are Ode to the Sun, Journey of Life, The Uplifted Gates, and Legend of the Bended Bow. He composed two non-programmatic symphonies,A first symphony in C major - see , and a second in D - see , the 2nd symphony published in 2013 in an edition by Lionel Harrison (). and some chamber music, including a nonet for piano, strings, flute, clarinet and horn.About the Nonet in G minor: see e.g. Free Library of Philadelphia Catalog record for material for the Nonet; also (2011 Soundpost edition) and (OCLCs are both links to Free Library of Philadelphia entries- which don't show up under \\"Worldwide libraries...\\"). Date is estimated to ca.1910. In addition to Mendelssohn Club, Gilchrist also conducted the West Philadelphia Choral Society, the Germantown Choral Society, the Harmonia, the Harrisburg Choral Society and the Tuesday Club of Wilmington. He was organist and choirmaster at St. Clement’s, Christ Church in Germantown, and at the Swedenborgian Church of the New Jerusalem. He was a founding member of both Music Manuscript Society and the American Guild of Organists. He was the head of voice instruction at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, and from 1893-1899 he conducted the Symphony Society of Philadelphia. Gilchrist was one of the very few American composers of this period who did not study in Europe. His pupils included Anna Priscilla Risher. His son, William Wallace Gilchrist, Jr. (1879-1926), became a painter of some note.

It is orange or brown with black wing borders and small white forewing spots on its dorsal wing surface, and reddish ventral wing surface fairly similar to the dorsal surface. The ventral hindwings have black veins and small white spots in a black border. The male has a black androconial scent patch on its dorsal hindwings. It is found throughout the tropics and into the temperate regions of the Americas, Asia and Africa. It can be found in meadows, fields, marshes, deserts, and at the edges of forests. This species is possibly a close relative to the similarly colored soldier butterfly (or tropic queen; Danaus eresimus); in any case, it is not close to the plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus) as was long believed. There are seven subspecies. Females lay one egg at a time on larval host plants. Larvae use these plants as a food source, whereas adult butterflies feed mainly on nectar from flowers. Unpalatability to avian predators is a feature of the butterfly; however, its level is highly variable. Unpalatability is correlated with the level of cardenolides obtained via the larval diet, but other compounds like alkaloids also play a part in promoting distastefulness. Males patrol to search for females, who may mate up to 15 times a day. Male organs called hair-pencils play an important role in courtship, with males with lower hair-pencil levels being selected against. These hair-pencils may be involved in releasing pheromones during courtship that could attract female mates. Taxonomy The queen is a member of the genus Danaus, which includes D. plexippus (monarch) and D. eresimus (soldier). It is of the family Nymphalidae of the order Lepidoptera. There are seven subspecies. It is a native of the Nearctic and Neotropical realms. The conservation status of this species is secure, with no reported management needs. Life cycle and morphology Females lay small white eggs one at a time on larval host plants, usually members of the milkweed subfamily Asclepiadoideae. The egg hatches into a black caterpillar with transverse white stripes and yellow spots, and three pairs of long, black filaments. The caterpillar feeds on the host plant and sequesters chemicals that make it distasteful to some predators. It then goes through six instars, after which the larva finds a suitable spot to pupate. The adult emerges 7 to 10 days afterwards. The queen butterfly has multiple generations per year. Egg The queen butterfly oviposits one egg at a time. Each individual egg can be found on leaves, stems, and flower buds of the host. The eggs are usually pale green, but may also be white. It has an ovate conical in shape, a flattened base and slightly truncated top, and is ribbed perpendicularly with raised cross-lines between the ridges. Compared to that of the monarch butterfly, the egg of the queen butterfly is taller relative to its width. Caterpillar A queen caterpillar Comparatively, the mature queen caterpillar is darker and not as brightly colored as the monarch. It is nearly identical to the caterpillars of Danaus chrysippus. In the larval stage, the queen is a bluish white, with a reddish-brown underside. It has three pairs of black, fleshy tentacles—one is on the head, one is on the second thoracic segment and one is on the eighth abdominal segment—but lack spines. When mature, the caterpillar is brown with purplish prolegs. The caterpillar has been observed in the following transverse stripes: blue, green, yellow, white, and blackish brown. The head is black with white rings. There is no hair on the body of the caterpillar. monarch caterpillar and a black swallowtail caterpillar. Pupa The pupa is relatively short and thick, tapering rapidly at the end of the abdomen. It is pale green, rarely pale pink, and is frequently ornamented with golden spots. A black transverse band edged with gold is on the abdomen. Below this black abdominal band lies another one in blue. The pupa has very few projections; most notably, it is suspended by a long cremaster from a button of silk. As such, the pupa resembles a pendant. In general, the pupa of the queen is smaller and more slender than that of the monarch. Butterfly As an adult, the queen has two cousins to which it bears a striking resemblance: the more common monarch (Danaus plexippus) and the soldier (Danaus eresimus). The queen is a moderately large butterfly. It has an average wingspan of to . It is easily distinguishable from its cousin, the monarch, by its darker brown ground colour, and lack of stripes decorating the wings. The queen bears a closer resemblance to its other cousin, the soldier (Danaus eresimus). It boasts a very tough and flexible chitinous exoskeleton, unlike most other butterflies. Wing color varies from bright, fulvous brown to rich chocolate, with black marginal bands that are dotted with white or yellow. The underside of the wing is designed much like the upper wing, except it is more pale. The queen has less prominent veins on its wings and lacks the darker, apical shading found in monarchs. The forewing is generally much larger than the rounded hindwing. Both sexes are morphologically similar. The male's and the female's forewing lengths range from to , with the mean length equaling . The antennae lack scales. Although all danaids have two pairs of walking legs, the forelegs, the first pair located on the prothoracic segment of the abdomen, is stunted and of little use. The forelegs are more atrophied in the male than in the female. The female uses its short forelegs to scratch the surfaces of leaves to determine which ones are suitable hosts for its eggs. On both sexes, only the atrophied forelegs lack claws. However, the male queen has a specialized patch of androconia, or a scent-pouch covered in scales, located on its dorsal hindwing. The position and structure of androconia is used to identify different genera. The male also has one reversibly extensible hair-pencil on each side of its abdomen. Hair-pencils, when in contact with these scales, disseminate pheromones near the female at integral stages of successful courtship. Distribution and habitat The queen belongs to a family (Danaidae) that is common to both New and Old Worlds, specifically found throughout the tropics and into the temperate regions of the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Stray specimens are found in Europe. The queen is chiefly a tropical species. In the US, it is usually confined to the southern portion of the country. It can be found regularly in peninsular Florida and southern Georgia, as well as in the southern portions of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Occasionally, the subspecies of the queen can be found somewhat north, in Kansas, Colorado, and Utah. Periodically, a stray may be found in the Midwest, such as in Missouri. The berenice subspecies is found largely in the Southeast and the strigosus in the Southwest. The queen is also found in Cuba. Queen butterfly feeding on Funastrum cynanchoides, Tucson, AZ It is more common in southern Central America, with numbers beginning to rise in Mexico. The queen can be found as far south as Argentina. Although the queen does not undertake dramatic migrations like the monarch, most undertake short-distance travel at tropical latitudes in areas that have a distinct dry season. During those periods, the queen will fly from lowlands to high elevations. Throughout its distribution, the queen can be found on open land, in meadows, fields, and marshes. It displays a more xeric preference in Hispaniola and will fly to the edge of, but seldom penetrate, hammocks and forests. In the southern US, the queen prefers open woodland, fields, and desert. Most likely they are found wherever milkweeds grow. Food sources and host plants Adult feeding on milkweed plant Larval host plants and food sources The queen larvae feed on Apocynaceae (milkweeds and dogbanes). It can survive on a number of hosts. Common plants include butterflyweed (Asclepias tuberosa) and bloodflower (Asclepias curassavica). In the West Indies, blunt-leaved milkweed (Asclepias amplexicaulis) and honey vine (Cynanchum laeve) are favored. The caterpillar has also been observed on Asclepias nivea, Calotropis procera, and Apocynaceae nerium. Other reported host genera include the Apocynum, Gonolobus, Sarcostemma, and Stapelia. Adult food sources and host plants As an adult, its feeding habits are less specific. The butterfly feeds predominantly on nectar from flowers and dead foliage, but can also feed on rotting fruit, sweat, and dry or wet dung, among other substances. Even as an adult, the queen is drawn to milkweeds (Apocynaceae). However, the butterfly is also attracted to the Nerium, Funastrum, Vincetoxicum, Philabertia, Stapelia. In addition to the above food sources, males are attracted to Heliotropium, Eupatorium, Senecio, and Crotalaria, plants known to contain the alkaloid lycopsamine. The alkaloid and other precursor compounds from these plants are used to create pheromones used to attract mates. Pheromone precursors are predominantly obtained from Boraginaceae, Asteraceae, and Fabaceae. Defense The queen is one of many insects that derives chemical defenses against its predators from its food plant. Most of the toxic cardenolides that make queens so unpalatable to its predators are sequestered from larval host plants. Mimicry in cardenolide- derived defense For quite some time, the queen had been regarded as highly unpalatable to its vertebrate (mainly avian) predators. This is due to the fact that the queen, like its cousin the monarch, feeds largely on Asclepiads. As the queen and the monarch are closely related, it was assumed that the queen also possesses the ability to effectively sequester and store cardenolides present in milkweeds. As such, the queen and the Florida viceroy was long regarded a classic model-mimic example of Batesian mimicry, similar to the relationship exhibited by the monarch and the viceroy. However, the unexpected failure of birds to reject successive queens in an experimental setting called into question the legitimacy of this relationship. In fact, experimental evidence suggested that Florida viceroys could be significantly more unpalatable than representative queens. Because experimental evidence showed sampled queens were significantly less distasteful than viceroys, it was purported that Florida viceroys and queens were Müllerian co-mimics. Furthermore, evidence from this study led to the hypothesis that the queen actually enjoys an asymmetric mimicry relationship, gaining an advantage from flying in the company of the relatively more unpalatable viceroy. =Palatability spectrum= Further experimentation suggested that chemical defense of queens is highly labile. It was shown that queens reared on the high-cardenolide A. curassavica sequester and store levels of cardenolides similar to those found in monarchs. These butterflies were regarded as very distasteful and were largely rejected by avian predators. Furthermore, those that were eaten elicited high rates of distress behavior. However, queens reared on S. clausum, a larval host plant known to be a very poor cardenolide source, contain no detectable cardenolide and are essentially palatable to predators. These highly variable responses of avian predators to queens reared on different plants suggest the existence of a food-plant-related palatability spectrum in Florida queen butterflies. Micro-geographic differences in the environment lead to variation in the dynamics of mimetic relationships even at a local level. Spatiotemporal variation throughout different areas lead to large differences in unpalatability of queens separated by only a few kilometers. This extensive variation supports the idea that automimicy occurs at the intrapopulation level – palatable queens mimic individuals that have higher cardenolide content. By extension, interspecific mimicry is also highly variable. At hydric inland sites, which contain large numbers of A. curassavica, queens and viceroys are distasteful Müllerian mimics of one another, while at coastal sites queens probably serve as the palatable Batesian mimics of viceroys. Noncardenolide-derived defense Queen unpalatability does not directly mirror either food plant or butterfly cardenolide content. Evidence suggests that the interaction of cardenolides and noncardenolides are utilized for chemical defenses in milkweed butterflies. Wild queens that fed upon S. clausum as larvae but had access to adult-obtained compounds, such as the pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) used for pheromone production, were observed to be significantly less palatable to avian predators than butterflies without chemical defenses. As such, these alkaloids, which are known to deter spider predators, may make a substantial contribution to queen distastefulness. Mating A queen butterfly in St. Louis, Missouri Males patrol all day to seek females. Females can mate up to 15 times, a significantly higher number than other members of Lepidoptera. Courtship and mating typically happen in the afternoon. Once a male and a female mate, the butterflies may remain coupled for more than an hour. Mated pairs often rest on foliage high up in a tree. Later, the female will fly closer to the ground than normal to find a suitable host for egg deposition. Courtship During courtship, which occurs while both butterflies are in flight, the male everts his hair-pencils and brushes them against the female's antennae. This act is called \\"hair-pencilling.\\" The secretion associated with these hair-pencils plays an important role in seducing the female. When the female comes to rest, the male hovers closely above her and subjects her to further “hair-pencilling” before alighting next to the female and copulating with her. Afterwards, the two engage in a postnuptial flight - the male flies with the female dangling beneath him. =Pheromone= The chemicals that comprise the pheromone are secreted by trichogen cells, which are located at the base of each hair-pencil. This liquid secretion moves from these cells, through the cuticle of the hairs, to coat the numerous free, cuticular dust particles that adhere to the hair-pencil surface. Two of the chemicals that comprise this secretion have been identified – a crystalline pyrrolizidinone (ketone) and a viscous terpenoid alcohol (diol). The diol imparts a stickiness that allows the secretion to stay on the dust, and the dust on antennae. The ketone is a releaser pheromone, inducing females to mate. Although insufficient levels of ketone present in the dust particle correlates to lower seductive capacity in the male, some males with low levels of ketone – and even some without hair-pencils – have been known to mate successfully with females. This suggests that although hair-pencil pheromones are of major importance, they are not absolutely essential to mating. =Importance of hair-pencils= Many butterflies possess extrusible brushlike structures, called hair-pencils. In the queen, the hair-pencils, which are present in the posterior abdomen in the male, are tucked away when the male is not interacting with the female. As such, these organs are thought to serve as important tools for pheromone dissemination during courtship. Hair-pencils play an important role in courtship success. Although the lack of hair-pencils does not affect the rate at and enthusiasm with which males pursue females, males without hair-pencils experience significantly lower success in achieving copulation. Male queen butterflies with physically normal but chemically deficient hair-pencils also suffer from lower mating success. In addition, adult female queens whose antennae have been blocked are not receptive to advances from competent male queens. However, physical contact between the male's hair-pencil and the female's antennae does not affect a male's mating success. Males without hair-pencils are no less fertile than males with hair- pencils. That actively hair-pencilling males emit a very definite odor that can even be perceived by humans also supports the idea that it is not the hair-pencil itself that is important in courtship, but rather, the pheromone which the hair-pencil transports.

Kindy was born in Warsaw, Poland. His first attempt at entering federal politics was in the 1962 federal election when he ran as an \\"Independent Liberal\\" in the Quebec riding of Maisonneuve—Rosemont. He placed last out of five candidates (including the official Liberal candidate) and won 942 votes. Kindy subsequently joined the Progressive Conservative party and attempted to win a seat from the Quebec riding of Sherbrooke running as \\"Alexandre Kindy\\" in the 1968, 1972 and 1974 elections, placing third on each attempt behind the Liberal and Social Credit candidates. He subsequently moved to Alberta where he won the Tory nomination for Calgary East in the 1984 federal election and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada. He was re- elected in the 1988 federal election in what had become the riding of Calgary Northeast Kindy was known for his anti-Communist views, and opposed the prosecution of Ukrainians and Balts in Canada accused of perpetrating Nazi war criminals during World War II. He and a fellow Tory MP, Andrew Witer, attempted in 1987 to delay the passage of legislation designed to allow the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in Canada. Kindy remained a backbench supporter of the Brian Mulroney government until 1990 when the government attempted to pass the Goods and Services Tax into legislation. Kindy, David Kilgour, and Pat Nowlan all opposed the GST and voted against it in the House of Commons resulting in their expulsion from the Progressive Conservative caucus on April 10, 1990. Kindy continued to sit as a Progressive Conservative MP, though outside of caucus, until May 5, 1993, when he formally became an Independent. He ran for re-election as an independent candidate in the 1993 federal election, and although his stand against the GST was popular with his constituents, he was defeated, coming in fourth place behind Art Hanger of the Reform Party of Canada and the official Progressive Conservative candidate.

Currently, there are two categories of SCVs: protected SCV and as non-protected SCV. New Zealanders who had entered Australia before 26 February 2001 are classified as protected SCV holders, and after that date as non-protected SCV holders. The rights of the two categories are somewhat different. Most New Zealanders are eligible for a SCV, except: * those with significant health problems * those with significant criminal records i.e. being sentenced to more than 12 months' imprisonment combined in total * those who hold temporary or permanent Australian visas * those who arrive in Australia using another passport (e.g. if holding dual nationality). In this case an SCV can be obtained at a Department of Immigration office in Australia upon production of a valid New Zealand passport * those who arrive for specified purposes, such as diplomats and visiting forces, who are normally granted a special purpose visa.  Mechanics  A SCV is granted New Zealander passport holders upon arrival to Australia. Unlike other non-citizens, New Zealanders do not require a visa before travelling to Australia. New Zealanders arriving in Australia are not told they have a visa and ordinarily their passports are not stamped. The SCV ceases when its holder departs Australia for any reason, but a new SCV is granted on return. The SCV is technically classified as a temporary visa, despite its holders residence in Australia not being subject to any limitation as to time imposed by law.  History  The Special Category Visa was created on 1 September 1994 by the Migration Regulations 1994, which created the universal visa system in Australia. Prior to that date, New Zealanders were generally treated as exempt non-citizens in Australia, not requiring a visa for entry. Under the 1994 regulations, New Zealanders entering Australia are treated as having applied for a temporary entry visa, which is automatically granted, subject to health and character considerations, on arrival. Protected SCV Until 26 February 2001, SCV holders were generally treated the same as permanent visa holders. New Zealanders who had entered Australia before 26 February 2001 are now classified as protected SCV holders and retain the same rights as permanent residents. They are eligible for most social security benefits without restriction. They are also eligible to apply for Australian citizenship, provided they meet character and health requirements, without needing to apply for permanent residency. Non-protected SCV In 2001, Australia introduced a number of changes in the rights of SCV holders. New Zealanders who enter Australia after 26 February 2001, remain in Australia to live and work indefinitely are classed as non-protected SCV holders. They have restricted access to social security benefits; e.g. they are eligible for a one-off 6-month unemployment benefit after 10 years of residence under the current rules. They are also required to apply for and obtain Australian permanent resident status before becoming eligible for Australian citizenship. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, many SCV holders were ineligible to access Centrelink payments, prompting many to return to New Zealand. On 30 March 2020, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Special Category Visa holders would be eligible for AU$1,500 fortnightly payments as hardship assistance following negotiations with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.  Permanent resident status  SCV holders fit the commonly understood meaning of the term 'permanent resident' as they are entitled to live in Australia indefinitely, in much the same way as an Australian citizen or a permanent visa holder. However, they are not treated as permanent residents for the purpose of some Australian legislation. Even in federal migration and citizenship law, there is no standard definition of the term and SCV holders are treated inconsistently. Section 204 of the Migration Act 1958 includes all SCV holders within the definition of 'permanent resident' on the basis they are 'not subject to any limitation as to time imposed by law'. The Migration Regulations 1994 exclude all SCV holders from the definition of 'Australian permanent resident', including only permanent visa holders within the definition. The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 empowers the relevant Minister to declare by legislative instrument whether SCV holders are permanent residents for the purpose of the Act. The current legislative instrument includes some SCV holders, while excluding others.  Resident Return Visa  New Zealand citizens who entered Australia before 1 September 1994 (regardless of the purpose of entry) are considered \\"former Australian permanent residents\\", and eligible to apply for a Resident Return Visa (RRV). An RRV can be issued to former Australian permanent residents who wish to restore their permanent residence status. Applicants must demonstrate 'substantial ties of benefit to Australia' and give compelling reasons for any continuous absences of 5 years or more (since their last stay in Australia as a permanent resident, i.e. as a New Zealand citizen entering before 1 September 1994).https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Life/New- http://www.ozkiwi2001.org/2013/09/eligibility-for-a-resident-return-visa/ In the absence of a RRV, the New Zealand citizen will be taken it have made of new entry into Australia.  Additional pathway to permanent residence  Since 1 July 2017, SCV holders who were resident in Australia on or before 19 February 2016 can apply for permanent residence after 5 years in Australia, in a new stream within the Skilled Independent (subclass 189) visa. They must also submit income tax returns which show assessable income at least equivalent to the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold (TSMIT) for the 5-year period (unless they are 'particularly vulnerable'), and pass mandatory health, character and security checks. The application fee for a primary applicant is AU$3,600 plus an additional AU$1,800 per partner/dependent aged 18 or above and AU$900 per dependent under 18.Department of Immigration and Border Protection: An additional pathway to permanent residence for ‘non- protected’ Special Category Visa (SCV) holders New Zealand citizens who are granted this visa are eligible to apply for Australian citizenship after 12 months, in addition to the 5 years as a SCV holder.  Cancellation of SCVs  A SCV can be cancelled by the Minister, normally as the result of criminal behaviour. SCV holders sentenced to imprisonment can be immediately deported on release. As of July 2019, since 2014, nearly 1,600 New Zealanders who had been sentenced to 12 months' jail had their visas cancelled and were deported.Australia looks to further tighten visa requirements Some of these offences date back for a considerable period, and the government is planning to tighten the test further by looking at the potential maximum sentence for an offence instead of what the actual sentence was.

It takes as its themes events during and after the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Historical background The song commemorates the surrender of the town of Carlisle to Prince Charles Edward Stuart, on 18 November 1745, when he invaded England, at the head of a mixed army of Highlanders and Lowlanders, after his victory at Prestonpans. He \\"entered Carlisle on a white horse, with a hundred pipers playing before him, whose shrill music was not calculated to inspire the citizens with confidence in their grotesque conquerors\\", according to Burtons History of Scotland. The episode, recorded in the fourth stanza, of two thousand Highlanders swimming the River Esk, when in flood, on the occasion of the capture of Carlise, is not quite correct. It refers to a later period, when Prince Charles made his disastrous retreat from Derby, and Carlisle had been retaken. It was Scots, and not \\"fell English ground\\" which they reached on that occasion. But Lady Nairne, by combining the two events, produced a very spirited and successful ballad, which takes a high place among later Jacobite songs. Composition and popularisation \\"The Hundred Pipers\\" is attributed to Carolina Nairne, Lady Nairne, a prolific songwriter of the period descending from a Jacobite family. The verses appears in the second edition of her Lays from Strathern (1846). \\"The Hundred Pipers\\" does not seem to have been printed as a song until about 1852, when it was issued at Edinburgh in sheet form, with the music arranged by Elizabeth Rainforth. Rainforth, a soprano singer, appears to have been responsible for introducing it to the public, some five or more years after Nairne's death. Rainforth lived in Edinburgh from 1851 or 1852 to 1856, and contemporary publications post reviews of her performance of the song in the capital; and she published the song with her own (and the now standard) musical arrangement in 1852. The song does not date from the Jacobite period, as is the case with many others now considered in the \\"classic canon of Jacobite songs\\", most of which were songs \\"composed in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but were passed off as contemporary products of the Jacobite risings.\\" The tune has not been satisfactorily traced, and though it is indexed in the Lays as \\"Hundred Pipers\\", no such air is known to exist previous to the date of Lady Nairne's song. Contemporary versions In 1998, Scottish singer Isla St Clair recorded a version of \\"The Hundred Pipers\\" sung in the old style, for her album When the Pipers Play. This version was also included in the film When the Pipers Play, aired by PBS Television in the United States. In 1958 Lord Rockingham's XI had a Number One UK hit with \\"Hoots Mon!\\", a mainly instrumental rock 'n' roll tune (with Scots-inspired interjections including \\"Hoots mon! There's a moose... loose... aboot this hoose!\\") based on the melody of \\"The Hundred Pipers\\".  Lyrics  These lyrics are in Scots. :Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a', :Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a', :We'll up an' gie them a blaw, a blaw :Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a'. :O it's owre the border awa', awa' :It's owre the border awa', awa' :We'll on an' we'll march to Carlisle ha' :Wi' its yetts, its castle an' a', an a'.

Shea Field, is a public use airport in northeastern Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. Owned and operated by Cuyahoga County since 1946, it also serves Lake County and Geauga County. The airport is located 10 nautical miles (12 mi, 19 km) east of downtown Cleveland and sits on the border of three cities: Highland Heights, Richmond Heights and Willoughby Hills. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a general aviation reliever airport for Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.  History  Developed in 1928 by Curtiss Wright and operated until closed a privately owned airport in 1930. The Airport site remained inactive until nearly the end of World War II. In the spring of 1946, the voters of Cuyahoga County approved a general obligation bond issue for the acquisition of the airport in the amount of $510,000. They purchased the Curtiss Wright Field in December 1946. *In September 1949, the 271-acre Curtiss Wright Field, also known as the Richmond Road Airport, was opened for business. The County officially opened the Airport on May 30, 1950. *In the late 1950s, Cuyahoga County hired an engineering firm to develop a master plan for the future of the airport. The plan, created in 1956, called for two runways, hangar facilities and other service area developments for private and business aviation. Shortly thereafter, major expansion of the County Airport began. It included the construction of the first runway in 1959 and later its expansion in 1962. Further development included the acquisition and installation of instrument approach facilities, the construction of a concrete apron and a paved entry road. *In the 1960s, the airport's first two Fixed Based Operators moved in. The growth of air traffic prompted various Airport improvements, and an additional study of land use on and adjacent to the Airport. In 1970, The County purchased a mobile Air Traffic Control Tower and opened one of the only \\"non‑federal\\" Control Towers in the United States. The facility was taken over by the FAA on May 15, 1971. *By the 1980s development of the adjacent land into office space and an industrial park had begun. In 1984, an office building was constructed on the flight line and soon became known as the Destination Building. Expansion of the Airport Industrial Park and Curtis Wright Corporate Center II continued throughout the 1990s. *On October 31, 1991, Aviation Administrator Robert D. Shea, retired after 42 years of dedicated service. In tribute, Cuyahoga County changed the name of the Airport to Cuyahoga County Airport, Robert D. Shea Field. *In 2003 the Airport Division, now under the auspices of the Cuyahoga County Department of Development, was awarded an FAA grant to assist with a Master Plan Update and Runway Safety Area Study Project. Airlines and Destinations=Cargo= Facilities and aircraft  Cuyahoga County Airport covers an area of 640 acres (259 ha) at an elevation of 879 feet (268 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 6/24 with an asphalt surface measuring 5,102 by 100 feet (1,555 x 30 m). The facilities includes 6 office buildings in the Industrial Park, an Administrative Safety and Service complex, 15 hangar facilities and 2 tie down areas to accommodate the 133 based aircraft, a flight school, US Customs, an FAA Air Traffic Control Tower, an 18-hole golf course and an employee base in excess of 2000.

At that time there were 133 aircraft based at this airport: 44% single-engine, 42% jet, 12% multi-engine, and 2% helicopter.

Its name means \\"First Unit\\" and it was formed in 1993 by a merger of several groups and solo artists. They started rapping in English, but later used Swahili as well. Founding members of Kwanza Unit included three of the main hip-hop crews at the time - Villain Gangsters, Riders Posse, and Tribe-X. According to Rhymson, the founding member of Villain Gangsters, the goal of creating Kwanza Unit was to establish Tanzania as a \\"hip hop nation.\\" Kwanza Unit's plan was to follow in the footsteps of Afrika Bambaataa, the African-American hip-hop innovator who built the Universal Zulu Nation. Just as Afrika Bambaataa had done, Kwanza Unit wanted to promote \\"Kwanzanian Nation\\" and ideals. The group created their own ethnic group called Kwanzania which was supposed to be made up of artists, fans, and anyone else who were supporters of their ideas within and outside of Tanzania. Hip-hop was supposed to be the binding force of the Kwanzanian nation in which they had their own way of life, their own values, their own culture, and their own goals. Kwanza unit represented a form of hip-hop nationalism. Just as Afrika Bambaataa tried to inspire efforts to respond to racism and class oppression in the United States, Kwanza Unit wanted to become \\"heroic warriors resisting oppression\\".

One of the members of Kwanza Unit recalled that \\"while we were recording our album we made a pact that non[e] of us would die before we release[d] our project ...\\" but then revealed that \\"[t]hree months later [Nigga One] died in a car crash.\\"Kasumba, Lee. 20 February 2008. \\"Emcee Africa - The Battle Chronicles #2: Tanzania – Mzuka!\\" Africanhiphop.com. http://www.africanhiphop.com/index.php?module=subjects&func;=viewpage&pageid;=286. Accessed 7 March 2008. This implies an allusion to great figures of American hip-hop, such as Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., who died at young ages. Although Nigga One was not murdered, the fact that a pact to stay alive was even necessary suggests a dangerous element to hip-hop. Furthermore, the dominance of the English language in hip-hop created a conundrum for Kwanza Unit. At first, rapping was done in English, but slowly hip-hop transitioned into Swahili, as Kwanza Unit and other Tanzanian musicians began to take more ownership over their work.Malm, Krister and Monika Sarstad. 1997. \\"Rap, Ragga and Reggae in Dar es Salaam: Kwanza Unit.\\" http://www.musikmuseet.se/mmm/africa/ku.html. Accessed 7 March 2008. The roots of Kwanza Unit's mission grew from one of the idolised figures from the United States, Afrika Bambaataa. \\"Not unlike the Afrika Bambaataa model in the U.S., which had introduced youth to both rap music and hip-hop culture in the ghettoes and barrios of New York, KU wanted to promote, 'Kwanza Unit has moved from a family to a tribe or rather an ethnic group called Kwanzania. Kwanzania is not made up of performing artists only but also fans, supporters and everyone who ids down with KU ideas, within and outside Tanzania.\\" ('Ni Wapi Tunakwenda': Hip-Hop Culture and the Children of Arusha by Sidney J. Lemelle) Rhymson the founding member of the group, works to get out the good word about rap in most of his interviews. It is not just for \\"hooligans\\" and there is a deeper message to listen for. \\"A big difficulty is that the society at large thinks that rap is for hooligans. This also makes it hard to get airplay. The media wants positive messages. The thing that is positive to me may not necessarily be positive to you. If the police mistreated me I could curse to ease my tension after having been disturbed by a policeman. If I say that in rhyme, in a poetic way, not necessarily the radio announcer should say this is positive or not. They can always say it's negative to their opinion, cause everybody has a right to their own opinion. In hip hop I can express my views by giving you a challenge, so you come to me the next day and say: What do you mean when you say that?\\" The group has since been disbanded, but some of its members continue doing solo music. Kwanza Unit had several members and line-up changes. Among their members were: * Chief Rhymson(Ramadhan A. Mponjika) * KBC (KSingo) * D-Rob (Robert Mwingira) -died 2002 * Eazy-B (Bernard Luanda) * Bugzy Malone (Edward Margat) * Papa Sav(Makanga Lugoe) * Abbas Maunda *Baraka *Ndoti Mwingira * Fresh-G * Y-Thang * Gaddy * Adili -died 1994 There is also a wider circle of affiliated members referred to as Kwanza Unit Foundation or Kwanzanians.

Wells' The Shape of Things to Come is a 1979 Canadian science fiction film directed by George McCowan, and starring Jack Palance, Barry Morse, Nicholas Campbell, Anne-Marie Martin, Carol Lynley, and John Ireland. Although credited as an adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel of the same name, the film takes only its title and some character names from The Shape of Things to Come, Wells' speculative novel from 1933. The film's plot has no relationship to the events of the book. The book predicts events such as a Second World War and the collapse of social order until a world state is formed, whereas the film involves a high-tech future involving robots and spaceships. The film was an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of such recent successes as Star Wars, and TV series such as Space: 1999 (also starring Morse) and Battlestar Galactica, although the film had only a fraction of the production budget of any of these. Plot Sometime in the future, Earth is recovering from \\"The Robot Wars\\" that devastated the planet seven years earlier. Most of humanity now lives on the Moon within a domed city called New Washington, but their survival depends on an anti-radiation drug called Raddic-Q2 which is manufactured on the distant planet Delta 3. As scheduled, Delta 3 sends a massive cargo ship with a supply of the drug, but the ship crashes into New Washington's dome and causes widespread destruction. The colony leader, Senator Smedley, and science advisor Dr. John Caball, try to contact Nikki, the leader of Delta 3, but instead hear from Omus, the \\"Robot Master,\\" Caball's former apprentice, and the newly self-proclaimed Emperor of that world. Omus states that the crash was a deliberate attack and he demands the people of New Washington recognize his authority as their leader, or else he will send more ships with an invasion force of robots under his control. Smedley refuses to give into Omus' threats and Caball suggests launching the Starstreak against him – an advanced starship designed for both space exploration and defense of the Moon colony, but Smedley goes against the plan since the ship has yet to be fully tested. Caball boards the ship anyway, and prepares it for launch, during which he accidentally exposes himself to a dose of deadly radiation while in the reactor room. With no time to obtain any of the radiation drugs, Caball calls his son Jason to help him pilot the ship. Tagging along are Smeldey's daughter Kim, and \\"Sparks,\\" a teleporting pilot robot that Kim had salvaged from the wreck of the cargo ship and repaired. When they arrive, Caball convinces them of the urgency to stop Omus at all costs. They agree to help steal the Starstreak and set course to Delta 3. Shortly after launch, a malfunction forces the Starstreak to stop at Earth, and the crew separate from the ship to land the forward saucer section on the planet. While Caball conducts repairs, Jason and Kim explore the area hoping to locate an old friend of Caball's named Charley who mans a nearby refueling depot. They are unaware however, of small figures that stalk them in the woods. Jason eventually finds Charley dead and then notices that Kim has disappeared. He and Sparks eventually find her with a group of harmless children who are survivors of the Robot Wars, but with more pressing matters to attend to, Jason decides to leave the kids behind with some food supplies, but promises to come back for them once their mission is complete. Meanwhile, on Delta 3, Nikki has formed a resistance force and tries to take back the Citadel – a massive tower controlled by Omus and his robot minions. Her infiltration attempt fails and Nikki can only pray that help arrives soon. Elsewhere, the Starstreak has left Earth and achieved light speed, but enters a gravity vortex that threatens to destroy the ship. The crew eventually manages to escape the storm with Delta 3 conveniently appearing before them. Upon landing, the crew finds Nikki and her people, but soon a group of Omus' robots surround them. The party is then greeted by a hologram of Omus and Caball demands to meet face-to-face. Omus agrees and has Caball brought before him while Jason and the others plan to sneak inside the Citadel. Omus shows off his latest achievements to his old mentor, and how he was able to turn the mining robots into shock troopers that easily took control of the planet. Caball remains unimpressed and tries to talk Omus into giving up his plan to control humanity. Omus refuses to listen and then dons a transparent helmet where he shows Caball another creation – a spinning disco ball-like device that drives Caball mad with pain and eventually kills him. Once the others finally reach Omus' chambers, Jason finds his father murdered, but Kim reveals that Caball had severe radiation sickness and was about to die soon anyway. A furious Jason then confronts Omus, but Omus' robots take him prisoner. Thanks to Sparks, all the robots suddenly turn on their master and run out of control, allowing Jason and the others to flee the control room. Jason hears from Sparks who has teleported to one Omus' cargo ships and taken over the main computer system. The robot frenzy however, overloads critical systems and explosions begin to rip through the Citadel. Sparks escapes in the cargo ship, while the others make it back to the Starstreak and lift off. They leave Omus sitting in his control room while everything explodes around him. The destruction of the Citadel eventually causes the whole planet to explode. The last scene shows the two ships returning to Earth, with the cargo ship hauling a supply of Raddic-Q2.

He was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Alex Maleev, first appearing in Daredevil vol. 2, #66 (Dec. 2004). He was retconned into being the Kingpin of Crime before Wilson Fisk. His story was told via flashbacks, which were drawn to resemble artwork from the Silver Age of comic books. The climax of Daredevil Vol. 2, #65 (Nov. 2004) alluded to Murdock having been Bont's attorney at one time. This plot thread was dropped however as it was revealed in later issues that Matt refused to be his lawyer. Fictional character biography=The First Kingpin Alexander Bont first made a name for himself when he killed the hero known as the Defender.Daredevil vol. 2, #67 After that, he soon rose up the ranks and became the head of organized crime. The Fixer, the man who ordered the hit on Jack Murdock, paid up to Bont. When Daredevil found this out, he confronted Bont and got him arrested. Bont got out on bail. He later asked Matt Murdock for legal help, but was refused. When he got out, he paid a visit to the Gladiator who had worked for Bont in the past. He ordered Potter to kill Daredevil. \\"I made my rep on the blood of one masked mystery man...I'm not--I am not going to lose it over another one.\\" The Gladiator attacked Daredevil, but was defeated. Daredevil found out that Bont had hired him, and told Bont that he'd see him in jail for this. Bont was found guilty and sent to prison. The last thing he saw before being loaded into the bus was Daredevil perched on top of a nearby building, smirking at him. Bont's Revenge When Bont was released from jail, he was now a bitter old man. He had found out that Daredevil was really Matt Murdock from The Globe and had acquired a possession of Mutant Growth Hormone.Daredevil vol. 2, #69 The world had changed a lot in his absence. Places had changed and his beloved wife died while he was imprisoned. Furious, Bont set out to get revenge on Daredevil. He met up with Melvin Potter again, who refused to work with him. Bont threatened him with the death of his daughter. \\"I've arranged for the murder of your four-year-old daughter. She's never met you, but she'll die because of you. You do what I say.\\" Potter kidnapped Matt Murdock, and was forced to beat him while Bont videotaped it. He then dragged Matt out (in his Daredevil costume) to show the public. When the new White Tiger arrived on the scene and defeated Melvin Potter, Bont took some MGH and threw Matt into a window, savagely beating him and telling him that this was where his father was killed. However, the action, coupled with the overdose of MGH, proved to be too much for Bont.

In the practice of law in the United States, a legal secretary is a person who works in the legal profession, typically assisting lawyers. Legal secretaries help by preparing and filing legal documents, such as appeals or motions. It is not unusual for a larger firm to place managerial duties on a particular legal secretary. Much like a paralegal, a legal secretary is responsible for locating relevant information for cases. This type of person would be called a \\"paralegal\\" in the UK. In the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, a legal secretary is a secretary experienced in working for a law firm or in-house legal department. They assist by giving administrative support to lawyers and are significant members of a team of professionals who work together. The work of a legal secretary varies. They deal with a wide range of challenging legal and business issues, combining their skills with modern technology. In Ceylon, it used to refer to the head of islands legal arms such as the Attorney General's Office and the Legal Draftsman's office during the British colonial period. Educational background There is no specific educational requirement in most U.S. states for legal secretaries. However, unlike an administrative assistant, a legal secretary must be familiar with legal procedures. Many colleges and universities offer programs geared towards this career, however, there is not a degree associated with that of a legal secretary. Rather, students are enrolled in existing legal courses, which have been established for those who wish to pursue a career in law, such as a lawyer or police officer. In the UK, they provide secretarial and clerical support to solicitors, barristers and the law courts. Their primary responsibilities are to deal with correspondence and preparation of legal documents such as wills, divorce petitions and witness statements. A legal secretary should have excellent secretarial skills together with a knowledge of law and legal procedures. They must be computer literate and have a good standard of English. People can acquire the legal skills they need through training companies, local colleges or some law firms are willing to train people themselves.

It oversees development plans of private land-owners as well as activities within the Adirondack Forest Preserve. Development by private owners must be reviewed to determine if their plan is compatible with the park. The agency is headquartered in Ray Brook, New York. History From its inception in 1892, the six-million-acre (24,000 km²) Adirondack Park, which is larger than Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky, and Everglades National Parks combined, has been a battleground between those who would preserve wilderness and proponents of the development rights of property owners. The Adirondack Park Agency was created in an attempt to settle many of these longstanding issues. It has been controversial from the outset. Paul Smiths Visitor Information Center, Heron Marsh from the Barnum Brook Trail The Adirondack Park is unique in that more than half of the land in the park is privately held. The APA was formed in response to a perceived threat to the integrity of the privately held portion, which, at the time, was in the hands of only a few hundred owners. The completion of the Adirondack Northway in 1967 drastically increased the pressure brought by developers for second home developments. The agency's first task was to create a master plan, followed by a zoning map and land use plan. This zoning map breaks the park up into different sections, and the land use that will be allowed on that particular piece of land is determined by the classification that it is given. The classifications are broken up into two sections, private land classification, and state land classification. Private land classifications are the most controversial because they determine what people can do on their own land. The different classifications for private land include hamlet, low-intensity use, moderate intensity use, rural use, resource management use, and industrial use. Citizens living in the park believe that much of the land is incorrectly classified. This is partly because the entire 6 million acres were classified in only eight months. A land classification can be changed through the APA, but it is a long process. Many argue that the whole map should be remade. The land use plan, in particular, ignited a storm of controversy. The idea of non-residents from Albany and New York City dictating to residents of the park what they could and could not do with their own land caused a great deal of resentment among the traditionally independent-minded \\"Adirondackers\\". Anonymous phone calls threatened to burn the homes of APA members, truckloads of manure were dumped on agency land, a man was caught in the act of attempting to burn the new agency headquarters, and one town voted to secede from the park. While most park residents were opponents of the APA, some, notably Clarence Petty, supported it. Initially, the APA handled matters poorly, and sentiment ran strongly against it. Then, in 1972, the Horizon Corporation of Tucson, Arizona, purchased within the park and announced plans to build 10,000 new homes, along with golf courses, and ski areas. Other plans for 4,000 homes on were under development. Suddenly the Park Agency's land use plan looked much more reasonable to many more people, and the continued existence of the agency assured. The work of the APA remains controversial, however, with many of its actions drawing lawsuits from one side or the other. Recent issues have revolved around cell phone towers along the Northway and on Lake George, all- terrain vehicle and snowmobile access to park lands, floating camps and/or houseboats, and, as always, subdivisions. A number of organizations continue to monitor its actions, including the Adirondack Council, the Association for the Protection of the Adirondacks, the Residents' Committee to Protect the Adirondacks and the Adirondack Land Trust.

G. Wells, published in 1933, which speculates on future events up to the year 2106. A long economic slump causes a major war that leaves Europe devastated and threatened by plague. The nations with the strongest air-forces set up a benevolent dictatorship that paves the way for world peace by abolishing national divisions, enforcing the English language, promoting scientific learning and outlawing religion. The enlightened world-citizens are able to depose the dictators peacefully, and go on to breed a new race of super- talents, able to maintain a permanent utopia. Some of Wells’ short-term predictions would come true, such as the aerial bombing of whole cities presented in more detail than in his previous The War in the Air and the eventual development of weapons of mass destruction. Others, such as the withering of state-power and the dissolution of Islam, have not. Plot As a frame story, Wells claims that the book is his edited version of notes written by an eminent diplomat, Dr Philip Raven, who had been having dream visions of a history textbook published in 2106 and wrote down what he could remember of it. It is split into five separate sections or \\"books\\": #Today and Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration Dawns – The history of the world up to 1933. #The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration – 1933–1960. #The World Renaissance: The Birth of the Modern State – 1960–1978. #The Modern State Militant – 1978–2059. #The Modern State in Control of Life – 2059 to New Year's Day 2106. The book was written as a future history. In late 1933 or early 1934, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's failure to implement the New Deal and revive the US economy, and Adolf Hitler's failure to revive the German economy by rearmament causes the worldwide economic crisis to continue for thirty years, concurrently with the war, as described above. Wells predicted a Second World War breaking out with a European conflagration from the flashpoint of a violent clash between Germans and Poles at Danzig. Wells set its date as January 1940, quite close to the actual date of September 1939. Wells's imagined war sharply diverges from the actual war when Poland proves a military match for Germany, in an inconclusive war that lasts ten years. More countries are eventually dragged into the fighting, but France and the Soviet Union are only marginally involved, the United Kingdom remains neutral and the United States fights inconclusively with Japan. The Austrian Anschluss happens during, rather than before, the war. Czechoslovakia avoids German occupation and its President Edvard Beneš survives to initiate the final \\"Suspension of Hostilities\\" in 1950. Wells' prediction was widely off the mark with regard to Spain, which the book assumed would manage to stay away from the violent passions sweeping the rest of Europe. In real life, the Spanish Civil War would become the main focus of these passions, two years after the book was published. Evidently, Wells greatly overestimated the influence of Spanish Liberals such as Unamuno on Spanish society as a whole. Wells correctly predicted that the coming war would involve both sides launching heavy bombings of each other's main cities, and his detailed depiction of the destroyed Unter Den Linden closely predicted its actual fate in the war. However, Wells wrongly assumed that land fighting would quickly bog down, as in World War I, and that the idea of using tanks to develop a war of movement would come to naught. Wells predicted that submarines would become the launching pads for \\"air torpedoes\\" (missiles) carrying weapons of mass destruction, enabling a country to threaten the destruction of places halfway around the world although that actually happened decades after World War II. Wells' predicted war ends with no victor but total exhaustion, collapse and disintegration of all the fighting states and of the neutral countries, which are equally affected by the deepening economic crisis. The whole world descends into chaos: nearly all governments break down, and a devastating plague in 1956 and 1957 kills a large part of humanity and almost destroys civilization. Wells then envisages a benevolent dictatorship, \\"The Dictatorship of the Air\\", which arises from the controllers of the world's surviving transport systems, who are the only people with global power. The dictatorship promotes science, enforces Basic English as a global lingua franca and eradicates all religions, setting the world on the road to a peaceful utopia. When the dictatorship chooses to execute a subject, the condemned person is given a chance to take a poison tablet (modelled on the Hemlock given to Socrates). The achievement of a classless society is not via a Marxist Dictatorship of the Proletariat, an idea that Wells completely rejected. Rather, the working class is massively \\"pulled upwards\\" and completely eliminated in several generations of intensive upward social mobility, in effect leaving a humanity entirely composed of \\"middle class intellectuals\\". The limited amount of physical labor still needed is performed by the world's youths, who undergo two years of \\"labor conscription\\" instead of military conscription, which is no longer needed. Eventually, after about 100 years of reshaping humanity, the Dictatorship of the Air is overthrown in a completely-bloodless coup, the former rulers are sent into honourable retirement and the world state \\"withers away\\". The last part of the book is a detailed description of the utopian world that emerges. The ultimate aim of this utopian world is to produce a world society composed entirely of polymaths, every one of its members being the intellectual equal of the greatest geniuses of the past. The book displays one of the earliest uses of the abbreviation \\"C.E.\\", which Wells explains as \\"Christian Era\\" but it is now more usually understood as \\"Common Era\\"..  Suppression of religion  One of the major aspects of the creation of the World State is the abolition of all organised religion, which is deemed indispensable to give the emerging \\"Modern State\\" a monopoly over education and the complete ability to mould new generations of humanity. The abolition of Islam is carried out by the Air Police, who \\"descend upon Mecca and close down the main holy places\\", apparently without major incident. Eventually, Islam disappears, its demise accelerated by the decay of Arabic and its replacement by \\"an expanded English\\". Some 20 mosques survive, deemed to be worthy of preservation on architectural grounds. The Lebanese-American scholar George Nasser remarked on this aspect of Wells' book: \\"In the 1979 imagined by HG Wells, a self- appointed ruling elite composed mainly of Westerners, with one Chinese and one Black African and not a single Arab member, would establish itself in the Arab and Muslim city of Basra and calmly take the decision to completely extinguish and extirpate the Muslim religion.... In the 1979 of real history, Khomeini's Islamic Republic of Iran came into being\\". Wells' speculations, which may well seem absurd from a more modern point of view, can be much better understood under the impression of the establishment and modernization of the Turkish State under Atatürk in the 1920s and 1930s. There is only a brief reference to the abolition of Buddhism and no reference to any serious problem encountered by the Modern State in eradicating it from East Asia. The most prolonged and formidable religious opposition envisaged by Wells is from the Catholic Church. (There is little reference to Protestants.) The Pope and the entire Catholic hierarchy are gassed unconscious when they bless the new aircraft, built by a revived Fascist Italy. After the Catholic Church is decisively crushed in Italy, it finds refuge in Ireland, \\"the last bastion of Christianity\\". When is subdued there also, the resistance is maintained only in Latin America, under \\"a coloured Pope in Pernambuco\\". Finally that too is put down. Wells gives considerable attention to the fate of the Jews. In this history, an enfeebled Nazi Germany is incapable of systematic murder on the scale of the Holocaust. However, Jews greatly suffer from \\"unorganized\\" persecution, and there is a reference to anti-Jewish pogroms happening \\"everywhere in Europe\\" during the chaotic 1950s. Then, in a world where all nation-states are a doomed anachronism, Zionism and its ambition to create a new state come to naught. In the later struggle between the emerging world state and its opponents, Jews are seen as caught between the hammer and the anvil. Following the launch of its antireligious campaign, the Modern State closes down all kosher butcheries still in operation, while the opening act of the \\"Federated Nationalist\\" rebels opposing the Modern State is to perpetrate a pogrom against Jews in the Frankfurt area. Eventually, in Wells's vision, it is the Modern State's forced assimilation that triumphs and the Jews, who had resisted earlier such pressures, become completely absorbed in the general society and lose their separate identity. Democracy, fascism and communism In the 1930s, especially after the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazi Germany, the survival of European democracy seemed in doubt. Wells, not a great supporter of democracy even in its more robust times, clearly shared that outlook. The future history book, from the vantage point of 2106, notes that at the outbreak of war in 1940, France was still a Parliamentary Democracy, the implication clearly being that it was an outmoded form of government on its way out. The visionary Gustave de Windt, setting out the blueprint for the coming \\"Modern State\\", rejects categorically \\"The Principle of Opposition\\", which by definition rules out Parliamentary Democracy. Wells' posterity remembers fascism more as ridiculous and stupid than as horrible. In the war envisioned in the book, an enfeebled Nazi Germany got bogged down in its war with Poland and never achieved vast conquests or engaged in The Holocaust but finally collapsed and disintegrated (no mention is made of Hitler's ultimate fate, and the historian of 2106 clearly considers it to be unimportant). Nazism disappears without a trace, and an attempt to revive Italian Fascism is easily swept away by the triumphant Modern State. The book notes that many people who were Fascists or Nazis in their early years had become staunch adherents of the Modern State in the more mature part of their lives. That posterity remembers Stalin as having been narrow and limited in his understanding but not as a bloody dictator. The Soviet Union is less affected than other countries by the worldwide chaos and disintegration of the late 1940s and the 1950s. With the rise of the Modern State, Russia experiences a bloodless takeover by the pilots and other skilled technicians, who displace the Communist Party bureaucrats and eagerly assimilate into the new worldwide state. In the transition time, the old Hammer and Sickle is displayed side by side with the Modern State's Winged Disk. Altogether, of the three competing systems of government (Democracy, Fascism and Communism) only the last would be remembered by Wells' Modern State as having been to some degree a predecessor of itself. Relation to Brave New World As noted by Nathaniel Ward Nathaniel Ward \\"The visions of Wells, Huxley and Orwell - why was the Twentieth Century impressed by Distopias rather than Utopias?\\" in Ophelia Ruddle (ed.) Proceedings of the 2003 Annual Multidisciplinary Round Table on Twentieth Century Culture\\"The Shape of Things to Come was published two years after Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. The two share the same basic outline of humanity's future: a massive war leaves the world in ruins, a self- appointed elite takes over, rebuilds the world and engages in very thorough social engineering to refashion human society completely. Wells explicitly acknowledges that relationship in the book itself; when the future history book discusses the \\"Dictatorship of the Air\\" and its leadership, it is noted, \\"As Aldous Huxley, one of the most brilliant of the reactionary writers, foretold of them, they tidied up the world\\". The crucial difference is in the kind of future society built up in the two books. The future society envisioned by Huxley is rigidly hierarchical, divided into five psychologically-conditioned castes, ranging from the highly intelligent and assertive Alphas on top to the subservient and moronic Epsilons at the bottom. As Huxley's cynical administrator Mustafa Mond asserts, such moronic underclasses are absolutely essential as society's \\"gyroscope\\" - a society composed entirely of intelligent and assertive \\"Alphas\\" would inevitably collapse in all-out conflict since all members would seek to improve their position at the expense of the others'. It was that vision that Wells believed would cause Huxley to be remembered by posterity as a \\"reactionary writer\\". Much of Shape of Things to Come is devoted to demonstrating that the century- long dedicated and intensive work by an elite possessing complete control of world education can make such a society of intelligent and assertive \\"Alphas\\" harmonious and functional, with no underclasses. Adaptations Wells loosely adapted the novel for the screenplay of the film Things to Come, produced by Alexander Korda and directed by William Cameron Menzies, and released in 1936. It also takes elements from Wells's non-fiction book The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (1931). The film stars Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson, Cedric Hardwicke and Margaretta Scott. H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come is a Canadian science fiction motion picture first released in May 1979. Although credited to H. G. Wells, the film takes only its title and some character names from the original source material. The film's plot has no relationship to the events of the book. The film was an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of such recent successes as Star Wars, and TV series such as Space: 1999 and Battlestar Galactica, although the film had only a fraction of the production budget of any of these. Big Finish Productions released a 2017 audio adaptation loosely based on the novel, adapted by Guy Adams, starring Nicola Walker and Sam Troughton and directed by Lisa Bowerman. This version presents events as taking part in an alternate timeline which Raven is shown, rather than the dreams of the original novel. Influence on later science fiction Theodore Wein. pointed out that \\"Wells' Things to Come was at its most influential in the six years between its publication and the moment when the course of its predicted war was overtaken and overshadowed by the actual fast-unfolding events of the Second World War. These same years of the 1930s were the time of incubation for the people who were destined to become the greatest names in Science Fiction, the time when they read ravenously any SF on which they could lay their hands and started to formulate their own ideas. It is not surprising that traces of Things to Come are clearly visible in what they wrote in the 1940s and 1950s.\\" Among such great names of Golden Age Science Fiction, Wein noted Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein and Poul Anderson, and he enumerated in the work of all three – as well of some lesser known SF writers – some influences which could be traced to \\"Things to Come\\". Rex Warner's dystopian novel The Aerodrome (1941) is partly a fictional critique of The Shape of Things to Come, with Wells' \\"Air Police\\" transformed into the fascistic \\"Airmen\\".\\" In a literary response to Things to Come, Rex Warner's allegorical novel The Aerodrome (1941) is, alas, little known. Its Air Vice- Marshal, who rejects the human world as it is...proposes the training of \\"a new and more adequate race of men\\": the Wellsian program exactly\\". Leon E. Stover, Science Fiction From Wells To Heinlein. Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland, 2002. (p. 45) Wells depicted the European social scientist Gustave De Windt sitting down at the British Museum Library and setting out the precise blueprint for a transformation of the world which he would not live to see. This, in Theodore Wein's opinion, may have inspired Isaac Asimov's character Hari Seldon. Wein noted: \\"Wells' De Windt, conducting his library research in London, capital of the declining British Empire, realized that the world was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Wells's book details how De Windt's disciples, the Modern State Society, set about implementing De Windt's vision. Asimov's Seldon conducted his library research in the Imperial Library of Trantor, capital of the declining Galactic Empire. He realized that the Galaxy was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Asimov's Foundation Series details how Seldon's disciples, the First Foundation and the Second one, set about implementing Seldon's vision.\\". Wein also points to Wells' \\"Encyclopaedic organization which centres upon Barcelona, with its seventeen million active workers\\" which is tasked with creating \\"the Fundamental Knowledge System which accumulates, sorts, keeps in order and renders available everything that is known\\" as a possible inspiration for Asimov's Encyclopedia Galactica, whose compilation was the original task of the First Foundation and quotes from which are sprinkled throughout the Foundation Series. The British Wells had the planes of the emerging World State overfly Washington, D.C. and undermine the authority of the President of the United States. A decade later, the American Robert Heinlein wrote \\"Solution Unsatisfactory\\" in which planes of the International Patrol do the same. Later, Heinlein upgraded the International Patrol into an Interplanetary Patrol, a self-appointed elite of highly motivated and rather puritanical spacemen reminiscent of those enforcing Wells' \\"Dictatorship of the Air\\". Wells depicted \\"Federated Nationalists\\" who had banded together only so that they could fly at each other's throats once they had smashed the budding world government. Poul Anderson in his early future history, The Psychotechnic League, depicted precisely the same kind of Nationalists violently opposing the United Nations' efforts to make itself a true world government and rebuild the war-torn world.

Founded in 1981, it is one of the oldest gay men's choruses in the United States, and is a cultural fixture in Philadelphia. The Chorus is affiliated with the Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses (GALA). The Chorus has performed with the Rainbow Chorale of Delaware and the Anna Crusis Women's Choir, and has participated in several GALA festivals. The chorus is currently under the artistic direction of Joseph J. Buches. History The Philadelphia Gay Men’s Chorus traces its history to 1981, when founder Gerald Davis and three other members toured Philly’s gay bars at Christmastime, singing carols. The chorus gave its first official concert performance on April 25, 1982, at the DCA club (now Voyeur) in Philadelphia. PGMC grew modestly but steadily throughout the 1980s. In 1987, it performed outside Philadelphia for the first time in a joint concert with the Baltimore Gay Men's Chorus. Three years later, PGMC performed for the first time at the historic Academy of Music along with \\"HeartStrings,\\" a national AIDS benefit concert tour that featured Sandy Duncan and Jason Bateman. The Chorus incorporated as a non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable organization on July 25, 1990. Throughout the 1990s, membership ranged from 20 to 60 voices as the organization continued to raise its profile in the local performing-arts and gay communities. Among the decade's highlights: the 1992 AIDS benefit concert, \\"Song for Life,\\" featuring local television celebrity Sally Starr and Juanita Holiday; a performance at the inaugural PrideFest celebration, now Equality Forum, in 1993; and the first joint performance with other gay choruses in the Greater Philadelphia region, featuring singer Marilyn Horne, in 1995. In December 1997, the chorus became the first LGBT musical group to perform in the Philadelphia City Council chambers in City Hall, and PGMC's small ensemble, Brotherly Love, sang at the dedication of the William Way Community Center, in which the chorus was one of the first tenants. The new millennium saw continued growth in PGMC's size and prominence. In 2000, the Chorus was asked to perform at an awards ceremony honoring Tony Award-winning British actor Sir Ian McKellen. In 2001, PGMC performed for the first time with Philadelphia's oldest and largest amateur chorus, the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia, in a joint performance of Arnold Schoenberg's \\"A Survivor from Warsaw.\\" PGMC's performance at the dedication of the National Constitution Center on July 4, 2004 aired nationally on C-SPAN. The Philadelphia Phillies invited the chorus to sing the national anthem for Gay Day at Citizens Bank Park in 2005 and more recently on August 28, 2012. In June 2006, PGMC performed for the first time at the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts to launch its 25th anniversary year. The concert featured the world premiere of \\"Open Road,\\" PGMC's first exclusively commissioned work, written by composer Dr. Robert Maggio. In the spring of 2007, PGMC traveled to Washington, D.C., for a joint concert with the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, D.C., and the chorus returned to the Kimmel Center for its June concert that same year. The 2007-08 concert season concluded with \\"The Circle of Our Lives: Music That Unites,\\" a concert that brought together seven gay, lesbian, and bisexual choruses from throughout the tri-state Pennsylvania/New Jersey/Delaware region. PGMC's first broadcast performance occurred in December 2008, when Brotherly Love performed a song from PGMC's 2008 holiday concert on \\"The 10! Show\\" on NBC10 (WCAU Philadelphia). The chorus has participated in every quadrennial GALA Choruses Festival since GALA Festival III in Seattle in 1988. At GALA Festival 2008 in Miami, PGMC performed \\"Open Road\\" for the first time outside Philadelphia. Recordings In 1997, the Chorus produced its first commercial recording, The Spirit Says Sing. In April 2006, the Chorus produced a second recording, entitled Open Road, featuring the commissioned piece of the same title by composer Dr. Robert Maggio. December 2007 saw the release of Holiday Delights, PGMC's first collection of songs celebrating Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.

Retrieved 14 February 2018 he also released four albums under his own name. He later practiced as a lawyer. Early life Tom Rapp was born in Bottineau, North Dakota. His parents, Dale and Eileen Rapp, were both school teachers, and his father became a heavy drinker often absent from their home. He had two sisters. When Rapp was a young child the family moved to Minnesota, where at the age of six he was given a guitar. A neighbour who was a country and western musician taught Rapp some chords, and he also learned to play the ukulele. He began writing songs, and (according to a local newspaper cutting kept by his mother) once came third in a talent contest in Rochester when he was aged eight, where Bobby Zimmerman, probably the boy who was later known as Bob Dylan, came in fifth.Tom Rapp, \\"Notes on the Album\\", One Nation Underground, 50th anniversary reissue CD, DC-659CD, 2017 The Rapp family moved from Minnesota to Pennsylvania before settling in Eau Gallie, Florida, in 1963.Kris Needs, \\"War & Space\\", Shindig! magazine, no.73, November 2017, pp. 48–54 Tom Rapp graduated from Eau Gallie High School in 1965. Music career, 1965–1976 In Florida, Rapp became a fan of Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Woody Guthrie and Bessie Smith, and formed Pearls Before Swine in 1965 with high school friends Wayne Harley, Roger Crissinger, and Lane Lederer. On the basis of thinking \\"if they'll record The Fugs, they'll record us\\", the following year they sent demo recordings to ESP-Disk Records in New York. The label agreed to record the band's first album, One Nation Underground, predominantly consisting of Rapp's own songs and produced in New York by Richard Alderson. Rapp sang and played lead guitar. He said: \\"We were just kids from Florida and everything was so hip, we thought we might faint.\\" The record sold an estimated 200,000 copies, but Rapp said that \\"We never got any money from ESP. Never, not even like a hundred dollars or something. My real sense is that he (Bernard Stollman) was abducted by aliens, and when he was probed it erased his memory of where all the money was\\". After their second album, the experimental and anti-war themed Balaklava, often regarded as the group's finest, the group split up. By the time of the third Pearls Before Swine album, These Things Too for Reprise in 1969, the other original members of the group had left, but Rapp retained the group name for recordings. At this time, Pearls Before Swine did not exist as a performing band. The next three Pearls Before Swine albums, The Use of Ashes (1970), City of Gold (1971), and Beautiful Lies You Could Live In (1971), contain some of Rapp's best songs, and were recorded with his Dutch wife Elisabeth and top session musicians in Nashville and New York City. He toured with Buddy Guy, Gordon Lightfoot, Chuck Berry and Bob Dylan, but turned down the opportunity to appear at the Woodstock festival. Rapp's lyrics \\"told hard truths about the human condition\\"; they were sometimes confrontational and cynical, but often embraced a \\"whimsical brand of mystical humanism\\". Review of Tom Rapp & Pearls Before Swine, 'City Of Gold/… Beautiful Lies You Could Live In', Fatea Records. Retrieved 14 February 2018 His songs included \\"Rocket Man\\", which inspired Bernie Taupin and Elton John's song of the same name. The album Familiar Songs (1972) was his first credited solo album, but was in fact a collection of demo recordings released by the record company without his knowledge. After moving from Reprise to Blue Thumb Records, he released two further albums under his own name, Stardancer (1972) and Sunforest (1973). Although these were issued as solo albums, they included recordings by a new version of Pearls Before Swine which from 1970 did tour and perform widely, once opening for Pink Floyd, as well as containing Rapp's solo recordings with session musicians. Between 1974 and 1976, Rapp performed as a solo singer- songwriter but did not record. Rapp later considered that the contracts he signed with his manager, Peter H. Edmiston, were a mistake as they allowed Edmiston to control Rapp's relationships with record companies and accrue all the financial benefits. Rapp said: \\"Any of the money he made... was gone. He had taken all that. It would have been a different life if I'd gotten all the money I was supposed to have gotten.\\" Rapp estimated that his total net income from music during his active career had been about $200. After a final show as a supporting act to Patti Smith, he retired from music in 1976. Later life and career Rapp then worked as a theater receptionist and projectionist in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and New York, before entering higher education. He graduated in economics from Brandeis University in 1981, and then studied at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, graduating in 1984 and becoming a civil rights lawyer. He described his legal work as an extension of his politically-attuned music, his areas of expertise including judicial estoppel and finding constitutional grounds upon which to challenge corporate actions. Gene Weingarten, \\"The Lawyer's Song\\", Washington Post, May 17, 1998 . Retrieved February 14, 2018 He later lived and worked in Philadelphia and Florida. In 2008, it was reported that Rapp and another attorney sued in federal court to reverse their termination as county government lawyers. \\"Song of the Week: Rocket Man\\", Ralston Creek Review, July 20, 2016 After being interviewed in 1993 by the magazine Dirty Linen,Lahri Bond, \\"Tom Rapp & Pearls Before Swine\\", Dirty Linen no.50, February 1994 and later contacted by Phil McMullen of the magazine Ptolemaic Terrascope, he reappeared in 1997 at Terrastock, a music festival in Providence, Rhode Island, with his son's band, Shy Camp.

The League changed its name to the Non-Partisan Political League of Canada: Alberta Branch in 1917 as it prepared to move into federal politics. The party changed its name yet again to the Farmers Non-Partisan Political League. The League was formed to promote the active interest of farmers in the political arena, because it was felt that the Liberal and Conservative parties, federal and provincial, were not serving the interests of farmers. The Non-Partisan League conducted extensive meetings with interested farmers across rural Alberta and was socialist in inclination under the influence of William Irvine.Rise to power, Alberta online encyclopedia, Heritage Community Foundation In the 1917 provincial election, four League members stood as candidates: Louise McKinney in Claresholm, James Weir in Nanton, J.E. Hillier in Pincher Creek and John W. Leedy in Gleichen. As well, there were several affiliated independent and labour candidates (through the NPL co-sponsored Labor Representation League), such as Lorne Proudfoot. McKinney and Weir were elected and sat in the legislature, while Hillier finished third in a tight three-way race and Leedy placed third. In the months that followed, the party became active in federal politics. The decision was made at a 1917 convention in Calgary. The Non-Partisan Political League of Canada was founded. It nominated three candidates in the December 1917 federal election, all running in Alberta ridings. None were elected. The league continued organizational efforts for the next few years, gathering a sizeable campaign fund, holding townhalls and increasing its membership. The league's political activities and its two successes pushed the United Farmers of Alberta to either enter electoral politics or face being eclipsed by the NPL. The UFA decided to launch a political arm and, in 1919, absorbed the NPL. The ground work and organization done by the league helped the UFA win a 1919 provincial by-election, a 1921 federal by-election, the 1921 provincial election, when it was elected government of the province, taking a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, and an almost-clean sweep of Alberta seats in the 1921 Canadian federal election.

The object is to put all the pieces into matching holes on the board (pushed down) before the time limit runs out. When time runs out, the board springs up, causing many, if not all, of the pieces to fly out. In the most common version, there are 25 pieces to be placed into a 5×5 grid within 100 seconds.  History  The original Perfection game was patented by the Harmonic Reed Company (later Reed Toys) in 1973. The patent was later transferred to Lakeside Industries before being purchased by Milton Bradley.  Gameplay  In the original version, one player at a time attempts to fit all 25 shapes into the holes in the game tray. The shapes are mixed and placed next to the game unit with handles facing up, the pop-up tray is pushed down, and the timer dial is set to 60 seconds. After moving the switch to START, the timer begins to run and the player must fit the shapes into their holes as quickly as possible. If the player completes this task, he/she moves the switch to STOP and records the time taken. If time runs out, the tray pops up and scatters the pieces in all directions. The winner is the player who fills the tray in the shortest time.  Original 1973 version  The original Perfection game consists of a red and yellow board with 25 shapes. Its \\"pop-up\\" mechanism was an ejector plate situated under the shaped holes and lowered by a PUSH button. The board also included a scoreboard with four stackable pegs of different colors. One point was scored for each shape properly placed in their correct holes; if all 25 shapes were inserted before the allotted 60 seconds, one point was also scored for each remaining second left on the clock. For tie scores, pegs were stacked on top of one another. The original version also included red \\"block-out\\" squares that were used one of two ways. For beginners and younger players, a chosen number of holes were covered and their corresponding shapes were removed. For advanced players, a chosen number of holes were covered, but all shapes were kept in play. In 1975, the game was changed to its current \\"pop-up tray\\" format in which the scoreboard and pegs, red block-out squares and four-point star shape were removed.  Game variants  *Superfection (1975): In this advanced version of Perfection, the object is to assemble 16 two-piece puzzle cubes and place them in the tray within two minutes. *Challenge Perfection (1978): Two to four players play against each other to be the first to fill their base of 18 shapes first. However, the bases are different so that one player could take a piece needed by another player. This version does not feature the pop-up mechanism. *Head-To-Head Perfection (1987): Two players compete to insert 25 shapes (in a format similar to Superfection) in their pop-up tray first and in the shortest time. Each player has a pop-up bar in front of their base; whoever completes their board first presses the bar to pop-up the opponent's tray and scatter the pieces.  Popular piece names  Rereleases  In 1992, the game was relaunched with a new jingle for television advertisements, \\"Pop Goes Perfection\\", to the tune of \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\".

Plumwood spent her academic life arguing against the \\"hyperseparation\\" of humans from the rest of nature and what she called the \\"standpoint of mastery\\"; a reason/nature dualism in which the natural world—including women, indigenous people, and non-humans—is subordinated.Davion, Victoria (Fall 2009). \\"Introduction\\", Ethics and the Environment, 14(2), Special Issue on Ecofeminism in Honor of Val Plumwood.

ABC, c. 00:03:10; also see . Plumwood's posthumously published The Eye of the Crocodile (2012) emerged from her survival of a saltwater crocodile attack in 1985, first described in her essay \\"Being Prey\\" (1996). The experience offered her a glimpse of the world \\"from the outside\\", a \\"Heraclitean universe\\" in which she was food like any other creature. It was a world that was indifferent to her and would continue without her, where \\"being in your body is—like having a volume out from the library, a volume subject to more or less instant recall by other borrowers—who rewrite the whole story when they get it\\". Early life and education alt= Plumwood was born Val Morell to parents whose home was a shack with walls made of hessian sacks dipped in cement. After obtaining a land grant, her parents had set up home in the Terrey Hills, near the Ku-ring- gai Chase National Park, north of Sydney. Her father worked at first as a hod carrier, then started a small poultry farm. According to Martin Mulligan and Stuart Hill, the beauty of the area made up for Plumwood's lack of toys. The poultry farm failed, and when she was ten the family moved to Collaroy, another northern Sydney suburb, where her father found work in the civil service.. They moved again to Kogarah in southern Sydney. Plumwood attended St George Girls High School in Kogarah, where she was dux of the school.Saunders, Alan (15 March 2008). \\"Philosophy and the Natural World - Val Plumwood\\", \\"The Philosophers Zone\\", ABC (audio, c. 2:40 mins. Offered a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend the University of Sydney, she turned it down for a Teacher's Scholarship instead, also at Sydney—her parents wanted her to do something practical—although she soon became interested in philosophy.. Plumwood's studies were interrupted in 1958 by her brief marriage to a fellow student, John Macrae, when she was 18 and pregnant, a marriage that had ended in divorce by the time Plumwood was 21. The couple had two children, both of whom died young. Their son, John Macrae, was born when Plumwood was 19 and died in 1988 after an illness. Their daughter, Caitlin Macrae, born in 1960 and given up for adoption when she was 18 months old, was murdered in her teens..Mathews, Freya; Rigby, Kate; Rose, Deborah (2012). \\"Introduction\\", in .For the children's names, see McGuirk, Rod (8 March 2008). \\"Val Plumwood, 68, feminist, activist for the environment\\", Associated Press.

Plumwood resumed her studies at Sydney in 1962, this time with a Commonwealth Scholarship to study philosophy, and graduated with first-class honours in 1964. Personal life and activism Plumwood, fourth from the left, 2004, at the home she built with Richard Sylvan near Plumwood Mountain Toward the end of her undergraduate studies Plumwood married another fellow student, the philosopher Richard Sylvan (then known as Richard Routley), and changed her name to Val Routley. They spent time travelling in the Middle East and UK, which included living near a beech forest in Scotland for a year. Returning to Australia, they became active in movements to preserve biodiversity and halt deforestation, and helped establish the trans- discipline known as ecological humanities. Referred to as Routley and Routley, from 1973 to 1982 they co-authored several notable papers on logic and the environment, becoming central figures in the debate about anthropocentrism or \\"human chauvinism\\". Together they wrote the influential book The Fight for the Forests (1973), which analysed the damaging policies of the forestry industry in Australia. The demand for the book saw three editions published in three years.Rose, Deborah Bird (2013). \\"Val Plumwood’s Philosophical Animism: attentive interactions in the sentient world\\", Environmental Humanities, 3, (pp. 93–109), p. 94; . In 1975 the couple built their home near Plumwood Mountain on the coast, 75 km from Canberra, an octagonal stone house on a 120-hectare clearing in a rainforest.. They divorced in 1981. Plumwood continued living in the house and changed her name again after the divorce, this time naming herself after the mountain, which in turn is named after the Eucryphia moorei tree. Routley changed his surname to Sylvan (\\"of the forest\\") when he remarried in 1983; he died in 1996. Plumwood held positions at the University of Tasmania, North Carolina State University, the University of Montana, and the University of Sydney. At the time of her death, she was Australian Research Council Fellow at the Australian National University. She was found dead on 1 March 2008 in the house she had built with Sylvan; she is believed to have died the previous day, after suffering a stroke.\\"Snake blamed as academic found dead\\", Australian Associated Press, 3 March 2008. \\"Val Plumwood died of natural causes: friend\\", Australian Associated Press, 6 March 2008. Woodford, James (8 March 2008). \\"Philosopher as prey, a life of survival\\", Sydney Morning Herald. Views=Human/nature dualism Plumwood (right) and Sky Kidd, 2007 Plumwood's major theoretical works are her Feminism and the Mastery of Nature (1993) and her Environmental Culture: the Ecological Crisis of Reason (2002). She critiqued what she called \\"the standpoint of mastery\\", a set of views of the self and its relationship to the other associated with sexism, racism, capitalism, colonialism, and the domination of nature. This set of views, she argued, involves \\"seeing the other as radically separate and inferior, the background to the self as foreground, as one whose existence is secondary, derivative or peripheral to that of the self or center, and whose agency is denied or minimized.\\" She identified human/nature dualism as one of a series of gendered dualisms, including \\"human/animal, mind/body ... male/female, reason/emotion, [and] civilized/primitive\\", and argued for their abandonment, as well as that of the Western notion of a rational, unitary, Cartesian self, in favour of an ecological ethic based on empathy for the other. In doing so, she rejected not only the \\"hyperseparation\\" between self and other, and between humanity and nature, but also postmodern alternatives based on a respect for absolute difference and deep ecological alternatives based on a merging of the self and the world. Instead, she proposed a view that recognizes and grounds ethical responsibility in the continuities and divisions between subject and object, and between people and the environment. Plumwood was a vegetarian, her affirmation of the ecological significance of predation notwithstanding, on account of her objection to factory farming. She advocated a semi-vegetarian position she labelled Ecological Animalism, in opposition to the animal rights platform of Carol J. Adams, which Plumwood called ontological veganism and which she criticised for its endorsement of human/nature dualism. Crocodile attack In \\"Human vulnerability and the experience of being prey\\" (1995), Plumwood describes how she survived an attack by a saltwater crocodile on 19 February 1985, and her experience of a paradigm shift from what she called the \\"individual justice universe\\", where humans are always the predators, to the \\"Heraclitean universe\\", where we are just another part of the food chain.Plumwood, Val (March 1995). \\"Human vulnerability and the experience of being prey\\", Quadrant, 29(3), pp. 29–34 (courtesy link). Also published as During a visit to Kakadu National Park, Plumwood had camped at the East Alligator ranger station and borrowed a four-metre-long, fibreglass canoe from Greg Miles, the park ranger, to explore the East Alligator Lagoon.. > When I pulled my canoe over in driving rain to a rock outcrop rising out of > the swamp for a hasty, sodden lunch, I experienced the unfamiliar sensation > of being watched. Having never been one for timidity, in philosophy or in > life, I decided, rather than return defeated to my sticky caravan, to > explore a clear, deep channel closer to the river I had travelled along the > previous day. ... I had not gone more than five or ten minutes back down the > channel when, rounding a bend, I saw ahead of me in midstream what looked > like a floating stick – one I did not recall passing on my way up. As the > current moved me toward it, the stick appeared to develop eyes. Crocodiles do not often attack canoes, but this one started lashing at it with his tail. Plumwood grabbed some overhanging branches, but before she could pull herself up, the crocodile seized her between the legs and dragged her under the water, a \\"centrifuge of whirling, boiling blackness, which seemed about to tear my limbs from my body, driving waters into my bursting lungs.\\" The crocodile briefly let her go, then seized her again, subjecting her to three such \\"death rolls\\" before she managed to escape up a steep mud bank. Despite severe injuries – her left leg was exposed to the bone, and she found later that she had contracted melioidosis – she began walking, then crawling, the three kilometres to the ranger station. The park ranger had gone searching for her when she failed to return by nightfall and heard her shout for help. She underwent a 13-hour trip to the hospital in Darwin, where she spent a month in intensive care followed by extensive skin grafts.Val Plumwood. \\"Taken by a crocodile\\", as told to Michelle Hamer, The Age, 12 January 2004.. The canoe is now in the National Museum of Australia.\\"Val Plumwood canoe\\", National Museum of Australia. The experience gave Plumwood a glimpse of the world \\"from the outside\\", a world that was indifferent to her and would continue without her: \\"an unrecognisably bleak order\\" – \\"As my own narrative and the larger story were ripped apart, I glimpsed a shockingly indifferent world in which I had no more significance than any other edible being. The thought, This can't be happening to me, I'm a human being. I am more than just food! was one component of my terminal incredulity. It was a shocking reduction, from a complex human being to a mere piece of meat. Reflection has persuaded me that not just humans but any creature can make the same claim to be more than just food. We are edible, but we are also much more than edible.\\" She argued that our anthropocentric view, the \\"individual justice universe\\", is disconnected from reality: > [I]n the individual justice universe the individual subject's universe is > like the person-as-the-walled-moated-castle-town. It is under constant siege > and desperately, obsessively seeking to keep the body—this body made out of > food—away from others and retain it for ourselves alone. Of course we know > the walled-moated castle will fall in the end but we try to hold off the > siege as long as possible while seeking always more and better siege- > resisting technology that will enable us to remain self-enclosed. In the > individual/justice universe you own the energy volume of your body > absolutely and spend much of that energy defending it frantically against > all comers. Any attempt by others at sharing is regarded as an outrage, an > injustice, that must be resisted to the hilt (consider our reaction to the > overfamiliar gatecrashers at our high-class feast—mosquitoes, leeches, > ticks. These outrage our proprietary sensibilities). In the other, > Heraclitean universe, being in your body is more like having a volume out > from the library, a volume subject to more or less instant recall by other > borrowers—who rewrite the whole story when they get it..

Scheme 1. The Doebner- Miller reaction This reaction is also known as the Skraup-Doebner-Von Miller quinoline synthesis, and is named after the Czech chemist Zdenko Hans Skraup (1850–1910), and the Germans Oscar Döbner (Doebner) (1850–1907) and Wilhelm von Miller (1848–1899). When the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound is prepared in situ from two carbonyl compounds (via an Aldol condensation), the reaction is known as the Beyer method for quinolines. The reaction is catalyzed by Lewis acids such as tin tetrachloride and scandium(III) triflate and Brønsted acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, perchloric acid, amberlite and iodine.  Reaction mechanism  The reaction mechanism for this reaction and the related Skraup synthesis is a matter of debate. A 2006 study proposes a fragmentation-recombination mechanism based on carbon isotope scrambling experiments. In this study 4-isopropylaniline 1 is reacted with a mixture (50:50)of ordinary pulegone and the 13C-enriched isomer 2 and the reaction mechanism is outlined in scheme 2 with the labeled carbon identified with a red dot. The first step is a nucleophilic conjugate addition of the amine with the enol to the amine ketone 3 in a reversible reaction. This intermediate then fragments to the imine 4a and the saturated cyclohexanone 4b in a non- reversible reaction and both fragments recombine in a condensation reaction to the conjugated imine 5. In the next step 5 reacts with a second aniline molecule in a nucleophilic conjugate addition to imine 6 and subsequent electrophilic addition and proton transfer to leads to 7. elimination of one aniline molecule through 8 and rearomatization leads to final product 9. Because α-amino protons are not available in this model compound the reaction is not taken to the fully fledged quinoline. Scheme 2. Doebner-Miller reaction mechanism The fragmentation to 4a and 4b is key to this mechanism because it explains the isotope scrambling results. In the reaction only half the pulegone reactant (2) is labeled and on recombining a labeled imine fragment can react with another labeled ketone fragment or an unlabeled fragment and likewise a labeled ketone fragment can react with a labeled or unlabeled imine fragment. The resulting product distribution is confirmed by mass spectrometry of the final product 9.each ion peak M, M+1, M+2, M+3 is equally represented and given the reaction conditions pulegone itself does not fragment in absence of amine.

(PCC) is a tax- exempt, non-profit educational and cultural organization. It was founded in 1966 by members of Musicians' Protective Union Local #274, American Federation of Musicians (A F of M). Local #274 was chartered in 1935 as a separate Black local because Black musicians were denied membership in the racially segregated Local #77. Local #274 enjoyed its autonomy for more than 36 years. It was the longest surviving independent Black Musicians' Union in the United States, of the more than fifty chartered in major cities. Local #274 and PCC's social unit are integral parts of the history of JAZZ in Philadelphia. They evolved out of the struggle of Black musicians for political, economic, and cultural recognition during Philadelphia's overt segregation period. Local #274's membership rolls included JAZZ greats like John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, Shirley Scott, Lee Morgan, \\"Philly\\" Joe Jones, Grover Washington Jr., the Heath Brothers, and Nina Simone to name a few. Naming The word, Jazz, was added to the name of PCC in 1994. The Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz & Performing Arts, Inc. made history when it opened the doors of its new facility in October 1995. The facility was the first ever designed and constructed specifically to be a Jazz institution. The concept of a Jazz Art Institution is a new one, because Jazz has been traditionally presented and developed in the commercial sector through bars, clubs, concert halls, and the recording industry. It is Philadelphia's only major music institution solely devoted to this great American art form. The Clef Club's vision is to have the broad community embrace, and support JAZZ as a great American Art Form, understand its roots in the African American experience, and recognize Jazz as central to our national cultural heritage, and worthy of public and Institutional support. The mission of the Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz & Performing Arts, Inc. is to celebrate and preserve the legacy of jazz through accessible education for the Greater Philadelphia region, and to support the evolving art form through talent development, programming, and public performance. We wish to accomplish this goal through promoting the development of talent and providing opportunities for the growth of the performing artist specifically, with a special emphasis in instrumentalists. We seek to serve the artist and the community through providing a forum for the listening and appreciation of the great American Art Form of Jazz and related disciplines. We also wish to promote the academic exchange of information related to Jazz through educational programs. Finally, The Clef Club will be a depository to collect and preserve the history of jazz music for further research and interpretation by scholars, educators, artists, and the general public. The programs of the Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz & Performing Arts. Inc. include: The Philadelphia Clef Club Youth Ensemble, Jazz Master Workshops, Youth Summer Jazz Camps, Student Ensemble Education Programs, Music Workshops in-school programs, Jazz Cultural Voices and The Preservation Jazz Series concert series. In the near future, the implementation of senior citizen outreach programs consisting of instrumental instruction (individual and group), and vocal activities (individual and group). And also the association of the Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz & Performing Arts, Inc. with all types of community groups including other JAZZ organizations, churches, schools, and community centers in the Greater Philadelphia/Delaware Valley area.

Early life Mansfield was born on 20 September 1902 in Brisbane, Queensland, where his family had land in Gumdale. He lived in the Mount Gravatt area for many years.

He appeared in Lion between 26 June 1965 and 26 April 1969 and was reprinted in Vulcan. He was created by writer Ted Cowan and artist Reg Bunn. Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel took over the writing of the character with his third adventure, and would write the bulk of his adventures. Publication history The Spider first appeared in The Lion from 26 June 1965 to 26 April 1969, as well as in Lion Annuals from 1967 to 1971. He would later be reprinted in Vulcan from 1975 to 1976. New material was also included in Fleetway's Super Stupendous Library series from 1967 to 1968. His adventures were also reprinted in other countries, such as Germany (in Kobra), Spain, Italy, France, and others. 2000AD published an \\"Action Special\\" featuring The Spider (as well as other characters from the same era) in 1992, but this version (written by Mark Millar at the start of his career) is ill- thought of by most fans, turning The Spider into a cannibal, and tends to be ignored. An older, retired, more benevolent version of The Spider has appeared in UK writer/artist Paul Grist's Image comic book Jack Staff. Grist has created a name for the character, Alfred Chinard, and the majority of fans consider this version a true, faithful revival of The Spider. The elderly Spider continues to appear in Jack Staff, although at IPC Media's request, he is identified merely as Alfred Chinard (as \\"The Spider\\" name is IPC Media copyright). The Spider, along with other IPC characters, appeared in the Albion mini-series from the Wildstorm imprint of DC Comics. This incarnation of the character, while different to the version appearing in Jack Staff, is also named Alfred Chinard. The Spider is also mentioned in Jean-Patrick Manchette's 1976 crime novel West Coast Blues, where one of the villains reads his adventures. He is featured in one page of the book's graphic novel adaptation by Jacques Tardi, reprinted by Fantagraphics. Fictional character biography Despite no origin ever being given for the Spider's appearance: pointed ears and teeth, and upswept eyebrows: it fits into the angular style of the artist 'Reg' Bunn who was most comfortable with designing and plotting the actions scenes from the scripts he was given by employing 'tri-angular' artwork. This emphasized (and made easier) the interaction of subject matter and framing within each action picture. Reg Bunn commented later on in the 1960s of the humorous irony of the later 'Spock' 'borrowing' his ears. The Spider appeared in the 1960s in the United States with the aim to become King of Crooks. His base of operations was a Scottish castle he brought over to the U.S. He broke out several other criminals to become members of his army of crime, and would clash with both the police and with other criminal masterminds. Among these were Mirror Man (who specialised in illusions), Doctor Mysterioso (a multi-talented scientist) and The Android Emperor (who could create a wide variety of robots). He also clashed with a number of criminal gangs, and one organisation, Crime Incorporated, hired the assassin The Exterminator to kill him. For once, the Spider seemed defeated, but struck an alliance with his would-be killer, and the pair took down Crime Incorporated. The Spider drained the Exterminator, aging him decades with a booby-trapped handshake, when the latter tried to double-cross him. The Spider found fighting criminals to be exhilarating, and decided to pit his wits against threats to mankind from now on. For a brief time he was associated with the \\"Society of Heroes\\" (Captain Whiz; Mr Gizmo; Rex Robot.; Tigro the Wild Man; Rockman; Snowman (Professor Fred Storm)). All except The Spider died fighting the Sinister Seven. Other foes he faced included The Crime Genie, Spider-Boy, The Snake, The Death-Master, the Ant, the Red Baron, The Fly, The Molecule Man, The Chessman and Mr. Stonehart. An elder, now retired, version of The Spider has appeared in Jack Staff. This version does not seem to have become a hero, and instead was active as an undefeated thief from the 1960s through the 80s in the UK. It's unclear if this Spider ever put together an army of crime, or only worked alone. The character featured strongly in Albion, having been hired by the Margaret Thatcher government to hunt down all of the other British superheroes and adventurers, a job which appealed to his ego. He was promised a pardon, but was double-crossed and locked up with those he captured. He escaped with the other inmates at the end of the series, taking the giant robot ape Mytek the Mighty with him. Powers and abilities It is unclear what powers, if any, The Spider has. He is physically fit, but probably not any more than most humans. He is supremely arrogant and self- confident. He is also cunning and intelligent, and a superb hypnotist. He has trained himself to be immune to his own knockout/poison gas. The Spider wears a black form-fitting outfit (this costume was often coloured yellow on the covers of Lion and Stupendous Super Library), along with a strange backpack/harness. The harness serves as a jetpack and webshooters, as well as the sources for his web gun and gas gun. He has a large number of gadgets of his own invention at his disposal. His reluctant allies are a pair of freed criminals, the genius 'Prof' Pelham and the safecracker Roy Ordini. They were the only members of his 'army of crime' to stay on after The Spider renounced his criminal ways. He treated them very badly and they often tried to harm, even kill him in return. Their failures often brought humiliating punishments from their master. In his appearances in Jack Staff, the Spider states that his outfit serves as an exoskeleton, which increases his strength and agility. Bibliography His first three storylines from Lion (plus a bonus storyline from a Lion annual) have been reprinted in: King of Crooks (2005, Titan Books ) Other versions As well as appearing in his own series he has appeared in a number of other British comics as himself in figures crafted as an homage: * In Alan Moore's run on Captain Britain a superhero called The Arachnid was killed by the Fury on Captain UK's world. Seen (on the 15th page of the reprinted graphic novel) only as a gravestone amongst a number of others all also referencing versions of famous superheroes. * In the Nikolai Dante series The Romanov Job as \\"Abel Ganz. The Tarantula. Anarchist. Assassin and all- round master criminal\\" (first appearance 2000AD #1282, 13 March 2002) alongside other similar characters based on Janus Stark (\\"Janos Starak. Escapologist Extraordinaire\\"), Catwoman (\\"Selina Solaris. The Panther.\\") and Crusher Creel (\\"Grushko Kreel\\"). * Jack Staff as an aging figure and former adversary of the eponymous hero. He gives his name as \\"Alfred Chinard\\", but this may be an alias, as \\"A. Chinard\\" is an anagram for \\"Arachnid\\". So as not to infringe IPC Media copyright, he can now only be referred to as Alfred Chinard in further Jack Staff appearances. * Albion which saw Alan Moore bring him back again, but this time as himself, along with the various other British superheroes of that era. The Spider is again referred to as \\"Alfred Chinard\\" in homage to Paul Grist's Jack Staff. When pointed out that his name is an anagram of Arachnid, he then gives the name Arthur O'Pod (Arthropod). * In the novel Sherlock Holmes y los zombis de Camford (Sherlock Holmes and the Camford Zombies, Ediciones Dolmen, 2010; ) by Spanish author Alberto López Aroca, The Spider appears under the name \\"Seth Pride\\" (an anagram for \\"The Spider\\"), and his criminal-heroic career is set back to the beginning of the 20th century (the novel takes place in 1903). \\"Seth Pride\\" appears in this novel alongside a number of other IPC-Fleetway characters (Timothy Jekyll aka Tim Kelly; Lewis Crandle aka Louis \\"Steel Claw \\"Crandell; Mightech aka Mytek; among others.)

It connects the airside roads around Terminals 1, 2 and 3 to those around Terminal 5. The tunnel was opened to traffic in March 2005 and is used only by vehicles with security clearance to drive airside. The ART is long, consisting of of twin-cell cut and cover box at each end, linked by a pair of long bored tunnels. The ART was designed and built between 1999 and 2004 by a team of engineers from the BAA (the tunnel's owner), Amec, Laing O'Rourke, Morgan Est-Vinci and Mott MacDonald. The bored tunnels have internal diameter of and were driven by a diameter Herrenknecht earth pressure balance tunnel boring machine.

Hindus putting lit oil lamps on the river Ganges. The ceremonial use of lights occurs in liturgies of various Christian Churches, as well as in Jewish, Zoroastrian and Hindu rites and customs. Light is everywhere the symbol of joy and of life-giving power, as darkness is of death and destruction. Fire as an impressive element in worship has been used in many religions. Fire-worship still has its place in at least two of the great religions of the world. The Parsis adore fire as the visible expression of Ahura Mazda, the eternal principle of light and righteousness; the Hindu Brahmins worship it as divine and omniscient. One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali (from the Sanskrit dīpāwali meaning \\"row or series of lights\\") symbolizes the spiritual \\"victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance\\".Jean Mead, How and why Do Hindus Celebrate Divali?, In the ritual of the Jewish temple fire and light played a conspicuous part. In the Holy of Holies was a cloud of light (shekinali), symbolical of the presence of God, and before it stood the candlestick with six branches, on each of which and on the central stem was a lamp eternally burning; while in the forecourt was an altar on which the sacred fire was never allowed to go out. Similarly the Jewish synagogues have each their eternal lamp. Ancient Greece & Rome Terracotta oil lamp representing Serapis (British Museum). The Greeks and Romans, too, had their sacred fire and their ceremonial lights. In Greece the Lampadedromia or Lampadephoria (torch-race) had its origin in Greek ceremonies, connected with the relighting of the sacred fire. Pausaniasi. 26, 6. mentions the golden lamp made by Callimachus which burned night and day in the sanctuary of Athena Polias on the Acropolis, andvii. 22, ~ 2 and 3. tells of a statue of Hermes Agoraios, in the market-place of Pharae in Achaea, before which lamps were lighted. Among the Romans lighted candles and lamps formed part of the cult of the domestic tutelary deities; on all festivals doors were garlanded and lamps lighted.Juvenal, Sat. xii. 92; Tertullian, Apol. xxxv. In the Cult of Isis lamps were lighted by day. In the ordinary temples were candelabra, e.g. that in the temple of Apollo Palatinus at Rome, originally taken by Alexander from Thebes, which was in the form of a tree from the branches of which lights hung like fruit. The lamps in the pagan temples were not symbolical, but votive offerings to the gods. Torches and lamps were also carried in religious processions. Lamps for the dead The pagan custom of burying lamps with the dead was to provide the dead with the means of obtaining light in the next world; the lamps were for the most part unlighted. It was of Asiatic origin, traces of it having been observed in Phoenicia and in the Punic colonies, but not in Egypt or Greece. In Europe it was confined to the countries under the domination of Rome. Christianity=Early Christian uses In Christianity, from the very first, fire and light are conceived as symbols, if not as visible manifestations, of the divine nature and the divine presence. Christ is the true Light,John i. 9. and at his transfiguration the fashion Christian of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering;Luke ix. 29. when the Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles, there appeared unto them cloven tongues of fire, and it sat upon each of them;Acts ii. 3. at the conversion of St Paul there shined round him a great light from heaven;Acts ix. 3. while the glorified Christ is represented as standing in the midst of seven candlesticks ... his head and hairs white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire.Rev. ~. 14, 15. Christians are children of Light at perpetual war with the powers of darkness. Light represents the purifying presence of god. There is no evidence of any ceremonial use of lights in Christian worship during its first two centuries. It is recorded, indeed,Acts xx. 7, 8. that on the occasion of St. Paul's preaching at Alexandria in Troas there were many lights in the upper chamber; but this was at night. And the most that can be hazarded is that a specially large number were lighted as a festive illumination, as in modern Church festivals.Martigny, Did. des antiqs~. C/fret. As to a purely ceremonial use, such early evidence as exists is all the other way. A single sentence of TertullianA pal. xxxv. sufficiently illuminates Christian practice during the 2nd century. On days of rejoicing, he says, we do not shade our door-posts with laurels nor encroach upon the day-light with lamp laurels (die lacto non laurels pastes obumbramus nec lucernis diem infringimus). Lactantius, writing early in the 4th century, is even more sarcastic in his references to the heathen practice. They kindle lights, he says, as though to one who is in darkness. Can he be thought sane who offers the light of lamps and candles to the Author and Giver of all light? .Div. Inst. vi. de vero cultu, cap. 2, in Migne, Patrologia Latina vi. 637. This is primarily an attack on votive lights, and does not necessarily exclude their ceremonial use in other ways. There is, indeed, evidence that they were so used before Lactantius wrote. The 34th canon of the Synod of Elvira (305), which was contemporary with him, forbade candles to be lighted in cemeteries during the daytime, which points to an established custom as well as to an objection to it; and in the Roman catacombs lamps have been found of the 2nd and 3rd centuries which seem to have been ceremonial or symbolical.J. Toutain, in Daremberg and Saglio, Diaionnaire, s.v. Again, according to the Acts of St Cyprian (died 258), his body was borne to the grave praelucentibus cereis, and Prudentius, in his hymn on the 2nd and martyrdom of St Lawrence,Peristeph. ii. 71, in Migne, centuries. Patr. Lat. lx. 300. says that in the time of St Laurentius, i.e. the middle of the 3rd century, candles stood in the churches of Rome on golden candelabra. The gift, mentioned by Anastasius,in Sylv. made by Constantine to the Vatican basilica, of a pharum of gold, garnished with 500 dolphins each holding a lamp, to burn before St Peters tomb, points also to a custom well established before Christianity became the state religion. Whatever previous custom may have been and for the earliest ages it is difficult to determine absolutely because the Christians held their services at night. By the close of the 4th century the ceremonial use of lights had become firmly and universally established in the Church. This is clear, to pass by much other evidence, from the controversy of St Jerome with Vigilantius. Vigilantius, a presbyter of Barcelona, still occupied the position of Tertullian and Lactantius in this matter. We see, he wrote, a rite peculiar to the pagans introduced into the churches on pretext of religion, and, while the sun is still shining, a mass of wax tapers lighted. ... A great honor to the blessed martyrs, whom they think to illustrate with contemptible little candles (de pilissimis cereolis). Jerome, the most influential theologian of the day, took up the cudgels against Vigilantius, who, in spite of his fatherly admonition, had dared again to open his foul mouth and send forth a filthy stink against the relics of the holy martyrs.Hier. Ep. cix. al. 53 ad Ripuarium Presbyt., in Migne, Patr. Lat. p. 906. If candles are lit before their tombs, are these the ensigns of idolatry? In his treatise contra VigilantiumPatr. Lat. t. xxiii. he answers the question with much common sense. There can be no harm if ignorant and simple people or religious women, light candles in honor of the martyrs. We are not born, but reborn, Christians, and that which when done for idols was detestable is acceptable when done for the martyrs. As in the case of the woman with the precious box of ointment, it is not the gift that merits reward, but the faith that inspires it. As for lights in the churches, he adds that in all the churches of the East, whenever the gospel is to be read, lights are lit, though the sun be rising (jam sole rutilante), not in order to disperse the darkness, but as a visible sign of gladness (ad signum ketitiae demonstrandum). Taken in connection with a statement which almost immediately precedes this Cereos autem non clara luce accendimus, sicut frustra calumniaris: sed ut noctis tenebras hoc solatio temperemus , this seems to point to the fact that the ritual use of lights in the church services, so far as already established, arose from the same conservative habit as determined the development of liturgical vestments, i.e. the lights which had been necessary at the nocturnal meetings were retained, after the hours of service had been altered, and invested with a symbolical meaning. Already they were used at most of the conspicuous functions of the Church. Paulinus, bishop of Nola (died 431), describes the altar at the eucharist as crowned with crowded lights, and even mentions the eternal lamp. For their use at baptisms we have, among much other evidence, that of Zeno of Verona for the West, and that of Gregory of Nazianzus for the East. Their use at funerals is illustrated by Eusebius's description of the burial of Constantine, and Jerome's account of that of Saint Paula. At ordinations they were used, as is shown by the 6th canon of the Council of Carthage (398), which decrees that the acolyte is to hand to the newly ordained deacon ceroferarium cum cereo. This symbolism was not pagan, i.e. the lamps were not placed in the graves as part of the furniture of the dead; in the Catacombs they are found only in the niches of the galleries and the arcosolia, nor can they have been votive in the sense popularized later.

Middle Ages As to the blessing of candles, according to the Liber pontificalis Pope Zosimus in 417 ordered these to be blessed, and the Gallican and Mozarabic rituals also provided for this ceremony. The Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, known as Candlemas, because on this day the candles for the whole year are blessed, was established according to some authorities by Pope Gelasius I about 492. As to the question of altar lights, however, it must be borne in mind that these were not placed upon the altar, or on a retable behind it, until the 12th century. These were originally the candles carried by the deacons, according to the Ordo Romanus (i. 8; ii. 5; iii. 7) seven in number, which were set down, either on the steps of the altar, or, later, behind it. In certain of the Eastern Churches to this day, there are no lights on the high altar; the lighted candles stand on a small altar beside it, and at various parts of the service are carried by the lectors or acolytes before the officiating priest or deacon. The crowd of lights described by Paulinus as crowning the altar were either grouped round it or suspended in front of it; they are represented by the sanctuary lamps of the Latin Church and by the crown of lights suspended in front of the altar in. the Greek. To trace the gradual elaboration of the symbolism and use of ceremonial lights in the Church, until its full development and systematization in the Middle Ages, would be impossible here. It must suffice to note a few stages in development of the process. The burning of lights before the tombs of martyrs led naturally to their being burned also before relics and lastly before images and pictures. This latter practice, hotly denounced as idolatry during the iconoclastic controversy, was finally established as orthodox by the Second General Council of Nicaea (787), which restored the use of images. A later development, however, by which certain lights themselves came to be regarded as objects of worship and to have other lights burned before them, was condemned as idolatrous by the Synod of Noyon in 1344. The passion for symbolism extracted ever new meanings out of the candles and their use. Early in the 6th century Magnus Felix Ennodius, bishop of Pavia, pointed out the threefold elements of a wax candle (Opusc. ix. and x.), each of which would make it an offering acceptable to God; the rush-wick is the product of pure water, the wax is the offspring of virgin, bees in the flame is sent from heaven.12 Clearly, wax was a symbol of the Blessed Virgin and the holy humanity of Christ. The later Middle Ages developed the idea. Durandus, in his Rationale, interprets the wax as the body of Christ, the wick as his soul, the flame as his divine nature; and the consuming candle as symbolizing his passion and death. This may be the Paschal Candle only. In some codices the text runs: Per parochias concessit licentiam benedicendi Cereum Paschalem.Du Cange, Glossarium, sv. Cereum Paschale. In the three variants of the notice of Zosimus given in Duchesnes edition of the Liber pontificalis (I~86I892) the word cera is, however, alone used. Nor does the text imply that he gave to the suburbican churches a privilege hitherto exercised by the metropolitan church. The passage runs: Hic constituit ut diaconi leva tecta haberent de palleis linostimis per parrochias et ut cera benedicatur, &c.; Per parrochias here obviously refers to the head-gear of the deacons, not to the candles. See also the Peregrinoiio Sylviae (386), 86, &c.;, for the use of lights at Jerusalem, and Isidore of SevilleElym. vii. 12; xx. 10. for the usage in the West. That even in the 7th century the blessing of candles was by no means universal is proved by the 9th canon of the Council of Toledo (671):De benedicendo cereo et lucerna in privilegiis Paschae. This canon states that candles and lamps are not blessed in some churches, and that inquiries have been made why we do it. In reply, the council decides that it should be done to celebrate the mystery of Christ's resurrection. See Isidore of Seville, Conc., in Migne, Pat, tat. lxxxiv. 369. Eastern Christian usage Russian Orthodox Church candle Tomb of Jesus, inside the Edicule. Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem. This is where the Holy Fire manifests itself. Candlestand in an Eastern Orthodox church. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, there is a large amount of ceremonial use of light. The most important usage is the reception of the Holy Fire at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem on the afternoon of Holy Saturday. This flame is often taken by the faithful to locations all over the world. =The temple= When a new temple (church building) is consecrated the bishop kindles a flame in the sanctuary which traditionally should burn perpetually from that time forward. This sanctuary lamp is usually an oil lamp located either on or above the Holy Table (altar). In addition, in the Eastern Orthodox Church there must be candles on the Holy Table during the celebration of the Divine Liturgy. In some places this takes the form of a pair of white candles, in others, it may be a pair of five-branch candlesticks. There is also traditionally a seven- branch candlestick on or behind the Holy Table, recalling the one mandated in the Old Testament Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem. Around the temple, there are a number of oil lamps burning in front of the icons, especially on the iconostasis. Additionally, the faithful will offer beeswax candles in candle stands in front of important icons. The faithful offer candles as they pray for both the living and the departed. It is customary during funerals and memorial services for everyone to stand holding lit candles. Often everyone will either extinguish their candles or put them in a candle stand at a certain point near the end of the memorial service to indicate that at some point, everyone will have to surrender their soul to God. =Special moments= The reading from the Gospel Book must always be accompanied by lighted candles, as a sign that Christ is the Light which enlightens all (). When the priest and deacon cense the temple, the deacon will walk with a lighted candle. During processions, and in some places during the liturgical entrances, either candles or lanterns are carried by altar servers. On certain feast days, the clergy, and sometimes all of the faithful, will stand holding candles for certain solemn moments during the service. This is especially so during Holy Week during the reading of the 12 Passion Gospels on Great Friday, and the Lamentations around the epitaphios on Great Saturday. Certain moments during the All Night Vigil will be accentuated by the lighting or extinguishing of lamps or candles. The Polyeleos is an important moment in the service when all of the lamps and candles in the church should be illuminated. Whenever the bishop celebrates the divine services, he will bless with a pair of candlesticks known as dikirion and trikirion, holding two and three candles, respectively. =In the home= The faithful will often keep a lamp burning perpetually in their icon corner. In the Russian Orthodox Church, it is customary to try to preserve the flame from the service of the 12 Passion Gospels and bring it home to bless their house: there is a custom of using the flame from this candle to mark a cross on the lintel of one's doorway before entering after the service, and of then using the flame to re-kindle the lamp in the icon corner. =Paschal Vigil and Bright Week= congregation lighting their candles from the new flame which the priest has retrieved from the altar (St. George Greek Orthodox Church, in Adelaide, Australia). During the Paschal Vigil, after the Midnight Office, all of the candles and lamps in the temple are extinguished, with the exception of the sanctuary lamp behind the iconostasis, and all wait in silence and darkness. (In Orthodox churches, when possible, the Holy Fire arrives from the Holy Sepulchre during Holy Saturday afternoon and it is used to light anew the flame in the sanctuary lamp.) At the stroke of midnight, the priest censes around the Holy Table, and lights his candle from the sanctuary lamp. Then the Holy Doors are opened and all the people light their candles from the priest's candle. Then, all the clergy and the people exit the church and go in procession three times around it holding lighted candles and singing a hymn of the resurrection. During the Paschal Vigil, and throughout Bright Week, the priest will hold a special paschal candle—in the Greek tradition a single candle, in the Slavic tradition a triple candlestick—at the beginning of the service, whenever he senses, and at other special moments during the service. In the Slavic tradition, the deacon also carries a special paschal candle which he holds at the beginning, whenever he senses, and whenever he chants an ektenia (litany). Oriental Orthodox In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, it is customary to light bonfires on the Feast of Timkat (Epiphany). Roman Catholic usage in the early 20th century In the Latin Church or Roman Catholic Church, the use of ceremonial lights falls under three heads. (1) They may be symbolical of the light of Gods presence, of Christ as Light Roman of Light, or of the children of Light in conflict with Catholic the powers of darkness; they may even be no more than expressions of joy on the occasion of great festivals. (2) They may be votive, i.e. offered as an act of worship (latria) to God. (3) They are, in virtue of their benediction by the Church, sacramental id, i.e. efficacious for the good of men's souls and bodies, and for the confusion of the powers of darkness. With one or more of these implications, they are employed in all the public functions of the Church. At the consecration of a church twelve lights are placed around the walls at the twelve spots. Dedication where these are anointed by the bishop with holy oil, of a and on every anniversary these are relighted; at the church, dedication of an altar tapers are lighted and censed at each place where the table is anointed (Pontificale Rom. p. ii. De ecci. dedicat. seu consecrat.). =Mass= Candles burning in Kraków after the death of Pope John Paul II. At every liturgical service, and especially at Mass and at choir services, there must be at least two lighted tapers on the altar, as symbols of the presence at Mass of God and tributes of adoration. For the Mass the rule is that there are six lights at High Mass, four at missa cantata, and two at private masses. At a Pontifical High Mass (i.e. when the bishop celebrates) the lights are seven, because seven golden candlesticks surround the risen Saviour, the chief bishop of the Church (see Rev. i. 12). At most pontifical functions, moreover, the bishop as the representative of Christ is preceded by an acolyte with a burning candle (bugia) on a candlestick. The Ceremoniale Episcoporum (i. 12) further orders that a burning lamp is to hang at all times before each altar, three in front of the high altar, and five before the reserved Sacrament, as symbols of the eternal Presence. In practice, however, it is usual to have only one Altar lamp lighted before the tabernacle in which the Host is reserved. The special symbol of the real presence of Christ is the Sanctus candle, which is lighted at the moment of consecration and kept burning until the communion. The same symbolism is intended by the lighted tapers which must accompany the Host whenever it is carried in procession, or to the sick and dying. As symbols of light and joy, a candle is held on each side of the deacon when reading the Gospel at Mass; and the same symbolism underlies the multiplication of lights on festivals, their number varying with the importance of the occasion. As to the number of these latter no rule is laid down. They differ from liturgical lights in that, whereas these must be tapers of pure beeswax or lamps fed with pure olive oil (except by special dispensation under Certain circumstances), those used merely to add splendour to the celebration may be of any material; the only exception being, that in the decoration of the altar, gas-lights are forbidden. In general, the ceremonial use of lights in the Roman Catholic Church is conceived as a dramatic representation in fire of the life of Christ and of the whole scheme of salvation. On Easter Eve the new fire, symbol of the light of the newly risen Christ, is produced, and from this are kindled all the lights used throughout the Christian year until, in the gathering darkness (tenebrae) of the Passion, they are gradually extinguished. This quenching of the light of the world is symbolized at the service of Tenebrae in Holy Week by the placing on a stand before the altar of thirteen lighted tapers arranged pyramidally, the rest of the church being in darkness. The penitential psalms are sung, and at the end of each a candle is extinguished. When only the central one is left it is taken down and carried behind the altar, thus symbolizing the nocturnal darkness, so our hearts are illumined by invisible fire, &c.; (Missale Rom.). In the form for the blessing of candles extra diem Purificationis B. Mariae Virg. the virtue of the consecrated candles in discomfiting demons is specially brought out: that in whatever places they may be lighted, or placed, the princes of darkness may depart, and tremble, and may fly terror-stricken with all their ministers from those habitations, nor presume further to disquiet and molest those who serve thee, Almighty God (Rituale Rom.) Altar candlesticks consist of five parts: the foot, stem, knob in the centre, bowl to catch the drippings, and pricket (a sharp point on which the candle is fixed). It is permissible to use a long tube, pointed to imitate a candle, in which a small taper is forced to the top by a spring (Cong. Rit., tIth May I&78). =Easter= On Easter Eve new fire is made with a flint and steel, and blessed; from this three candles are lighted, the lumen Christi, and from these again the Paschal Candle. This is the symbol of the risen and victorious Christ, and burns at every solemn service until Ascension Day, when it is extinguished and removed after the reading of the Gospel at High Mass. This, of course, symbolizes the Ascension; but meanwhile the other lamps in the church have received their light from the Paschal Candle, and so symbolize throughout the year the continued presence of the light of Christ. =Baptism= At the consecration of the baptismal water the burning Paschal Candle is dipped into the font so that the power of the Holy Ghost may descend into it and make it an effective instrument of regeneration. This is the symbol of baptism as rebirth as children of Light. Lighted tapers are also placed in the hands of the newly baptized, or of their god-parents, with the admonition to preserve their baptism inviolate, so that they may go to meet the Lord when he comes to the wedding. Thus, too, as children of Light, candidates for ordination and novices about to take the vows carry lights. when they come before the bishop; and the same idea 17, CEo. underlies the custom of carrying lights at weddings, at the first communion, and by priests going to their first mass, though none of these are liturgically prescribed. Finally, lights are placed around the bodies of the dead and carried beside them to the grave, partly as symbols that they still live in the light of Christ, partly to frighten away the powers of darkness. =Funeral= During the funeral service, the Paschal Candle is placed, burning, near the coffin, as a reminder of the deceased's baptismal vows and hope of eternal life and salvation brought about by the death and resurrection of Jesus, and of faith in the resurrection of the dead. =Excommunication= Conversely, the extinction of lights is part of the ceremony of excommunication (Pontificale Rom. pars iii.). Regino, abbot of Prum, describes the ceremony as it was carried out in his day, when its terrors were yet unabated (De eccles. disciplina, Excom ii. 409). Twelve priests should stand about the bishop, holding in their hands lighted torches, which at the conclusion of the anathema or excommunication they should cast down and trample under foot. When the excommunication is removed, the symbol of reconciliation is the handing to the penitent of a burning taper. Lutheran usage Jesus Church in Valby, Copenhagen. Evangelical Lutheran church (Church of Sweden) in Röke, Sweden on the Feast of All Hallows. Flowers and lighted candles are placed by relatives on the graves of their deceased loved ones.200pxthumbright In the Lutheran Churches they were retained, and in Evangelical Germany have even survived most of the other medieval rites and ceremonies (e.g. the use of vestments) which were not abolished at the Reformation itself. The custom of placing lighted candles around the bodies of the dead is still practised by Lutherans. Anglican usage In the Church of England the practice has been less consistent. The first Book of Common Prayer directed two lights to be placed on the altar. This direction was omitted in the second Prayer-book; but the Ornaments Rubric of Queen Elizabeth's Prayer-book again made them obligatory. The question of how far this did so is a much-disputed one and is connected with the whole problem of the meaning and scope of the rubric. Uncertainty reigns with regard to the actual usage of the Church of England from the Reformation onwards. Lighted candles certainly continued to burn in Queen Elizabeth's chapel, to the scandal of Protestant zealots. They also seem to have been retained in certain cathedral and collegiate churches. There is, however, no mention of ceremonial candles in the detailed account of the services of the Church of England given by William Harrison (Description of England, 1570). They seem never to have been illegal under the Acts of Uniformity. The use of wax lights and tapers formed one of the indictments brought by Peter Smart, a Puritan prebendary of Durham, against Dr. Burgoyne, John Cosin and others for setting up superstitious ceremonies in the cathedral contrary to the Act of Uniformity. The indictments were dismissed in 1628 by Sir James Whitelocke, chief justice of Chester and a judge of the Kings Bench, and in 1629 by Sir Henry Yelverton, a judge of Common Pleas and himself a strong Puritan.Hierurgia Anglicana, ii pp. 230 seq.) The use of ceremonial lights was among the indictments in the impeachment of Laud and other bishops by the House of Commons, but these were not based on the Act of Uniformity. From the Restoration onwards the use of ceremonial lights, though far from universal, was usual again in cathedrals and collegiate churches. It was not, however, until the Oxford Movement of the 19th century that their use was widely extended in parish churches. The growing custom met with some opposition; the law was appealed to, and in 1872 the Privy Council declared altar lights to be illegal (Martin v. Mackonochie). This judgment, founded as was afterwards admitted on insufficient knowledge, produced no effect. In the absence of any authoritative negative pronouncement, churches returned to practically the whole ceremonial use of lights as practised in the Roman Catholic Church. The matter was again raised in the case of Read and others v. the Bishop of Lincoln, one of the counts of the indictment being that the bishop had, during the celebration of Holy Communion, allowed two candles to be alight on a shelf or retable behind the communion table when they were not necessary for giving light. The Archbishop of Canterbury, in whose court the case was heard (1889), decided that the mere presence of two candles on the table, burning during the service but lit before it began, was lawful under the first Prayer-Book of Edward VI. and had never been made unlawful. On the case being appealed to the Privy Council, this particular indictment was dismissed on the ground that the vicar, not the bishop, was responsible for the presence of the lights. The custom of placing lighted candles around the bodies of the dead, especially when lying in state, has never wholly died out in the Anglican communion. In the 18th century, moreover, it was still customary in England to accompany a funeral with lighted tapers.Picart (op. cit. 1737) A contemporary illustration shows a funeral cortege preceded and accompanied by boys, each carrying four lighted candles in a branched candlestick. The usage in this respect in Anglo-Catholic churches is a revival of pre-Reformation ceremonial as is found in the Roman Catholic Church. Reformed usage As a result of the Reformation, the use of ceremonial lights was either greatly modified, or totally abolished in the Reformed Churches. Candles and lamps were only used to provide necessary illumination. Since the twentieth century, many churches in the Reformed tradition, especially in the United States, commonly use two or more candles on the Communion Table, influenced by the liturgical movement. The use of the Advent wreath has gained near universal acceptance, even in churches traditionally hostile to ceremonial lights, such as the Church of Scotland. Usage in Hinduism In almost all Hindu homes, lamps are lit daily, sometimes before an altar. In some houses, oil lamps or candles are lit at dawn, in some houses they are lit at both dawn and dusk, and in a few, lamps are maintained continuously. A diya, or clay lamp, is frequently used in Hindu celebrations and forms an integral part of many social rites. It is a strong symbol of enlightenment, hope, and prosperity. Diwali is the festival of lights celebrated by followers of dharmic religions. In its traditional and simplest form, the diya is made from baked clay or terracotta and holds oil or ghee that is lit via a cotton wick. Traditional diyas have now evolved into a form wherein waxes are used as replacements for oils.sample of a traditional earthen clay lamp Usage in Sikhism Lamps are lit in Sikhism on Diwali, the festival of light, as well as being lit everyday by followers of Dharmic religions. Candles Candles are used in the religious ceremonies of many faiths. ;Buddhism A very large carved Thai candle, similar to those used in the Ubon Ratchathani Candle Festival Candles are a traditional part of Buddhist ritual observances. Along with incense and flowers, candles (or some other type of light source, such as butter lamps) are placed before Buddhist shrines or images of the Buddha as a show of respect. They may also be accompanied by offerings of food and drink. The light of the candles is described as representing the light of the Buddha's teachings, echoing the metaphor of light used in various Buddhist scriptures. See Ubon Ratchathani Candle Festival for an example of a Buddhist festival that makes extensive use of candles. ;Christianity Candle lighting in the Visoki Dečani monastery. churches and cathedrals as a sign of remembrance of the departed Bundle of candles sold in the shops of the Christian Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem In Christianity the candle is commonly used in worship both for decoration and ambiance, and as a symbol that represents the light of God or, specifically, the light of Christ. The altar candle is often placed on the altar, usually in pairs. Candles are also carried in processions, especially to either side of the processional cross. A votive candle or taper may be lit as an accompaniment to prayer. Candles are lit by worshippers in front of icons in Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Catholic and other churches. This is referred to as \\"offering a candle\\", because the candle is a symbol of the worshiper offering himself or herself to God (and proceeds from the sale of the candle are offerings by the faithful which go to help the church). Among the Eastern Orthodox, there are times when the entire congregation stands holding lit tapers, such as during the reading of the Matins Gospels on Good Friday, the Lamentations on Holy Saturday, funerals, Memorial services, etc. There are also special candles that are used by Orthodox clergy. A bishop will bless using dikirion and trikirion (candlesticks holding two and three candles, respectively). At Pascha (Easter) the priest holds a special Paschal trikirion, and the deacon holds a Paschal candle. The priest will also bless the faithful with a single candle during the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts (celebrated only during Great Lent). In the Roman Catholic Church a liturgical candle must be made of at least 51% beeswax, the remainder may be paraffin or some other substance. In the Orthodox Church, the tapers offered should be 100% beeswax, unless poverty makes this impossible. The stumps from burned candles can be saved and melted down to make new candles. In some Western churches, a special candle known as the Paschal candle, specifically represents the Resurrected Christ and is lit only at Easter, funerals, and baptisms. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, during Bright Week (Easter Week) the priest holds a special Paschal trikirion (triple candlestick) and the deacon holds a large candle during all of the services at which they serve. In Sweden (and other Scandinavian countries), St. Lucia Day is celebrated on December 13 with the crowning of a young girl with a wreath of candles. In many Western churches, a group of candles arranged in a ring, known as an Advent wreath, are used in church services in the Sundays leading up to Christmas. In households in some Western European countries, a single candle marked with the days of December is gradually burned down, day by day, to mark the passing of the days of Advent; this is called an Advent candle. ;Judaism A yahrtzeit candle, lit on the Hebrew anniversary of a loved one's death In Judaism, a pair of Shabbat candles are lit on Friday evening prior to the start of the weekly Sabbath celebration. On Saturday night, a special candle with several wicks and usually braided is lit for the Havdalah ritual marking the end of the Sabbath and the beginning of the new week. The eight- day holiday of Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is celebrated by lighting a special Hanukkiyah each night to commemorate the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem. A memorial candle is lit on the Yahrtzeit, or anniversary of the death of a loved one according to the Hebrew calendar. The candle burns for 24 hours. A memorial candle is also lit on Yom HaShoah, a day of remembrance for all those who perished in The Holocaust. A seven-day memorial candle is lit following the funeral of a spouse, parent, sibling or child. Candles are also lit prior to the onset of the Three Festivals (Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot) and the eve of Yom Kippur, and Rosh Hashana. A candle is also used on the night before Passover in a symbolic search for chametz, or leavened bread, which is not eaten on Passover. ;Kwanzaa The Candle is also used in celebrations of Kwanzaa, which is an African American holiday which runs from December 26 to January 1. A Kinara is used to hold candles in these celebrations. It holds seven candles; three red candles to represent African American struggles, one black candle to represent the African American people and three green candles to represent African American hopes. ;Humanism For some Humanists the candle is used as a symbol of the light of reason or rationality. The Humanist festival of HumanLight often features a candle- lighting ceremony. ;Satanism During satanic rituals black candles are the only light source, except for one white candle on the altar. The dim lighting is used to create an air of mystique and the color of the candles has symbolic meaning.Anton LaVey, The Satanic Bible, pp. 136-137. ;Unitarian Universalism A common element of worship in many Unitarian Universalism churches and fellowships is the lighting of candles of joy and concern. Here members of the congregation may come up to the altar or chancel, light a votive or other candle, and share a personal concern or joy with the community. Unitarian Universalism also incorporates candle-lighting ceremonies from other spiritual traditions, from which they draw inspiration. A flaming chalice is the most widely used symbol of Unitarianism and Unitarian Universalism, and is, in reality, usually a candle, not an actual chalice of burning oil. ;Wicca In Wicca and related forms of Paganism, the candle is frequently used on the altar to represent the presence of the God and Goddess, and in the four corners of a ritual circle to represent the presence of the four classical elements: Fire, Earth, Air, and Water. When used in this manner, lighting and extinguishing the candle marks the opening and closing of the ritual. The candle is also frequently used for magical meditative purposes. Altar candles are traditionally thick tall candles or long tapers which are available in many colors. In Wicca, the candles that are used come in a variety of colors, depending on the nature of the ritual or custom at hand. Some Wiccans may use red, green, blue, yellow and white or purple candles to represent the elements. Using candles in magic based on Wiccan beliefs is known as \\"sympathetic magick\\" in that it is believed the candle represents the outcome the person is wanting. It is a \\"like attracts like\\" form of magical practice. For example, if a person is looking for a job or needs extra income a green candle (the color of American dollars) would be used. For romance, a red candle would be used (red is a universal color of love and hearts). There is an additional belief that the smoke from the candles will take the prayer requests, desires, or wishes up to the gods. ;Raqs sharqi In raqs sharqi, candles are used as a complementary element in some dance styles. The candles can be held either on the dancer's hand or above her head, depending on what the choreography demands. References *Article Lucerna, by J.

On 1 March 2006, new rules came into effect requiring all public and private institutions, including bars and restaurants, to allow smoking only in special secluded areas. Absence of any legal sanctions against those who violate the smoking laws has made them completely ineffective. Tobacco advertising is prohibited in TV, radio and outdoor advertising. Other sources of advertising on newspapers, magazines of tobacco products is not fully restricted. Sponsorships are partially allowed in Armenia. In 2012, Armenia had the third-highest number of male cigarette smokers in the world. On January 11, 2017, the Eurasian Economic Commission said that starting mid-March 2017, graphic pictures would be implemented on the packaging of cigarettes in all Eurasian Economic Union member states (EEU).  Australia  In Australia, smoking bans are determined on a state- by-state basis. In chronological order by state: The first place smoking was banned in Victoria was in 1990 when Councillor John Huntley (a smoker) moved a motion to ban smoking in the Shire of Orbost offices.

The 2009 law granted certain exceptions for eating and drinking establishments as well as workplaces if no employee works in the enclosed space objects. Smoking was banned on trains and in railway stations when Germany introduced a similar smoking ban in 2007. The 2009 law mandated that all restaurants, bars, discos, and pubs larger than 50 m2 had to be either be non-smoking or introduce separate smoking rooms. Below 50 m2 the owner could opt to make the establishment either a smoking or non-smoking place. The law provided for a long transition phase ending July 2010. The 2009 law was a subject of controversy, as the rules were widely ignored by bar owners and not actively enforced by the authorities. Anti-smoking campaigners claimed to have filed 18,000 reports with the authorities on non-compliant businesses since the bans were introduced, to little effect. In December 2017, after a change in government – under the coalition of the centre-right ÖVP and the far-right FPÖ – an already passed bill Austrian parliament voted for strict smoking ban from May 2018 banning smoking in all restaurants, bars, discos and pubs from May 2018 was repealed and the prior rules reinstated with some minor changes. In July 2019, after another change in government – under a technocratic government led by Chancellor Brigitte Bierlein – the parliament decided to reintroduce the strict ban for all types of restaurants, bars, discos, and pubs from 1 November 2019.

Small bars are also not included in the regulations. Larger bars, such as concert venues, should enforce the regulations although the initial experience was variable. * September 2008: Smoking no longer allowed in schools. * January 2010: A general smoking ban that included all types of bars had been discussed but was watered-down to a set of regulations that apply only when food is served. * July 2011: On 15 March 2011, Belgium's Constitutional Court ruled that the discrimination between bars serving food and those not serving food (and casinos) distorted competition and that, as a consequence, the partial exemption had to end by July 2011, thus banning smoking in Belgian bars, restaurants and casinos without exception. Benin Benin has a smoking ban in place for certain public places. Bermuda As of 1 October 2006, smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces in Bermuda, including restaurants, bars, private clubs and hotels.Smoking ban kicks in on Sunday – Bermuda Sun Bhutan Following a resolution of the 87th session of the National Assembly on 17 December 2004, a national prohibition upon the sale of tobacco and tobacco products went into effect, but importing limited tobacco was still permitted subject to very heavy taxes.Slate Magazine: The First Nonsmoking Nation by Eric Weiner Smoking in all public places in Bhutan became illegal on 22 February 2005. It thus became the first nation in the world to outlaw this practice outright. The Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan was enacted by parliament on June 16, 2010. It regulates tobacco and tobacco products, banning the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of tobacco and tobacco products in Bhutan. The act also mandates that the government of Bhutan provide counseling and treatment to facilitate tobacco cessation. Premised on the physical health and well-being of the Bhutanese people – important elements of Gross National Happiness – the Tobacco Control Act recognizes the harmful effects of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke on both spiritual and social health. The consumption of tobacco is not altogether prohibited in Bhutan, though it is largely banned in places of public accommodation. The Act largely targets smoking in particular, though all forms of tobacco are subject to the Act. The Tobacco Control Act establishes non-smoking areas: commercial centers including markets, hotel lobbies, restaurants, and bars; recreation centers such as discothèques, cinemas, and playing fields; institutions and offices, both public and private; public gatherings and public spaces such as festivals, taxi stands, and the airport; all public transportation; and any other places declared by the Tobacco Control Board. The board also has the authority to designate smoking areas in public. Smoking areas are permitted in non-public areas of hotels (i.e. smoking floors or smoking rooms) at the discretion of the patron. The Act prohibits the cultivation, harvest, manufacture, supply, and distribution of tobacco, as well as the manufacture, supply, distribution, sale, and purchase of tobacco products within Bhutan. The Act allows individuals to import tobacco and tobacco products for personal consumption subject to limits set by the Tobacco Control Board, as well as duties and taxes. Those who bring their own tobacco or tobacco products into Bhutan must bear proof of taxation, may only bring goods that display required health warnings, and must not bring goods that promote tobacco by means that are false, misleading, or likely to create an erroneous impression of its characteristics, health effects, or hazards. (e.g. descriptors such as \\"light\\" or \\"mild\\") The Act totally prohibits tobacco advertisement, promotion and sponsorship, restricting the appearance of tobacco in domestic videos and movies to educational clips produced for the purpose of health promotion. Bosnia and Herzegovina The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has prohibited smoking in public buildings nationwide since 1 September 2007. However, until 2016, indoor buildings were not completely smoke-free. Bosnia and Herzegovina was ranked the 4th highest in Europe by percentage of daily smokers in 2016, after Russia, Serbia and Greece (the highest). Brazil Smoking in Brazil is forbidden in all enclosed public spaces except for specifically designated smoking areas. Since 15 December 2011, Federal Law 12546 (article 49) forbids smoking in enclosed spaces in the entire country, including restaurants and bars.INCA (National Cancer Institute) As of 3 December 2014, Brazil has banned smoking in all indoor private and public places, including restaurants, bars and nightclubs. In 2017, a research was published in Brazil that the smoke-free laws implemented resulted in a reduction in the number of heart attacks welcomed in the hospitals. After a year and half, the number of deaths caused by heart attacks decreased by 12% In Brazil, the legal age for sale and consumption of tobacco is 18. Tobacco advertising is restricted to posters in shops, and is banned on television and radio.

Cameroon In Cameroon, smoking is only prohibited in schools, universities and ministry buildings. Canada In Canada, indoor smoking is restricted by all territories and provinces and by the Canadian federal government.

The federal government's workplace smoking ban applies only to the federal government and to federally regulated businesses, such as airports. In Ontario and Alberta, smoking is banned in all workplaces except designated areas. Smoking rooms are available in select hotels and motels in most jurisdictions. Individual communities have bylaws restricting where individuals may smoke. In several Canadian cities smoking has now been banned on municipally owned property including public parks. Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, and Ontario have also prohibited smoking within vehicles with children under 16. Chile Chile prohibits smoking in schools, hospitals, government offices, shopping centres, supermarkets, pharmacies, airports, buses, subway networks and other indoor public places. Smoking indoors in universities is restricted, although it is allowed outdoors. In 2013 Chile's legislative body approved a ban on all smoking in public enclosed spaces nationwide, including restaurants, pubs and clubs.  China  Shanghai Municipality expanded a smoking ban from hospitals to kindergartens, schools, libraries and stadiums, as of 1 March 2010, and had attempted to restrict smoking in restaurants for the 2010 World Expo, but compliance in restaurants was reportedly poor and enforcement lax. In 2015, Shanghai municipality improved the smoking ban by adding hotels, offices and restaurants. As of March 2017, Shanghai widened its smoking ban by implementing on all public places and adding some outdoor areas In Guangdong Province, the municipalities of Guangzhou and Jiangmen restricted smoking in public places in 2007, but the law was not effectively enforced. A new national smoking ban, which extends to all enclosed public areas, came into effect on 1 May 2011. However enforcement of this is patchy at the best of times, especially outside developed cities like Beijing. On June 1, 2015, Beijing enacted a new law banning smoking in public spaces such as restaurants and bars, offices, shopping malls, on public transportation and at airports. Those breaking the law will be fined 200 yuan ($32) and will be \\"named and shamed\\" on a government website after three times. Businesses allowing patrons to light up could be fined up to 10,000 yuan ($1,600) and could have their licenses revoked for repeat offences. The new law also cracks down on advertising.(() Colombia In 2009, Colombia extended its existing tobacco control regulations by requiring all indoor work places and public places be immediately smoke-free; prohibiting tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorship, and the use of terms such as ‘light’ and ‘mild’ on packaging, requiring large, pictorial health warnings on tobacco packaging (covering 30 per cent of the front and back) within a year, preventing the sale of tobacco products to minors; and mandating public education programs on the deadly effects of tobacco use. Comoros Comoros has a smoking ban in place for certain public places. Costa Rica In 2012, Costa Rica passed one of the strictest smoking regulations in the world. This legislation has banned smoking in buses, taxis, trains and their terminals, work places (including parking lots), public buildings, restaurants, bars, casinos, and all enclosed public-access buildings, granting no exceptions (no separate \\"smoking areas\\" are permitted). It also bans smoking in outdoor recreational or educational areas such as parks, stadia and university campuses. It introduced a 20 colones tax per cigarette and prohibits any form of tobacco advertising, the use of misleading terms such as \\"light\\" or \\"mild\\" and the sale of small packages or individual cigarettes. It also prohibits bars and restaurants from selling cigarettes. Violators will be fined a minimum of 180.000 colones (US$355). Croatia On 22 November 2008 the Croatian Parliament passed legislation prohibiting smoking in public institutions such as hospitals, clinics, schools, nurseries and universities with infractions punishable with up to 1000 kuna (140 euros). A notable exception in the Act are psychiatric wards in Croatia's hospitals. The law went further in May 2009 when smoking was banned in all enclosed public areas including bars, restaurants and cafes. The smoking ban applies to all public areas where non-smokers could suffer from second-hand smoke including open public areas like sport stadiums, arenas, open-air theatres, tram and bus stations etc.Law on restriction of tobacco-product use Narodne novine 125/08' \\"Croatia Bans Smoking\\" balkaninsight.com 7 November 2008 Link accessed 7 November 2008Croatia banning smoking vecernji.hr' On 10 September 2009 the regulations restricting smoking in bars and cafes in Croatia was partially repealed for a grace period until 9 April 2010, local media has reported.

The ban included prohibiting smoking in closed public spaces, public transport, educational, health and sporting institutions. However, the ban was not very effective as a study revealed that more than 50% of the population are being exposed to smoking in daily life. In 2014, Cuban authorities said that they are working on passing further anti-smoking legislation. Such legislation will prevent the sale of cigarettes to people under the age of eighteen. The new legislation will also require tobacco companies to add graphic warnings on the packaging. Cyprus On 9 July 2009 Cyprus passed a new law, tightening up ineffective 2002 legislation, which banned smoking in bars, restaurants, nightclubs and workplaces as of 1 January 2010. Since the implementation of the smoking ban on 1 January 2010, compliance levels have been variable, apparently mainly due to a lack of enforcement by the police. A spokesman for some restaurant & bar owners has nevertheless complained that the introduction of the ban has led to a drop in revenue but produced no evidence to support this statement. Czech Republic The second German anti-tobacco organisation, the Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents), was established in 1910 in Trautenau, Bohemia. In 1920, a Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Czechoslovakia) was formed in Prague, after Czechoslovakia was separated from the Austro- Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I.

In February 2011, the popular initiative \\"stop kouření\\" announced, that 115,000 people had signed their petition demanding a ban on smoking in restaurants and denouncing the country's high cancer rate, poor rating concerning tobacco control and possible corruption of members of the Czech Parliament. On December 9, 2016, the Chamber of Deputies passed a law that bans smoking in all restaurants and bars. The bill was approved by the Senate on January 19, 2017, and signed by the President Miloš Zeman on February 14, 2017. It came into effect on May 31, 2017. Democratic Republic of the Congo The Democratic Republic of the Congo has a smoking ban in place for certain public places.

In the other 13 states designated smoking rooms as well as one-room smoking bars with less than 75 m2 are permitted. Gibraltar Smoking has been prohibited in all enclosed public spaces since 1 October 2012.Smoking ban comes into force – Vox Gibraltar Greece Royal decree of 1856, introducing the first restriction upon smoking in modern Greece. Prohibition was valid only within state buildings and was grounded on the need to prevent accidents. As of 2010, Greece was the country with the highest rate of tobacco consumption (more than 40%) in the European Union. Since older legislation was not very efficient; a new, more comprehensive law was passed. Effective from 1 September 2010, this law prohibits smoking and consumption of tobacco products by other means, in all workplaces, transport stations, taxis and passenger ships (in trains, buses and aeroplanes smoking is already prohibited), as well as in all enclosed public places including restaurants, nightclubs, etc., without any exception. Casinos and bars bigger than 300 m2 were given eight months to apply the law. Enforcement of the law is reportedly weak, with most owners of coffee shops, pubs, and restaurants continuing to permit smoking, especially at outdoor sitting areas. Guinea Guinea has a smoking ban in place for certain public places. Guatemala Guatemala has implemented a comprehensive smoking ban covering all types of places and institutions. In December 2008 the Guatemalan Congress approved Decree 74-2008 and it became effective in February 2009. This law restricts smoking in all work-places including health-care facilities, governmental facilities, schools, universities, airports, bars and restaurants. However, two years after the law's implementation enforcement has been deficient. Governments are facing pressures to permit work-place smoking once more by local tobacco companies.Decreto 74-2008, Ley de Creación de los Ambientes Libres de Humo de Tabaco, El Congreso de la República de Guatemala Diciembre del 2008 url= Guernsey Smoke-free ordinances were introduced at different times in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, a British Crown dependency. Smoking was restricted in all enclosed public places in the island of Guernsey, including workplaces, bars, clubs and restaurants, on 2 July 2006, under the \\"Smoking (Prohibition in Public Places and Workplaces) (Guernsey) Law 2005\\". Anyone who breaks the law, upon conviction, could be fined up to the maximum of £1000 (~€1150, ~$1470).

It carries fines of $311 per incident, with police involvement, and fines up to $6,000 for businesses with possibility of being forced to close, and has been strongly enforced, even in provincial areas, including in large bars and nightclubs. Billiards areas at night continue to allow smokers. Hong Kong Hong Kong has seen all public smoking restricted from 1 January 2007 under the government's revised Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), first enacted in 1982 with several amendments subsequently. The latest amendment enlarges the smoke-free regulations to include indoor workplaces, most public places including restaurants, Internet cafés, public lavatories, beaches and most public parks. Some bars, karaoke parlors, saunas and nightclubs were exempt until 1 July 2009. Smoke-free regulations pertaining to lifts, public transport, cinemas, concert halls, airport terminals and escalators had been phased in between 1982 and 1997. The smoke-free requirements in shopping centres, department stores, supermarkets, banks, game arcades have been in place since July 1998. An anomaly exists on cross-border trains between Hong Kong and mainland China as they are operated jointly between MTR Corporation and China Railways, of whom the latter allows smoking in the restaurant car and in the vestibules at the end of the cars, but not in the seating area. Any person who smokes or carries a lighted tobacco product in a statutory no smoking area commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of HK$5,000. Unlike many other jurisdictions, Hong Kong does not place the onus on licensees of liquor licensed premises to enforce smoke-free regulations bans with subsequent loss of licence for non compliance. A 2009 law provides for fixed-penalty arrangement (HK$1,500) for smoking, on a par with that for littering. At the same time smoking was to be prohibited in designated public transport interchanges, but the government has yet to clarify how it will enforce this against non Hong Kong ID card-holders and tourists, since the offender has 21 days after the ticket issue to pay up. The overall daily smoking rate in Hong Kong is 11.8% (HK Department of Census and Statistics Household Thematic Survey 36) with 25% of males smoking whereas in China 63% of males smoke.

Smoke-free regulations were extended to Bali in November 2011, affecting tourist sites, including restaurants and hotels; plus schools, government buildings, places of worship and other public places. A ban on sale and advertising tobacco in schools was also enacted, although this would not stop tobacco companies offering sponsorship to schools. However, regulations were not strong enough, leading to a new stricter promulgation for June 2012. Smoking in trains of state company PT Kereta Api Indonesia has been banned as of 1 March 2012. Bali has banned smoking to be effective 1 June 2012, also having heavy fines.

The law was amended in 2007 so that owners are held accountable for smoking in premises under their responsibility. The second means by which smoking is regulated in Israel is via the environmental hazard law, and via criminal law smoking (or the introduction of second-hand smoke) may even be considered an assault.the criminal act law defines smoking as an assault (in Hebrew) The restrictions include all commercial entities such as lavatories, office buildings, gyms, cafés, restaurants, discos, pubs and bars, and it is illegal for the owners of such places to put ashtrays anywhere inside enclosed spaces. Also, owners of public places must display \\"no smoking\\" signs and prevent visitors from smoking. They can also designate a well-ventilated and completely separate area for smokers, as long as the non-smokers' area does not fall below 75% of the whole area. The fine for owners of public places is ₪ 5,000 (around US$1400) and for smokers – ₪ 1000. In spite of all of this, the smoke-free law has not met with 100% compliance and smoking is still encountered in some pubs, bars and clubs. In Israel, a 2011 law restricts smoking in railway stations and at bus stops, and prohibits the sale of tobacco from automated vending machines. An individual may call the police in cases of smoking in a restricted environment and can also sue (via the citizen's court) the smoking entity (i.e., both the person smoking and the facility that allowed smoking to occur).passive smoker is allowed to sue smokers when he can prove damages (in Hebrew)aggregation of verdicts against smokers in Israel(in Hebrew) Some cities are known for their rigorous enforcement of the smoke-free laws, such as the city of Be'er Sheva (which raised revenue of 799,000 NIS (~215K USD) in 2011 through fining smoking in public places) and Tel-Aviv, but in many municipalities the law isn't enforced. Italy Since 2003 it is forbidden to smoke in all public indoor spaces, including bars, cafés, restaurants and discos. However, special smoking rooms are allowed. In such areas food can be served, but they are subjected to very strict conditions: they need to be separately ventilated, with high air replacement rates; their air pressure must constantly be lower than the pressure in the surrounding rooms; they must be equipped with automatic sliding doors to prevent smoke from spreading to tobacco-free areas; they may occupy at most 50% of the establishment. Only 1% of all public establishments have opted for setting up a smoking room. Smoking is also forbidden in all enclosed workplaces – this includes also trains and underground stations. It is, indeed, permitted to smoke outdoors, which means that since Italy has sunny weather more than half of the year, people can still smoke at restaurants and bars as long as they sit at the outside tables and the establishment permits it. Ivory Coast Ivory Coast has a smoking ban in place. Jamaica Smoking is not permitted in the airport or generally indoors at shops and malls and places of business.

Japan Although there are no consistent nationwide smoke-free regulations in Japan, and all moves to introduce such reforms are strongly opposed by the powerful lobby groups, there are a growing number of local ordinances restricting smoking. Smoking is forbidden on the streets of the Chiyoda, Shinagawa, Shinjuku and Nakano wards of Tokyo for reasons of child safety (not health). Smoking is prohibited on public transport and subway platforms, while above ground train station platforms typically have smoking areas. Unlike Tokyo wards' ability to fine people for smoking on the streets, public transportation companies don't have the authority to enforce no smoking rules. Due to this inability, there are smokers not respecting no smoking rules, in some cases on a very frequent basis such as at Minami Urawa station in Saitama Prefecture, adjacent to Tokyo. Kanagawa Prefecture has implemented in April 2010 the nation's first prefecture-wide smoking ban, banning smoking in public facilities, including hospitals, schools and government offices. The ordinance requires large restaurants and hotels to choose whether to become nonsmoking or create separate smoking areas, while mah-jong and pachinko parlours, restaurants with floor space of up to 100 sq. meters and hotels of up to 700 sq. metres are merely required to \\"make efforts\\" to reduce second-hand smoke. Another Kanagawa ordinance to restrict smoking at swimming beaches was expected to be implemented in May 2010. Although still relatively few, there are a growing number of private businesses implementing voluntary smoking restrictions bans in restaurants, taxis, buildings and bars. In 2017, Japan experienced pressure from the International Olympics Committee (IOC) to implement smoking bans in all public areas to offer for healthy sporting environment. Japan is hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics and risks being the unhealthiest country to host the Olympics in years. Jersey Smoking is restricted in public places in Jersey (a British Crown dependency).

No one under 18 can use, sell or buy cigarettes or tobacco products. Tobacco cannot be sold where children might gather and be kept 100 meters from schools and playgrounds. Citizens are encouraged to help apprehend violators. Those who violate the ban could face up to four months in jail and a fine of 5,000 pesos (around $100). As of 2017, a pack of cigarettes is still cheap, costing about 27 pesos (54 cents) and more than 74 percent of that is taxes. Poland Smoking is prohibited in schools, hospitals or other medical facilities and public transport (including the vehicles such as train or bus and bus stops, train stations, etc. within the 10 metres radius).Act of 9 November 1995 on the Protection of Health from the Consequences of Tobacco (Dziennik Ustaw RP z 1996 r. nr 10, poz. 55, Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland 1996 No 10, item 55) In March 2010, an attempt to introduce a complete smokefree law failed. Since 1 January 2011, it is forbidden to smoke in indoor workplaces, and all public indoor spaces, including public offices, museums, bars, cafés, discos, shops or restaurants smaller than 100 square metres. In larger restaurants enclosed smoking areas are permitted, provided they are physically separated and properly ventilated. Smoking is also prohibited in venues for cultural and sporting events. Portugal Portuguese Law 37/2007 (in force since 1 January 2008) governs various aspects of the consumption, sale and control of tobacco in Portugal, and lists a large number of enclosed spaces where smoking is not permitted, including such obvious cases as schools, hospitals and theatres. The law states that exceptions to the no-smoking rule may be made in the cases, inter alia, of enclosed eating and drinking establishments (i.e. restaurants, cafes and bars) not frequented by under-18s if the smoking area is physically separated from the non-smoking area or where ventilation and air extraction systems directed towards the exterior are effective to the point of preventing smoke from entering the non-smoking area, and that in the case of establishments with a floor area of more than 100 square metres no more than 40% (if physically separated) or 30% otherwise may be designated a smoking area. In effect, restaurants are almost always smoke- free as are most cafes whose trade is mainly for food, whereas in bars the law is ignored by customers and bar owners alike. A study published in 2011 by the Ministry of Health showed 90% compliance with the law in establishments with a total smoking ban, but only 50% compliance in establishments where smoking is partly or wholly permitted (i.e., most bars). Infotabac Relatório page 71 Puerto Rico The Law No. 40 from 1993, the Law to Regulate the Smoking Practice in Public Places, and its later 1996 amendment Law 133, regulate smoking in private and public places. The most recent modification established in [2 March 2007], Law 66, amended articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 11 of Law Num. 40, forbids this practice inside jails, pubs, restaurants (including open-air terraces with one or more employees), bars, casinos, workplaces, educational institutions, cars with children under age 13 and most public places. Smoking sections are not allowed. Fines start at $250. Qatar The capital of Qatar, Doha, restricted smoking in public or closed areas in 2002. The law discouraged shopkeepers from selling to under-aged people and completely banned tobacco advertisements in the country and punished violaters with hefty fines. However, the law is openly flouted especially by the youth. Romania No smoking sign in a rural train station in Romania Smoking is banned in \\"indoor public places\\" such as schools, office buildings and public institutions, though specially designed smoking areas may be established on the premises under certain conditions. Hospitals, CFR passenger trains and the Bucharest Metro, among others, are completely smoke-free. Since 2011, bars and restaurants may be designated either as smoke-free or exclusively for smokers. On 15 December 2015, the Romanian Parliament adopted a law banning smoking in public areas. The law, that came into effect in March 2016 forbids smoking in any closed environment for public use, defining a closed environment as one having at least two walls. Russia Russia had been highly tolerant of smoking for a long time, with almost no regulation. However, the Soviet Union had approved countrywide campaigns against smoking. The law \\"on the protection of the population from the harmful effects of cigarette smoke and the consequences of tobacco consumption\\" has passed the third and final vote in the State Duma and has been effective partly from 1 July 2013 and has completely from 1 July 2014. Starting 1 June 2013, smoking in workplaces, on aircraft, trains and municipal transport as well as in schools, hospitals, cultural institutions and government buildings has been restricted and tobacco advertising and sponsorship forbidden. Graphic warnings have become compulsory. Starting 1 June 2014, smoking has also been prohibited in restaurants and cafés. Smokers will also be fined for smoking within a distance of 15 meters in front of entrances of subway stations, the airport or in children playgrounds and parks, as well as places and squares that attract many people. Rwanda Rwanda has a smoking ban in place. Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia had almost no restrictions against smoking until 2010 when the Council of Ministers urged the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) to restrict smoking at all airports and their facilities in the Kingdom, and strict rules were imposed. It also advised GACA to impose a fine of SR200 (US$53) on people who violate the new regulations. Many commercial buildings and work places banned smoking at offices in an attempt to stop smoking in public places. In addition, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran, for instance, launched a program in 2010 to make their university smoke-free, and Umm al-Qura University in Mecca launched a campaign with the same title in 2011. In May 2012, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh banned people from smoking in and around its buildings, the first such move in the country. The hospital implemented fines of SR200 for violations. On 30 July 2012, Interior Minister Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz ordered the implementation of a royal ban on smoking in all government facilities (ministries, buildings, institutions, offices etc.) and most indoor public places. The ban also prohibits smoking of hookahs in public places, and prohibits selling tobacco to anyone under 18. On 1 December 2012, the Saudi Commission for Tourism & Antiquities (SCTA) imposed a ban on smoking in all tourism facilities. From 6 June 2016, smoking is prohibited in the vicinity of religious, educational, health, sport and cultural institutions, social and charity institutions. Smoking is also prohibited at private and government offices, factories, banks, public transport facilities, in areas for manufacturing and processing food products and drinks, petrol, gas and fuel distribution systems, warehouses, elevators and restrooms, in addition to several other public places. Violating the law is punishable by a fine of SAR 200, which increases for repeat violations. Serbia The Serbian Parliament passed a new law on public smoking in November 2010. It forbids smoking in every indoor working or public space, and any outdoor space that is a functional part of a facility connected with health care, education, or child care. This law prescribes very high fines for employers and restaurant owners who do not post smoking ban notifications. Outlets (bars, cafés, restaurants, night clubs etc.) smaller than 80 sq m can choose whether to ban smoking or not, and outlets larger than this margin have to have divided areas for smokers and non-smokers. Singapore A sign in Singapore to indicate that smoking is allowed Smoking was restricted in hawker centres, coffee- shops, cafes and fast-food outlets beginning 1 July 2006. For establishments with an outdoor area, 10–20% of the area can be set aside for smoking, although they would have to be clearly marked to avoid confusion. Gradually, the regulations have been extended to bus interchanges and shelters, public toilets and public swimming complexes.Smoking Ban in Singapore On 1 July 2007, the regulations were extended to entertainment nightspots. The rule allows for construction of designated smoking rooms that can take up to 10% of the total indoor space. On 1 January 2009, the regulations were extended to all children's playgrounds, exercise areas, markets, underground and multi- storey carparks, ferry terminals and jetties. Coverage was also extended to non-air conditioned areas in offices, factories, shops, shopping complexes and lift lobbies. Smokers found flouting the rules are fined S$200 while the owners of the establishments are fined S$200 and S$500 for a subsequent offence. On 22 November 2010, the Towards Tobacco-Free Singapore online campaign was launched to support the initiative to phase out tobacco in Singapore by preventing the supply of tobacco to Singaporeans born from the year 2000. Social movements such as Tobacco Free Generation also exist on the island. Slovakia Since Nov 2019 Slovakia is the last EU country to still allow smoking in bars & clubs. Smoking is prohibited in most indoor places. Since 2004, employers have been obliged to provide separate smoking rooms or a designated outdoor smoking place if smoking is allowed at work. Smoking is also prohibited in the majority of indoor public places. The regulations currently exempt bars that do not serve food. Restaurants are also excepted from indoor smoking restrictions. Since 2010 there has been no requirement for restaurants to have separate smoking and non-smoking areas. Smoking is also prohibited in shopping centres but a loop-hole in the law allows smoking on the balconies of cafeterias in shopping centres. Enforcement of this law is the responsibility of the Slovak Business Inspection (SOI) service. There is also a partial restriction upon outdoor smoking, especially around railways stations and bus termini, and close to the entrances of government buildings. Local police forces are responsible for enforcing these laws, although this has on occasion been lax, reportedly due to a mix of corruption and insufficiently clear legislative requirements. Slovenia On 22 June 2007, the Slovenian National Assembly approved a law prohibiting smoking in all indoor public and work places, effective 5 August 2007. Exempted from the ban are \\"open public areas, special smoking hotel rooms, special smoking areas in elderly care centres and jails, and special smoking chambers in bars and other work places. The smoking chambers, which will have to meet strict technical standards, will however not be allowed to occupy more than 20% of an establishment.\\"Slovenia Gets Tough Anti-Smoking Legislation The law also raised the minimum age to purchase tobacco products from 15 to 18 and mandated that tobacco labels carry the telephone number of a quit-smoking hotline. Solomon Islands The Solomon Islands has a ban on smoking in many indoor public places, workplaces and public transport but allows smoking in designated areas in workplaces and boats. South Africa Bilingual \\"No Smoking\\" sign in English and Afrikaans at a state-owned facility. The South African government passed the first Tobacco Products Control Act in 1993 and started implementing the act in 1995. The act regulated smoking in public areas and prohibited tobacco sales to people under the age of 18. Some aspects of tobacco advertising were also regulated for example labelling. The 1993 act was not considered to be comprehensive enough and the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act was passed in 1999. This act prohibits all advertising and promotion of tobacco products, including sponsorship and free distribution of tobacco products. The act also restricts smoking in public places, which includes workplaces, restaurants, bars, and public transport. The act does allow for designated smoking areas (no more than 25% of the total floor area). The act also stipulates penalties for transgressors of the law, and specifies the maximum permissible levels of tar and nicotine. The regulations were implemented in 2001. The government proposed further amendments to the bill in 2007 that sought to deal with new practices designed to circumvent the Act. These amendments also aim to bring the current law into compliance with the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). This framework has been ratified by the South African government. The South African government has currently set the minimum legal age for smokers to 18. South Korea South Korea enforced strict smoking bans in public places since July 2013, with fines of ₩100,000 won on any spotted smoker and up to ₩5 million won on shop owners not following the law. It is illegal and strictly prohibited to smoke in all bars and restaurants, cafes, internet cafes, government buildings, kindergartens, schools, universities, hospitals, youth facilities, libraries, children's playgrounds, private academies, subway or train stations and their platforms and underground pathways, large buildings, theaters, department stores or shopping malls, large hotels and highway rest areas. The strict bans came into force gradually beginning with a ban on places larger than 150 square meters in 2012, extended to 100 square meters in 2014, with a full-fledged complete nationwide ban on 1 January 2015. Spain Since 1 January 2006 Spain had a partial restriction upon smoking in most public places. Offices, schools, hospitals and public transportation were smoke-free, but restaurants and bars could create a \\"smokers' section\\" or allow smoking if they were small (under 100m2). Since 2 January 2011 smoking has been restricted in every indoor public place, including restaurants, bars and cafes. Hotels may designate up to 30% of rooms for smoking; mental hospitals, jails and old people's residences may have public rooms where workers cannot enter. Outdoor smoking is also prohibited at childcare facilities, in children's playparks and around schools and hospital facilities. Establishments can be closed by the authorities for repeatedly violating the smoke-free law, as happened for the first time on 10 February 2011 in Marbella. Suriname Suriname has a smoking ban in place. Sweden In Sweden, smoking was restricted in restaurants, cafes, bars and nightclubs in June 2005. Smoking rooms are, however, allowed in these institutions. The smoking rooms contain a few restrictions: no serving or consumption of food or beverages is allowed in the smoking rooms and it may not cover more than 25% of the institution's total area. The smoke-free law was very popular amongst the population and even the industries affected.Swedish snuff – not just for men – SWEDEN.SE In January 2008, The Swedish Prison and Probation Service prohibited smoking indoors in prisons. Starting from 1 July 2019, smoking outdoors will be prohibited for restaurants with outdoor seating as well as playgrounds, sports grounds, bus stops, train platforms. Switzerland The Swiss Federal Assembly enacted a law for protection against second-hand smoke in 2008, which came into force on 1 May 2010. It prohibits smoking in enclosed, publicly accessible areas and in rooms that are workplaces for several persons. There are exceptions for bars and restaurants, which may allow smoking in separate, ventilated rooms or in establishments smaller than 80m2, but the federal statute allows for more stringent cantonal smoking bans. 10 cantons (Jura, Aargau, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Zug, Schwyz, Glarus, Schaffhausen, Thurgau, Appenzell Innerrhoden) have imposed only the national mandated restrictions, with the remaining 16 (Geneva, Vaud, Neuchâtel, Valais, Fribourg, Bern, Solothurn, Basel-City, Basel-Land, Zürich, Uri, Ticino, Graubünden, St. Gallen, Lucerne, Appenzell Ausserrhoden) imposing stricter laws by not excluding establishments smaller than 80 square meters. All 16 cantons however permit separate smoking rooms with 7 (Bern, Solothurn, Zürich, Uri, Ticino, Graubünden, St. Gallen) permitting service. Taiwan Smoking is regulated by the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act (Taiwan), promulgated on 11 July 2007. In January 2009, the government of Taiwan amended the original 1997 Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act by extending smoke-free areas to include almost all enclosed work-places and public places, banning tobacco advertisements, and increasing tobacco taxes. Thailand 100px Indoor smoking restrictions have been in effect in all indoor air-conditioned establishments throughout Thailand since November 2002, with entertainment areas exempted. Cigarettes have had graphic pictures since 2005, and advertising is banned. Enforcement and compliance have been strong. On 10 January 2008, Thailand announced further restrictions that came into force on 10 February 2008, in that smoking would be banned (indoors and outdoors) in establishments open to the public, including restaurants, bars, and open-air markets. Members of the public face a 2,000 baht fines for not complying, and establishments face a 20,000 baht fine for not enforcing the ban (including not displaying mandated 'no smoking' signs). In addition to fines, those who fail to comply may be arrested. Most legal bars comply with these regulations, but in establishments that operate illegally or semi- legally they are mostly disregarded. Timor-Leste Timor-Leste has a ban on smoking in many indoor public places, workplaces and public transport but has some exceptions for airports, government facilities and boats. Togo Togo has a smoking ban in place for certain public places. Turkey Turkey currently restricts smoking in government offices, workplaces, bars, restaurants, cafes, shopping malls, schools, hospitals, and all forms of public transport, including trains, taxis and ferries. Turkey's smoke-free law ban includes provisions for violators, where anyone caught smoking in a designated smoke-free area faces a fine of 83 liras (~€35/$47/£30) and bar owners who fail to enforce the law could be fined from 560 liras for a first offence up to 5,600 liras. Smoking was first restricted in 1997 in public buildings with more than four workers, as well as planes and public buses. On 3 January 2008, Turkey passed a law prohibiting smoking in all indoor spaces including bars, cafés and restaurants. It also restricts smoking in sports stadia, and the gardens of mosques, hospitals and schools. The smoking ban came into force on 19 May 2008; however, bars, restaurants and cafes were exempted until mid-July 2009. On 19 July 2009, Turkey extended the indoor public smoking restrictions to include bars, restaurants, village coffeehouses and nargile (hookah) bars. Turkmenistan In 1998, a ban on tobacco advertising was enacted. Under decree from President for life Saparmurat Niyazov, has prohibited the chewing of tobacco. In 2000, Turkmenistan banned smoking in all public places. People say the ban was implemented because the president was advised by his doctor to quit smoking.BBC News: Turkmen face smoking ban . 13 January 2012 In 2002, it was forbidden to smoke while behind the wheel. According to the Code of Administrative violations for smoking cigarettes, including hookah and other tobacco products in the bodies of state power and administration, executive bodies and local authorities, enterprises, institutions and organizations irrespective of ownership, military units and formations, educational institutions, theaters and cinemas, public transport, parks and other places of mass visiting citizens – punishable by a fine in the amount of 100 manats. In January 2016, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow banned the sales of all tobacco-related products nationwide, making Turkmenistan the second country in the world (after Bhutan) to implement such policy. Turks and Caicos Islands The Turks and Caicos Islands have a smoking ban in place in indoor public places, workplaces and public transport. Uganda In March 2004, smoking was prohibited in public places, including workplaces, restaurants and bars. An extension to private homes is being considered. Ukraine Smoking is banned in all indoor public places, including restaurants, discos, nightclubs, indoor workplaces and all state and cultural institutions, including football stadiums. United Arab Emirates Emirates in the United Arab Emirates recently started restricting smoking in shopping malls, beaches, gardens. The states leading the regulations on smoking are Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai and Sharjah. United Kingdom Since 1 July 2007 smoke-free workplace laws have been in effect across the whole of the UK. These were introduced in each constituent administration of the United Kingdom separately, as decided by the partially devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the UK Parliament acting for England. For details, see (in chronological order of bans): Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. =England= A smoking shelter outside on office building in England. Since 2007 such shelters have become commonplace at workplaces. Smoke-free regulations covering all indoor work-places in England, including bars, clubs and restaurants, came into force on 1 July 2007. Some places, such as certain smoking hotel rooms, nursing homes, prisons, submarines, offshore oil rigs, and stages/television sets (if needed for the performance) were initially exempted, as well as Royal Palaces, although members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords agreed to ban all smoking in the Palace of Westminster. The on-the-spot fine for smoking in a workplace is £50 (~€60/~$75), £30 (~€35/~$45) if one pays within 15 days, while a business that allows smoking can be fined £2,500 (~€3,700/~$3,800). Smoking largely remains permitted outdoors, apart from railway stations. However, an internal government briefing obtained by The Independent on Sunday newspaper reveals that powers are available to extend coverage to further outdoor areas if required. A legal loophole exists for cigar smokers who are allowed to smoke in store to 'sample' the cigar in England only. =Northern Ireland= In Northern Ireland, a smoke-free law has been in effect since 30 April 2007. It is illegal to smoke in all enclosed workplaces. This includes bars, restaurants, offices (even if the smoker is the only person in the office) and public buildings. Like Scotland, the smoke-free law is comprehensive in that places such as telephone boxes and enclosed bus/train shelters are included. The on- the-spot fine for smoking in a workplace is £50 (~€70/~$100), while a business that allows smoking can be fined £2,500 (~€3,700/~$5,000). A £200 fine may be levied by local councils if businesses fail to display no-smoking signs. An opinion poll showed that 91% of people supported the law. =Scotland= On 26 March 2006, Scotland prohibited smoking in enclosed (more than 50% covered) public places, which includes public buildings, workplaces, sports stadiums, bars and restaurants. Exemptions are in place to allow hotel guests to smoke in their own rooms, as long as the hotel has designated them as smoking rooms. The law restricts smoking in bus shelters, phone boxes or other shelters that are more than 50% enclosed. It also prohibits smoking in trucks and vans owned by a company, whether or not the driver is the only person inside (though smoking while driving was already legally questionable as it could be presented as \\"driving without due care and attention\\"). Nevertheless, the ban on smoking in work vehicles is commonly flouted, especially by tradesmen, and compliance with outdoor bans is minimal. There are no restrictions on smoking in railway stations as the railway bylaw applies only to England, and smoking remains common in outdoor areas of railway stations. Compliance with the indoor ban in pubs, restaurants and other workplaces is almost universal. Businesses covered by the smoking ban must display a statutory smoking sign at the entrance to, and around the building as well as a smoke-free policy. Opinion polls at its introduction showed a clear majority of the Scottish public were in favour of the ban. 'Widespread support for smoking ban in Scotland' As in New Zealand, the smoke-free law was initially criticised by certain interested groups (e.g., publicans, cafe and bingo hall owners, etc.) who feared that it would adversely impact their businesses. A survey published by the Scottish Beer & Pubs Association one year on from implementation concluded that \\"the number of pub licensed premises in Scotland has remained more or less constant over the last year\\" indicating fears of an adverse impact of the ban on the hospitality industry were unfounded. Widespread concerns prior to implementation about the impact on bingo halls prove harder to objectively assess: As at May 2008 there is anecdotal evidence to suggest an increase in closures of bingo halls since implementation. However, no statistical analysis has been conducted and speculation within the betting and gaming industry is that a decline could also be the result of demographic changes and increases in online gaming. The NHS Scotland Quit Smoking Line reported it received an additional 50,000 calls from people wishing to give up in the six months after the smoke-free law was introduced. In September 2007 a study of nine Scottish hospitals over the twelve months following implementation reported positively on its impact on the country's health, including a 17% drop in admissions for heart attacks, compared with average reductions of 3% per year for the previous decade. =Wales= Smoking was restricted across all enclosed public premises and work premises in Wales on 2 April 2007. Adherence is widespread and many public houses have closed since the law came into place.\\"MPs campaign to relax smoking ban in pubs\\" , BBC, 29 June 2011 Public places must display a special bilingual no smoking sign: * \\"Mae ysmygu yn y fangre hon yn erbyn y gyfraith\\" (Welsh) * \\"It is against the law to smoke in these premises\\" (English) In addition, Wales is due to introduce a smoking ban outside schools and hospitals from Summer 2019. United Nations As United Nations buildings are not the subject of any national jurisdiction, the United Nations has its own smoking and non-smoking policies. Following the gradual introduction of partial smoking restrictions between 1985 and 2003, Secretary-General Kofi Annan introduced in 2003 a total prohibition upon smoking at United Nations Headquarters. Similar restrictions have not been introduced in field offices of the United Nations worldwide. Some specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organization have their own strict smoke- free regulations that apply to their offices worldwide, but the same is not necessarily true for entities of the Secretariat, such as the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Only on 13 December 2007, OCHA introduced a smoke-free regulation applicable to all its field offices. United States In the United States, Congress has not attempted to enact any nationwide federal smoking ban. Therefore, smoking bans in the United States are entirely a product of state and local criminal and occupational safety and health laws. As a result, the existence and aggressiveness of smoking bans varies widely throughout the United States, ranging from total bans (even outdoors), to no regulation of smoking at all. Jurisdictions in the greater South tend to have the least restrictive smoking bans or no statewide bans at all. Of the 60 most populated cities in the United States, all but 17 ban smoking in all bars and restaurants. According to Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, as of October 2012, 81.3% of the U.S. population is covered by bans on smoking in \\"workplaces, and/or restaurants, and/or bars, by either a state, commonwealth, or local law,\\" although only 48.7% are covered by bans in all workplaces and restaurants and bars. As of November 2012, 28 states have banned smoking in all general workplaces and public places, including bars and restaurants (though many of these exempt tobacconists, cigar bars, casinos, private clubs, and/or small workplaces). Six have enacted smoking bans exempting all adult venues including bars, and in some cases casinos and restaurants (Tennessee exempts any place not admitting patrons under 21). Georgia, Idaho, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Virginia have particularised state laws banning smoking in specific places but leaving out all others. The remaining 10 states have no statewide smoking bans at all, though many cities and/or counties in those states have enacted local smoking bans to varying degrees (except Oklahoma, which prohibits local governments from regulating smoking at all). As for U.S. jurisdictions that are not states, as of November 2012 smoking is banned in all public places (including bars and restaurants) in American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and United States Virgin Islands. Guam prohibits smoking in restaurants, but not in any other workplaces. The Northern Mariana Islands prohibits smoking in most workplaces and in restaurants but not in bars. Uruguay In March 2006, it became illegal in Uruguay to smoke in enclosed public spaces. Now bars, restaurants or offices where people are caught smoking face fines of more than $1,100 or a three-day closure. This makes Uruguay the first country in South America to ban smoking in enclosed public spaces. Anti-smoking groups estimate that as many as a third of Uruguay's 3.4 million people smoke. President Tabaré Vázquez, a practicing oncologist, has cited reports suggesting about seven people die each day in Uruguay (an estimated 5,000 people a year) from smoking-related causes including lung cancer, emphysema and other illnesses.Public smoking ban takes effect in Uruguay – TobacoFree.org Vatican City A July 2002 law signed by Pope John Paul II banned smoking on all places accessible to the public, and in all closed places of work within the Vatican City, and within all extraterritorial properties of the Holy See. Smoking bans in museums, libraries and churches on Vatican territory had already been in force for a long time. In November 2017, Pope Francis banned the sale of cigarettes throughout Vatican City, the sale of cigars is still legal. Venezuela On 31 May 2011 Venezuela introduced a ban on smoking in all enclosed public and commercial spaces, including malls, restaurants, bars, discos, workplaces, etc. The owners or managers of the establishments where smoking is banned, must post a notice measuring 80 cm. (31.5 inches) wide and 50 cm (19.7 inches) high; The poster should contain an international smoking ban pictogram and the following text: \\"Este es un ambiente 100% libre de humo de tabaco, por resolución del Ministerio del Poder Popular para la Salud\\" (This is a 100% smoke-free environment, by resolution of the Ministry of Popular Power for Health). Owners or managers also have the obligation to ensure compliance with this rule. Owners or managers that do not post the notice or do not ensure compliance with the rule may be penalized with the closure of the establishment and / or a fine that can be up to 190,000 VEF (US$1.90), however, regulation does not provide sanctions for smokers.Venezuelanalysis.com, 30 May 2011, Smoking Banned in Public and Commercial Closed Spaces in Venezuela Vietnam The Vietnamese government has banned smoking and cigarette sales in offices, production facilities, schools, hospitals, and on public transport. However, bus drivers, especially in north Vietnam, occasionally smoke. Smoking was banned in enclosed indoor spaces and public facilities in Ho Chi Minh City in 2005 with the exception of entertainment areas. A ban has also been imposed on all forms of advertisement, trade promotion, and sponsorship by tobacco companies, as well as cigarette sales through vending machines, or over the telephone and on the Internet. Zambia Smoking is prohibited in public places in Zambia and is punishable by a fine of K400 or imprisonment of up to two years. Specific restrictions=Outdoor smoking restrictions *It is illegal to smoke at a bus shelter in Ireland. It was also the first country in the world to impose a restriction upon smoking outdoors within 3-metres of a public building. *In Costa Rica, it is also illegal to smoke at a bus shelter or at queues for the bus, train, etc. It is also forbidden to smoke in public parks and recreational areas. *In the Australian state of Queensland, smoking is prohibited within four metres of entrances to public buildings, within 10 metres of children's playground equipment, in commercial outdoor eating or drinking areas, at patrolled beaches, and at all major sports stadiums.Outdoor public areas Queensland Government **Some beaches in Sydney, Australia have smoking restrictions in place. **Smoking on land owned by the New South Wales Department of Education is prohibited. *Cambridge Memorial Hospital in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, enacted a total (outdoor) smoke-free regulation, believed to be the first in the entire province if not country, as of October 2004. At the same time, Wilfrid Laurier University in the nearby city of Waterloo, Ontario, proposed a similar total smoke-free regulation on its property, after its 10 metre outdoor proximity restriction (enacted in 2002) failed. WLU was presumed to be the third Canadian (public) post-secondary institution to consider such measures, after Carleton and Acadia. **Smoking is prohibited in Hamilton Street Railway bus shelters in Hamilton, Ontario. **It is illegal to smoke on a bus or at a bus shelter in Winnipeg, Manitoba. **It is illegal to smoke on a bus or at a bus shelter as well as less than 4 metres from any entrance in Halifax, Nova Scotia. **Calgary, Alberta, prohibited all outdoor patio smoking at bars, restaurants and casinos on 1 July 2005.

Some Singapore citizens have launched an online campaign to support the proposal to prevent the supply of tobacco to Singaporeans born from the year 2000. New Zealand hopes to be smoke-free in 2025. ASH New Zealand is a group of people who believe New Zealand should be smoke-free and have become popular. The Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health also are trying to promote the idea that New Zealand should be smoke- free.

Life Born September 6, 1838 in Elgin, Scotland, Audsley apprenticed with A. & W. Reid, architects there. In 1856, he followed his older brother, William James Audsley to Liverpool, England, and was employed by architect John Weightman. By 1860, Audsley & Co., architects and makers of mounts and passe-partout, was established. The firm was eventually named W. & G. Audsley and completed ten churches in the Gothic Revival Style in the Liverpool area. An eclectic style was used for synagogues built in Liverpool and London. The firm's secular buildings, such as the Layton Art Gallery in Milwaukee, WI, USA, closely followed the style of Alexander Thomson (1817-1875), featuring Greek, Egyptian and Hindu motifs. Audsley and his brother authored lavishly illustrated books on ornament and Japanese art, as well as personally illuminated versions of great literature. In 1875 Audsley collaborated with his friend James Lord Bowes, a wealthy Liverpool Wool Merchant and collector of Japanese art, to produce The Keramic Art of Japan. This was one of the first and most important books on Japanese art to be produced in the English language and, like many of Audsley's works, it continues to be a popular classic publication still in print. By 1884, the brothers apparently separated, with William emigrating to the United States and George relocating to a London suburb where he had built a house complete with a music room and a pipe organ he designed himself that was admired by Saint-Saëns and others. The move to London seems to have been occasioned by Audsley's success with the New West End Synagogue there (a masterpiece of Victorian architecture and furnishing), but further architectural commissions in the London area failed to materialize. While there, he appears to have been financially unsuccessful in establishing himself as a pipe-organ designer and author of artistic books. He emigrated to the United States, settling in the New York City area in around 1890. The firm of W. & G. Audsley was revived and was commissioned to design the Bowling Green Offices (completed 1896), the largest office building erected in New York City to that time. Two Catholic schools, a chapel in Brooklyn, NY, a library in Norwalk, CT, and a church in Philadelphia, PA, were also designed by the firm. Pipe Organs Illustration from Organ-stops and their artistic registration - names, forms, construction, tonalities, and offices in scientific combination (1921) by George Ashdown Audsley Audsley's interest in the pipe organ was largely sparked by early experiences hearing W. T. Best at St. George's Hall, Liverpool. Audsley wrote numerous magazine articles on the organ, and as early as the 1880s was envisioning huge instruments with numerous divisions each under separate expression, in imitation of the symphony orchestra. The Los Angeles Art Organ Co. (successors to the Murray M. Harris Organ Company) had Audsley design the world's largest organ they were building for the St. Louis Exposition of 1904, and included him on the paid staff. This instrument was produced just as his book on The Art of Organ-Building was being published This great pipe organ eventually was purchased for the John Wanamaker Store in Philadelphia, PA, where it is today known as the Wanamaker Organ. In 1905, Audsley published the monumental two-volume The Art of Organ Building as an attempt to position himself as the pre-eminent organ designer in the US. The lavish work includes numerous superb drawings done by Audsley and is still consulted today although organ fashions have evolved in many directions in the ever-fluid, passion- driven world of music. He was an early advocate of console standardization and radiating concave pedal keyboards to accommodate the natural movement of human legs. Unfortunately, his plan to develop the profession of \\"organ architect\\" as a consultant to work in consultation with major builders in achieving a high-art product was short-lived. Few commissions for pipe organs or buildings came his way, and few organs were built to high-art standards. In subsequent years, he wrote several works, one of which was published posthumously, that were essentially shortened forms of his 1905 organ building book, updated to comment on controversies of the day and the rapid advances in applying electro-pneumatic actions and playing aids to the craft. The National Association of Organists (now defunct) bestowed an Audsley medal in his honor. Personality and Artistic Temperament Audsley was dogmatic by nature and generally unwilling to compromise his ideals. In architecture he followed the teachings of John Ruskin and rejected \\"sham architecture\\" such as \\"miserable inch-thick plaster\\" imitating stone vaulting and iron columns finished to look like marble. Audsley strongly insisted on quality materials both in buildings and pipe organs. He made an important distinction in pipe-organ tone from what is musical and what is mere \\"musical noise.\\" He was in the vanguard of the symphonic-organ music but also believed in fully developed principal choruses with real mixtures. He was very much his own worst critic and attention to detail is evident in every aspect of his works. He was dedicated to mid-19th century forms of architecture and rejected the Beaux Arts and subsequent movements, at perhaps much personal cost. Audsley's overarching theory of organ design has been considered either eccentric or particular to its period, and was never adopted fully by any builder. It would be wrong, however, to say that many aspects of his writing were not influential. His urging of multiple divisions under expression proved particularly prophetic, and there is much of value in his books on his discussions of organ stops, their natures, their materials, and the relative merits of the various forms of construction possible. As an example of his eccentricity, Audsley insisted that sound was not a wave in a medium, but some kind of particle phenomenon, rejecting all the science to the contrary. It has been said that Audsley was very right when he was right, but very wrong when he was wrong. In all his achievements, however, there is excellence in execution, deep thought, profound craftsmanship and high artistry. Art is never static, and all his achievements reward patient study. Death Audsley's last years were spent with little income living with his son in Bloomfield, New Jersey. He died there working on his unfinished book, The Temple of Tone, on June 21, 1925, and was buried at Mt. Hope Cemetery in Yonkers, New York. Audsley descendants Many of Audsley's descendants pursued artistic careers. Son Berthold was a model maker whose works are preserved in a Newark Museum. Son Maurice was a skilled photographer.

Ciprodex contains the synthetic broad- spectrum antibacterial agent, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (0.3%), combined with the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid, dexamethasone (0.1%), in a sterile, preserved suspension for otic use. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has shown in vitro activity against many Gram-positive and Gram- negative bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dexamethasone acts as an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid. Ciprodex is indicated for use in the treatment of acute otitis media and acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear) in ages 6 months and older. Ciprodex should be avoided in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin or other quinolones and should not be used to treat viral infections. Ciprodex is typically given twice a day in each infected ear, 4 drops per ear, for as long as prescribed by the doctor (usually 7 days).http://www.ciprodex.com/  Mechanism of action  Ciprofloxacin functions as a bactericide by interfering with DNA gyrase, an enzyme with a key role in the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Dexamethasone is used in combination in order to aid in the reducing inflammatory responses that often accompany bacterial infection.  Clinical trials  In clinical trials, the median time to cessation of ear pain in Ciprodex was 5 days in a sample population of 909 patients. However, the clinical trial failed to demonstrate any significant benefit of using the combination of active ingredients in Ciprodex over ciprofloxacin alone, in regards to ear pain. Ciprodex was superior to ciprofloxacin in regards to time to cessation of otorrhea.  Phase I  The most reported adverse effects of phase I studies included headache, rhinitis, pain, dyspepsia, and dysmenorrhea. Investigators did not believe that any of these were directly treatment-related, as many of these events are considered symptoms or manifestations of the underlying illness.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2003/021537_Ciprodex_medr.PDF  Phase II and III  Treatment-related adverse effects in AOE studies were determined in phase II and III trials. This includes ear pruritus, ear debris, superimposed ear infection, ear congestion, ear pain, and erythema. Similar effects were demonstrated in AOMT studies. Overall, Ciprodex was determined as a safe and well-tolerated drug for the treatment of AOE and AOMT. The proposed dosage for all patients was also effective and safe. Cure rates for pediatrics were slightly higher than adults in AOE studies.  Drug interactions  Drug interactions have not been studied with Cirprodex.  Commercialization  Ciprodex, owned by Alcon Laboratories, Inc., is protected by multiple patents and will be restricted from generic manufacturing until 2025.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/patexclnew.cfm?Appl_No=021537∏_No=001&table1;=OB_Rxhttps://www.google.com/patents/US8846650 Ciprodex is the number 1 topical antibiotic ear drop prescribed since 2007 by ENTs and pediatricians. There have been 18 million prescriptions filled for Ciprodex since 2003, making it the world leading marketed ear drops for AOE. In October 2015, Alcon sued Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (DLR) for allegedly infringing on Ciprodex patents.

History Nixon purchased the first of his three waterfront homes, 500 Bay Lane, during 1969 from his former Senate colleague George Smathers of Florida. Nixon visited it at least 50 times while in office as President from 1969 to 1974. Nixon's compound was close to the home of Charles \\"Bebe\\" Rebozo who resided at 490 Bay Lane and of industrialist Robert Abplanalp (inventor of the modern aerosol spray can valve). Bebe Rebozo, president/owner of the Key Biscayne Bank, was indicted for money-laundering a $100,000 donation from Howard Hughes to the Nixon election campaign. According to an exposé by Don Fulsom, Nixon and Rebozo got bargain real estate prices from Donald Berg, a Mafia-associated Rebozo business partner. The Secret Service eventually advised Nixon to stop associating with Berg. The lender for one of Nixon's properties was Arthur Desser, who consorted with both Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa and mobster Meyer Lansky. Nixon and Rebozo were friends of James V. Crosby, the chairman of a company repeatedly associated with major mobsters, and Rebozo's Key Biscayne Bank was a suspected pipeline for Mafia money from Crosby's casino in The Bahamas. By the 1960s, FBI agents monitoring the Mafia had identified Rebozo as a \\"non-member associate of organized crime figures.\\" President John F. Kennedy and Nixon met for the first time after the 1960 presidential election in an oceanfront villa at the old Key Biscayne Hotel. As the Watergate scandal developed, Nixon spent more time in seclusion there. The United States Department of Defense spent $400,000 constructing a helicopter landing pad in Biscayne Bay adjacent to the Nixon compound. When Nixon sold his property, including the helicopter pad, there were public accusations that he enriched himself at taxpayer expense. Scarface, the 1983 gangster movie starring Al Pacino, was filmed there. The original building was razed during July 2004 by owner Edgardo Defortuna, president of Fortune International Realty.

The facility ceased all medical services on February 25, 2010. History The hospital's southeast corner, 2007. Home Hospital originally began in a house at the corner of 16th and Howell streets, adjacent to the current Franciscan Health Lafayette Central campus. It was known as \\"The Home for the Friendless,\\" a place where care was provided for homeless residents. At their board meeting in November 1894, the board voted to use the home and all of its belongings as a hospital, as many other community organizations began serving homeless and destitute residents. They voted to rename the facility, \\"City Hospital,\\" which never caught on with residents, who kept going back to the name \\"Home.\\" On June 16, 1895, Lafayette Home Hospital was officially incorporated as a non-profit entity with 21 local residents serving on the board of directors. As part of the group’s fundraising activities, they offered to name the hospital after any local benefactors. \\"If any generous and public spirited lady or gentleman wishes to hand his or her name down to posterity as a benefactor or to erect a monument that will be lasting and grand by contributing sufficient money to build the proposed institution, it will be possible to change the name, so as to honor the donor,\\" was one report in the Lafayette Journal & Courier from June 1895. (A date of July 22, 1895 appears on the paperwork approved by the Secretary of State.) While no benefactors stepped forward to change the name, several community members and groups stepped forward to provide supplies, funds and eventually land for Home Hospital. According to the Journal & Courier in a special 1945 edition about Home Hospital, the first patient was Miss Mary Smith – who later married Robert Orr, who lived at 923 N. 8th St. \\"On the morning of Mrs. Orr’s operation, she recalls that all patients ate together, after which the dining room table was cleared for action and the surgery performed. The hospital then is said to have had one nurse, an assistant who also kept house, and a cook. There was room for eight patients and the place was like a home, with the staff and patients forming one happy family.\\" As their services grew, the board was looking for a new location. After much debate, thoughts of building at Seventh and Union streets were abandoned. In early 1898, a Hospital Ladies’ Aid Society was established as a way to continue to raise funds for various needs at the hospital. In October 1898, the board purchased a half block of land at 24th and South streets – 3 acres of land – across from Columbian Park, which many people called \\"out in the country.\\" The land included a farm house, which would serve as the new hospital. In 1901, one of the first benefactors for Home Hospital stepped forward with a gift. John P. Kile, a retired merchant from Lafayette, donated funds and built a new two-story brick building in memory of his wife Elizabeth. The building would be known as the Kile Building, but the organization would still continue to be known as Home Hospital. The new building would have rooms for 24 patients and administration. In December 1905, a third floor was added onto the Kile Building. Mrs. Charles B. Stuart gave Home Hospital an early Christmas gift by donating the rest of the block to the hospital and now its property extended to 25th Street. Throughout the next 40 years, the community continued to provide donations that enabled Home Hospital to expand, both in facilities and property. The Kile Building was continually used until it was demolished in 1981. In the mid 1950s, a group of community leaders gathered and met with both administration and boards of Home Hospital and St. Elizabeth to plan for the future. After about three years of study, the group made its intentions known on April 15, 1959: to provide funding to build 100 beds at Home Hospital and 100 beds at St. Elizabeth, as well as provide equipment and space for ancillary services. The group launched a campaign called HEALTH: Help Enlarge Adequately Lafayette’s Two Hospitals. According to the April 16, 1959 edition of the Journal and Courier, the Tippecanoe County Medical Society recognized \\"the critical shortage of hospital facilities in Greater Lafayette, Tippecanoe County and the surrounding area, sought the assistance of the Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce in obtaining expansion of Home and St. Elizabeth Hospitals.\\" A report was issued by the HEALTH committee by Dr. Herman Smith and Associates – a hospital consultant – emphasizing the need for improvement and expansion at both facilities. The reason why the hospitals needed to be modernized: expansion and growth in the community, especially with new industries and a growing student population at Purdue. The more than $3 million campaign was launched with four goals in mind: to address the existing shortage of hospital beds; the greater demand for beds and other hospital facilities that would accompany population growth; the need for replacement of outmoded facilities; and the improvements necessary for the hospitals to keep pace with the continuing advancements in medical science. The HEALTH campaign went to build a new four-story wing for 100 beds, a new lobby and administrative area, new emergency department, physical medicine department, central medicine supply department, X-ray suite, operating rooms and laboratories at Home Hospital. In the marketing material, it recalled the history of each entity and how they were working together for the community: \\"Together, St. Elizabeth and Lafayette Home Hospital have provided the finest possible health service to our community for a total of over 140 years. The history of each institution is a story of struggle and of heartening achievement. Now, however, as our hospitals look to the future, their ability to continue serving this expanding community, is once again, threatened. The facilities in our hospitals, just as for those in many other institutions across the land, have in recent years been severely strained by record demands for health care. The urgent need to bring our facilities up-to-date must be met now, for when emergency strikes, there must be room in our hospitals.\\" The 1970s brought additional advancements in technology and services to Home Hospital. The hospital, which had 365 beds, 35 bassinets and nine isolettes, celebrated the launch of the neonatal intensive care unit in July 1975. Other happenings from 1975 included the Auxiliary providing $59,242.96 to Home Hospital, a bulk of that from the Home Hospital Fair, the gift shop and other events. Their main goal was to complete their pledge of $500,000 for the building fund. The report also included that \\"Home Hospital’s Red Coats, the first all-male organization of hospital volunteers in the world, celebrated their 10th anniversary.\\" Construction and changes in services continued through the 1980s and 1990s. Home Hospital continued to experience patient growth. The result: the addition of the new front lobby, patient rooms and ancillary service areas, parking garage and other areas. In 1984, a corporate restructuring created a family of corporations united by a single goal: doing whatever was necessary to maintain Home Hospital as a vibrant, community-owned hospital. North Central Health Services (NCHS) became the new name and parent company of Home Hospital and several other ventures. In 1990, in preparing for its 100th anniversary as Home Hospital, it launched a massive remodeling and modernization project. On September 26, 1997, Home Hospital and St. Elizabeth officials announced that the two entities intended to combine the governance and management in a new corporation. The unified hospital system – originally called Greater Lafayette Health Services (GLHS) – would work to be more efficient and more responsive to those who purchase and consume health care. Some of the benefits of creating the new system would be to eliminate waste and reduce the duplication of expensive technology. They officially merged on January 1, 1999. Greater Lafayette Health Services announced in late 2005 a plan to close Home Hospital, and construct a new facility now called Franciscan Health Lafayette East on the city's southeast side. Work on the new facility commenced in late 2006, with completion and occupation occurring on February 25, 2010; Home Hospital closed the same day. A private developer, Columbian Park Redevelopment LLC. agreed to purchase the property in late 2012. Denney Excavating Inc started demolition in early 2013, finishing in December 2013. The site is now occupied by The Springs at Lafayette, a rehabilitation and assisted living facility.

Waller Dr. James E. Waller is a Holocaust and Genocide Studies professor at Keene State College located in Keene, New Hampshire. Keene State College is home to the Cohen Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, one of the nation’s oldest Holocaust resource centers. Keene State College also offers the only undergraduate major in Holocaust and Genocide Studies in the United States. Within the Cohen Center, Dr. Waller teaches courses primarily focused on genocide and comparative genocide. Dr. Waller was previously a Professor of psychology at Whitworth University, in Spokane, Washington, and was the Edward B. Lindaman Chair from Fall 2003-2007. In addition to being an educator, Dr. Waller is also regularly involved in the policy making arena with his role as Director of Academic Programs with the Auschwitz Institute for Peace and Reconciliation (AIPR), as the curriculum developer and lead instructor for the Rahael Lemkin Seminar for Genocide Prevention. Within AIPR, Dr. Waller educates and trains in genocide prevention for the US Army command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Dr. Waller also has delivered briefings on genocide prevention and perpetrator behavior for the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, the CIA Directorate of Intelligence, and the International Human Rights Unit of the FBI. Biography Waller has led teacher training in Holocaust and genocide studies for the Washington State Holocaust Education Resource Center (2009 and 2012), the North Carolina Center for the Advancement of Teaching (2010), the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (2010-2012, 2015), and the Zoryan Institute (2015 and 2016). In addition, he has consulted on exhibition development with the National Institute for Holocaust Education at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) and the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre in Rwanda. His fieldwork has included research in Germany, Israel, Northern Ireland, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Argentina, Chile, and Guatemala. During 1999-2000, Dr. Waller was one of sixteen national recipients of the prestigious Pew Fellowship Award to continue his work on the psychology of human evil. In June 2007, he received the “First Voice Humanitarian Award” from the Chicago Center for Urban Life & Culture in recognition of his work in connecting students with urban communities, particularly communities in need. In November 2011, Waller was recognized by a California Senate Resolution for “his tireless efforts to end genocide.” In 2012, he was Keene State College’s institutional nominee for the Joseph B. and Toby Gittler Prize from Brandeis University, an award given in recognition of scholarly contributions to racial, ethnic, and/or religious relations. Dr. Waller was appointed as the Centennial Global Ethics Fellow of the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs for 2013-2014. Most recently, in September 2015, he was named a Peace Ambassador by the Center for Peacebuilding in Sanski Most, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Dr. Waller's book, Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing, is a standard text for students of genocide throughout the United States. He is widely recognized for his work on intergroup relations and prejudice, and in 1996 developed a study program titled \\"Prejudice Across America.\\" The program drew national media attention and was named by President Bill Clinton's Initiative on Race as one of America's \\"Promising Practices for Racial Reconciliation.\\" Many of the experiences from the study program are chronicled in Dr. Waller's first book, Face to Face: The Changing State of Racism Across America; and in a second book, Prejudice Across America.http://www.keene.edu/newsevents/default.cfm Type=NewsDetail&News;_ID=2294 In addition to four books, Dr. Waller has published twenty-eight articles in peer-reviewed professional journals and contributed twenty chapters in edited books. His book on perpetrators of genocide, Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing (Oxford University Press, 2002), was praised by Publisher’s Weekly for “clearly and effectively synthesizing a wide range of studies to develop an original and persuasive model of the process by which people can become evil.” In addition to being used as a textbook in college and university courses around the world, Becoming Evil also was short-listed for the biennial Raphael Lemkin Book Award from the Institute for the Study of Genocide. Concepts from Becoming Evil, released in a revised and updated second edition in 2007, have been the basis for an international best-selling novel (The Exception by Christian Jungersen) and a play workshopped in the School of Theater, Film, and Television at UCLA. Dr. Waller’s next book, also from Oxford, is titled Confronting Evil: Engaging Our Responsibility to Prevent Genocide with a release date of May 2016. Dr. Waller received his B.S. (1983) from Asbury University (KY), M.S. (1985) from the University of Colorado, and Ph.D. in Social Psychology (1988) from the University of Kentucky. He also has completed additional certification work in safety and security after violent conflict at the Queen’s University of Belfast, Northern Ireland. He is an active member of the International Association of Genocide Scholars (for which he served as the program chair at the eighth biennial meeting in 2009 and is currently a member of the Advisory Board) as well as the International Network of Genocide Scholars. Dr. Waller also serves on the board of the Journal for the Study of Antisemitism, as an editor-in-chief for Genocide Studies and Prevention, and is an Honorary Member of the International Expert Team of the Institute for Research of Genocide Canada. Dr. Waller lectures and speaks on Holocaust and genocide studies, intergroup relations, and prejudice for academic, professional, and public audiences.

Mission statement The Ottawa-Carleton Educational Space Simulation, or Spacesim, is a non-profit organization that promotes a greater understanding of space exploration and research in students of all ages. By conducting a 120-hour mission to a chosen planet, moon, or asteroid each year, Spacesim strives to foster initiative and responsibility in its members, while instilling love and respect for space and science. Mission The most important activity conducted by Spacesim is its annual 120-hour simulated space mission. This mission is conducted in a simulated spacecraft, or Habitat, designed and built by the organization. https://ottawacitizen.com/technology/journey+write+home+about/4363228/story.html The current habitat was built in the 2008/2009 school year, after the Ottawa- Carleton District School Board asked the OCESS to move to a different room within the same building. The previous habitat had been built in 2001.http://www.wiki.spacesim.org/index.php/Mission Accompanying the Habitat is an array of custom-made software written by the current Teacher Adviser of the organization, Dr. James Magwood. This software handles everything from environmental conditions to the navigation and piloting of the Habitat. Dr. Magwood's work with the organization earned him Carleton University's 2010 Patrick O'Brien High School Teaching Award.https://carleton.ca/studentsupport/patrick-obrien-high-school-teaching- award/ One mission, in 2011, visited Europa, a moon of Jupiter, an anomalous object and the Gliese 581 planetary system. The original flight plan was to fly to the potentially habitable Gliese 581g but due to unknown radiation levels and low fuel, the mission landed on Gliese 581f. While the simulation generally steers away from speculative science such as a mission destination the existence of which is indeterminate, this year's was chosen to underscore for members the real life proliferation of exoplanets. Previous missions include the 2010 mission, which visited three moons of Jupiter, the 2009 mission to Iapetus, the 2008 mission to Mars, and the 2007 mission to Borrelly. Habitat The Habitat, called the Hawking III as the third in a series of OCESS habitats named after eminent physicist Stephen Hawking, is the simulated living space for astronauts during missions. The current incarnation of the Habitat, composed entirely of drywall with metal supports, is made up of seven modules: the Control Room, Interlock, Longhouse, Hotlab, Washroom, Engineering Closet, and Airlock. The Control Room is the flight deck of the Hab; in it are the four computers and some miscellaneous equipment essential to the operation of the mission. The computers run the simulation programs software such as EECOM (Emergency, Environmental & COnsuMables), BIOCOM (BIOlogical COMmunications, which details the health of each astronaut both for Mission Control and for the astronauts), ORBIT (the piloting software), and Engineering, which is used to control the habitat's engineering systems. During the Mission each of these programs is run on a dedicated computer, but BIOCOM shares a computer with mission records and logs. Every room is outfitted with CAPCOM (CAPsule COMmunicator), telephone lines that allows the astronauts to communicate with Mission Control. Contents of the rooms The Control Room contains a television with a camera feed to Mission Control, so as to enable two-way visual communication in the event of a telephone and radio failure. Astronauts are encouraged to become familiar with sign language, an endeavour in which they are aided by an instructive chart on the wall of the Control Room. The Interlock is the largest room of the habitat and it connects to every other room. It serves as a kitchen, containing a refrigerator, a microwave, and a full complement of cupboards and cutlery, and also contains a television and camera feed that monitors activity in the airlock and hotlab. The Longhouse is where the astronauts sleep during the mission. It contains 3 wooden bunk beds, providing 1 bed for each of the 6 astronauts. The Hotlab is a laboratory in which tests are conducted on samples collected during the mission, and contains an isolated work area or 'Hotbox' to handle potentially dangerous substances. It also contains the materials necessary to determine the identity of unknown substances, such as pH Indicators, thermometers and solubility charts. The Washroom contains chemical toilets, and is the only room in the habitat aside from the Engineering Closet that does not contain a video camera. The Engineering Closet houses the vital machines that maintain the vital functions of the habitat, such as the engine, air compression systems, and life support. Finally, the Airlock enables astronauts to enter and exit the habitat without venting the atmosphere inside the other five modules. It contains materials necessary for an Extra-vehicular activity, such as flashlights, sample collectors, and EVA suits. In 2011, Samuel Baltz gave a tour of the habitat and its rooms to the Ottawa Citizen. Education Aside from the mission, SpaceSim also conducts several programs to educate youth outside the club. The organization offers two programs: a hands-on learning experience, known as the Elementary Education Program (EEP), and a planetarium program. The OCESS is one of two organizations in the Ottawa area to offer planetariums, the other being the Canada Science and Technology Museum. Elementary Education Program EEPs are offered to every elementary school within the Ottawa-Carleton District school board every year, although only one has been performed in the last four years due to a decline in interest within the organization. These entail transporting one or more classes of students to the OCESS's facilities and providing them with science demonstrations in such fields as Electrostatics, Classical Physics, Rocketry, and special characteristics of the planets of the solar system. The best-loved demonstration of the EEP is the Neptune demonstration, which involves freezing marshmallows in liquid nitrogen as a treat for the visiting classes. Complete details regarding the EEP are available on the OCESS Website. Planetarium Program The Planetarium Program involves transporting the OCESS's inflatable planetarium to elementary or high schools across the Ottawa region and delivering a presentation involving constellations, luminosity, temperature of stars, and a discussion about light pollution. The standard presentation is designed to complement the Grade 9 Ontario Science Curriculum, but the experience is equally suitable for a younger audience. Complete details regarding the Planetarium Program are available on the OCESS Website. Leadership One of the most important facets of the OCESS is the leadership experience it provides for its members. The club is entirely student-run by three commanders: the Mission Commander, the Education Commander, and the Engineering Commander. The Mission Commander is in charge of everything relating to the mission, the Education Commander is in charge of everything relation to Planetariums and EEPs, and the Engineering Commander is in charge of designing any habitat systems, such as door indicators, phone circuitry, or power systems. The Mission is assisted by the Mission Subcommander, who serves as an executive officer, and the Education Commander is assisted by the Planetarium Commander. Ranked below the commanders are the Directors. These consist of the Quartermaster, who is in charge of storage, and the Webmaster, who is in charge of the Spacesim Website. The Webmaster assigns members to the Wiki Task Force, which is headed by the Wikimaster, who is also a Director. Commanders are chosen every June for the following year, as most of the Commanders are usually in Grade 12, and thus graduate at the end of their term in office.

Baťa Canal (in Czech Baťův kanál or Průplav Otrokovice-Rohatec) is a navigable canal on the Morava river in the Czech Republic. The water canal was built during 1934-38 and today it serves mainly for recreational cruises. History Reasons for building the canal were two: an attempt to increase the level of groundwater after the Morava river was regulated and as an initial phase of long planned but never realized Danube- Oder-Canal. The immediate reason for the construction was the need to transfer lignite from mine in Ratíškovice to the Otrokovice power plant. Both were owned by Bata Shoes (Baťovy závody) and the company was the main investor (the rest was paid for by the state). Construction started on October 16, 1934 and finished during autumn 1938. The canal was financed by Jan Antonín Baťa in cooperation with the Czechoslovak state. Technical details The route is 51.8 km long, of which 27 km fall to the Morava river, 1 km to the Dřevnice river and 24 km is artificial canal. The difference in water levels is 18.6 m. In total 33 bridges spanned over the canal. The canal had 14 canal locks. Some parts of the technical infrastructure were quite unique at the time of construction. Canal today During World War II the canal was severely damaged and only partially repaired (repairs lasted until 1949). Its use for transportation declined and in 1972 it was officially abandoned. In 1995 the route was reopened for sightseeing tours. After repairs 13 canal locks are now accessible. The canal became the most popular tourist destination of the region. It is also used for transportation of industrial goods and plans exist to extend it downstream to the border of Slovakia.

Averaging 90,000 copies per issue, it reportedly has one of the largest circulations of any alternative weekly publication in the nation. It frequently presents an opposing viewpoint to the San Diego Union Tribune, the primary printed newspaper in the city. The Reader was founded in 1972 by Jim Holman, a Carleton College graduate who was a member of the group which established the Chicago Reader. Although Holman briefly owned shares in the Chicago paper, none of the Chicago owners had an interest in the San Diego paper. Holman used the Reader format and nameplate with the blessings of his friends in Chicago. Noted for its literary style of journalism and coverage of the arts, particularly film and theater, the Reader is recognized as a pioneer among alternative weeklies for both its creative nonfiction and its commercial scheme, using ad revenue (particularly from classifieds and entertainment promotions) to establish the practice of widespread free circulation, a cornerstone of today's alternative papers. Published weekly since October 1972, the Reader, according to altweekly.com, is known as \\"a showcase for San Diego writers and photographers.\\" Each issue of the Reader is dated every Thursday and distributed free on Wednesday and Thursday via street boxes and cooperating retail outlets. Background Specializing in feature stories, the Reader covers San Diego life in general, with emphasis on politics and the arts and entertainment. The Reader also publishes listings of movies, events, theater and music, restaurant and film reviews, and free classified advertisements for its readers. Its \\"City Lights\\" section contains short investigative reports into the dealings of the city, while the \\"Calendar\\" section highlights local society, things to do, places to eat, and the local music scene. Notable cover stories have included in-depth overviews chronicling San Diego history and pop culture, such as Before It Was the Gaslamp: Downtown’s Grindhouse Theater Row in the ‘70s, Gompers School Takes a Bow, The Rise and Fall of San Diego’s Pacific Comics, Pussycat Theaters – a Comprehensive History of a California Dynasty, Field of Screens: San Diego Drive-In Theater History 1947–2008, and Africans, Asians, Hispanics, and Hipsters: Changes in City Heights. The March 28, 2012 cover feature People Will Tell You That You're Late and You'll Hate Them for It., with confessions of a San Diego USPS mail carrier, earned national coverage on TV programs like 20/20 (U.S. TV series). Among the website's most-viewed and most-commented stories are its profile of Jack Ruby’s rabbi, The Kennedy Assassination's Last Insider, an account of a local chalk-graffiti artist's arrest The Mad Chalker, The La Jolla Cove is a Sea Lion Cesspool, Hikers Discover Marijuana Plantation in Local State Park, Mitt Romney’s San Diego Connections, and Surfers' Incurable Obsession. The paper has also become increasingly known for its local political coverage, due in no small part to the addition of columnist Don Bauder to the staff. Bauder become financial editor and columnist for the daily San Diego Union paper in 1973. When the Union and rival Tribune merged in the early 1990s, he remained at that post; in 1995, he was named senior columnist at the Union-Tribune. In 1985 and 1986, Bauder wrote Captain Money and the Golden Girl, a book about a local San Diego Ponzi scheme which stayed on the L.A. Times best-seller list for more than two months. He retired from the U-T in March 2003 and began writing his weekly column for the Reader in April 2003. He started his blog Scam Diego in September 2007, regularly engaging so many local readers that the comment section frequently racks up to a hundred or more comment posts for each blog post. Bauder announced his retirement in September 2018. Among the Reader’s political and sociological cover features are Soho VS Developers: What’s Worth Saving in San Diego, Obama Taps Alan Bersin to Cover the Border, It’s Getting Ugly Downtown, What’s Wrong With Balboa Park?, San Diego’s Secret Missile Testing Sites, and a whistleblowing feature Just Save My Life, exposing how clinic trials of an experimental blood substitute called PolyHeme were being conducted on city medical patients without their knowledge. Beginning around 2003, a political comic strip also began running in the paper, \\"Obermeyer’s Cut,\\" by Neal Obermeyer.Obermeyer’s Cut Other well-known comic artists who've served as staffers include Jim Cornelius, who illustrated Matthew Alice's long-running \\"Straight From the Hip\\" column from the earliest issues until being replaced by Rick Geary in the later 1970s, as well as famed surf artist and California landscape painter Jeff Yeomans (whose wall murals on San Diego buildings included the Unicorn Trading Company on India Street), political cartoonist J.D. Crowe (previously with the San Diego Union Tribune until drawing for the Reader from 1992 to 2000), underground cartoonist Spain Rodriguez (co-founder of Zap Comix), and Revolutionary Comics Managing Editor Jay Allen Sanford. In the editorial staff, the paper’s longtime editor Judith Moore was an American author and essayist best known for her 2005 book Fat Girl: A True Story, published by Hudson Street Press. Joining the Reader staff in 1983 and subsequently known as “Mother Reader” for many years, she specialized in book reviews (especially food writing) and offbeat, whimsical feature subjects. Once, she visited a San Diego sausage factory and described it in lurid detail, in order to test the cliché that no one wanted to see sausage being made. She mentored dozens of writers still contributing to the paper to this day. Moore died of colon cancer after three years of treatment in May 2006. A memorial feature about Moore written by several staffers ran August 16, 2007, titled She Hated Adverbs. The paper's local music coverage reportedly earns some of its heaviest website traffic, including columns and staff blogs like \\"Blurt\\", \\"Lists\\", \\"Musician Interviews\\", \\"Record Release Roundup\\", \\"Here's the Deal\\" (local venue reviews), \\"Rock Around the Town,\\" \\"Jam Session,\\" and \\"Out and About.\\" The magazine's massive online \\"Local Music Database\\" chronicles the histories of over 4,000 San Diego bands and 10,000 local musicians, from the 1940s through today, with discographies, biographies, interviews, article links, videos, and playable MP3s. The music section comic strip \\"Overheard in San Diego\\" has been running since late 1995, spinning off an omnibus book collection in 2012 containing over 700 strips. With an average of over 104 pages each week, the Reader reportedly has the largest circulation of any alternative publication in the nation. It is the second-largest circulation newspaper in San Diego, currently (as of summer 2014) claiming a single-issue circulation of 115,000. Notable contributors, reporters, and writers Julia Davis is a member of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, an executive member of Women In Film, a member of the Screen Actors Guild, a member of the Independent Filmmakers Alliance and a member of Film Independent. As a contributing writer for the San Diego Reader, she has authored several articles, including Murder in Las Vegas. Richard Meltzer is a music critic whose first book, The Aesthetics of Rock, was one of the earliest rock-focused literary efforts. In the 1980s, while writing for the Reader chain, Meltzer’s articles for the L.A. Reader on the ugliest buildings in Los Angeles were published as a book. After moving to Portland, Oregon in the 1990s, he continued contributing to the Reader, mostly music columns and autobiographical stories. Paul Williams is an American music journalist and writer. Williams created the first national U.S. magazine of rock music criticism Crawdaddy!Dylan Gives the People What He Wants by Bill Wyman, The New York Times, June 12, 2005. in January 1966. His Reader features include profiles of local bands Riot Act (March 9, 2013) and Powerdresser (July 24, 2003). Williams died in March 2013, at the age of 64. Duncan Shepherd is a longtime film critic whose pithy, incisive, and very often negative reviews began running in the Reader on November 2, 1972, continuing through the November 10, 2010 issue, where he announced his retirement. Originally, Shepherd had no rating system, but he was persuaded to institute a four star system, later expanding that to five. Five-star reviews have become rare: only two movies since 2000 have received the highest rating: Mystic River (2003) and Stevie (2002). Less than 100 films are listed as 5-star films, while nearly 2,000 have had the black spot, his lowest rating, bestowed upon them. Jay Allen Sanford is an author and cartoonist best known for his work with Revolutionary Comics and Carnal Comics. He co-created the comic book Rock ‘N’ Roll Comics with Todd Loren in 1989, which is still being published by Bluewater Productions. The publishing company he founded, Carnal Comics, is known for launching the movie and cartoon character Demi the Demoness. His Reader comic strip \\"Overheard in San Diego\\" was launched in late 1995, while a second weekly Reader strip, \\"Famous Former Neighbors\\" debuted in 2002. Both reality-based strips are still running. Besides writing several full-length cover features per year (many autobiographical), he writes columns, music features, DVD reviews, and various interview Q&As.; Rick Geary is a cartoonist and graphic novel writer best known for his contributions to the Heavy Metal and National Lampoon magazines. The National Cartoonist Society awarded Geary its Magazine and Book Illustration Award in 1994. At the Reader, he has been illustrating the staff-written advice and trivia column \\"Straight From the Hip\\" - aka \\"Ask Matthew Alice\\" – since the late seventies, as well as contributing spot illustrations throughout the newspaper. Bart Mendoza is a musician and journalist who has written for numerous publications, including San Diego’s Axcess Magazine and local editions of The Reader and San Diego CityBeat, as well as The San Diego Union and its weekly arts insert Night & Day. National publications include the second series of Crawdaddy!. International publications he has contributed to include British Time Out Guides for Southern California and the Spanish rock magazine Ansia De Color. He has also penned liner notes for recording artists including Phil Angeloff, Ray Brandes, Ryan Ferguson and The Lolas, and for music compilations such as This is Mod Volume 6, from Cherry Red Records. Bernard \\"Buddy Blue\\" Seigal, a founding member of The Beat Farmers band, was a music critic in the late 1980s, continuing to contribute into the 1990s. Connie Bruck wrote cover stories from 1973 through 1977, with subjects ranging from a witches’ coven (November 1, 1973) to a Carmelite monastery (February 3, 1977), and others. Bruck became staff writer at the New Yorker in 1989, and is the author of The Predators' Ball (about Michael Milken and junkbond raiders, 1989) and Master of the Game (concerning Steve Ross and the creation of Time Warner circa 1994). Stephen Dobyns wrote cover features from 1998 through 2008, including one on illegal boats in San Diego Bay (August 3, 2000) and local amputees (July 9, 2008). Dobyns’ poetic works count among them 1971's Concurring Beasts, a National Poetry Series award winner (Black Dog, Red Dog), and a Melville Cane Award winner (Cemetery Nights). Dobyns’ novel Cold Dog Soup has been made into two films, the American Cold Dog Soup and the French Doggy Bag. W. S. Di Piero has written art reviews for the Reader since 2000 and has published many collections of poetry and essays, in addition to his translations. In 2012, Di Piero received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for his lifetime achievement, in addition to earning Guggenheim Fellowship (1985) and NEA awards. His poetry collection Nitro Nights was published in 2011 by Copper Canyon Press, while When Can I See You Again: New Art Writings (2010, Pressed Wafer) contains many of his Reader columns. Thomas Lux wrote cover features from 1999 through 2009, with subjects ranging from the San Diego-Coronado Bridge (March 16, 2000) to a man who loves bugs (April 11, 2002) and more.

It was one of the U.S Army's principal medium tanks of the early Cold War, with models in service from 1949 until the mid-1950s. It was not widely used by U.S. Cold War allies, being exported only to Belgium, and only in small numbers to train crews on the upcoming M47 Patton. The M46 was the first tank to be named after General George S. Patton Jr., commander of the U.S. Third Army during World War II and one of the earliest American advocates for the use of tanks in battle. History After World War II, most U.S. Army armored units were equipped with a mix of M4 Sherman and M26 Pershing tanks. Designed initially as a heavy tank, the M26 Pershing tank was reclassified as a medium tank after the war. The M26 was a significant improvement over the M4 Sherman in firepower and protection. Its mobility, however, was deemed unsatisfactory for a medium tank, as it used the same engine as the much lighter M4A3 and was plagued with an unreliable transmission. Work began in January 1948 on replacing the original power plant with the Continental AV1790-3 engine and Allison CD-850-1 cross-drive transmission. This design was initially called the M26E2, but modifications continued to accumulate; eventually, the Bureau of Ordnance decided that the tank needed its own unique designation, the M46. The upgraded M26 received a new power plant and a main gun with a bore evacuator. Upon completion of the first model of the Detroit Tank Arsenal production line in November 1948, the M46 was christened after the late General George S. Patton. By December the Army had ordered several hundred. In July 1950 Detroit Arsenal was producing Pershings and M46s at a rate of over a dozen a day. In August 1950 President Harry S. Truman authorized funding for increased M46 production as part an expansion of heavy tank development program. A total of 1,160 M46s of all variants were built. Combat service The only American combat use of the M46 Patton was during the Korean War. On 8 August 1950, the first M46 Patton tanks, belonging to the 6th Tank Battalion, landed in South Korea. The M46 proved to be capable against North Korean T-34 medium tanks. By the end of 1950, 200 M46 Pattons had been fielded, forming about 15% of US tank strength in Korea; the balance of 1,326 tanks shipped to Korea during 1950 were 679 M4A3 Shermans (including the M4A3E8 variant), 309 M26 Pershings, and 138 M24 Chaffee light tanks. Subsequent shipments of M46 and M46A1 Pattons allowed all remaining M26 Pershings to be withdrawn during 1951, and most Sherman equipped units were also reequipped. M46 series operators include: 1st Tank Battalion and regimental Antitank Platoons of the 1st Marine Division by 1952, 72nd Armor Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division by January 1952, 64th Tank Battalion of the 3rd Infantry Division, 73rd Tank Battalion of the 7th Infantry Division by January 1951, 6th Tank Battalion of the 24th Infantry Division, 140th Tank Battalion (took over the tanks of the 6th Tank Battalion) and regimental tank companies of the 40th Infantry Division by October 1951, and the 245th Tank Battalion of the 45th Infantry Division by 1952. Several other regimental tank companies gained M46/M46A1s by the end of the war, including the 7th and 65th Infantry Regiments of the 3rd Infantry Division. A surviving example of the M46 Patton tank can be seen on display at the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul. In the 1950s, small numbers of M46s were leased for training purposes at no cost to some European countries, including Belgium, France and Italy, in preparation for the introduction of the M47. American instruction teams used the vehicles to train European tank crews and maintenance personnel.

Marie-Théodor Ratisbonne, N.D.S., (December 28, 1802 – January 10, 1884) was a French Jewish convert to the Catholic Church, who became a priest and missionary and who later founded the Congregation of Our Lady of Sion. He was the brother of Marie-Alphonse Ratisbonne, who joined him in this effort. Life=Early life Théodor Ratisbonne was one of the 13 children born in Strasbourg, Alsace, France, to Auguste Ratisbonne and his wife, Adelaide Cerfbeer, who were members of a noted Jewish banking family.Notre Dame de Sion-Ein Karem His father additionally served as president of the Provincial Council of Alsace.Encyclopedia Judaica: \\"Ratisbonne Brothers\\", Volume 13, pp.1570–1571, Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem, 1972 Conversion At the age of 22, Ratisbonne gained the acquaintance of a local Catholic, Louise Humann, who was a catechist and active in works of charity. After the conversion of his friends, Emile Dreyfus, Alfred Mayer and Samson Liebermann to Christianity, Théodor spent two years under her guidance studying the Scriptures, both the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament, which eventually led him to embrace Christianity.Sistes of Our Lady of Sion, Australia Philippines Province \\"Our History\\" He was baptized in 1826, at which time he added the name Marie (Mary) to his given name, and was ordained as a priest in 1830. Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Maria Theodor Ratisbonne\\" This step by Théodor caused his family to reject him. Through his embrace of Christianity, Théodor Ratisbonne joined a wave of conversions then taking place in the French Jewish community, triggered by a sense that the Jews could not achieve full integration in French society as long as they remained Jews. He had reached the conclusion that there was a fundamental incompatibility between Judaism and French citizenship. Until his conversion, he was active in the Societe d'Encouragement au Travail en Faveur des Israelites du Bas-Rhin (Society for the Advancement of the Israelites of the Lower Rhine). He later felt that this involvement in Jewish communal affairs was a preparatory step to his baptism. Ministry Théodor Ratisbonne published a biography of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, A Life of St. Bernard, in 1841. During a visit to Rome the following year, this work drew the admiration of Pope Gregory XVI, for which the Pope made him a Knight of the Order of St. Sylvester in recognition of his contribution to the Catholic faith. Ratisbonne was still very conscious of his Jewish roots and how his heritage was the basis for his faith as a Catholic. He wanted to work to help other Jews who would embrace Christianity. After his own sudden conversion, Alphonse had proposed to his brother the founding of schools for providing a Christian education to Jewish children. The Pope gave his blessing and authorization for this mission. The first concrete step was accomplished with his founding of the Sisters of Our Lady of Sion in 1847, the first members being two Jewish sisters who converted to Catholicism and committed themselves to the education of Jewish children in a Christian setting. Not long after Alphonse's ordination in 1850 as a Jesuit priest, he left his Order to join his brother in their shared vision. In 1852 Theodore and Alphonse led the small community of men who had gathered to share in the work to form a new congregation, the male branch of the Congregation of Our Lady of Sion. The Ratisbonne brothers obtained permission to work as missionaries in Jerusalem. There Alphonse went to establish a convent for the Sisters to carry out their mission in the heart of the Jewish homeland. The Sisters arrived in Jerusalem in 1856, while he sought to purchase the ruined Church of Ecce Homo to serve as their home. The Sisters then devoted their lives to hastening the \\"fulfilment of the promises concerning the Jews and the Gentiles\\" while avoiding all proselytism through the education of girls regardless of creed. Ratisbonne's directive was: \\"Remain firm in your own faith without attempting to impose it on others.\\"http://www.cjre.net/history.htm The esteem Ratisbonne received from Pope Gregory was shared by his successors. He was honored repeatedly by Pope Pius IX and was named a Protonotary Apostolic by Pope Leo XIII. Death On his deathbed, Ratisbonne received the Last Sacraments from the Archbishop of Paris, Joseph Hippolyte Guibert, and a final blessing from Pope Leo XIII. He died in Paris on January 10, 1884. Published works Ratisbonne was the author of, among other works: * An Essay on Moral Education (1828) * A Life of Saint Bernard (1841) * Meditations of Saint Bernard on the Present and Future (1853) * A Manual for Christian Mothers (1860) * The Jewish Question (1868) * A new Manual for Christian Mothers (1870) * The Pope (1870) * Gospel Tidbits (1872) * A Response to Questions from an Israelite of our Time (1878) * Mes souvenirs, Sources de Sion, Presses monastiques, rééd (1966) References Category:1802 births Category:1884 deaths Category:French Jews Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Judaism Category:French Roman Catholic priests Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:People from Strasbourg Category:Knights of the Order of St. Sylvester Category:French religious writers Category:French male non-fiction writers Category:19th- century French writers Category:19th-century French male writers ","title":"Marie-Théodor Ratisbonne"},{"id":"4124197","text":"The Location of the District of Central Eleuthera Central Eleuthera is one of the districts of the Bahamas, on the island of Eleuthera.

History Historically, the island was used as a last stop for Spanish ships returning to Europe, where these ships refilled their water supply from wells created for this purpose - thus the English name of the settlement: Spanish Wells. The first British colonists were the Eleutheran adventurers from Bermuda (intending to be some of the first settlers of Eleuthera), who suffered shipwreck on a reef, known as the \\"Devil's Backbone\\" off Eleuthera in 1647. After living in a cave known as \\"Preacher's Cave\\" on Eleuthera, they ended up at Spanish Wells. Among other, later, groups of settlers were Crown loyalists, who left the United States after the American Revolutionary War. The area suffered extensive property damage during a direct hit from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and Floyd in 1999. Economy Currently, (2006) Spanish Wells is a centre for lobster fishing and tourism in the Bahamas. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Spanish Wells served as a transhipment point for illicit recreational pharmaceutical products, being shipped from South America to North America.

In 1874, Muus led a group of Norwegian-American immigrant pastors and farmers to found St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. St. Olaf College is a residential, four-year private liberal arts college affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.The Beginnings of St. Olaf College Ingebrikt Grose. Norwegian-American Historical Association, Volume V: Page 110 Despite his substantial achievements, Muus was considered a \\"fascinating, capable, but flawed leader.\\" During the Predestination Controversy (naadevalgsstriden), where The Norwegian Synod experienced internal division over questions concerning predestination and conversion, Muus sided with Anti-Missourian Brotherhood. Muus' uncompromising nature and stubbornness eventually resulted in his expulsion from his church in 1898 for failure to conform to doctrine. Illness, return to Norway and death In 1899, Muus resigned as a pastor after having suffered a stroke and was stricken with partial paralysis. He returned to Norway in 1899, where he died on May 25, 1900. He is buried in Trondheim, Norway at the Nidaros Cathedral cemetery. Personal life Muus married Oline Pind of Fet in 1859. The two had three children, Nils (1863–1932), Jens Ingebrigt Rynning (1866–1878), and Paul Johan Elster (1872–1890). Jens died of typhus at the age of twelve. Oline Muus Divorce After a lengthy and highly publicised legal battle, Pind was granted a limited divorce on January 20, 1883. She received $150 per year for ten years as alimony. Bernt was given custody of the children, who were still minors. Divorce in Minnesota's nineteenth century Norwegian-Lutheran community was a rarity. Legal separation between a leading pastor and his wife was unheard of. The 1879 court case in Holden Township led to both those outcomes, and triggered a public debate about married women's legal rights. See also *Muus v. Muus ReferencesRelated Reading *Nelson, E.

In the battle, a substantially superior force composed of the Spartan garrison of Athens and the army of the oligarchic government attacked a hill in Piraeus (the Munychia) which had been seized by 1,000 exiles under Thrasybulus, but was defeated. After this defeat, the Thirty Tyrants were forced to flee to Eleusis. Prelude In late 404 BC, Thrasybulus, with other Athenian exiles, had seized Phyle, a strong point on the Athenian border. He and his men resisted an abortive attempt to dislodge them and then, as their numbers were swelled by new recruits, ambushed the Spartan garrison of Athens, which had been dispatched to watch them. Shortly after this victory, the men from Phyle, now 1,000 strong, marched by night to Piraeus, the port of Athens. There, being too few to defend the entire port, they seized one of its prominent hills, the Munychia. The next morning, the forces of the Thirty marched out to meet them.Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.10-11 The battle The Athenian exiles drew up for battle in a formation ten ranks deep at the top of the Munychia, with light troops and spear throwers behind them. Below, in one of the markets of Piraeus, the joint Spartan-oligarchic force drew up in a formation of equal width, but fifty ranks deep. The Spartan garrison held the right, the forces of the Thirty the left. Xenophon's account of the battle states that Thrasybulus, to inspire his men, reminded them that the enemy right was composed of men whom they had routed a few days before, while the left was made up of men who had wrongly driven them from their country.Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.11-14 The oligarchic forces advanced up the road towards the top of the hill, but before they reached the top the men from Phyle charged down the hill at them. This charge broke the oligarchic line, and the exiles pursued their enemies down the hill onto the level ground. In this rout, seventy men of the Thirty's force were killed. Among the dead was Critias, the leader of the Thirty; several other prominent oligarchic leaders were also killed, including Charmides.Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.18-19 Aftermath After this battle, the prestige of the Thirty, already weakened by the earlier defeat near Phyle, was irreparably damaged. The next day the Thirty were deposed by a vote of the larger oligarchic governing body, the council of three thousand. The Thirty fled to Eleusis, and a governing board of ten was elected in their place. This new government, however, was not ready to compromise with the men in Piraeus, so envoys were sent to Sparta to request aid. A Spartan force under Pausanias was dispatched to deal with the situation; after a face saving victory at the Battle of Piraeus, Pausanias arranged a settlement between the oligarchs and exiles and restored democracy in Athens.

Bobby actually referred Flex-Deon to the producer Edward James, and secured the introduction of Flex-Deon to the adult industry.See Owen Keehnen, More Starz, 90–2, esp. 90.

Gordon, My Life in Porn: The Bobby Blake Story (Philadelphia: Running Press, 2008). ;As a subject of Gay Studies The film Niggas' Revenge, and Flex-Deon Blake's role in it, have become the subject of academic discussion. In his book, Unlimited Intimacy: Reflections on the Subculture of Barebacking, Tim Dean, a professor at the University at Buffalo, treats Niggas' Revenge in detail because of the way in which it fetishizes the simultaneous transgression of a number of taboos, all in order, Dean argues, to “conjure the transgressive charge of unprotected anal sex among gay men.”Tim Dean, Unlimited Intimacy: Reflections on the Subculture of Barebacking (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2009), 157. The representation of interracial sex, rape, violence, and incest (between Chris Blake and Bobby Blake) is enhanced by what Dean calls Flex-Deon Blake's \\"phallicized\\" appearance.

However, he continues, \\"in all the years I was working in the adult entertainment business, I never turned my back on God or the Bible teachings I had grown up with.\\" Blake emphasizes that he has no regrets about his lifestyle, interpreting it as part of God's plan for him: \\"Now that it's over, I can accept that that journey was all part of God's plan for me.\\"Blake, p. 277. Personal life In his personal life, Bobby Blake was the long-term partner of Flex-Deon Blake, another black gay pornographic actor. It was Bobby Blake who, by referring Flex-Deon to the producer Edward James, introduced his partner to the adult industry. Bobby Blake has told the story of their relationship in his book, My Life in Porn.

The channel shares a broadcast licence with its sister network, Unis, a channel devoted to broadcasting programming primarily focusing on Canadian French-speaking communities, in particular, those living outside of Quebec. History The idea of a Canadian feed of TV5Monde, thhen known simply as TV5 Canada, was first proposed in 1986 when the Consortium de télévision Québec Canada (Television Consortium Québec Canada in English), comprising CBC/Radio Canada, Télé-Quebec, TFO and the Association des producteurs de films et de télévision du Québec, joined the TV5 consortium the same year. The proposed channel underwent a CRTC hearing on specialty channel applications in July 1987, and TV5 Québec Canada was launched on September 1, 1988 as the spiritual successor to the cable television channel TVFQ 99 , which was originally launched in 1979 as a joint venture between Vidéotron and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to rebroadcast TF1, Antenne 2 and FR3 programming in Canada. Overview TV5 Québec Canada has a partnership with TV5Monde, the second-most-widely distributed network in the world, reaching over 180 million households in over 200 countries. Unlike TV5Monde, which is based in Paris, France, and supervises the distribution of signals to all continents, TV5 Québec Canada is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, and is owned by the non-profit group Le Consortium de télévision Québec Canada inc. (CTQC), which distributes and manages the channel in Canada. As with the TV5Monde consortium, CTQC is also a co-operative organisation currently structured as follows: one representative from each of the following, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (also known as Radio-Canada), Télé-Québec, TFO, and the Association des producteurs de films et de télévision du Québec (APFTQ) with two representatives appointed by the minister of Canadian Heritage, two others by Quebec's minister responsible for culture and communications and its minister responsible for international relations, and the remaining member of the board of directors is the president and CEO of CTQC. Programming TV5 broadcasts a variety of French-language programming from Canada and around the world, including drama, sports, documentaries and information programming among a variety of other genres. Canadian content is provided primarily by Télé-Québec and TFO, while foreign programming comes from the France Télévisions group, Arte France, RTBF (French language public broadcaster in Belgium), RTS (French language public broadcaster in Switzerland) and CIRTEF (council representing French-speaking Africa). Radio-Canada and TVA are also partners in TV5 and provide programming to the international parent channel, but as both are already widely available across Canada, most of their programming is replaced on the Canadian version by content from Télé-Québec and TFO.

He was one of the closest advisors to Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram. In his early 20s Sang began to write regularly on political and international subjects and became a daily commentator for the national radio station. He became famous thanks to his radio show Mr. Mun and Mr. Kong and soon was appointed the head of the radio and newspaper sections of the Thai Government Publicity Department. In 1938, shortly after becoming prime minister, Phibun named Sang the official government spokesman and put him in charge of all government propaganda. It was in this capacity that when Thailand had to declare war against the Allies in World War II, Sang had the distinction of reading the formal declaration of war over the radio on January 25, 1942. When the war ended the Allies wanted to prosecute Sang, along with Pibul and a few others, for war crimes. However, as Phibun had during the war refused Japanese pressure to arrest alleged resistance leaders and had allegedly looked the other way as Pridi Banomyong, the leader of the Free Thai Movement, developed contacts with the Allies during the war, and with public opinion favourable to all those arrested by the Allies, the Thai Supreme Court ruled that they could not be prosecuted under a war crime statute imposing the death sentence that had been enacted after the end of the war, and ordered their release. In 1947 Phibun became prime minister once again and invited Sang to join the cabinet. However Sang refused, preferring to remain Phibun's confidant and advisor. He decided to take only the official post of President, and later General Secretary, of the Thai National Traders Union Congress. With a reduced formal role in government and more time available to other projects, Sang turned himself to journalism, setting up a daily newspaper that he himself edited: Satienraparb (\\"Forever\\") soon exerted considerable influence in Thai politics. In 1956, with Phibun's government openly pro-western and anti-Chinese, Sang and Phibun devised a strategy to establish a backdoor informal communication channel with the Chinese government. They agreed to send two of Sang's children to be brought up under the auspices of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai as his wards. A daughter aged eight and a son aged twelve secretly travelled through Burma to Beijing. Unfortunately for the children, a sudden change of government resulting from a coup, meant that their father was arrested for his pro-Beijing policies and his newspaper articles about China. Sang's arrest meant loss of contact with Premier Zhou Enlai and consequently with his children. Sang's daughter, Sirin Phathanothai, would later write a book, The Dragon's Pearl, about her experiences growing up among China's elite. Following the death in 1963 of dictator Sarit Thanarat (whose government arrested Sang), the political climate eased somewhat in Thailand. It was at this time that Sang, after being under arrest for seven years, was finally brought to trial before a military tribunal. The trial, open to the public and widely covered by Thai media at the time, was the first of many trials for the intellectuals, writers, journalists, lawyers, and university professors who had been arrested without any formal charges and sent to jail for several years under Sarit's military dictatorship. Sang was specifically accused of publishing subversive and seditious articles on China from October 1956 to September 1958. Sang conducted his own defense and shortly after cross-examining the prosecution witnesses, the military judges dismissed all charges. After his release from jail, Sang remained involved in politics until his death in 1986. References *Phathanothai, Sirin The Dragon's Pearl.

Plot summary The plot revolves around sixteen-year-old Barbara MacLane, a girl in the suburbs of San Francisco grappling with disappointing romantic prospects, her worries about not being accepted into the University of California, Berkeley, and the fact that she will never catch up to her sister, Rosemary, who is two years older (and a student at Berkeley). Barbara's feeling of being left in the dust by her sister only intensifies when Rosemary calls home and suddenly announces that she will marry her college sweetheart, Greg. Although this news comes as an unexpected and less-than-pleasant shock to their parents, Barbara becomes enthralled with the romantic details of the wedding, and promptly decides that if she is to be caught up to Rosemary in two years, she needs to step up her search for a boyfriend. Her two potential prospects are Tootie Bodger (Robin to his folks), a tall and rather gloomy trombone player who is more fond of Barbara than she is of him, and Bill Cunningham, a handsome classmate with a Vespa whom Barbara woos with homemade cookies (this somewhat misfires, as he comes to think of her as the \\"domestic\\" type and tries to get her to mend a shirt he ripped). Tootie is presented as plodding yet thoughtful, while Bill is conversely dashing but thoughtless. However, as the stresses of Rosemary's wedding begin to pile up (tension between the lower-middle-class MacLanes and Greg's wealthy parents; the cost of the wedding and the short time frame granted to plan it in; and the sacrifices Rosemary and Greg must make (such as becoming landlords of a dumpy tenement to save on rent), Barbara begins to think that maybe she's not ready to live the life of a serious adult just yet. At Rosemary's wedding, the sisters' elderly grandmother offers Barbara a bit of advice: \\"Have a good time while you are young,\\" which Barbara apparently means to follow, focusing less on finding a special sweetheart and more on enjoying socializing with a variety of company and friends.

It is known as Kuala Lumpur's Little India due to the high percentage of Indian residents and businesses. Brickfields been ranked third in Airbnb's list of top trending destinations. Brickfields is notable for being home to KL Sentral, Kuala Lumpur's main public transportation hub.  History Kapitan Yap Ah Loy, founder of modern Kuala Lumpur In 1881, a flood swept through Kuala Lumpur, in the wake of a disastrous fire. These successive problems destroyed the town's structures of wood and atap (thatching). As a response, Frank Swettenham, the British Resident of Selangor, required that buildings be constructed of brick and tile. Hence, Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate, now Brickfields, for the setting up of a brick industry which would spur the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur. Later the area was developed by Yap Kwan Seng, the fifth and last Kapitan Cina of Kuala Lumpur. As a businessman, he foresaw an increased demand for bricks in fast-growing Kuala Lumpur and established a kiln in the district. The area soon became the centre for brick-making in the early days because the whole area was a clay pit and good quality bricks are made from clay. Therefore, Brickfields became synonymous with good quality bricks. Brickfields also used to be the site of the main depot for Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) (Malayan Railway) during the administration of the British. The British authorities brought in people from Sri Lanka to work the railway and the depot. Many lived in quarters around Brickfields. Since then the Indian community have lived and remained here and became citizens of Malaysia. Some of the old quarters can still be found around Jalan Rozario. Today the depot has been transformed into KL Sentral, the main railway hub of the city. Brickfields is one of the pioneer settlements in Kuala Lumpur. Indeed, the whole stretch of Jalan Tun Sambanthan (formerly Jalan Brickfields) is interspersed with old colonial structures.  Lifestyle= Culture The headquarters of Malaysian Association for the Blind Along Jalan Tun Sambanthan 4 is the century-old YMCA, which has become an integral landmark in Brickfields. Further down along Jalan Tun Sambanthan is the charming Vivekananda Ashramam that was built in the early 19th century. Brickfields also houses historical government quarters built during the British era which are under harm from rapid development. The 100 railway quarters in Jalan Rozario are still there although modern buildings have cropped up all around. The \\"Hundred Quarters\\" are located at Jalan Chan Ah Tong. It was built in 1915 as terrace houses for junior servants. It is planned to be demolished for commercial development. As of June 2014 there has been no demolition works. Brickfields is popular for its Indian food delights especially the unique banana leaf rice and thosai (Indian pancake made from fermented rice flour). The Malaysian Association for the Blind, located along Jalan Tebing, houses a number of blind people. They can be seen walking around Brickfields. Many have become familiar with the area that they rarely encounter much problem walking around here. Most parts of Brickfields have been equipped with tactile guided pathways designed to aid the blind in walking around the area. The Temple of Fine Arts is located along Jalan Berhala. It is essentially a cultural organisation offering various courses relating to mainly Southern Indian music, dance, and arts. It was founded in 1981 and has currently similar centres in Johor Bahru, Melaka, Penang, as well as centres around the world including India, Australia and Singapore. Besides offering courses, the organisation frequently organises Indian performances around Kuala Lumpur, and has produced many artists progressing to international standards. They will be launching their state of art building soon which has been built upon the founding architecture old Temple of Fine Arts adjacent to the Maha Vihara Buddhist Temple. The new building will be symbolic icon to the progress of arts and culture in Brickfields. Places of Worship The Lutheran Zion Church in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur, established in 1924. Sri Kandaswamy Kovil on Jalan Scott Chinese Temple on Jalan Thambipillay Brickfields is also tagged as a \\"Divine Location\\" as many religious structures, some over 100 years old, are concentrated in the area, particularly Jalan Berhala. The aptly named road (\\"Berhala\\" means shrine) houses the Buddhist Maha Vihara and the Sri Sakthi Karpaga Vinayagar Temple. Buddhist Maha Vihara was founded in 1894 by the Sasana Abhiwurdhi Wardhana Society, the oldest registered Buddhist Society in the Klang Valley. It has been managed by the Sinhalese Buddhist community and supported by the Chinese Buddhist and Indian Buddhist communities. The Wesak procession organized by the Buddhist Maha Vihara since the 1890s is the oldest and largest religious procession in the country. The Wesak month long celebrations attracted about 100,000 people every year. The Sri Kandaswamy Temple is one of the most prominent Sri Lankan Tamil or Ceylonese Tamil temple located along Jalan Scott. It is huge and showcases rich Tamil Architecture and has become a popular tourist attraction in Kuala Lumpur. This temple was built in 1902. They provide religious services such as house warming ceremonies and child 31st day ceremony. The Kalamandapam hall which was officiated by the 2nd Prime Minister of Malaysia holds wedding ceremonies and is also owned by this temple. Both the Sri Kandaswamy Temple and Buddhist Maha Vihara stand testament to the influence of the Ceylonese in Brickfields, who were brought in to work on the Malayan Railways before World War II. A sprinkling of churches of different denominations can also be found here. Among the larger churches in the area are the Holy Rosary Church (est. 1903), Our Lady of Fatima, and the Zion Lutheran Church. Most of which are located along Jalan Sultan Abdul Samad. There is also an Indian Orthodox Church called the St. Mary's Orthodox Syrian Cathedral in Jalan Tun Sambanthan Satu. There is a Surau (small mosque) located on Jalan Sultan Abdul Samad called Madrasatul Gouthiyyah. This mosque is mainly attended by Indian-Muslims, and the sermons are sometimes conducted in Tamil. Finally, another major landmark in Brickfields is the distinctive Chinese Temple known as Sam Kow Tong Temple (三教堂), which means \\"Hall of Three Teachings\\" along Jalan Thambillay. The Temple was founded in 1916 and belongs to the Heng Hua clan in Hokkien Province. There is also another Chinese Temple, Seng Hong Tokong (城隍庙) along Jalan Berhala. Shopkeepers in Brickfields  Trade Being the Little India of Kuala Lumpur, it has numerous shops that are owned by Indian businessmen. There are spice shops, grocery outlets, sweet and snacks shops, textile shops, goldsmiths, hotels, restaurants, food stalls, printers and even flower stalls. The headquarters of Malaysian Institute of Accountants can be found along Jalan Tun Sambanthan 3, which also contains a number of second tier audit firms scattered around. There are also plenty of law firms all over Brickfields area. Other popular businesses is the printing and paper distribution business which is concentrated along Jalan Sultan Abdul Samad. The new Sentral Brickfields 3-storey commercial complex is located next to the Sri Kandaswamy Temple offering 22 exclusive retail outlets with free parking and easy access via the Jalan Istana road.

Formed in 1975.  Development Brickfields is rapidly evolving from being a residential to a very commercial extension of downtown Kuala Lumpur. The KL Sentral development project is one of Kuala Lumpur's largest development project encompassing an area of 290,000 square metres. It includes the KL Sentral transportation hub, two hotels, condominiums, shopping complexes, a clubhouse, office buildings, as well as a convention and entertainment centre. Much of it is built on the former Keretapi Tanah Melayu marshalling yard here in Brickfields. The overall project is expected to be completed in 2012. The rapid evolvement has left parts of Brickfields suspended in time. One can find small village type housing amidst the high-rise modern living complexes being constructed. There has been efforts to clean up the area of Brickfields outside the KL Sentral development area. Recently Brickfields' image as a notorious area with a high incidence of crime is slowly disappearing. There are brothels and massage parlors in Jalan Hicks and Jalan Thambipillay where prostitutes ply their trade.  Transport View of KL Sentral at dusk Brickfields can be accessed through many ways: *KL Monorail: Tun Sambanthan and KL Sentral stations *Rapid KL's Kelana Jaya Line (LRT): KL Sentral station *MRT Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line: Muzium Negara station *KTM Komuter: KL Sentral station *Express Rail Link: KL Sentral station *Rapid KL buses The combination of the commercial activity, schools and residential traffic and Brickfields' location as one of the major access points into and out the city frequently results in bad traffic congestion in the mornings and evenings.

Personal life Born in Carstairs, Alberta, Hays had several careers related to agriculture. He was an auctioneer, rancher and breeder as well as a radio broadcaster. He was a founding member and president of the Alberta Poultry Breeders' Association and also served as president of the Alberta Holstein Breeders' Association. He led the Canadian Swine Breeders during World War II when it initiated the \\"Bacon for Britain\\" campaign of increased production as part of the war effort. In the 1950s, he pioneered exporting cattle by airplane allowing the Canadian industry to develop new markets in Mexico and the United Kingdom. Hays is the creator and namesake of the Hays Converter beef cattle breed. Harry Hays is credited with starting the Calgary Stampede pancake breakfast tradition. In 1934 Hays married Muriel Biglund and had one son Daniel Hays, who was a former member of the Senate of Canada appointed in 1984 where he served as Speaker and Leader of the Opposition. Political life=Mayor of Calgary While Hays had never run for political office prior to 1959, it was generally believed that he made his 1959 run at the urging of business colleagues who were concerned about the City of Calgary's rising debt, which would reach $82 million in 1960. In 1959 Hays would sell his dairy farm on the southern outskirts of the city to developers for $1 million, the land would eventually form the community of Haysboro. Hays was elected the 27th Mayor of Calgary in the October 1959 Calgary municipal election. Hays defeated popular incumbent Mayor Donald Hugh MacKay following the damning report from the Turcotte Inquiry which concluded MacKay had used his position as Mayor for improper personal gain. Turcotte would note that MacKay \\"derived a direct improper advantage through his position as mayor\\". Hays would be re-elected for a second term in the 1961 Calgary municipal election. Harry Hays resigned effective June 30, 1963, Grant MacEwan appointed as Mayor by Council and sworn on July 3, 1963. During his time as Mayor, it was noted that Hays quickly gained the confidence of Council, city commissioners, the press and public, which made him an attractive candidate for Pearson's Liberals. Hays campaigned on more efficiency in government, and the creation of a robust business climate. For his 1961 re-election, Hays made good on his election promise to reduce debt, claiming he had lowered the per capita debt by $11. Following pressure by Hays directed to the Canadian Pacific Railway regarding a lack of development on the downtown rail right-of-way, the CPR would dispatch employee and future City of Calgary Mayor Rod Sykes to work with Hays to reach a solution. In June 1962 Sykes and Hays would announce CPR led development into a two-block project east of the Palliser Hotel. Hays did not inform his colleagues on council of the announcement, besides Alderman Jack Leslie, and would be censured by in a following council meeting. Despite the rebuke by his peers, Hays was defiant noting \\"You will be getting these projects from me as long as I am in the chair (Mayor)\\", to which his fellow councillors reacted by capitulation to the comments, recognizing the power and influence Hays held. The CPR redevelopment scheme would eventually fail to materialize by June 1964. Harry Hays would also prove to be an ardent supporter of the Calgary Municipal Airport and its continued growth. Hays would lead a delegation to Ottawa to lobby the Department of Transport and Minister of Transport George Hees to provide the Airport with official \\"International Status\\". The federal government did not agree with the request, but as a compromise renamed the passenger terminal from \\"Calgary Municipal Airport\\" to \\"Calgary International Airport\\". Public and council support ensured the remaining area of the airport including the runway would remain called \\"McCall Field\\" after Calgary aviator and First World War ace Fred McCall. Federal politics Hays was recruited by Lester Pearson to run for the Liberals in the 1963 federal election in Calgary South, defeating Progressive Conservative opponent, current Aldermen, and future Calgary Mayor Jack Leslie. Hays would be the only Liberal Member of Parliament elected in Alberta or Saskatchewan. At the time, Calgary South was considered a conservative stronghold and Hays would have a difficult contest against his conservative opponent Leslie. Hays was able to garner significant financial support through his 60-person-strong \\"Citizens for Hays Committee\\", which included Aldermen Grant MacEwan and P.N.R. Morrison, and several prominent businessmen including Carl Nickle, James K. Gray, Harry Cohen, Jack Pierce, and Peter Rule. On April 5, just three days prior to the federal election, Hays would announce an agreement with CPR for a \\"$35 Million Face- Lift for Calgary\\" which would result in \\"a rebuilt downtown within two decades.\\" Hays' opponent Jack Leslie would later admit to seeing this announcement as a political ploy. Upon his election Hays would join Pearson's cabinet as Minister of Agriculture. Hays was often absent from the House and initially continued to serve as Calgary's mayor after his election to parliament. He also continued his work as an auctioneer as well as his volunteer duties for the Rotary Club. Hays had little formal education and was popular for his down to earth manner of living and talking and often swore and used poor grammar and colourful expressions. He described his agricultural policy by saying \\"We want a flush-toilet, not an outhouse, farm economy for Canada\\". However, some of his views were unpopular with farmers, such as his opposition to farm subsidies. He advocated a minimum guaranteed income for farmers and a system of marketing boards. During his tenure as minister the Dairy Commission Act was introduced establishing an agency to purchase, store and market dairy products. He was also responsible for the Farm Machinery Syndicate Credit Act which extended loans to farmers to buy machinery co- operatively. Journalist Walter Stewart once wrote of Hays that \\"No minister seems more inept inside Parliament and few get so much done outside it.\\" Hays also established the Western College of Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon and was responsible for expanding crop insurance and introducing a national farm accounting system. Hays and Tory Alvin Hamilton were bitter rivals with Hamilton denigrating Hays' efforts regularly. Hays once challenged Hamilton to prove he could beat Hays in a cow milking contest but the competition never came to pass. Hays was defeated in his attempt to retain his seat in the 1965 federal election by Progressive Conservative candidate and two-term Calgary Aldermen Ray Ballard by a margin of 115 votes. Hays loss can be attributed to the limited popularity of the Liberal government in Alberta, however, Hays was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1966 on the advice of Pearson and served on the Senate's agriculture committee for a number of years. In 1980 he co- chaired the special joined committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the Canadian Constitution and was an advocate of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and of reducing the Senate's power to veto legislation approved by the House of Commons. Later life He died in office in 1982 following heart surgery.

Objects in the Shell namespace can represent physically stored file system objects such as files and folders, or can be virtual objects such as the My Network Places and Recycle Bin \\"virtual folders\\". The folders and data files that reside on physical computer disk drives are the most numerous and familiar of these objects; although, through extensions the Shell also provides access to various virtual objects that may not involve physical storage at all. Consequentially, there are folders that do not reside on the physical file system, which are referred to as virtual folders. Likewise, there are virtual file objects that do not reside on the physical file system. Virtual Shell objects are used throughout the Windows Shell. On the Desktop, Shell launchers are implemented through a built-in shell extension. The Window Shell utilizes virtual Shell objects to conceptually represent computer peripherals and network devices, such as printers and routers. Virtual Shell objects can function as Shell links and execute commands when invoked by the user. For example, in Windows XP and other versions, \`\\"rundll32.exe\\" shell32.dll,Options_RunDLL 0\` is executed on the command line when a user launches the \\"Folder Options\\" applet in the Control Panel. The user's Desktop is a special folder that resides at the root of the Shell namespace. Although this folder maps by default to a physical folder stored in the user's profile folder, the special desktop folder is represented as a distinct object from the physical desktop folder. The same holds true with the \\"My Documents\\" (Windows 95 through XP) or user \\"Documents\\" (Windows Vista+) folder.

Its readily identifiable elements consists of the desktop, the taskbar, the Start menu, the task switcher and the AutoPlay feature. On some versions of Windows, it also includes Flip 3D and the charms. In Windows 10, the Windows Shell Experience Host interface drives visuals like the Start Menu, Action Center, Taskbar, and Task View/Timeline. However, the Windows shell also implements a shell namespace that enables computer programs running on Windows to access the computer's resources via the hierarchy of shell objects. \\"Desktop\\" is the top object of the hierarchy; below it there are a number of files and folders stored on the disk, as well as a number of special folders whose contents are either virtual or dynamically created. Recycle Bin, Libraries, Control Panel, This PC and Network are examples of such shell objects. The Windows shell, as it is known today, is an evolution of what began with Windows 95, released in 1995. It is intimately identified with File Explorer, a Windows component that can browse the whole shell namespace. Features=Desktop Windows Desktop is a full-screen window rendered behind all other windows. It hosts the user's wallpaper and an array of computer icons representing: * Files and folders: Users and software may store computer files and folders on Windows desktop. Naturally, on a newly-installed version of Windows, such items do not exist. Software installers commonly place files known as shortcuts on the desktop, allowing users to launch installed software. Users may store personal documents on the desktop. * Special folders: Apart from ordinary files and folders, special folders (also known as \\"shell folders\\") may appear on the desktop. Unlike ordinary folders, special folders do not point to an absolute location on a hard disk drive. Rather, they may open a folder whose location differs from computer to computer (e.g. Documents), a virtual folder whose contents is an aggregate of several folders on disk (e.g. Recycle Bin or Libraries) or a folder window whose content is not files, but rather user interface elements rendered as icons for convenience (e.g. Network). They may even open windows that do not resemble a folder at all (e.g. Control Panel). Windows Vista and Windows 7 (and the corresponding versions of Windows Server) allowed Windows Desktop Gadgets to appear on the desktop. Taskbar Windows taskbar is a toolbar- like element that by default, appears as a horizontal bar at the bottom of the desktop. It may be relocated to the top, left or right edges of the screen. Starting with Windows 98, its size can be changed. The taskbar can be configured to stay on top of all applications or to collapse and hide when it is not used. Depending on the version of operating system installed, the following elements may appear on the taskbar respectively from left to right: * Start button: Provides access to the Start menu. Removed in Windows 8 (but can be added using third-party software), in favor of the Start charm (see below), only to be reinstated in Windows 8.1. Pictured as a Windows logo. * Quick Links menu: Added in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. Invoked by right-clicking on the Start button, or pressing . Grants access to several frequently used features of Windows, such as accessing the desktop, Settings, Windows Command Processor, Windows Power Shell, and File Explorer. * List of open windows: Along the length of the taskbar, open windows are represented by their corresponding program icons. And once pinned, they will remain even after their respective windows are closed. Until Windows 7, the operating system displayed active windows as depressed buttons in this list. Starting with Windows 7, the icon for each open window is framed by a translucent box, and multiple open windows for the same program can be accessed by clicking the program's icon. When the open window icon is hovered over with the mouse, a preview of the open window is shown above the icon. However, the taskbar can be changed to function more as it does with older versions of Windows. Starting from Windows 7, the open windows icons can be configured to show the program icon only, referred to as \\"combining taskbar buttons\\", or give the program name alongside the program icon. * Shortcuts: An update to Windows 95 and Windows NT 4 added a Quick Launch Bar that can hold file, program, and action shortcuts, including by default the \\"show desktop\\" command. Windows 7 merged this area into the list of open windows by adding \\"pinning\\" and \\"jump list\\" features. * Deskbands: Toolbars provided by Windows or other programs for easier access to that program's functions; for more information, see * Notification area: Allows programs to display icons representing their status as well as pop-up notifications associated with those icons. By default, Windows volume control, network status, Action Center, date and time are displayed in this area. * \\"Show desktop\\" button: Allows users to access their desktops. It is moved from the left of the Taskbar as a Quick Launch shortcut to the rightmost side as its own dedicated hover button in Windows 7. Not initially visible in Windows 8. Once the mouse cursor is hovered upon for a second, makes all windows transparent as long as the pointer stays over the button, thus showing the desktop without switching to it: this feature requiring Aero. Clicking the button dismisses all open windows and transfers the focus to the desktop. Clicking it again before selecting any other window reverts the action. This feature also available on Windows 8, 8.1 and 10. * Task View: A function in Windows 10 allowing the user to view and manage open windows and virtual desktops. The 1803 version includes the Timeline, adding the ability to view and open previously used apps over a certain period of time. Task View can be accessed by pressing the Task View button on the taskbar, or by pressing Windows Key+Tab on the keyboard. * Cortana and Search: User can utilize Microsoft's Cortana Virtual Assistant, which enables internet searches, searches for apps and features on the PC, and searches for files and documents. Cortana can be accessed by clicking the search bar, pressing the microphone button, saying \\"Hey Cortana\\", or by pressing Windows Key+C on the keyboard. Searches can be initiated by also pressing the search bar, or by pressing Windows Key+Q on the keyboard. * Action Center: Introduced in Windows 7, the Action Center gave notifications and tips on boosting computer performance and security. In Windows 10, the Action Center serves as a place for all notifications to reside, as well as the location of frequently used settings, such as screen brightness, wireless connectivity, VPNs, Bluetooth, projector connections, and wireless display connections. Replacing the Charms from Windows 8, the Windows 10 Action Center can be accessed by pressing the speech bubble icon on the taskbar, pressing Windows Key+A on the keyboard, or, if using a touchscreen, swiping from the right. Task switching Task switcher is a feature present in Windows 3.0 and all subsequent versions of Windows. It allows a user to cycle through existing application windows by holding down the key and tapping the key. Starting with Windows 95, as long as the key is pressed, a list of active windows is displayed, allowing the user to cycle through the list by tapping the key. An alternative to this form of switching is using the mouse to click on a visible portion of an inactive window. However, may be used to switch out of a full screen window. This is particularly useful in video games that lock, restrict or alter mouse interactions for the purpose of the game. Starting with Windows Vista, Windows Desktop is included in the list and can be activated this way. Windows 7 introduced Aero Flip (renamed Windows Flip in Windows 8). When the user holds down the key, Aero Flip causes only the contents of the selected window to be displayed. The remaining windows are replaced with transparent glass-like sheets that give an impression where the inactive window is located. Windows 8 introduced Metro-style apps, which did not appear when was pressed. (They have to be switched with their own dedicated task switcher, activated through the combination.) Windows 8.1 extended to manage the Metro-style apps as well. Windows 10 has a unified task switcher called Task View, which manages not only application windows but virtual desktops as well. Aero Flip 3D Flip 3D is a supplemental task switcher. It was introduced with Windows Vista and removed in Windows 8. It is invoked by holding down the key and tapping the key. As long as the key remains pressed, Windows displays all application windows, including the Desktop, in an isometric view, diagonally across the screen from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. The active window at the time of pressing the key is placed in front of the others. This view is maintained while key is held down. and cycle through the open windows, so that the user can preview them. When the key is released, the Flip 3D view is dismissed and the selected window comes to the front and into focus. Charms The charms in Windows 8 Windows 8 added a bar containing a set of five shortcuts known as the \\"charms\\", invoked by moving the mouse cursor into the top or bottom right-hand corners of the screen, or by swiping from the right edge of a compatible touchpad or touch screen. This feature was retained in 8.1. Windows 10 removed the charms and moved the commands associated with them into the system menu of each application. For users with touch screens, swiping from the right of the touch screen now shows Action Center. Start menu Starting with Windows 95, all versions of Windows feature a form of Start menu, usually by this very same name. Depending on the version of Windows, the menu features the following: * Launching applications: The menu's primary function is to present a list of shortcuts for installed software, allowing users to launch them. Windows 8 and 10 utilize tiles in the start menu, allowing the user to display icons of different sizes, and arrange icons as the user chooses. Microsoft Store Metro-style apps can utilize live tiles, which are used to add visual effects and provide, for example, notifications for a specific app, such as Email notifications for Windows Mail. * Invoking special folders: Until Windows 8, the Start menu was a mean of invoking special folders such as Computer, Network, Control Panel, etc. In Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the only special folder that can be invoked from the Start screen is the desktop. Windows 10 restored this functionality. * Searching: Starting with Windows Vista, searching for installed software, files and folders became a function of the Start menu. Windows 10 ended this tradition by moving the search into taskbar. * Managing power states: Logging off and shutdown has always been a function of the Start menu. In Windows 8, the shutdown function was moved out of the Start screen, only to be brought back in Windows 8.1 Update (in April 2014) with a sufficiently high screen resolution. Computer power states can also be managed by pressing Alt+F4, or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del. AutoPlay AutoPlay is a feature introduced in Windows XP that examines newly inserted removable media for content and displays a dialog containing options related to the type and content of that media. The possible choices are provided by installed software: it is thus not to be confused with the related AutoRun feature, configured by a file on the media itself, although AutoRun is selectable as an AutoPlay option when both are enabled. Relation with File Explorer File Explorer is a Windows component that can browse the shell namespace. In other words, it can browse disks, files and folder as a file manager would, but can also access Control Panel, dial-up network objects, and other elements introduced above. In addition, the \`explorer.exe\` executable, which is responsible for launching File Explorer, is also responsible for launching the taskbar, the Start menu and part of the desktop. However, the task switcher, the charms, or AutoPlay operate even when all instances of the \`explorer.exe\` process are closed, and other computer programs can still access the shell namespace without it. Initially called Windows Explorer, its name was changed to File Explorer beginning with Windows 8, although the program name remains \`explorer.exe\`. History=MS-DOS Executive MS-DOS Executive file manager The first public demonstration of Windows, in 1983, had a simplistic shell called the Session Control Layer, which served as a constantly visible menu at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on Run would display a list of programs that one could launch, and clicking on Session Control would display a list of programs already running so one could switch between them. Windows 1.0, shipped in November 1985, introduced MS-DOS Executive, a simple file manager that differentiated between files and folders by bold type. It lacked support for icons, although this made the program somewhat faster than the file manager that came with Windows 3.0. Programs could be launched by double-clicking on them. Files could be filtered for executable type, or by a user-selected wildcard, and the display mode could be toggled between full and compact descriptions. The file date column was not Y2K compliant. Windows 2.0 made no significant change to MS-DOS Executive. Program Manager Windows 3.x GUI added Program Manager. Windows 3.0, introduced in May 1990, shipped with a new shell called Program Manager. Based on Microsoft's work with OS/2 Desktop Manager, Program Manager sorted program shortcuts into groups. Unlike Desktop Manager, these groups were housed in a single window, in order to show off Microsoft's new Multiple Document Interface. Program Manager in Windows 3.1 introduced wrappable icon titles, along with the new Startup group, which Program Manager would check on launch and start any programs contained within. Program Manager was also ported to Windows NT 3.1, and was retained through Windows NT 3.51. Start menu Windows 95 introduced a new shell. The desktop became an interactive area that could contain files (including file shortcuts), folders, and special folders such as My Computer, Network Neighborhood and Recycle Bin. Windows Explorer, which replaced File Manager, opened both ordinary and special folders. The taskbar was introduced, which maintained buttons representing open windows, a digital clock, a notifications area for background processes and their notifications, and the Start button, which invoked the Start menu. The Start menu contained links to settings, recently used files and, like its predecessor Program Manager, shortcuts and program groups. Program Manager is also included in Windows 95 for backward compatibility, in case the user disliked the new interface. This is included with all versions of Windows up to and including Windows XP Service Pack 1. In SP2 and SP3, PROGMAN.EXE is just an icon library, and it was completely removed from Windows Vista in 2006. The new shell was also ported to Windows NT, initially released as the NewShell update for Windows NT 3.51 and then fully integrated into Windows NT 4.0. Windows Desktop Update In early 1996, Netscape announced that the next release of its browser, codenamed \\"Constellation\\", would completely integrate with Windows and add a new shell, codenamed \\"HomePort\\", which would present the same files and shortcuts no matter which machine a user logged into. Microsoft started working on a similar Internet Explorer release, codenamed \\"Nashville\\". Internet Explorer 4.0 was redesigned and resulted in two products: the standalone IE4 and Windows Desktop Update, which updated the shell with features such as Active Desktop, Active Channels, Web folders, desktop toolbars such as the Quick Launch bars, ability to minimize windows by clicking their button on the taskbar, HTML-based folder customization, single click launching, image thumbnails, folder infotips, web view in folders, Back and Forward navigation buttons, larger toolbar buttons with text labels, favorites, file attributes in Details view, and an address bar in Windows Explorer, among other features. It also introduced the My Documents shell folder. Future Windows releases, like Windows 95C (OSR 2.5) and Windows 98, included Internet Explorer 4 and the features of the Windows Desktop Update already built in. Improvements were made in Windows 2000 and Windows ME, such as personalized menus, ability to drag and sort menu items, sort by name function in menus, cascading Start menu special folders, customizable toolbars for Explorer, auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, displaying comments in file shortcuts as tooltips, advanced file type association features, extensible columns in Details view (IColumnProvider interface), icon overlays, places bar in common dialogs, high-color notification area icons and a search pane in Explorer. Start menu and taskbar changes Windows XP introduced a new Start Menu, with shortcuts to shell locations on the right and a list of most frequently used applications on the left. It also grouped taskbar buttons from the same program if the taskbar got too crowded, and hid notification icons if they had not been used for a while. For the first time, Windows XP hid most of the shell folders from the desktop by default, leaving only the Recycle Bin (although the user could get them back if they desired). Windows XP also introduced numerous other shell enhancements. In the early days of the Longhorn project, an experimental sidebar, with plugins similar to taskbar plugins and a notifications history was built into the shell. However, when Longhorn was reset the integrated sidebar was discarded in favor of a separate executable file, sidebar.exe, which provided Web-enabled gadgets, thus replacing Active Desktop. Windows Vista introduced a searchable Start menu and live taskbar previews to the Windows shell. It also introduced a redesigned Alt-Tab switcher which included live previews, and Flip 3D, an application switcher that would rotate through application windows in a fashion similar to a Rolodex when the user pressed the Win-Tab key combination. Windows 7 added 'pinned' shortcuts and 'jump lists' to the taskbar, and automatically grouped program windows into one icon (although this could be disabled). Windows Server 2008 introduced the possibility to have a Windows installation without the shell, which results in fewer processes loaded and running. Windows 8 removed Flip 3D in order to repurpose Win-Tab for displaying an application switcher sidebar containing live previews of active Windows Store apps for users without touchscreens. Windows 10 added the possibility to have more than one virtual desktop, to group active programs' windows, it is possible to navigate through this desktops using Ctrl+Win+Left or Right arrows, or by clicking on an icon in the taskbar, and creating them with Ctrl+Win+D. Windows 10 also added Cortana to the Start menu, to provide interaction with the shell through vocal commands. Shell replacements Windows supports the ability to replace the Windows shell with another program. A number of third party shells exist that can be used in place of the standard Windows shell.

History The party was founded on 7 February 2006 as the result of a split from the New Italian Socialist Party (NPSI) by the wing favourable to a political alliance with The Union on the centre-left, and an immediate discontinuance of ties with the centre-right House of Freedoms. The party was originally led by Bobo Craxi, son of the late Bettino Craxi, former leader of the Italian Socialist Party and former Prime Minister of Italy. In the 2006 general election the party was part of The Union coalition, being present only in few constituencies and thus gaining only 0.3% of the vote for the Chamber of Deputies and 0.4% for the Senate. The party saw none of its members elected and even Craxi, who had a place on The Olive Tree electoral list, was not elected, leaving the party without representation in Parliament.Repubblica.it » politica » Bobo Craxi, accordo coi Ds sarà candidato nel \\"listone\\" However, the centre-left coalition won the election and Craxi was appointed Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs in the Prodi II Cabinet. The first party convention, held on 10–11 March 2007, elected unanimously Saverio Zavettieri as party secretary and deliberated the change in name from The Socialists (I Socialisti) to The Italian Socialists. The party also discussed and rejected the opportunity to join the Democratic Party. In July 2007, the party decided to merge into the modern-day Italian Socialist Party (PSI), which was launched on 5 October 2007, but, in July 2008, Zavettieri left that party and re-organised The Italian Socialists. In October 2009 also Craxi left the PSI, paving the way for a new party with Zavettieri into which The Italian Socialists were finally merged, the United Socialists.I socialisti di Bobo Craxi: «Autonomi da tutti»  References External links *Official website Category:2006 establishments in Italy Category:2009 disestablishments in Italy Category:Defunct social democratic parties in Italy Category:Political parties disestablished in 2009 Category:Political parties established in 2006 Category:Defunct political parties in Italy ","title":"The Italian Socialists"},{"id":"4124696","text":"Shimmer Magazine was a quarterly magazine which published speculative fiction, with a focus on material that is dark, humorous or strange. Established in June 2005, Shimmer was published in digest format and Portable Document Format (PDF) and was edited by Beth Wodzinski. Shimmer featured stories from award- winning authors Jay Lake and Ken Scholes; comic book artist Karl Kesel also contributed artwork. The magazine ceased publication with issue 46 published in November 2018. History In mid-April 2005, Beth Wodzinski began having \\"vague thoughts\\" about starting an on-line, downloadable zine. While worried that she wouldn't have much time to devote to such a project, she wanted to support authors who wrote the kind of stories she liked, and to reject authors who wrote \\"alright\\" instead of \\"all right.\\" About a month later, Beth came up with the ideal name for her zine: \\"Shimmer.\\" Beth then recruited a few on-line friends to help develop the magazine. J.L. Radley, Jon Willesen, and Chris Hansen came on board, and Shimmer moved from its conception phase to its development and business model phase. Rather quickly, it became evident that more help would be needed, and Mary Robinette Kowal joined the Shimmery Staff as Art Director. Beth, Mary Robinette, and J.L. Radley all met on-line at Orson Scott Card's Hatrack River Writers Workshop forum. Barely a few weeks into development, a conversationShade Books Forum discussion on electronic versus print magazines on an on-line message board for writers precipitated a major discussion among the Shimmery Staff that changed how Shimmer would be delivered to its readers. Shimmer, Beth decided, would be a printed magazine. Though risky and requiring some more capital than initially planned for, Shimmer debuted as a digest-sized printed magazine with a perfect-bound glossy, color cover. Shimmer has since been well received by readers and critics; and esteemed Editor Ellen Datlow (whose interview appears in the Winter 2006 issue) wrote that Shimmer is \\"worthwhile\\" in the summary section of 2005 Year’s Best Fantasy and Horror anthology.www.shimmerzine.com - news posting 2 September 2006 Contributor payment Since August 2012, Shimmer has paid US$0.05/word, considered the minimum professional rate for speculative fiction writing.Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Inc. Website SWFA Membership Requirements - Paid Sales Contributors to earlier editions were paid lower rates (US $5/piece for the debut issue, Autumn 2005, rising to $10 for the next two issues and to $0.01/word in July 2006). Circulation To date, no mention of Shimmer's circulation totals, either print or electronic, appeared on the official website or elsewhere on the Internet. There were, however, two \\"news\\" posts on the Shimmer site which claimed Shimmer placed fifth on Clarkesworld Books Bestseller List (magazines), one in April and another in June, 2006.www.shimmerzine.com - news posting 29 April 2006www.shimmerzine.com - news posting 28 June 2006 Other All story and artwork submissions were received electronically via e-mail. The magazine's Submissions Wrangler removed all personally-identifiable information from a manuscript and then forwarded the story to one of its editors, who read the story \\"blind.\\" This, Shimmer claims in its submission guidelines, allowed for editors to judge whether a story merits acceptance based solely on the story and not which author submitted it. There were other publications which use a similar acceptance and rejection process. All stories that were not accepted received personal rejection letters and feedback from the editor(s). John Joseph Adams, a.k.a. \\"The Slush God,\\" assistant editor of Fantasy and Science Fiction, edited the magazine's special Pirate issue in Summer 2007. One story from each issue was selected for an audio recording, sometimes read by the author who wrote the story. There is (or was) another Shimmer Magazine published in Australia, with content geared towards women's fashion, but it is unclear if the Australian Shimmer is still in publication; this uncertainty is based on its website, which does not appear to have been updated since 2004.

Beginning in 1998, he appeared more than 30 times on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss transformation in human consciousness concepts presented in his book The Seat of the Soul. His first book, The Dancing Wu Li Masters (1979), won a U.S. National Book Award.\\"National Book Awards – 1980\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-07. Life Gary Zukav was born in Port Arthur, Texas, the elder of two children of Morris Luis \\"Morey\\" and Lorene (née Weinberg) Zukav. His father owned a jewelry store in Pittsburg, Kansas, and his mother was a housewife who raised him and his younger sister. Gary spent his early childhood in San Antonio and Houston. His family moved to Pittsburg, Kansas in 1952, while he was in fourth grade. In 1960, he graduated from Pittsburg High School as valedictorian. During that time he became an Eagle Scout, Governor of Kansas Boy's State, President of the Student Council, and Kansas State Debate championship team member twice. In 1959, Gary received a scholarship to Harvard and matriculated high school in 1960. In his junior year at Harvard he left to motorcycle in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East before returning the following year. In 1964, he was deeply moved by the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in Philadelphia, Mississippi, and worked as a summer volunteer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Jackson, Mississippi, under the direction of Charles Evers, brother of the slain Medgar Evers. In 1965, he graduated from Harvard. That same year he enlisted in the U.S. Army and entered U.S. Army Infantry Officer Candidate School. He was commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant in 1966. He volunteered for the U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets), completed Parachute Training (Fort Benning, Georgia), U.S. Army Special Warfare School (Fort Bragg, North Carolina), and served as an A Detachment Executive Officer in Okinawa and Vietnam, participating in Top Secret operations in Vietnam and Laos. He left Vietnam after the Tet Offensive of January 1968 and was discharged from the U.S. Army in 1968 as 1st Lieutenant. Zukav returned to the U.S. in 1970 and moved to San Francisco, California. He recounts this period as an emotionally volatile time of sexual addiction, motorcycles, anger and drug-abuse. This continued until 1975 when an unexpected introduction to quantum physics by his roommate, Jack Sarfatti, who took him to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory initiated changes in his experience. This led to his first book, Dancing Wu Li Masters, written with extensive help from Jack Sarfatti and other physicists he met through Sarfatti, as described in David Kaiser's book How the Hippies Saved Physics. He later described this book as his \\"first gift to Life\\". In 1987 he moved to Mount Shasta, California, where he lived in a cabin as a self-described \\"secular monk\\" and spent extensive time in the surrounding wilderness. In 1993 he met Linda Francis. They co-founded the Seat of the Soul Institute in 1998 and moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 2000. Writing career Christopher Lehmann-Haupt reviewed The Dancing Wu Li Masters in The New York Times March 28, 1979. He called it > a book that manages to explain relativity and a lot more without resorting > to a single bit of mathematics (except for asking you to grasp the not-too- > onerous concept that the velocity of light, a constant 186,000 miles per > second, is a product of its frequency and wavelength). After all, Mr. Zukav > writes, \\"The fact is that physics is not mathematics. Physics, in essence, > is simple wonder at the way things are and a divine (some call it > compulsive) interest in how that is so. Mathematics is the tool of physics, > stripped of mathematics, physics becomes pure enchantment.\\" The review also acclaimed Zukav as > one of those rare gifted teachers who makes you feel as if you're ahead of > the lesson, jumping happily to conclusions he hasn't yet seen (though of > course he has). And when he does arrive at those conclusions, he often > states them in the words of their original discoverers, which suddenly seem > as simple as \\"Pat the Bunny\\" and flatter you into thinking you could have > understood them in their original context on your own. The drama built into > Mr. Zukav's presentation is considerable. It begins with his introduction of > an Oriental dimension. The Chinese name for \\"physics\\", \\"wu li\\", also means > (depending upon how it is pronounced) \\"patterns of organic energy\\", \\"my > way\\", \\"nonsense\\", \\"I clutch my ideas\\" and \\"enlightenment\\". These six > meanings, not only become the title of the book's six sections – for > instance, \\"Nonsense\\" is the heading of the one on Einstein's ideas, which is > divided into chapters called \\"Beginner's Mind\\", \\"Special Nonsense\\", and > \\"General Nonsense\\" – they also serve to shape the leitmotif of Mr. Zukav's > discussion that relates modern physics to Oriental religion. Dancing Wu Li Masters was also reviewed by the scientific community. Robert H. March, Professor of Physics at the University of Wisconsin, wrote in Physics Today in August 1979, \\"Dealing with general relativity [Zukav] manages to convey the profound mental shift required to reduce physics to geometry. This is a neat trick, considering that he addresses an audience familiar with neither physics nor non-Euclidian geometry.\\" Martin Gardner, mathematician and science writer for Scientific American, wrote in a book review: \\"Zukav is such a skillful expositor, with such an amiable style, that it is hard to imagine a layman who would not find this book enjoyable and informative.\\" David Bohm, renowned quantum physicist, wrote a personal endorsement provided to the book's publisher Harper Collins: \\"Recommended highly for those who want to understand the essential significance of modern physics, and for those who are concerned with its implications for possible transformation of human consciousness.\\" Zukav's next book, The Seat of the Soul, published in 1989, was a No. 1 New York Times Best Seller for 31 weeks and remained on the list for three years. In an interview by Jeffrey Mishlove, for the popular Public Television series Thinking Allowed, Zukav summarized the concepts presented in The Seat of the Soul. > My objective was not to make the soul legitimate in terms of science. The > soul is legitimate, period. It doesn't need validation. At least that was my > perception and so I wrote The Seat of the Soul to share the things that were > most important to me. The Dancing Wu Li Masters was designed to open the > mind and The Seat of the Soul, is a book designed to open the heart. And > this is often the sequence that many people encounter as they move into an > expanded awareness of who they are and why they are here. Our evolution, > until very recently, has been as five sensory humans evolving through the > exploration of physical reality. That is the same thing as the pursuit of > external power. Now we have crossed the threshold, we're in new territory, a > brand new domain. We are now becoming multi sensory. That means we are no > longer confined to the five senses. Now I use these terms because the five > senses together form a single sensory system and the object of that sensory > system is physical reality. That's what it is designed to detect. As we > become multi sensory, we move beyond the limitations of the five senses and > we now are evolving to a different mechanism in the exploration of physical > reality. We are evolving through responsible choice of and with the > assistance and guidance of non physical guides and teachers. We are > spiritual beings, we have always been spiritual beings and we will always be > spiritual beings. The difference is that now we are becoming aware of > ourselves as spiritual beings and that is making all the difference. In 1998 Zukav began an ongoing conversation with Oprah Winfrey, appearing on her television show 35 times – more than any other guest. Oprah, who keeps a copy of The Seat of the Soul at her bedside, proclaimed: \\"The Seat of the Soul is my favorite book of all time, except for the Bible.\\" Her favorite quote from The Seat of the Soul: \\"Every action, thought, and feeling is motivated by an intention, and that intention is a cause that exists as one with an effect.... In this most profound way, we are held responsible for every action, thought, and feeling, which is to say, for our every intention.\\" Zukav's third book, Soul Stories (2000), provides examples of people creating authentic power. Thoughts from the Seat of the Soul: Meditations for Souls in Progress (2001) offered daily quotes for meditation. The principles in The Seat of the Soul were elaborated in The Heart of the Soul: Emotional Awareness (2002), The Mind of the Soul: Responsible Choice (2003) and Self-Empowerment Journal: A Companion to The Mind of the Soul: Responsible Choice (2003) co- authored with Zukav's wife and spiritual partner Linda Francis. Soul to Soul: Communications from the Heart (2007) answered questions about love, fear, choice, responsibility and intuition. Spiritual Partnership: The Journey to Authentic Power (2010) provided guidelines for individuals engaged in relationship for the purpose of spiritual development. In 1999 Zukav and Linda Francis co-founded the Seat of the Soul Institute. Its mission is to assist people across the world to create meaning and purpose, creativity and health, joy and love. It offers programs and tools to develop emotional awareness, responsible choice, intuition, trust, and spiritual partnerships. Events and programs include an annual five-day intensive Journey to the Soul immersion retreat, and co-sponsored lectures and workshops. Teachings Zukav introduces the concept of the alignment of personality with soul as the creation of \\"authentic power\\". He asserts that a transformation of humanity is underway from a species that is limited to the perceptions of the five senses, evolves by surviving, and survives by pursuing \\"external power\\", which he defines as the ability to manipulate and control, into a species that is not limited to the perceptions of the five senses, evolves by growing spiritually, and grows spiritually by creating authentic power. He further asserts that this transformation brings with it the new potential of authentic power and that the pursuit of external power is henceforth counter-productive to our evolution and produces only violence and destruction. According to Zukav, creating authentic power is a highly personal endeavor that requires the development of emotional awareness, responsible choice, intuition, and trust in the Universe, which he describes as \\"alive, wise, and compassionate\\". He asserts that each individual can create authentic power only for himself or herself. He defines intention as a \\"quality of consciousness that infuses an action\\", i.e., the reason or motivation for the action, and choice of intention as the \\"fundamental creative act\\" that each individual performs continually, whether unconsciously or consciously. Creating authentic power requires consciously choosing intentions that create consequences for which the chooser is willing to assume responsibility (responsible choice), which requires emotional awareness, and which intuition can assist. Zukav distinguishes the \\"Old Male\\" (five-sensory, protector, provider) and the \\"Old Female\\" (five-sensory, child bearer, homemaker) who join in marriage in order to enhance probabilities of survival and comfort from the emerging \\"New Male\\" (multi sensory, intuitive, emotionally aware) and the \\"New Female\\" (multi sensory, capable in all chosen endeavors) who join in a new kind of relationship in order to create authentic power and assist each other in creating authentic power. He calls this relationship \\"spiritual partnership\\" and defines it as \\"partnership between equals for the purpose of spiritual growth\\". According to Zukav, \\"spiritual growth now requires relationships of substance and depth\\" and only spiritual partnerships are able to support all multi sensory individuals (not only couples) in creating authentic power. Zukav posits the \\"Universal Human\\" as the ultimate potential of the emerging multi sensory humanity – a human who is \\"beyond nation, religion, race, sex, and economic status; a Citizen of the Universe whose allegiance is to Life first and all else second\\".

Additionally, McCreery was chief of staff at Greenwich Hospital (Connecticut) from 1939-1948, and one of the founders of the American Board of Surgery.  Early life  McCreery was born in New York City, the son of John Alexander McCreery, a respected New York City surgeon, and Louise Dowdal Carrigan. His father was the son of a Scottish immigrant, James McCreery, who settled in New York City in 1831; James McCreery later became a prominent wholesale dry-goods merchant. His mother was a daughter of Andrew Carrigan (1804-1872), a wealthy Irish-born philanthropist and provisions dealer who co-founded the Emigrant Savings Bank. The McCreery family were among the first parishioners at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, and several members of the family are interred inside the cathedral. McCreery had two younger sisters, Christine Forbes McCreery Hoguet (1886–1951) and Mary McKay McCreery (1888–1964). The family resided on Fifth Avenue in New York City. McCreery was educated at the Cutler School (New York) and entered Harvard University in 1902, graduating in 1906. From there McCreery received a degree in medicine from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1910. During World War I, McCreery served as a Major in the Medical Corps, and was stationed in France. It was there in 1918 that he met Miss Eileen Birkett Ravenshaw of England, an ambulance driver stationed in France as well. Miss Ravenshaw, a member of the prominent Ravenshaw family of England, was a daughter of Charles Withers Ravenshaw, a lieutenant colonel in the Indian Political Service appointed by Queen Victoria who later served as a governor of the British colony of Nepal from 1902-1905. The Ravenshaw Family descends from John Goldsborough Ravenshaw II, chairman and director of the British East India Company between 1819 and 1832, and descends from Sir William Withers, one time Lord Mayor of London. McCreery and Ravenshaw were married on November 26, 1918, and settled in New York City.  Medical career  McCreery started off as a private physician in New York City, however later took a position as chief of surgery at Bellevue Hospital Center during the early 1920s. In 1925, McCreery transferred positions from Bellevue to Greenwich Hospital (Connecticut), and was appointed chief of surgery there. At this point, McCreery was also serving as president of both the New York Surgical and Greenwich Medical Societies, and kept offices in both Greenwich and New York City. In 1937, Dr. McCreery helped establish the American Board of Surgery. Two years later, in 1939, McCreery was appointed chief of staff at Greenwich Hospital, a position he held up until his death in 1948. At Greenwich Hospital, McCreery was widely credited as being responsible for modernizing the technology used during surgery, quickly putting Greenwich Hospital as one of the top hospitals in the New York City area.  McCreery family and personal life  In 1919, while residing in New York, Dr. and Mrs. McCreery gave birth to twin daughters Joan Anne (1919–2005) and Lalande Louise McCreery (1919–1983). Two years later, a third daughter, Sheila Mary McCreery (1921–1997), was born. The McCreery girls were high society debutantes, making their debuts in 1938 and 1939, respectively. The three girls were also highly recognized equestriennes. After moving to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1931, the McCreery family resided at an English estate in the Khakum Wood section known as \\"Quiet Waters\\"; the house is currently owned by former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Thomas C. Foley. The McCreerys additionally owned a historic home on Nantucket, Massachusetts, as well as the McCreery family estate in Stockbridge, \\"Council Grove\\". McCreery died suddenly of pneumonia. He was survived by his wife, Eileen Ravenshaw McCreery; three daughters, Joan (Mrs. John Wynne Gerster), Lalande (Mrs. John William Keeshan), and Sheila (Mrs. Richard Newton Jackson, Jr.); and two sisters, Christine (Mrs. Ramsay Charles Hoguet) and Mary McCreery. The descendants of McCreery continue to reside in Greenwich, New York, Nantucket, and Baltimore.

Gilmerton Cove is a series of underground passageways and chambers hand-carved from sandstone located beneath the streets of Gilmerton, an ex-mining village, now a southeastern suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland. A five-year collaborative project between Gilmerton Heritage Trust and The City of Edinburgh Council allowed the newly restored Cove to open in 2003 as an educational resource for the community as well as a place to visit. There are many theories about the origins of the Cove and its purpose. It is known that it was the 18th century residence of local blacksmith, George Paterson. The parish records show that he was reprimanded for allowing alcohol to be consumed within the Cove on the sabbath. It is not known whether Paterson was responsible for carving the Cove. In 1769 Thomas Pennant mentions the site in the context of Newbattle Abbey saying that \\"In the woods adjacent to this seat are some subterraneous (sic) apartments and passages cut out of the live rock: they seem to have been excavated by the ancient inhabitants of the country either as receptacles for their provisions, or a retreat for themselves and families in time of war, in the same manner, as Tacitus relates, as was customary with the old Germans.\\" Extensive archaeological and historical research has failed to resolve the mystery. In 2017, research by scientists from University of St Andrews and University of Edinburgh using ground-penetrating radar indicated that the network of passageways and chambers may be more extensive than that currently exposed. Popular theories are that it was used as a drinking den for local gentry, a Covenanters refuge, and a smugglers' lair. In 2007, the documentary television series Cities of the Underworld featured Gilmerton Cove in the episode Scotland's Sin City which postulates that the Cove was linked to a nearby Hellfire Club building via a secret passage.

Originally serialised in Adventure magazine,Taves, pp. 94-5 it concerns the Nine Unknown Men, a secret society founded by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka around 270 BC to preserve and develop knowledge that would be dangerous to humanity if it fell into the wrong hands. The nine unknown men were entrusted with guarding nine books of secret knowledge.  Plot  In the novel the nine men are the embodiment of good and face up against nine Kali worshippers, who sow confusion and masquerade as the true sages. The story surrounds a priest called Father Cyprian who is in possession of the books but who wants to destroy them out of Christian piety, and a number of other characters who are interested in learning their contents. Influence The concept of the \\"Nine Unknown Men\\" was further popularized by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier in their 1960 book The Morning of the Magicians. They claimed that the Nine Unknown were real and had been founded by the Indian Emperor Ashoka. They also claimed that Pope Silvester II had met them and that nineteenth-century French colonial administrator and writer Louis Jacolliot insisted on their existence.Neal Wilgus The Illuminoids New York, Pocket Books 1978 pp.95-6 The Nine Unknown were also the final dedicatees mentioned in the dedication of the first edition of Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible in 1969.LaVey, Anton Szandor (1969).

Brogan (born September 6, 1953) is the former Chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (who retired on September 1, 2017), former Chancellor of the State University System of Florida, and former President of Florida Atlantic University. He was also the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Florida. Brogan is a longtime educator who served eight years in statewide office. On June 25, 2018, Brogan was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Assistant Secretary of Education (Elementary and Secondary Education). He succeeded Deborah S. Delisle. Education In 1976, Frank Brogan became the first member in his family to earn a college degree when he received his bachelor's degree in education magna cum laude from the University of Cincinnati. In 1981, he earned his Master of Arts in Educational leadership from Florida Atlantic University. Early career=Education Brogan began his education career in 1978 in the Martin County, Florida public school district. His first job was teaching fifth grade at Port Salerno Elementary School. It was while teaching at this school that he earned his master's degree in 1981. Brogan next focused his career on educational administration. He went on to serve as the Dean of Students at Indiantown Middle School, and then assistant principal, and principal of Murray Middle School. While an administrator, Brogan negotiated a gun away from a student. Brogan was eventually elected to two terms as the Superintendent of Schools in Martin County. Politics Brogan's Florida Lt. Governor portrait In 1994, Brogan was elected Florida Commissioner of Education. In this position he oversaw all education activities in Florida and served as a member of the Florida Cabinet, which oversaw various aspects of state government. He was the youngest education commissioner in Florida's history. Brogan was seeking a second term as Education Commissioner when, in 1998, Jeb Bush asked him to be his running mate as lieutenant governor. The Bush/Brogan team won the general election. As lieutenant governor, Brogan oversaw education policy and acted as legislative liaison for the Bush Administration. Bush and Brogan were re-elected in 2002; Brogan departed to become president of FAU in 2003. Florida Atlantic University Brogan in 2003 Brogan holding a bald eagle in 2009 Brogan became the fifth president of Florida Atlantic University in 2003 and was reappointed by the FAU Board of Trustees to a second six-year term, which began in 2009, although Brogan quit this position the same year to become Chancellor of the State University System of Florida. Recognizing the region's strong potential to become a center of biomedical research, Brogan has placed special emphasis on creating partnerships between the University and leading research organizations. He fostered relationships with organizations such as The Scripps Research Institute, the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, the Max Planck Society and the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute. Additionally, FAU entered into a unique public/private medical school partnership that resulted in the introduction of a complete, four-year medical education program on FAU's Boca Raton campus and the creation of FAU's independent medical school in 2010. During Brogan's initial six-year term, the university developed its first-ever comprehensive strategic plan, which has provided a roadmap for progress since its inception in 2006. He oversaw the largest physical development of the university's campuses as new facilities were built to serve FAU’s undergraduate and graduate population, which surpassed 27,000 for the first time. He presided over the early planning stages of \\"Innovation Village\\" on the Boca Raton campus, which doubled the amount of on-campus housing while adding the wellness center, alumni center, football stadium, retail space and additional parking. The stadium and most of these features were developed and completed in the years after Brogan left FAU. In 2009 Brogan became chancellor of the State University System and resigned as president of FAU. State University System of Florida Brogan took office as Florida's university system chancellor in 2009 during a time of deep acrimony between the Florida Legislature and the Board of Governors. As the longest-serving chancellor since the creation of the Board of Governors in 2003, his tenure brought a welcome stability for the system. During his tenure, relationships with the Florida Legislature were restored, as evidenced by the landmark governance agreement of 2010 that provided clarity regarding oversight of the university system. Meanwhile, the university system demonstrated significant progress in providing access to high-quality higher education. During his tenure, the system increased enrollment by 7 percent, increased degree production by 12 percent and saw record high attainment in academic standards, graduation rates, national rankings and research. The board approved a new 2025 Strategic Plan that includes 39 key performance benchmarks, which is an integral part of Florida's nationally recognized accountability framework that tracks progress of university and system goals. This was part of Brogan's goal for Florida to have \\"the most accountable university system in America.\\" During the 2013 legislative session in particular, the university system took several major steps toward further excellence. The board and Legislature worked together to implement a number of top priorities, including establishing a path for universities to reach preeminent status, creating the nation's first fully online institute operated by a public research university, and providing a platform for a performance- funding model that fosters the unique mission of each institution while advancing system goals. The state legislature reversed an earlier $300 million budget cut and added more than $400 million in new funding for operations, facilities and maintenance. In October 2013, Brogan left his post as Chancellor of the State University System of Florida to serve as the chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. Under his leadership of the PASSHE, the membership of the faculty union, APSCUF, which represents more than 5000 teachers, went on strike for the first time in 34 years, after working for more than 13 months without a contract.

Heading up the brook from the Passaic River, one encounters the boroughs of Fair Lawn and Glen Rock, as well as the village of Ridgewood. Description Diamond Brook passes through a largely suburban setting, though its southern end runs under an industrial complex in Fair Lawn before terminating at the Passaic River. The head of Diamond Brook is located south of Godwin Ave in Ridgewood, near the border of Midland Park. Diamond Brook is considered part of the Goffle Brook drainage basin, but it has no junctions with Goffle Brook and is partly separated from it by another brook, Stevenson Brook, which flows south to the Passaic River between Goffle Brook and Diamond Brook in Hawthorne. Another brook east of Diamond Brook, Little Diamond Brook, is considered to be in part of the same drainage basin as Diamond Brook. Little Diamond Brook and Diamond Brook terminate at the Passaic River within about five hundred feet of each other. History Diamond Brook was historically known as Bass Brook. It once traveled through a series of springs and wetlands along the western edge of Glen Rock. In the 21st century, only a few wetlands remain intact, with two preserved as parts of the Glen Rock Arboretum and Diamond Brook Park. Some natural springs also remain intact behind Orchard School in Ridgewood. In the 1870s, Diamond Brook’s gradation was sufficient to support a water wheel operated by the Marinus Lumber Mill in Glen Rock. When the mill finally closed the wheel and its accompanying machinery were too cumbersome to move. Today the wheel remains where it once operated, buried beneath the street near the intersection of Rock Road and the Boulevard.http://www.glenrocknj.net/Environment/pdf/DiamondBrookBrochure.pdf Diamond Brook Greenway Guide See also *List of New Jersey rivers ReferencesExternal links *TopoQuest map depicting Diamond Brook *Glen Rock, NJ ~ Diamond Brook Greenway Guide *2007 Water Resources Data brief on USGS's Diamond Brook stream gage Category:Rivers of Bergen County, New Jersey Category:Tributaries of the Passaic River Category:Rivers of New Jersey ","title":"Diamond Brook"},{"id":"4124800","text":"Ammiel Alcalay (born 1956) is an American poet, scholar, critic, translator, and prose stylist. Born and raised in Boston, he is a first-generation American, son of Sephardic Jews from Serbia. His work often examines how poetry and politics affect the way we see ourselves and the way Americans think about the Middle East, with attention to methods of cultural recovery in the United States, the Middle East and Europe. Brief overview Alcalay is perhaps best known as a Middle Eastern scholar and university instructor. During the war in former Yugoslavia he was a primary source for providing access in the American media to Bosnian voices. He was responsible for publication of the first survivor's account in English from a victim held in a Serb concentration camp, The Tenth Circle of Hell by Rezak Hukanović (Basic Books, 1996), which he co-translated and edited.Big Bridge, Issue 3 \\"Over the past fifteen years,\\" writes Alcalay, \\"I have focused primarily on Hebrew and Jewish literature of the Middle East, in its Islamic, Levantine Arabic, and Israeli contexts. My work on Bosnia during the war in former Yugoslavia has entailed similar efforts at creating the cultural space for unfamiliar works to emerge. Throughout, my work as poet and prose-writer remains a crucial reference point, representing a kind of standard in form and content that I insist my other writing (and translation) adheres to.\\"Small Press Traffic As a university instructor, Prof. Alcalay has taught Sephardic Literature (both Hebrew and in-translation), and a variety of courses on Middle Eastern and Mediterranean literacy and intellectual culture and its contemporary and modern reception, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as creative writing. After Jews and Arabs: Remaking Levantine Culture (1993)––Alcalay's first book of scholarship and a critical contribution to Levantine studies––was the subject of a 20th anniversary conference at Georgetown University in 2012.

As a member of Los Panchos, he was the third voice and player of the requinto, a small guitar which he invented, and is now a staple instrument.  Biography  He was born in Teziutlan, Puebla, the son of a Lebanese immigrant Felipe Julián Bojalil and Carmen Gil. He had five siblings, two boys and three girls, all with a love of music, and as the surname Bojalil was unsuitable for the show, they adopted their mother's surname. Since he was a child he loved music; at the request of his father he learned the hairdressing trade and it was there that he received his first music lessons with the mandolin. Then he discovered his love for the guitar, which he learned to play in his spare time. But it was his first love, the mandolin, on which he molded his inspiration as a composer. In 1940 his brother Felipe Gil , who was by then beginning to be as popular as El Charro Gil and his Caporales, called him to join him on a tour of New York. There he met Jesús Chucho Navarro Moreno, another Mexican, who since 1936 was part of the Caporales. After his brother Felipe \\"Charro\\" Gil's return to Mexico, Alfredo and Chucho Navarro remained in New York until they achieved fame in 1944, and with the Puerto Rican Hernando Avilés they founded the Trio Los Panchos , in which he remained in the period 1944-1981. Third voice of the group, he is particularly remembered for his extreme mastery with the requinto, a small high register guitar, created by himself to reinforce the introductions and voiceless passages of the songs. Tuned a quarter higher than the normal guitar, it resembles a small guitar but with a sharper sound, very characteristic of the Los Panchos Trio. As a composer, many of his boleros are famous, such as Caminemos , Sin un amor, Hija de la mala vida, Basura, Tu ausencia, Solo, Cien mujeres, Me puniga Dios, No trates de mentir, Ni que sí, ni quizá ni que no, Un siglo de ausencia, Ya es muy tarde, Loco, Mi último fracaso, No te vayas sin mí and Lodo also known as Si tu me dices ven , among many others.

It was established in 1963 under the direction of Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of PRC, and is one of the oldest foreign language schools in China.  History = Establishment and Early History  Starting from the mid 1950s, the Chinese Government recognized its shortage of diplomats with strong language potency. To address this issue, a number of foreign language schools were established in major cities of China under the direction of Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, aiming to cultivate the diplomatic talents in demand. One of these schools was the then Jiangsu Labor and Farmer Instant High School, which was renamed Nanjing Foreign Language School upon its re-establishment in 1963. The instant high school, which had served as a pre-college training school for cadres, had better faculties and facilities than other secondary schools in Nanjing, paving a good foundation for the development of Nanjing Foreign Language School. There were students of three different grades in the school's first Class: the 3rd grade, selected from various elementary schools in Nanjing; the 7th grade, admitted from current year graduates; and the 10th grade, who had already studied German and French in the No.11 Middle School. The school was established as a boarding school, which was rare among Chinese elementary and secondary schools, in order to foster a better environment for language learning. The campus was originally a Japanese military camp during the Second Sino-Japanese War, with three quadrangles for soldiers, a western-style mansion for officers, and a training ground. Dormitories, a three-story teaching building, and a ceremony hall were added during the instant high school period. In 1965, a new main teaching building was constructed, which was called \\"The Car Building\\" by students and faculties due to its shape resembling a truck.  Development  Despite its advantages over other high schools in facilities and support, the school's early development was largely restrained by economic and educational limitations in China. Teaching buildings with modern teaching facilities were not available, and \\"non-built- up\\" areas, such as woods, pond, river, and agricultural lands, were still part of the campus. However, NFLS managed to maintain an advanced education philosophy that focused more on \\"quality-oriented education\\", especially regarding foreign language education.  School Structure  Nanjing Foreign Language School consists of a three- year middle school and a three-year high school offering the National Curriculum. In addition to the National Curriculum, NFLS also offers three international programs, including the International Baccalaureate, GCE A-Level, and BCA program. The current principal is Zou Zheng. As of 2019, NFLS has established several branch schools in Nanjing and around Jiangsu Province: * NFLS Xianlin Campus, established in 2002 in collaboration with Nanjing Government, twelve-year private boarding school; * NFLS Hexi Campus, established in June 2012, three-year public middle school; * Nanjing Pukou Foreign Language School, established in August 2012, nine-year public school; * NFLS Fangshan Campus, established in 2018, twelve-year private school; * NFLS Huai'an campus; operational from 2018-2019 onward with classes from the preschool to high school levels. A new campus at Daxiaochang in the city south is currently under construction, and is scheduled to complete in 2022. Nanjing Foreign Language School has provided A-Level courses since 2006. It also has a program working with most of the 20 top universities in Australia and another program with some top 20 universities in Canada. Now NFLSers are studying or living in over 30 countries.  Admissions  Widely recognized as one of the best middle/high schools in Nanjing, admission to NFLS is highly selective.  Junior School admissions  Elementary graduates apply to Nanjing Foreign Language School by taking an interview. Application for interview is available for all elementary graduates in Nanjing, who are also free to choose the language for admission (this determines not the language of the interview, but rather the language studied in the foreign language curriculum afterwards), including English, French, German, and Japanese. The total enrollment number is usually 380, and the number of students qualified for interview is 8 times the enrollment number, around 3,200. An open computer allocation carried out by the Student Recruitment Committee office of Nanjing will be needed if the number of students applying for interview exceeds the expected qualification number. The eligible applicants then take a school-organized interview on English capabilities to determine the final qualification. Contents of the interview are officially declared to be restricted within course contents of standard elementary school textbooks. Various subjects, in fact, are tested, notably English language and Mathematics. Detailed test questions in the interview are not officially open to public. The final qualification is based on results of the interview, each language with a specific admission line. The enrollment number of students who choose English is approximately 330 and varies among different years, while admissions for each \\"minor\\" languages usually do not exceed 20. Before 1998, the school admission process involved two rounds of competition each year. In the first round, pupils compete within their resident districts of the city, and then about 1000 of them in total were selected for the next round. The chosen applicants were required to take an entrance exam to test their verbal and math skills. Only 200 top candidates could be admitted. From 1998 to 2002, the first round of competition was abolished, because it was considered to be unfair for students in different city districts. Therefore, pupils who were going to graduate could freely sign up for the entrance exam. The response was overwhelming with thousands of pupils eagerly joining the competition each year. In 2002, the number of applicants was more than 10,000. Around 150 students was selected for admission with full financial aid, with another 150 selected for partial aid or self-sponsored enrollment. Recruitment of top students in such a large scale for a high school was unprecedented in Nanjing, and residents in Nanjing gradually formed a habit of judging the quality of an elementary school by looking at how many of its students could be admitted to NFLS, which sparked a high degree of controversy. For a long time, elementary school teachers and some parents were being criticized for placing too much pressure on students, and the fierce competition for entering NFLS obviously made the situation worse. Furthermore, other top high schools contending for talented students complained about NFLS's unfair practice and accused the city's education council for being partial to NFLS. In order to relive pupils' burden of taking exams, some people suggested that the number of students allowed to take the entrance exams of NFLS should be strictly limited, and each elementary school should recommend several students who had good performance not only in exams but also in extracurricular activities. However, this idea was considered to be unrealistic, because the selection criteria were too vague and impractical, and might easily cause unfairness for schools and individual pupils. In 2003, an even more controversial admission policy was carried out. Since 2003, the school is still allowed for citywide recruitment, but with an additional preliminary random allocation procedure executed by a computer. For instance, assume for year 2009 the number of applicants is 4,000 and the number of planned admits is 300, then only 300*8=2400 applicants are actually allowed to proceed to take the entrance exam, always multiplied by a factor of 8. The 2,400 candidates would be randomly selected among the 4,000 applicants by a computer algorithm, with high degree of public supervision. This new policy destroyed the decision power of exams, and allowed more room for other schools to select good students, but aroused serious arguments concerning the fairness for individual students.南京\\"小升初\\"电脑派位结束 南外摇出2240人  Senior School admissions  For students from junior high school of NFLS, enrollment qualifications are determined by a combination of standard High School Admission Examination(Zhongkao) in Nanjing and a school-held language examination. Students' combined scores of the two examinations are ranked, and the top 320 students are qualified for high school enrollment. Admissions from other junior high schools to NFLS has two options: # Applicants take another language test different from that for on-campus students, whose score, combined with the Zhongkao score, are used to determine qualification. # Applicants participate in a school-organized test on STEM capabilities. Only very limited number of students are admitted in this way in different subjects. This option is also shared with students from NFLS junior school. Before 2003, the senior high school of NFLS only enrolled students from its own middle school, with a small number of elimination. Since 2003, students from other middle schools can also apply and compete for the entrance to NFLS, by taking the city's public exams and an additional English language test.  Facilities  The school's library includes a main library and foreign language reading rooms. There is a laboratory for experiments and curriculum in STEM elective courses, including a UV spectroscope, IR spectroscope, TGA, HPLC, HP-MS, and an elemental analyzer. Engineering workshops are available to students taking selective courses or upon request, equipped with roboting facilities and 3D printers. The School Stadium has facilities for sports, including table tennis, indoor basketball, gym, badminton field, volleyball and others.  Academics  Nanjing Foreign Language School employs the standard education system of Jiangsu Province in disciplines other than foreign languages. Students may select one from English, German, French and Japanese as their major language as early as their applications for admission. Comparing to the other languages, English is the major choice, consisting approximately 330 students in a grade. Enrollments of minor languages are controlled to be around 20 students for each language, and the admission score line in the interview vary correspondingly, as mentioned above. Comparing with other middle schools, numbers of language lessons rise to 10 classes per week, including one class given by foreign teachers for almost every grade. Language courses in NFLS are smaller in class size than other courses, with only 20-30 students; small-size classrooms are also specially designed for such class model. For English courses, junior high school students use special textbooks instead of standard textbooks in China, while students in senior high school use New Concept English 3. NFLS is reputed as a highly competitive school, at least in Nanjing. As of 2019, all 19 students taking Gaokao attained scores above the first standard score; Average score in Zhongkao was 620 out of 700. Various selective courses are available for all students. Topics range from liberal arts to STEM, from sporting to lectures, and from Olympiad training to cartoon design. Students are recommended to take 1-2 selective courses, but not as a compulsory. Some courses are certified international course programs, such as FHAO courses; others are generally school-based courses, such as STEM courses, debate, and MUN.  Olympiads  NFLS has strong coaching resources in various fields, notably Mathematics, Physics, and CS, which contributed to a considerable number of students excelling in STEM competitions. By far, students from NFLS has won 9 gold medals in international STEM Olympiads (IPhO 1996, 2012, IChO 2008, IOI 2005, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2013, 2019). In year 2019 alone, 6 students have been selected into national Olympiad teams (IOI 1, IYPT 2, ISIJ 1, ILO 2).  Student Life  Students in NFLS are involved in numerous extracurricular activities. With both rich school-based resources and competitive community, NFLS students excel in activities of various fields, whether liberal arts or STEM.  Liberal Arts  NFLS has a long tradition in prestigious liberal arts competitions, such as MUN and debate. Organized as elective courses and student clubs, students benefit greatly from a competitive, helpful environment.  Student Government  The annual student union election, which takes place every September, is one of the major student events of NFLS main campus. Student of all grades on campus are eligible for votes, while only Grade 10 and 11 students are eligible running for positions. Candidates run for various positions in groups of two, starting their preparation during summer vacations. In early September, a group of random students are selected for voting administrations. For the whole 3rd week of September, the candidates and their supporting groups can rally for their campaigns with finely-designed posters, slogans, tours around the campus, speeches, and various other activities, before classes begin and during lunchbreaks. Special activities and contests are designed for specific positions, including: * Debate for Student Union Chairmen, during the 4th week's morning meeting of September; candidates running for chairmen pose critical questions on their rivals' proposed policies; * Tour of Daxinggong Campus on Friday, 3rd week, in which candidates for Chairmen visit Junior 3 students on Daxinggong Campus to rally for their supports; * Poster contest for Minister of Publicity, with themes varying from year to year; * Talent show for Minister of Arts. Besides on-campus promotion, each candidate also create a short video introducing themselves and promoting their campaigns. As a noticeable trend, the candidates are investing more into the video part, hoping to give greater visual impressions on voters. A series of pre-recorded final speech are broadcast to the whole school on Monday, 4th week of September, in which each candidate restates their proposals and policies; the students then vote for the candidates they support. The results are released shortly after. One group of candidate will win for each position, and if the winner if from Grade 11 instead of 10, an additional group of Chairman/Minister Assistant will also be selected. The Student Union generally plays a supportive role in school administration to the authorities, such as managing regular student disciplinary records, organizing campus activities, and delivering certain information from the school authorities, while efforts have been proposed to expand power of the student government, with little progress. Terms of service for each position is one year, and students are eligible to run for a different position the next year. Students of each grade vote for their own Heads and Ministers in the subsequent month, yet on a much smaller scale. Students in IB, A-Level, and BCA Curriculum organize their own student governments and elections, with similar processes.  Festivals  Various festivals organized by the school are available for students during many times of the year. Notable festivals include: * The Art Festival, usually during the last 2 weeks of December. Each class rehearses and presents a drama or music play for the grade show, and upon teacher and student ratings, tops classes have the chance to perform in the school performance. The rankings of grade performances are always subjected to great controversies and argumanets. Special offers are given to school organizations, such as the school chorus. Other activities include singing contest, instrumental contest, calligraphy contest, and exhibitions. * The New Year Party, held on the last day of school before January 1. Classes are dismissed in the afternoon, and students prepare shows and games for classmates to enjoy. Food delivery services to campus are specially allowed. In the evening, a magnificent party is held on the playground, with bonfires or colored lights lit. Students, musical bands, and clubs prepare songs, instrument live shows, dances, and various other activities for students to enjoy and participate (such as bonny dancing and treasure hunt). Activities usually last till 7 o'clock. * The Foreign Language Festival, taking place on late March. Similar to the Art Festival, students present dramas or musical plays in groups of classes, competing for tickets into school performance. Special offers are given to plays from minor language classes. The magnificant final school performances are normally held in People's Auditorium on Changjiang Rd. On the morning assembly of the first week of the festival, a speech delivered by the school principal will be translated into four languages. English Corner is held on the first Monday of the festival, in which students prepare cultural exhibitions in groups of classes on the playground; students winning \\"credits\\" from a certain amount of classes receive special gifts. Other activities include spelling contests. * Reading Festival, in April or May. Students write reviews for books in foreign languages, and selected essays are edited into pamphlets. Students also make bookmarks for exchange. Other activities include speech contest. Apart from these, various other activities are also available, such as Science Week, May 4 debate, Month of Charity.  School Clubs and Societies  NFLS students have the tradition of establishing and running diverse, successful student clubs and societies. Clubs are generally highly-professional, and some even cooperate with the school in activities, such as the American Debate club. Annual recruitment for all clubs, including newly-founded ones, is in October. Students can join in as many clubs as they like, but 2 or 3 clubs are recommended. Clubs organize numerous events at almost all times of a semester, and an annual grand exhibition is held in late May in which clubs are free to exhibit their achievements. The clubs are then graded by a special committee from 2 to 5 stars; clubs with 3 stars or more are permitted to continue their activities in the next semester, and are encouraged to demonstrate their activities in a club yearbook published by school. Clubs activities are generally open to Senior school students, yet Juniors can form special clubs of their own, and can participate in club activities without joining as members. Notable clubs include, but are not limited to, Chemistry and Life club, Chinese Culture club, Dance club, Philosophy society, and Transportation Club. = Music = Days on the Beijing East Road () is a pop music song and video—Dedicated to Nanjing Foreign Language School.

Also Devotees throng this temple to appease the goddess for the fulfillment of their desires. On fulfillment of their wish, the Goddess is offered with the blood of a goat which is poured into a small hole (kund) of 6 inch in diameter. It is said that the kund would not get filled up even if thousands of goat's blood is poured into it, in which blood goat in honour of devi is given, a fact is that it never overflows.

Weir was born in Wingham, Ontario, and was a teacher by training. After working in Ontario he moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, where he taught, worked as an actuary, public school inspector, farmer and horse, cattle and hog breeder. He fought in World War I and was wounded at the Third Battle of Ypres. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1930 federal election becoming the Conservative MP for Melfort, Saskatchewan. He was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture under Richard Bennett at a time when farmers were faced with the drought known as the \\"Dust Bowl\\" as well as the general crisis of the Great Depression which caused wheat prices to collapse from $1.28 to 60 cents a bushel within three years. Under Weir's tenure, agricultural researchers attempted to teach farmers how to prevent soil drifting that caused the Dust Bowl and initiated a major grasshopper control campaign in 1933 that reduced crop losses. The National Products Marketing Act, which attempted to establish a national marketing board was declared unconstitutional in 1934 for exceeding the federal government's jurisdiction. Weir's Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration Act passed in April 1935. The law provided money to farmers to encourage them to improve their farming practices, conserve water supplies and adopt new land use practices. He also reformed and expanded scientific research by the Department of Agriculture in conjunction with the National Research Council.

It passes through the heart of Boston's MetroWest region, through towns on the eastern edge of Worcester County and western edge of Middlesex County, crossing the border between the two counties four times. Throughout its entire distance, Route 85 runs parallel to I-495, never passing more than two miles from it. Route description Route 85 begins in the town of Milford at Route 16, just west of the downtown area. It passes east of Milford Pond before meeting I-495 at Exit 20. From there, Route 85 heads northward into Hopkinton, passing the eastern side of Echo Lake. It intersects Route 135 at the center of town, less than a quarter mile west of the start line of the Boston Marathon. It then passes through Hopkinton State Forest and past the Hopkinton Reservoir before entering the town of Southborough. Southbound in Hopkinton In Southborough, Route 85 crosses under I-90 (the Mass Pike) without junction; the nearest exit is in neighboring Framingham. It then meets Route 9, the second of the four major east-west routes out of Boston, in an elevated four- way cloverleaf intersection. It then crosses the Sudbury Reservoir before meeting Route 30 at the center of town. From there, Route 85 continues northward into Marlborough, meeting U.S. Route 20 in the downtown area. It then crosses the far western edge of the Fort Meadow Reservoir before crossing into Hudson. Shortly after entering Hudson, Route 85 meets Hudson Street, the super two connector road between Route 85 and the junction of I-290 and I-495 at I-495's Exit 25 and I-290's terminus, Exit 26. From there Route 85 heads north, crossing the Assabet River before meeting Route 62, passing concurrently with that route through Wood Square before Route 85 continues northward. After passing into Bolton, the route passes between Little Pond and West Pond before ending at Route 117, less than a half mile east of I-495's exit 27.  Route 85 Connector  MA 85 Connector is a road that goes from the eastern terminus of Interstate 290 (I-290) to a wye with MA 85, away in Marlborough. Future=Improvements to Route 85 in Hudson In 2011 a $10.8 million project to reconstruct 7,700 feet (1.5 miles) from School Street/Park Street to the Marlborough City Line will begin. The project will consist of travel lanes and bike shoulders with concrete sidewalks throughout the project corridor. The Walmart Driveway will be reconstructed with bicycle accommodation, ADA compliance, and a new traffic signal. At the intersection of the Route 85 Connector and Technology Drive, the intersection will be reconstructed. A new northbound left turn lane will be constructed, new through lane constructed on Technology Drive, new through lane on Route 85 Connector and a new wire traffic signal. The section between Route 85 Connector and Broad Street will consist of four lanes (two in each direction) with a raised concrete median. At the intersection of Broad Street, the existing signal will be replaced with a two-lane roundabout. The roadway will be widened to four lanes (two in each direction)from Houghton Street to Broad Street. A new traffic signal will be installed at R.K Town Centre Drive with a new turn lane. A new traffic signal will be installed at Giasson Street. A new northbound left turn lane with a new traffic signal will be installed at Brigham Street. From Brigham Street to Park Street, the roadway will be cold planed and resurfaced with drainage, curbing, sidewalks and driveways included. At Park Street/School Street, a new traffic signal will be installed and a new southbound right turn lane will be constructed. Hudson Route 85 Bridge Beginning in 2013, MassDOT will replace the existing structurally deficient arch bridge with a new bridge. The estimated cost is $7 million. The project is funded as part of the Accelerated Bridge Program and will use an innovative construction. The new bridge will consist of new concrete reinforced abutments and a new concrete NEXT beam superstructure.

The \\"twins\\" at El Azuzul. A photo of the sculptures in situ, as they were discovered, with the \\"twins\\" facing off against the jaguar. The sculptures have since been moved to Xalapa. El Azuzul is an Olmec archaeological site in Veracruz, Mexico, a few kilometers south of the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán complex and generally considered contemporary with it (perhaps 1100 to 800 BCE). Named for the ranch on which it is located, El Azuzul is part of the Loma del Zapote complex. The site occupies the higher elevations north of the confluence of two ancient river courses, a part of the Coatzacoalcos River system. It is upstream of the monumental earthworks at Potrero Nuevo, which is part of the San Lorenzo complex. Monumental art El Azuzul is best known for two pairs of monumental sculptures, now on exhibit at the Museo de Antropologia, Xalapa, Mexico. These statues were found on the south side of the large pyramid/hill on the site, intact and apparently undisturbed since they were placed there in Pre-Classic times. The first pair of statues, described as \\"some of the greatest masterpieces of Olmec art\\",Pool, p. 118. are nearly identical seated human figures. When discovered the two statues were facing east, one behind the other (see bottom photo). Some researchers have suggested that these \\"twins\\" are forerunners of the Maya Hero Twins from the Popul Vuh,\\"The physical arrangement and characteristics of human figures and felines bear uncanny symbolic resemblances to later period myths from the Maya and Central Mexican cultures about twins and jaguars.\\" Cyphers (1999), p. 174 although their headdresses have led others to describe them as priests. For example, in a caption describing a jaguar figurine that was found together with these two statues, Southampton and UCL archaeology professor Nicholas Saunders describes the statues as \\"...dos piezas que representan a gobernantes o sacerdotes olmecas\\" [\\"two pieces that represent Olmec governors or priests\\"]; quote from Saunders 2005, p.22. The twin's headdresses have been mutilated, probably to erase identifying insignia.Cyphers (1999), p. 19. Each twin, like the figure in San Martín Pajapan Monument 1, is grasping a ceremonial bar with his right hand under the bar and his left over, caught in the act of raising what has been described as an axis mundi or Mesoamerican world tree.Pool, p. 143. Cyphers refers to a sense of \\"imminent movement\\", p. 19. Facing these two humans was a feline-like statue, generally identified as a jaguar. Slightly larger than the humans it faced, the feline is roughly 1.2 meters high. A 1.6 meter version of this feline was found a few meters away, to the northeast. The jaguars show evidence of having been recarved from earlier monuments.Pool, p. 121; Cyphers (1999). The humans are similar to other Olmec sculpture, in particular San Martin Pajapan Monument 1, where a young lord also attempts to lift a ceremonial bar. Despite its \\"tantalizing hints of [a] lost mythic cycle\\",Joralemon (1996), p. 59. it is not known with any clarity what this four statue tableau illustrates. Structures In addition to the large pyramid/hill, a long causeway or dike was constructed along the waterway, possibly functioning as a levee and/or wharf.Pool, p. 102 El Azuzul also contains other possible structures, now completely overgrown.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Braves, Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals, St. Louis Cardinals, and Chicago White Sox. A noted practical joker, Drabowsky engaged in such antics as leaving snakes in teammates' lockers or phoning the opposing team's bullpen to tell a pitcher to warm up. He batted and threw right-handed. Born in Poland to a Jewish family, Drabowsky emigrated to America in 1938. He excelled as a pitcher in high school and college and was signed as a bonus baby by the Chicago Cubs. He debuted for the Cubs in 1956 and finished tied for second in the National League in strikeouts in his rookie season. In 1958, he gave up Stan Musial's 3,000th hit. An arm injury that year curtailed his effectiveness, and after a couple more seasons with the team, he was traded to the Milwaukee Braves. He played for the Braves, the Cincinnati Reds, and the Kansas City Athletics in 1961 and 1962 before remaining with the Athletics through the end of the 1965 season. During this period, he was sent to the minor leagues a few times, and while in the major leagues, he typically went back and forth between the starting rotation and the bullpen, except in 1963, the year he had his lowest earned run average (ERA) as a starter. Drabowsky also was the losing pitcher to Early Wynn in Wynn's 300th win that season. Following the 1965 season, he was selected in the Rule 5 Draft by the Baltimore Orioles. Once in Baltimore, Drabowsky was used almost exclusively as a relief pitcher. After three starts in 1966, he would pitch only in relief the rest of his career. He became a part of one of the best bullpens in the major leagues and posted ERAs of 2.80, 1.60, and 1.91 during his first three years with the club. The Orioles won the American League (AL) pennant in 1966, and in Game 1 of the World Series, Drabowsky relieved an innefective Dave McNally with the bases loaded and one out in the third inning. Though he walked a batter to let in a run, he finished the inning with the Orioles leading 4–2, and he threw six scoreless innings after it to preserve the Game 1 victory. The Orioles would sweep the Los Angeles Dodgers in four games, making Drabowsky a World Series champion for the first time. Drabowsky was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the expansion draft after the 1968 season. He won their first game in franchise history and led the AL in wins for relief pitchers, with 11. In 1970, he was traded back to Baltimore, where he won his second World Series, this one against the Reds. He pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1971 and 1972 before finishing out his career with the Chicago White Sox that year. After his career, Drabowsky worked for an envelope company and a communications firm until the 1980s, when increased salaries for coaches allowed him to support himself in baseball. He was the pitching coach for the White Sox in 1986, then for several of their minor league teams. Later, he served as the pitching coach for the Cubs in 1994, before rejoining the Orioles as their minor league pitching instructor in Florida. He died June 10, 2006, at the age of 70. Early life Moe was born Miroslav Drabowski in Ozanna, a village in southern Poland, located near Leżajsk, and was Jewish. His mother was an American citizen. The two fled to the U.S. in 1938 when Adolf Hitler began mobilizing in Eastern Europe. His father joined them a year later, and the family settled in Wilson, Connecticut, a village in the town of Windsor, just north of Hartford. Growing up in Connecticut, Drabowsky was an avid Boston Red Sox fan. His favorite player was Bobby Doerr, and he wanted to be a second baseman too, but he was converted to a pitcher by his prep school coach, who observed he had a good arm. Drabowsky went to the Loomis Prep School, now Loomis Chaffee School, in Windsor where he had an 8–0 record with a no-hitter his senior year. He later attended Trinity College in Hartford, where he studied economics. He had an academic scholarship to study at the school until he started partying too much in a fraternity. While at Trinity, he studied economics and played for their varsity baseball team, with whom he also threw a no-hitter. He played summers in Canada, in the Halifax and District League, for the Truro Bearcats. While with Truro, he caught the eye of former Chicago Cubs shortstop Lenny Merullo in 1956, who signed him to play for the Cubs that year. Sources differ on the exact amount of the contract, but Drabowsky himself said it was for $75,000 ($ today). This made Drabowsky a bonus baby, meaning the Cubs would have to keep him in the major leagues for two full seasons or expose him to waivers. Baseball career=Chicago Cubs (1956–60) Drabowsky made his major league debut on August 7, 1956, having just turned 21. He pitched a scoreless inning of relief in a 6–1 loss to the Milwaukee Braves. Eleven days later, pitching coach Dutch Leonard asked Drabowsky, \\"How would you like to do some throwing tonight?” \\"I'd like it,\\" Drabowsky responded. “Then you’re starting against the Cardinals tonight.” Pitching into the eighth inning, Drabowsky held the St. Louis Cardinals to one run, picking up his first major league victory. He continued to make starts for the Cubs the rest of the year and finished the season with a 2–4 record, a 2.47 earned run average (ERA), and 36 strikeouts in 51 innings pitched. In 1957, Drabowsky was the Cubs' number two starter. He was 4–8 with a 5.04 ERA through July 4; after that, he went 9–7 the rest of the way, with a 2.51 ERA. Control problems affected him during the year, such as in a game against the Cincinnati Redlegs on June 2, when he hit four batters (including future teammate and Hall of Famer Frank Robinson twice) in innings, tying a major league record. On August 4, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Drabowsky threw a shutout in a 6–0 victory. He threw another shutout against Cincinnati on September 4, also in the first game of a doubleheader, giving up just two hits this time in a 1–0 victory. Drabowsky finished the year with a 13–15 record. His 170 strikeouts tied him for second in the National League with teammate Dick Drott, behind another rookie, Jack Sanford of the Philadelphia Phillies, who had 188. His 33 games started were 4th (tied with Lew Burdette and Sanford), 239 innings pitched 6th, and 12 complete games 8th in the NL (tied with Brooks Lawrence and Don Newcombe). Additionally, he led the league with ten hit by pitches. In 1958, Drabowsky did not appear in a game with the Cubs until May 1, delayed by a throat ailment and a stint in the United States Army Reserve. In his second start of the year, on May 13, he threw a curveball in the sixth inning of a start against the Cardinals which pinch-hitter Stan Musial made contact with for a double. The hit was Musial's 3,000th. Entering July 11, Drabowsky had an 8–7 record and a 3.80 ERA. In a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates held that day, though, Drabowsky \\"heard something snap in [his] elbow.\\" He gave up five runs in the next inning, skipped his next start, and failed to get out of the first inning in his next before having to take time off. \\"The arm responded to treatment at first,” said Drabowsky, “then I had trouble again. I strained my shoulder favoring the elbow. One thing led to another.\\" He returned for four starts in August but struggled and was shut down for the rest of the year. At season's end, Drabowsky had posted a 9–11 record with a 4.51 ERA and 77 strikeouts. He gave up 19 home runs, three shy of the previous year's total, despite pitching 114 fewer innings. Drabowsky kept his spot in the Cubs' rotation in 1959 but saw little improvement from the year before. His best game of the year came on August 7, when he threw a five-hit shutout against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Drabowsky finished the season 5–10 in 31 games (23 starts), but his ERA dropped to 4.13, and his innings pitched rose to . However, he had seven fewer strikeouts than he had in 1958. In 1960 spring training, Drabowsky's arm was pain-free. However, used mostly in relief, he posted a 9.70 ERA through July 4. This got him a demotion to the minor leagues for the first time, as he was sent to the Triple-A Houston Buffs of the American Association. At Houston, Drabowsky won all five of his starts and had a 0.90 ERA before getting recalled to the Cubs in August. He pitched better for the Cubs in his return, posting a 4.03 ERA in his final 11 games. In 32 games (seven starts), Drabowsky had a 3–1 record, a 6.44 ERA, and 26 strikeouts in innings pitched. Milwaukee Braves (1961), Cincinnati Reds (1962), and Kansas City Athletics (1962–65) At the end of spring training in 1961, the Cubs decided no longer required Drabowsky and traded him along with Seth Morehead to the Milwaukee Braves for Daryl Robertson and Andre Rodgers. Milwaukee did not have room for him in their rotation, though, and used him exclusively in relief, where he had an 0–2 record and a 4.62 ERA in 16 games. After Drabowsky gave up four runs in the sixth inning of a 10–8 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on June 8, Milwaukee banished him to the minor leagues and never bothered to call him up again the rest of the season. He finished the year pitching for the Louisville Colonels of the American Association, where in 20 games (nine starts), he had a 9–6 record but a 4.75 ERA, with 54 strikeouts in 106 innings pitched. Milwaukee left him unprotected from the Rule 5 draft after the season, and he was selected by Cincinnati. He started 1962 with the Reds, who used him both as a starter and a reliever. In 23 games for them (10 starts) through August 4, he went 2–6 for them with a 4.99 ERA. On August 13, the Kansas City Athletics acquired him for cash. He appeared in 10 games (three starts) for Kansas City the rest of the year, going 1–1 with a 5.14 ERA. Drabowsky's combined stats on the season were a 3–7 record, a 5.03 ERA, and 75 strikeouts in 33 games (13 starts). Kansas City sent Drabowsky to the Triple-A Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League to start the 1963 season; most of his appearances were in relief (19 games, 2 starts) but after going 5–1 with a 2.13 ERA, he got called up to the major league club in June. Back in the majors, he was used as a starter once again. He lost his first six decisions, then went 7–7 the rest of the year to finish 1963 with a 7–13 record. One of the losses from the losing streak was notable; it was the 300th win for Early Wynn, on July 13. Despite the losing numbers, he had a very good 3.05 ERA and topped one hundred strikeouts for the first time since his rookie year, making the 1963 season a resurgence. Drabowsky's 1964 season got off to a good start, as he pitched into the eighth inning in his first start and gave up just one run in a 3–1 victory over the Washington Senators. After that, he would lose seven decisions in a row before getting another win on June 8 (again against the Senators). He pitched out of the bullpen for a few games in June; by the end of July, he was being used almost exclusively as a reliever. Drabowsky appeared in the most games of his career that season (53), starting 21 times and logging innings. He struck out 119, the most since his rookie season. However, his record was 5–13, and his ERA was 5.29, a jump from the 3.05 mark the year before. Despite the losing record and the high ERA the year before, Drabowsky was Kansas City's Opening Day starter in 1965. He went 0–3 with a 5.55 ERA in his first five starts before getting sent to the bullpen, then demoted to the Athletics' Triple-A affiliate, now the Vancouver Mounties, halfway through June. Drabowsky was not called back up, finishing the season in Vancouver. In 14 games (five starts) with Kansas City, he had a 1–5 record and a 4.42 ERA. In 17 games (12 starts) with Vancouver, he had an 8–2 record with a 2.44 ERA and 85 strikeouts in 96 innings—his time in Vancouver would be the last time he ever pitching in the minor leagues. After the 1965 season, Baseball-Reference reports that the St. Louis Cardinals purchased his contract from Kansas City on an unknown date. The Society for American Baseball Research reports merely that the Cardinals were interested in selecting him in the Rule 5 Draft from Kansas City but ultimately never got a chance to select him. Either way, he would not pitch for the Cardinals in 1966, as the Baltimore Orioles took him in the Rule 5 Draft on November 29, 1965. Baltimore Orioles (1966–68) The trade to Baltimore was a turning point in Drabowsky's career. It was here that he became a full-time relief pitcher; after making three starts for the Orioles in August 1966, Drabowsky would never start a game again over his final six years in the major leagues. With teammates Stu Miller, Dick Hall, and Eddie Fisher, Drabowsky was a part of one of the best bullpens of the 1960s. Though Drabowsky was part of the Orioles' roster to begin the 1966 season, he was only used nine times in the team's first 37 games, and he had a 3.94 ERA. At the end of May, he asked pitching coach Harry Breechen if he could throw once every two nights. Pitching more frequently from that time forth, Drabowsky's ERA fell to 2.59 over his final 35 games. Bullpen coach Sherm Lollar speculated joining the Orioles gave Drabowsky new confidence. \\"We were a contender and could support his pitching.\\" Drabowsky finished the year with six wins, no losses, a 2.81 ERA, and seven saves. He struck out 96 in 98 innings pitched as the Orioles won the American League (AL) pennant, sending Drabowsky to the playoffs for the first time in his career. In the opening game of the 1966 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Drabowsky entered the game in the third inning with one out and the bases loaded after starter Dave McNally was taken out of the game. After striking out the first batter, he walked Jim Gilliam to force in Lou Johnson for a run to cut Baltimore's lead to 4–2. That would be the last run the Dodgers scored in the entire series, however, as the Orioles would sweep the them 4–0, the Orioles' next three wins coming on shutouts from Jim Palmer, Wally Bunker, and McNally. Drabowsky set a one-game World Series record for relievers by striking out 11 batters, and he tied Hod Eller's 47-year record of six consecutive fans in the 1919 World Series. Over the next two seasons, Drabowsky continued to perform excellently in relief. In 1967, he was one of the few Oriole pitchers to repeat his success from the season before. Struggles by Stu Miller, who had gotten most of the Oriole saves a year before, allowed Drabowsky to be the team's primary closer. Drabowsky got off to a 6–0 start, with a mere six earned runs allowed through his first 25 games of the year. Beginning with his first loss July 28, Drabowsky would finish out the year with a 1–5 record, and his ERA would rise to 3.45 in his final 18 games. Still, Drabowsky finished the year 7–6, with a 1.60 ERA. He struck out 96 in 95 innings pitched and was tied for seventh in the AL with 12 saves, the only season in his career that he finished in the Top 10 of a league in saves. Drabowsky did not allow a run in 1968 until his tenth game of the year. For the second year in a row, he posted an ERA under 2.00 (1.91). He threw innings in 45 games, and he had a 4–4 record with seven saves and 46 strikeouts. MLB added four clubs for the 1969 season, however, and Drabowsky was one of the few veterans selected by the Kansas City Royals in the expansion draft, ending his first stint with the Orioles. Later career Back in Kansas City, Drabowsky negotiated with his new club for a raise before signing his contract on February 28, 1969. He won the first-ever game in Royals' history, pitching a scoreless 12th on April 8 against the Minnesota Twins in a 4–3 victory. The win was the first of many for Drabowsky that season; he led all AL relief pitchers in 1969 with 11 victories. Additionally, he saved 11 games and finished 37 games (7th in the league). He threw 98 innings in 52 appearances and had a 2.94 ERA. Drabowsky started 1970 with the Royals again. He spent time in the hospital after an averse reaction to medication, presumably during a stretch in May where he had 12 days off. On June 15, he saw on the out-of- town scoreboard that the Orioles' pitchers had struggled late in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers and speculated that the team would be wanting some bullpen help. Sure enough, he was traded back to the Orioles that same day, for Bobby Floyd. \\"I always knew I'd come back to the Orioles someday,\\" he said. He made 21 appearances for the Orioles the rest of the season, finishing the year with a 5–4 record, a 3.52 ERA, and 59 strikeouts in 69 innings pitched in 45 games between Kansas City and Baltimore. The Orioles won the AL East, and Drabowsky was a part of their playoff roster. He did not make an appearance in the first-round sweep of the Twins but was used twice in the World Series against the Reds. In Game 2, he entered in the fifth and pitched innings, giving up a solo home run to Johnny Bench in the Orioles' 6–5 victory over the Reds. He threw a scoreless ninth inning in Game 4, but the Orioles lost that game 6–5. However, that was the Orioles only loss of the series, and Drabowsky won another World Series ring as the Orioles defeated the Reds in five games. Drabowsky was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Jerry DaVanon on November 30, 1970. He got into 51 games his first season with St. Louis, going 6–1 with a 3.43 ERA, eight saves, and 49 strikeouts in innings pitched. His ERA improved with the Cardinals during the next season; it was at 2.60 through his first 30 games when the club released him August 9. Signed days later by the Chicago White Sox, he became the 6th-oldest player in the American League. Drabowsky saw the end of his career coming in a game against the Boston Red Sox in August. \\"I threw a fastball [to Tommy Harper], and I watched that ball go to the plate, and I said, ‘When in the world is that ball going to get to the plate?’ I said, ‘Hey, my career is over.’” In 37 games, he had a 1–1 record, a 2.57 ERA, two saves, and 26 strikeouts in 35 innings. He lasted until the end of the year with Chicago, but following his release on October 6, Drabowsky would never pitch again. Career statistics and pitching style In 17 seasons Drabowsky won 88 games, lost 105, saved 55, struck out 1,162 and walked 702 in 1,641 innings pitched, posting a 3.71 ERA. He threw a fastball, curveball, and slider. When the Cubs first signed him, he was a hard-thrower, which helped him tie for second in the league in strikeouts as a rookie. Despite control issues, Drabowsky was supposed to be a future star for the team. However, his velocity went down after his arm injury in 1958. “I struggled for a few years after developing arm trouble,” summed up Drabowsky. “Then I made some delivery adjustments and became a pitcher instead of a thrower. I also became a student of the game, analyzing hitter’s strengths and weaknesses, and this is how I survived.” Later life and coaching Drabowsky in 1988 Following his career, Drabowsky initially worked in other fields. He had a job with the Garden City Envelope Company in Chicago through 1982, following which he worked with a Canadian-owned communications firm. Changing salaries for coaches enabled him to return to baseball in the mid-1980s, and he became the Chicago White Sox' pitching coach in 1986. He then coached White Sox farm teams for several years: the Double-A Birmingham Barons from 1987–88 and the Triple-A Vancouver Canadians from 1989 to 1991. Moving to the Cubs' organization in 1993, he served as the team's minor league pitching instructor for a year, then was the Cubs' pitching coach in 1994. After that, he served as the Orioles' minor league pitching instructor in Florida for over ten years, until his death in 2006. Practical joker Drabowsky was well known as a prankster whose jokes involved, among other things, being rolled to first base in a wheelchair after claiming to be hit on the foot by a pitch while with the Cubs. (Teammate Dick Drott obtained the wheelchair and pushed Drabowsky to first—and was ejected from the game.) Frequently, he would make prank phone calls with the bullpen phones. While on the road at Anaheim Stadium in California, he once ordered a takeout meal from a Chinese restaurant—in Hong Kong. The year after he left Kansas City, when Baltimore was playing the Athletics on May 27, he called Kansas City's bullpen and, imitating former manager Alvin Dark's voice, ordered Lew Krausse Jr. to warm up, then sit down again. Not until the third call did someone recognize his voice. \\"You should've seen them scramble, trying to get Lew Krausse warmed up in a hurry,\\" Drabowsky said. \\"It was really funny.\\" Once, he inserted three goldfish into the other team's water cooler. Snake pranks were a specialty of Drabowsky's; while he was with the Orioles, he cultivated relationships with a number of pet shops around Baltimore. The stores would loan him their snakes, and Drabowsky managed to scare such famous players as Brooks Robinson, Paul Blair, and Yogi Berra. During the 1969 World Series, a biplane flew over Memorial Stadium during Game 1 with a banner proclaiming, \\"Good Luck Birds: Beware of Moe.\\" For Game 2, he got the Baltimore Zoo to deliver a seven-foot black snake to the stadium. Though he was with the Orioles for their next World Series against the Reds, Drabowsky was more subdued in 1970: \\"When you're in the Series, you have to be careful because [pranks] might backfire.\\" However, this caution did not apparently apply to people off the field, as Drabowsky gave Commissioner Bowie Kuhn a hot foot during the Orioles' 1970 World Series celebration. \\"You never saw a shoe come off so fast in your life,\\" Drabowsky assessed the effectiveness of that prank. In 1971, sportswriter Hal Bock was twice the victim of a Drabowsky hot foot during a series in New York (NL President Chub Feeney responded with an official censure.) During the same year, Drabowsky also threw cherry bombs in Chief Noc-A-Homa's teepee on a road trip to Atlanta. After retiring, he continued his jokes during his coaching days. Once, he even got arrested for cruelty to animals; Drabowsky wondered if he had done something unacceptable until he was informed at the police station that it was a joke arranged by his players. In the Jim Bouton book \\"Ball Four\\", one of Drabowsky's teammates claimed that Drabowsky got sick on a team flight and \\"puked up a panty girdle.\\" \\"There is no bigger flake in organized baseball than Drabowsky,\\" Bouton said. Polish heritage Chicago columnist Mike Royko stated in his annual Cubs quiz, April 11, 1968, that Drabowsky \\"is still considered the best pitcher that Ozanna, Poland, ever produced.\\" In 1987, Drabowsky took a trip there with Hall of Famer Stan Musial to hold a baseball clinic in Kutno. Though Poland was his birthplace, he needed an interpreter to communicate with the players. \\"Talent in the raw, this is,\\" Drabowsky characterized the Polish ballplayers with his usual wry sense of humor. \\"Very raw. Very, very raw. Extremely raw.\\" He and Musial brought the participants baseball equipment donated by the MLB Commissioner's office, training the players on the fundamentals of the game. Drabowsky was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. Personal life In 1957 Drabowsky met his first wife, Elizabeth Johns, a flight attendant for United Airlines, while traveling with his teammates. They were married in 1958 and had two daughters: Myra Beth and Laura Anne. A baseball fan, Elizabeth once told a reporter that she had harbored a crush on Dodgers' star Gil Hodges since she was ten. Drabowsky's daughter Laura, an actress, went on to be in three TV shows, including Port Charles where she played the role of Brenda Madison. At some point, Moe and Elizabeth divorced, and Drabowsky got remarried to Rita in 1990. During his playing career, he worked as a stockbroker in the offseason. The Sporting News quipped that he came to the major leagues with The Sporting News in one hand and The Wall Street Journal in the other. Drabowsky died in Little Rock, Arkansas following a long battle with multiple myeloma at age 70 on June 10, 2006. First diagnosed with the disease in 2000 and given six months to live, he survived longer than expected, continuing to coach while undergoing stem cell treatments.

Program The games were formally closed by International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge calling them \\"magnificent\\" This again departed from former IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch's tradition of declaring each games \\"best ever\\" and continued Rogge's tradition of assigning each games their own identity in his comments. Medal ceremony During the closing ceremony, in the Olympic Stadium, medals were presented for Cross country skiing at the cross-country skiing men's 50 km free event, one of the last events held at the Games. In a new practice for Winter Olympics closing ceremonies, the medals for this long race were awarded during the ceremony similar to the way the medals for the men's marathon are awarded during the closing ceremonies of Summer Olympic Games. Giorgio Di Centa of Italy, the host nation, won the race and was presented with the gold medal. Eugeni Dementiev of Russia was awarded silver, with Austria's Mikhail Botvinov claiming the bronze. The medal presenter was former Olympian and current IOC member Manuela Di Centa, sister of the gold medalist. Carnevale The main theme, to coincide with Italy’s popular masked festival, was Carnevale. The show, directed by Daniele Finzi Pasca, who is known internationally for his theatre performances based on the circus world, included six of the original costumes from the film I clowns by Federico Fellini, on lease from the Italian national film museum. Life-sized Piedmontese tarot cards marching in drill formation signifying all the Luck, Fortune and Life of the Athletes performed to honor every individuals personal story in coming to Torino. The formal moments of the ceremony alternated with artistic moments inspired by the creativity of Viareggio Carnival artists, of travelling shows and of the typical Italian \\"feste in piazza\\". The original music was composed, arranged and orchestrated by Italian producer Michele Centonze in collaboration with Stefano Nanni, Giuseppe Gambino and Serenella Occhipinti (a.k.a. Sara 6). Fiat 500s and Vespas drove through the center of the stadium to symbolize the crowded streets of the center of the Italian cities. Wind machine A wind machine was shown with flying acrobats performing an aerial ballet. This was a vertical wind tunnel that blew the acrobats up into mid-air. The machine was custom-built by Aerodium Canada and Aerodium Latvia for use in the closing ceremony. It is very similar to machines used for indoor skydiving facilities. Parade of the athletes The athletes entered the arena without strict order, following a tradition started 50 years earlier at the 1956 Summer Games. They had reportedly been given light-up red clown noses to wear, but few athletes were seen wearing the noses. Intruders During the final speech by Valentino Castellani, chairman of the Torino Olympic Organizing Committee, a Spanish man ran onto the stage and attempted to speak into the microphone. He managed to shout \\"Passion lives in Torino\\", as well as rip off one of the two microphones on the podium, before security officials quickly wrestled him away. Castellani continued his speech with only a minor pause. The intruder's T-shirt was printed with the logo of GoldenPalace.com. A young Polish female streaker named Justine tried to perform a similar stunt, holding an Italian flag bearing the handwritten inscription \\"Mi consenta\\", and having a drawing by a Roman artist, Ettore Wallemberg III, on her skin, but security officials stopped her. Vancouver 2010 In accordance with the Olympic Charter which governs the Closing Ceremony, IOC President Jacques Rogge called on the youth of the world to assemble in Vancouver, in four years, for the next Winter Olympics. Canadian opera star Ben Heppner, himself born in British Columbia, the host province of the next Winter Olympics, sang O Canada to begin the Canadian segment of the ceremonies and mark the beginning of the countdown to the Vancouver Olympic Games in 2010. Heppner sang a version of O Canada which is presented in a combination of Canada's two official languages, English and French, which are also the official languages of the IOC. Then came the \\"Oslo Ceremony\\" (so called because the original Olympic flag, which was used for transfer of the Winter Games, was first used at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo), which is the transfer of the Olympic Flag from the mayor of Turin, Sergio Chiamparino, to Jacques Rogge, and then to the mayor of Vancouver, Sam Sullivan. The flag was kept in the Vancouver City Hall during the next four years. With music playing, Chiamparino ran up the steps to the stage, waved the flag the symbolic eight times, handed it to Rogge, who then handed it to Sullivan. Because Sullivan is a quadriplegic who uses a wheelchair and has limited use of his arms and hands, the flag was placed in a specially-designed flag holder on his chair. Sullivan then spun his chair back and forth eight times to make the flag wave in the air. The assembled crowd roared in approval and rose to their feet in response. This culminated this part of the program. The Olympic flag was next raised again at the next Summer Olympic games in Beijing; opening ceremony there took place on 8 August 2008. The show included a Vancouver-based specially-cast dance corps together with the latest concepts in boarding, skating and skiing. The Montreal-based members of the cast are multi-talented acrobatic performers drawn from Quebec’s acclaimed École nationale de cirque (National Circus School), and Les sept doigts de la main, energetically supported by the renowned Cirque du Soleil. In addition, Canadian singer Avril Lavigne performed her song, \\"Who Knows.\\" In Ottawa, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, himself from Calgary, the host city of the 1988 Winter Olympics, said in a statement that the Olympic flame had begun its journey to Vancouver. Exit of the Olympic Flag After the Olympic flag was lowered, Piccoli Cantori di Torino sung Va, pensiero while the flag was exiting the stadium. The Siege of Turin After Va, pensiero was sung, there was a segment featuring the Siege of Turin to commemorate the 300th anniversary. Musical finale Andrea Bocelli performed his song \\"Because We Believe (Ama Credi E Vai)\\" before the flame was extinguished; on stage with Andrea appeared 500 Italian brides in white carrying lighted lilies and formed \\"the Dove of Peace\\" formation choreographed by Doug Jack and symbolically \\"flew\\" across the stage as the flame took its final breath. An international collection of pop singers closed out the ceremonies as a fireworks display ensued, which was unusual because mostly artists that originate from the host country usually performs. After Canadian Avril Lavigne who had sung during the Vancouver segment, Italian Elisa, who had already sung at the closing ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics, performed the song \\"Luce (Tramonti a nord est)\\", and Puerto Rican Ricky Martin performed \\"I Don't Care\\" and \\"The Cup of Life\\". Anthems were performed by * Piccoli Cantori di Torino, Italian National Anthem * Seiji Ozawa and New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra, Greek National Anthem * Ben Heppner, Canadian National Anthem * Instrumental Version of Olympic Hymn Notable attendees Aside from celebrities participating in the ceremonies and members of the International Olympic Committee, the following notable people were in attendance: *Silvio Berlusconi, Prime Minister of Italy *Luca di Montezemolo, President and CEO of Ferrari and chairman of FIAT *Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden, with son, Prince Carl Philip *Albert II, Prince of Monaco *Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City *Mario Andretti, Italian-American race car driver *Andrea Casiraghi, older son of the heir to the throne of Monaco, Caroline, Princess of Hanover *Tarja Halonen, President of Finland *Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada with spouse Jean-Daniel Lafond and their daughter Marie-Éden. *Peter MacKay, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs *Gordon Campbell, Premier of British Columbia, the host province of the 2010 Winter Olympics Television broadcast In the United States, NBC broadcast the ceremony on tape delay, starting at 7:00 pm EST and PST/6:00 pm CST and MST, and it was one of the broadcasters that did not edit out the intruders interrupting the speeches.

She rose to prominence in the eighties as a member of the popular collective Južni Vetar. Today, Mirković is recognised as one the best- selling artists from the former Yugoslavia with close to 10 million sold records. Alongside her husband, she also founded a satellite music channel called DM SAT. Life and career =Early life Mirković was born on 18 January 1968, in Kasidol, a village near Požarevac, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, as the youngest of two children. As a child, she lived with her parents, her grandparents, and her sister, Dušica. A major musical influence in her youth was her grandfather, Dragutin, who played the accordion. At the age of five, she sang the Bosnian folk song \\"Djevojka sokolu zulum učinila\\". The story of a talented young singer in Kasidol quickly spread and got the attention of the heads of the record label \\"Diskos\\". They visited Mirković's parents at their house and suggested that she become a professional singer. Career Mirković's first two releases, Imam dečka nemirnog (1984) and Umiljato oko moje (1985), were solo albums. Her third release, Spasi me samoće (1986), was a collaborative album with the band Južni Vetar. The single of the same name was a major hit and brought Mirković and her band to the top of the Yugoslav music scene. She went on to record four more albums with Južni Vetar: Ruže cvetaju samo u pesmama (1987), Najlepši par (1988) with hit single \\"Milo moje, što te nema\\", Simpatija (1989) and Pomisli želju (1990). Throughout the late 1980s and in 1990, Dragana toured with Južni Vetar (Kemal Malovčić, Šemsa Suljaković, Sinan Sakić, Mile Kitić and Toshko Vasilov). Also in 1989, Dragana collaborated with pop band Zana with their pop hit \\"E, Moj Doktore (\\"Oh, Doctor!\\"). This song is often considered as one of the highlights of her career. Mirković's eighth studio album (and third solo project), Dobra devojka (1991), had two major hit singles: \\"Umreću zbog tebe\\" and \\"Dodaj gas\\". It was followed by Dolaze nam bolji dani (1992) with multiple hit songs: \\"Umirem majko\\", \\"Pitaju me u mom kraju\\", \\"Da, da, da\\", \\"O, da li znaš\\", \\"Dobro jutro, dobar dan\\", \\"Sedmi dan\\". That same year, she held eleven consequent concerts in Belgrade, with an audience of 50,000 people. Unlike many other Balkans singers, Mirković's career was not severely disrupted by the Yugoslav Wars. 1993 saw the release of Mirković's tenth studio album, Do poslednjeg daha, which featured the hit song of the same name, along with \\"Baš tebe volim ja\\". More hit songs were featured on her eleventh album, Nije tebi do mene (1994): \\"Crni leptir\\", \\"Čarolija\\", \\"Varala bih, varala\\" and \\"Opojni su zumbuli\\". She held a concert in Podgorica, Montenegro with 25,000 attendees. She made a stab at acting in 1994 in the comedy film Slatko Od Snova, which premiered on 4 December 1994. She sang in English for the film's soundtrack. In 1996, Mirković held a big concert in Skopje, Macedonia at the FC Vardar Stadium in front of 30,000 fans. During her 1995 tour, she was seen by over 200,000 people and two years earlier had been declared the third most popular personality of the former Yugoslavia. Mirković released four more albums in the 1990s: Plači Zemljo (1995) with hit singles \\"I u dobru i u zlu\\", \\"Vrati mi se ti\\", \\"Uzeo si moja jutra\\" and \\"Divlja devojka\\", Nema promene (1996), with singles \\"Dušu si mi opio\\", \\"To nije tvoja stvar\\" and \\"Oči pune tuge\\", Kojom gorom (1997) with songs like \\"Poslednje veče\\", \\"O na, na, na\\" and the title track. Her final release of the 1990s was U godini (1999), a collaborative album with Zlaja Band. After the release of her seventeenth studio album, Sama, with hit singles \\"Svatovi\\" and the title track, she went on a four-year hiatus. She returned with 2004's Trag u vremenu. The comeback album featured multiple hit singles including \\"Tamo gde je milo moje\\", \\"Prsten\\", \\"Zašto zoro svanjavaš\\" and \\"Preživeću\\". She then released two more albums: Luče moje (My Dear, 2006) with hit singles \\"Pečat na usnama\\", \\"Na kraju\\", \\"Luda kao ja\\", \\"Nepoželjna\\" and the title track, then Eksplozija (2008) with songs like \\"Laste\\", \\"Zemljo okreni se\\", \\"Ko je ta\\", and \\"Život moj\\". In the first half of 2011, she released three new songs and a remake of an old song of hers. The new songs, \\"Drugovi\\", \\"Srce moje\\" and \\"Jedini\\", all became hits in the ex- Yugoslav countries. The updated version of her 1991 song, \\"Umreću zbog tebe\\" was also well received. Those four songs, along with sixteen new ones are featured on her jubilee twentieth studio album, 20, released 5 December 2012. Mirković (middle) with her husband and friend, 29 January 2015. Personal life Dragana married an Austrian businessman of Bosnian Croat ethnicity, Toni Bijelić, in 1999. The couple has a son, Marko (born 2000), and a daughter, Manuela (born 2001). They reside in the Austrian capital Vienna. Other ventures On 17 September 2012, Mirković announced that she would hold a humanitarian concert in Zenica, Bosnia on 7 November in the Arena Zenica. The concert, called \\"Dragana and Friends for Zenica\\", also featured singers Hanka Paldum, Boban Rajović, Halid Muslimović, and the band Plavi orkestar. The concert raised around €26,500 (about $36,500 US dollars) for the People's Kitchen. The following month, Serbian tabloids claimed that \\"local politicians\\" in Zenica had taken €7,500 of the money to pay for renting out the arena, and another €11,500 for the sound system, leaving only about €7,500 of the money to charity. The tabloids claimed that the majority of the money went for the politicians' personal use. Also the during the concert, Mirković and Hanka Paldum first publicly sang their duet \\"Kad nas vide zagrljene\\" (When They See Us Embrace). The song officially premiered one year later on 26 November 2013, when the music video was released. The video shows Dragana in Belgrade singing about Serbia and Hanka in Sarajevo singing about Bosnia. Near the end of the video they meet on Stari Most in Mostar, embrace, and dance. Their video was featured prominently in Serbian and Bosnian media. On 19 December 2013, Mirković, along with Lepa Brena, Severina, Haris Džinović, Aca Lukas and Jelena Karleuša, was a guest at a humanitarian concert by Goran Bregović at the Olympic Hall Juan Antonio Samaranch in the Bosnian capital city Sarajevo for the Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The farmer turned samurai is known for his filial piety and incredible strength, and is viewed as an ideal samurai. Keyamura Rokusuke by Utagawa Kuniyoshi.  Plot  Written by Tsugano Kafū and Chikamtsu Yasuzō, the Hiko-san Gongen chikai no sukedachi was first performed as a ningyō jōruri play in 1786. It gained popularity and was adopted as a kabuki play in the next year. It was set in the Azuchi-Momoyama period, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi was about to reunify Japan: Yoshioka Ichimisai, a sword instructor to the Kōri (Mōri) clan, is killed with a sneak attack by Kyōgoku Takumi. His widow Okō and daughters Osono and Okiku swear revenge on him. However, Okiku is killed by Kyōgoku Takumi and her young son Yasamatsu disappears. Around the same time, Rokusuke goes into mourning for his late mother in a mountainous village named Keya (Keya-mura). He lives a quiet life in the countryside as a farmer although he is a skilled swordmaster. In fact he was a student of Yoshioka Ichimisai. His skill is so famous that the local ruler has proclaimed that anyone who defeats Rokusuke would be hired as a sword instructor. Rokusuke is visited by a rōnin who styles himself Mijin Danjō but is Kyōgoku Takumi in disguise. Holding an elderly woman on his back to raise sympathy, Mijin Danjō asks Rokusuke to help him become a swordmaster. Rokusuke accepts his request and deliberately loses a match. On his return, Rokusuke finds Yasamatsu without knowing that he is the grandson of his late teacher. He hangs the boy's kimono outside his house hoping that his family will see it. He is visited by an elderly woman, and then by a woman disguised as a traveling priest. She sees the kimono and misidentifies Rokusuke as the enemy. He fends off her fierce attack, and then Yasamatsu identifies her as his aunt Osono. She suddenly becomes very feminine and claims to be his wife, which is a highlight of the play. Then the elderly woman reveals her identify as the swordmaster's widow. Later he is visited by a woodman who asks for a revenge for the killing of his mother. It turns out that the woman brought by Mijin Danjō was the woodman's mother, not Mijin Danjō's. Osono identifies Mijin Danjō as Kyōgoku Takumi, and Rokusuke decides to help their revenge. Rokusuke is refused to make a match against Mijin Danjō because of his humble state. He becomes a retainer of Katō Kiyomasa after demonstrating his incredible power and skills by a series of sumō matches. He is given the name of Kida Magobee (貴田孫兵衛). Now as a samurai, he challenges Mijin Danjō to a match and successfully defeats him. The play ends with Katō Kiyomasa's departure to the Korean campaign.  Model  It is not clear how well this fiction reflects historical facts. A small village community named Keyamura is located in Tsukinoki, Yamakuni-machi, Nakatsu, Ōita Prefecture. There is a tomb of Kida Magobee (木田孫兵衛), which was built in the Meiji period. There is also an apparently old manuscript about Keyamura Rokusuke that contains the dates of copy of 1716 and 1902. According to the manuscript, Rokusuke was a son of a rōnin and his local wife. He joined Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Korean campaigns and distinguished himself as the unrivaled warrior. He returned to the village and died at the age of 62. Kida Magobee himself was a real figure. He appeared as a retainer of Katō Kiyomasa in some contemporary sources. The Kiyomasa-ki, a not-so-faithful biography of Katō Kiyomasa written in the mid-17th century, claimed that Kida Magobee was killed in a battle with the Jurchens (Orankai) on the Manchurian border (in 1592). Japanologist Choi Gwan dismissed this claim. His name can be found in a letter written by Katō Kiyomasa about two months after his supposed death. One of the recipients was Kida Magobee himself. Until the end of the Edo period, the Kida family served to the Hosokawa clan, who replaced the Katō clan as the ruler of Kumamoto.  New myth in South Korea  In South Korea, Keyamura Rokusuke is known as the target of a successful suicide attack by a kisaeng (official courtesan) named Nongae. However, this new myth can only be traced back to the mid-20th century. The new myth is as follows: There is no contemporary record of Nongae. Relatively early accounts did not name the victim of her suicide attack. Later, various manuscripts of the Imjillok, a semi-fictitious history book, identify him as Katō Kiyomasa or Toyotomi Hideyoshi, which is obviously wrong. No contemporary Korean sources suggest that the Koreans recognized the name of Kida Magobee or Keyamura Rokusuke, not to mention his association with the suicide attack. Choi Gwan claimed that Bak Jonghwa (朴鍾和)'s Nongae and Gyewolhyang (1962) was the first to identify the victim as Keyamura Rokusuke. Kawamura Minato discovered a slightly earlier mention of this new myth: a Japanese novel named Keijō, Chinkai and Fuzan (1951) by Tamagawa Ichirō.

As a member of the heat shock protein 70 family and a chaperone protein, it facilitates the proper folding of newly translated and misfolded proteins, as well as stabilize or degrade mutant proteins. Its functions contribute to biological processes including signal transduction, apoptosis, autophagy, protein homeostasis, and cell growth and differentiation. It has been associated with an extensive number of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, cell senescence, and aging.  Structure  This gene encodes a 70kDa heat shock protein which is a member of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family. As a Hsp70 protein, it has a C-terminal protein substrate-binding domain and an N-terminal ATP-binding domain. The substrate- binding domain consists of two subdomains, a two-layered β-sandwich subdomain (SBDβ) and an α-helical subdomain (SBDα), which are connected by the loop Lα,β. SBDβ contains the peptide binding pocket while SBDα serves as a lid to cover the substrate binding cleft. The ATP binding domain consists of four subdomains split into two lobes by a central ATP/ADP binding pocket. The two terminal domains are linked together by a conserved region referred to as loop LL,1, which is critical for allosteric regulation. The unstructured region at the very end of the C-terminal is believed to be the docking site for co- chaperones.  Function  The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family contains both heat-inducible and constitutively expressed members. The latter are called heat-shock cognate (Hsc) proteins. The heat shock 70 kDa protein 8 also known as Hsc70 belongs to the heat-shock cognate subgroup. This protein binds to nascent polypeptides to facilitate correct protein folding. In order to properly fold non-native proteins, Hsp70 chaperones interact with the hydrophobic peptide segments of proteins in an ATP-controlled fashion. Though the exact mechanism still remains unclear, there are at least two alternative modes of action: kinetic partitioning and local unfolding. In kinetic partitioning, Hsp70s repetitively bind and release substrates in cycles that maintain low concentrations of free substrate. This effectively prevents aggregation while allowing free molecules to fold to the native state. In local unfolding, the binding and release cycles induce localized unfolding in the substrate, which helps to overcome kinetic barriers for folding to the native state. Ultimately, its role in protein folding contributes to its function in signal transduction, apoptosis, protein homeostasis, and cell growth and differentiation. Hsc70 is known to localize to the cytoplasm and lysosome, where it participates in chaperone-mediated autophagy by aiding the unfolding and translocation of substrate proteins across the membrane into the lysosomal lumen. Through this pathway, Hsc70 also contributes to the degradation of the proapoptotic BBC3/PUMA under normal conditions, thus conferring cytoprotection. Hsc70 additionally serves as a positive regulator of cell cycle transition and carcinogenesis. For example, Hsc70 regulates the nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1, which is a key player in G1 to S phase cell cycle transition. Another function of Hsc70 is as an ATPase in the disassembly of clathrin-coated vesicles during transport of membrane components through the cell. It works with auxilin to remove clathrin from coated vesicles. In neurons, synaptojanin is also an important protein involved in vesicle uncoating. Hsc70 is a key component of chaperone-mediated autophagy wherein it imparts selectivity to the proteins being degraded by this lysosomal pathway.  Hsc70 vs Hsp70 comparison  Human Hsc70 has 85% identity with human Hsp70 (SDSC workbench, blosom26 default analysis). The scientific community has long assumed that Hsp70 and Hsc70 have similar cellular roles, but this assumption proved incomplete. While Hsc70 also performed chaperone functions under normal conditions, unlike canonical heat shock proteins, Hsc70 is constitutively expressed and performs functions related to normal cellular processes, such as protein ubiquitylation and degradation.  Clinical significance  The Hsp70 member proteins are important apoptotic constituents. During a normal embryologic processes, or during cell injury (such as ischemia-reperfusion injury during heart attacks and strokes) or during developments and processes in cancer, an apoptotic cell undergoes structural changes including cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation of the DNA and nucleus. This is followed by fragmentation into apoptotic bodies that are quickly removed by phagocytes, thereby preventing an inflammatory response. It is a mode of cell death defined by characteristic morphological, biochemical and molecular changes. It was first described as a \\"shrinkage necrosis\\", and then this term was replaced by apoptosis to emphasize its role opposite mitosis in tissue kinetics. In later stages of apoptosis the entire cell becomes fragmented, forming a number of plasma membrane-bounded apoptotic bodies which contain nuclear and or cytoplasmic elements. The ultrastructural appearance of necrosis is quite different, the main features being mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane breakdown and cellular disintegration. Apoptosis occurs in many physiological and pathological processes. It plays an important role during embryonal development as programmed cell death and accompanies a variety of normal involutional processes in which it serves as a mechanism to remove \\"unwanted\\" cells. Hsp70 member proteins, including Hsp72, inhibit apoptosis by acting on the caspase-dependent pathway and against apoptosis-inducing agents such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), staurosporine, and doxorubicin. This role leads to its involvement in many pathological processes, such as oncogenesis, neurodegeneration, and senescence. In particular, overexpression of HSP72 has been linked to the development some cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancers, colon cancers, breast cancers, and lung cancers, which led to its use as a prognostic marker for these cancers. Elevated Hsp70 levels in tumor cells may increase malignancy and resistance to therapy by complexing, and hence, stabilizing, oncofetal proteins and products and transporting them into intracellular sites, thereby promoting tumor cell proliferation. As a result, tumor vaccine strategies for Hsp70s have been highly successful in animal models and progressed to clinical trials. One treatment, a Hsp72/AFP recombined vaccine, elicited robust protective immunity against AFP-expressing tumors in mice experiments. Therefore, the vaccine holds promise for treating hepatocellular carcinoma. Alternatively, overexpression of Hsp70 can mitigate damage from ischemia-reperfusion in cardiac muscle, as well damage from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and spinocerebellar ataxias, and aging and cell senescence, as observed in centenarians subjected to heat shock challenge. In particular, Hsc70 plays a protective role in the aforementioned diseases, as well as in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Its protective role was further highlighted in a study that identified HSPA8 alongside other HSP70 proteins in a core sub-network of the wider chaperome interactome that functions as a proteostasis safeguard and that is repressed in aging brains and in the brains of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease patients.  Interactions  Hsc70 forms a chaperone complex by interacting with the heat shock protein of 40 kDa (Hsp40), the heat shock protein of 90 kDa (Hsp90), the hsc70-interacting protein (HIP), the hsc70-hsp90 organizing protein (HOP), and the Bcl2-associated athanogene 1 protein (BAG1).

Her image famously appears in Novalis’ Hymns to the Night, a foundational text of the literary movement known as German Romanticism. Although Novalis’s love for Sophie has assumed mythic proportions, their time together was short and uneventful. The two met on November 17, 1794 when Novalis was twenty-two and Sophie was only twelve. They became engaged on Sophie's thirteenth birthday March 17, 1795. Sophie became sick in November 1795, and her sickness continued until her death at the age of 15 in March 1797. The loss of Sophie brought about a deep period of mourning and suffering in Novalis' life. Even so, he became engaged to Julie von Charpentier in December 1798. The depth of Sophie’s love for Novalis is uncertain given her young age. Some of her diary entries, found in Wm. O’Brien's Novalis: Signs of Revolution, provide some insight into her relationship with Novalis: :March 1. Today Hartenberch visited again nothing happened. :March 11. We were alone today and nothing at all happened. :March 12. Today was like yesterday nothing at all happened. :March 13. Today was repentance day and Hartenb. was here. :March 14. Today Hartenber. was still here he got a letter from his brother. Sophie had a sister, Caroline von Kühn, and a stepsister, Wilhelmine von Thümmel. Ludwig Tieck's biography of Novalis describes Sophie, saying: \\"Even as a child, she gave an impression which--because it was so gracious and spiritually lovely--we must call superearthly or heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into an actual reality.\\" von Kühn and Novalis' relationship is the focus of the 1995 novel The Blue Flower by Penelope Fitzgerald.

The exact date of its construction remains unknown, the most plausible theory being the Byzantine period. It combines Byzantine and Frankish architectural elements. It fell into disuse in the 14th century. History Buffavento stands between St. Hilarion Castle to the west and Kantara Castle to the east forming a protective axis in the Kyrenia mountain range of Northern Cyprus. As both of the other castles are visible from Buffavento, it was used to pass signals between them. The castles were built in conjunction during the Byzantine period, however the exact date of their commission remains unknown. Among the theories put forward to explain their origin the popular are: In 965 (after the expulsion of the Arabs from the island), in 1091 by the rebel Rapsomates, during the rule of Eumathios Philokales (1091–1094), in the late 11th century after the Cilician coast was overrun by the Seljuk Empire or at the beginning of the 12th century as a countermeasure for the spread of the Crusader states. A Lusignan period legend claims that the castle was built by a Cypriot noblewoman who was seeking shelter from the Knights Templar in 1191, as such the castle was known as Leonne (Lion's Castle) or Queen's Castle. The name Buffavento is of Italian origin and means “Defier of the Winds\\", the name may have been borrowed from a monastery in the Koutzoventi village. Serving mainly as a watchtower for pirate raids and a place of incarceration the castle saw next to no fighting. In 1191, it was taken by Richard the Lionheart during his campaign against the island's ruler Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus. Since the castle's defenses have been described as very strong it is believed that the defenders of Buffavento surrendered after Kantara and St. Hilarion fell into English hands. Richard subsequently sold the island to the Knights Templar whose rule abruptly ended after a major revolt in Nicosia. Cyprus was thus resold to the Guy of Lusignan of the House of Lusignan. A period of peace ended with the death of Hugh I of Cyprus in 1218. A struggle over who should act as the kingdom's regent ensued, pitting the House of Ibelin with the local supporters of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick's arrival in Limassol in 1228 escalated the conflict into an open war. Between 1229 and 1233, it changed hands several times between the Ibelins and their rivals. Afterwards, the Lusignans continued their reign interrupted only by occasional palace coups. In the 14th century, the island came under the control of the Republic of Venice, at which time the castle fell into disuse. Architecture Buffavento is situated on an altitude of above sea level, and has approximately 600 steps leading up to it. The steep crags surrounding it make it inaccessible from west, east and north. Many of the castle's buildings are irregular in shape, as the limited available space forced its builders to economize space. The main building material was dressed limestone from the island's coasts and stones taken directly from the mountain on which the castle stands. The architecture carries no signs of decoration. The castle is divided into two wards the upper one facing the sea and the lower one the plain. The wards were connected by a long staircase, which was later destroyed by the Venetians who deemed the fortifications redundant. The castle's outbuildings consist of a big water cistern and a stable, which would have been rendered useless in the event of a siege. The castle's gates were located inside a two storey rectangular tower, which encompassed a Frankish style pointed arch. To the west of the tower there are three barrel vaulted buildings and recess all Frankish in origin. The buildings immediately behind the gate are three irregularly shaped chambers, the fourth building's ruins can be found nearby. The castle's main stairway then branches to the west leading to a two storey, unvaulted Byzantine building, which is divided into three large chambers. The castle's upper ward included a rectangular Byzantine cistern, interconnected with 4 rectangular wards containing pipes for collecting water. On upper ward's eastern side was guarded by a short, Frankish, groin vaulted tower. On its sides was the eastern cistern and a building that may have served as a church. At the extreme west of the castle stands a ruined, isolated tower. The lack of a kitchen or a food storage, points to the fact that rooms were multi functional in their nature. Popular Culture Buffavento Castle appears in the video game Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines.

The story revolves around the antics of the title character, a precocious fourth-grader with a knack for getting into trouble. Otis lives with his mother, who is often absent from the household due to teaching classes at her dance school, and therefore Otis is required to entertain himself, by \\"stirring up a little excitement\\". His trademarks are his glow-in-the-dark shoelaces (one pink, one green), the rabbit's foot he keeps attached to his jacket zipper, and his particular fondness for irritating his classmate Ellen Tebbits although he never understands the reason for it. Plot summary Otis Spofford is a young boy with a propensity for causing trouble. He does not have any brothers or sisters and he lives with his mother. One of the reasons why Otis likes to cause trouble is because he yearns to make life more exciting. Unfortunately, his behavior means that he does not have any close friends and his classmates are reluctant to form close bonds with him. The book is also about how Otis torments his classmate, Ellen Tebbits. He annoys her because she performs well in school and exhibits excellent behavior. Thus, Ellen is often the victim of Otis's bad behavior. Each chapter revolves around a prank of Otis's, which often backfires. In one instance, he sabotages the class science project, which consists of feeding cafeteria food to one rat and bread and soda to another, and monitoring their growth. Otis feeds the underfed rat himself, hoping that it will get soda pop served in the cafeteria. His teacher, Mrs. Gitler, becomes wise to this and tries to get the culprit to confess. Otis opens his mouth and is stunned when Ellen steps forward. Ellen was secretly feeding the rat as well. Subsequently, it is Ellen who is allowed to take the rat home at experiment's end, much to Otis's displeasure (although she gives it to him when her mother will not allow her to keep it). Otis' pranks are typically innocuous, such as firing spitballs in class. Near the end of the book he finally \\"gets his comeuppance,\\" as Mrs. Gitler has long predicted. In order to impress his classmates on a dare, he cuts off a chunk of Ellen's hair, which she had been painstakingly trying to grow \\"long enough for pigtails\\". This act turns nearly the entire class against him, and for the first time Otis does not relish the attention he receives from his actions. Otis eventually feels bad about what he did to Ellen when she bursts into tears and flees the classroom. Ellen and her best friend Austine manage an act of retribution by stealing Otis's shoes while he is skating at the pond, forcing him to walk home in his ice skates. The two girls later accost a dejected Otis on the steps of his apartment and offer him his shoes in exchange for an apology to Ellen, and a promise that he will stop pestering her. Otis concedes, but only after the girls are leaving reveals he had two fingers crossed behind his back the entire time; clearly, he means to pester Ellen for a long time to come.

After releasing two full-length albums, the original band split in 2005, but reformed in 2014.  Formation and original era  My Favorite formed in Long Island in 1991, and eventually migrated to the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. The \\"classic\\" lineup consisted of founder and principal songwriter Michael Grace Jr., vocalist Andrea Vaughn, guitarist Darren Amadio, bassist Gil Abad and drummer Todd \\"Todbot\\" Karasik. An even earlier incarnation featured Amadio on bass and current Roots member Captain Kirk Douglas on guitar (two tracks featuring Douglas were included on the 2014 reissue/compilation Love at Absolute Zero/Death in Suburbia). Their main influences included the Smiths, David Bowie, New Order and various singles from influential labels like Factory, Rough Trade, Cherry Red and Sarah. In negotiating these influences and impulses, they were contemporaries of Magnetic Fields and Belle and Sebastian, two bands they performed alongside in New York. The band released two full- length albums (Love at Absolute Zero and The Happiest Days of Our Lives: The Complete Joan of Arc Tapes), and several EPs and limited-edition, vinyl-only singles. They also made two music videos. Late in their original career, My Favorite found popularity in Sweden, where they were the focus of a feature on that country's national Sveriges Radio. They performed at three influential festivals and had many smaller, but enthusiastically received performances in cities like Gothenburg and Stockholm.  Reception  My Favorite were frequently discussed in the indie music press of the time in the context of new wave retroism, but were more accurately thought of in the tradition of romantic, lyric-driven post-rock and roll melancholia, strands of which originated with artists like the Velvet Underground and certain glam rock artists before reaching their apex in the post-punk period. They were featured in the Village Voice, New York Post, Daily News and Alternative Press, and were interviewed on indie programs such as New York Noise.  Breakup  My Favorite broke up on September 14, 2005, when Vaughn left the band.  Other projects  In 2006, the remaining five members of My Favorite joined forces with vocalists Lisa Ronson (daughter of David Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson) and Erin Dermody to form a new band called the Secret History. Karasik also played for New York post-punk band Bell Hollow from 2006 until their 2008 split, and appeared on their 2007 album Foxgloves (which also featured My Favorite singer Vaughn on backing vocals). Vaughn recorded vocals for the French band Bagatelle's debut EP, Rendez-Vous Transatlantique, which was released in 2013 by La Nageuse Records.http://www.lanageuserecords.com/index.php/en/artistes- en/bagatelle-en In 2014, Vaughn, Amadio and Karasik reunited to form the Chandler Estate with long-time friends and collaborators Tara Emelye Needham (Mad Planets, the Reverse) and Bryce Edwards (Boycrazy).http://www.thechandlerestate.com/ In 2015, they played their first show at the NYC Popfest and released four-song EP Infrastructure on Jigsaw Records.https://jigsaw-records.com/collections/jigsaw- records/products/chandler-estate-infrastructure-ep-cdep  Reformation  In 2014, Grace reassembled My Favorite (minus Vaughn) to perform at the NYC Popfest. On October 7, 2014, they released their first new single in 10 years, \\"Second Empire\\"/\\"Dance With a Stranger\\", on London's Where It's At Is Where You Are label.

The principle states that the spectral lines of any element include frequencies that are either the sum or the difference of the frequencies of two other lines. Lines of the spectra of elements could be predicted from existing lines. Since the frequency of light is proportional to the wavenumber or reciprocal wavelength, the principle can also be expressed in terms of wavenumbers which are the sum or difference of wavenumbers of two other lines. Another related version is that the wavenumber or reciprocal wavelength of each spectral line can be written as the difference of two terms. The simplest example is the hydrogen atom, described by the Rydberg formula :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} = R\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n_1^2}-\\\\frac{1}{n_2^2}\\\\right) where \\\\lambda is the wavelength, R is the Rydberg constant, and n_1 and n_2 are positive integers such that n_1 < n_2. This is the difference of two terms of form T_n = \\\\frac{R_H}{n^2}. Relation to quantum theory The combination principle is explained using quantum theory. Light consists of photons whose energy E is proportional to the frequency ν and wavenumber of the light: E = hν = hc/λ (where h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. A combination of frequencies or wavenumbers is then equivalent to a combination of energies. According to the quantum theory of the hydrogen atom proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913, an atom can have only certain energy levels. Absorption or emission of a particle of light or photon corresponds to a transition between two possible energy levels, and the photon energy equals the difference between their two energies. On dividing by hc, the photon wavenumber equals the difference between two terms, each equal to an energy divided by hc or an energy in wavenumber units (cm–1). Energy levels of atoms and molecules are today described by term symbols which indicate their quantum numbers. Also, a transition from an initial to a final energy level involves the same energy change whether it occurs in a single step or in two steps via an intermediate state. The energy of transition in a single step is the sum of the energies of transition in two steps: (E3 – E1) = (E2 – E1) + (E3 – E2). The NIST database tables of lines of spectra contains observed lines and the lines calculated by use of the Ritz combination principle. History The spectral lines of hydrogen had been analyzed and found to have a mathematical relationship in the Balmer series. This was later extended to a general formula called the Rydberg formula. This could only be applied to hydrogen- like atoms. In 1908 Ritz derived a relationship that could be applied to all atoms. This principle, the Rydberg–Ritz combination principle, is used today in identifying the transition lines of atoms.

The film stars Sridevi in the titular role. It also features Rishi Kapoor, Vinod Khanna. The film follows, Chandni Mathur, a young effervescent woman torn between two suitors. The eighties marked a professional setback in Chopra's career, as several films he directed and produced in that period were critical and commercial failures. After a series of failed action movies, Chopra decided to return to his roots and make a romantic musical, a film with all the hallmarks of what has come to be known as the \\"Yash Chopra style\\" - heroine-oriented, romantic, emotional, depicting the lifestyle of the super elite, with melodic music used in songs picturised in foreign locations. The film marked the first collaboration between Chopra and Sridevi. Chandni released to widespread success, grossing ₹27.02 crores, becoming the third highest-grossing Indian film of 1989, whereas its soundtrack became the best selling album of the year as well as the decade with more than 10 million copies sold. The huge success of the film and its soundtrack were instrumental in ending the era of violent action films in Indian Cinema and rejuvenating the romantic musical genre. The success of film further reinforced Sridevi's position as the top female star of the era. Over the years, Chandni is hailed as one of the greatest Indian films of all time and one of Chopra's finest movies. At the 37th National Film Awards, it won Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, while at the 35th Filmfare Awards, the film received 10 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director for Chopra and Best Actress for Sridevi, and won Best Cinematography. Plot Rohit Gupta attends his sister's wedding and meets the beautiful Chandni Mathur. He falls in love with her at first sight. She agrees to date him, and they eventually get engaged, though his family dislikes Chandni due to the vast difference in their social status. While wanting to surprise Chandni with a special thing one day, Rohit asks her to wait for him on a terrace. Then the afternoon's silence is broken by the roaring blades of a helicopter, from which a smiling Rohit appears to shower Chandni with red rose petals. Post five minutes of the delight, Rohit disappears and Chandni is surrounded by silence. After reaching inside her home, she is informed by Rohit's family that he has been hospitalised. Chandni immediately reaches the hospital ICU unit where Rohit is admitted. Rohit's family greets Chandni with stony expressions and accuses her of being responsible for his accident, learning he is paralyzed on his right side. Rohit realises that he would be unable to fulfill a good husband's role and decides to let Chandni go. Heartbroken, Chandni moves to Bombay. She now starts working for a travel agency, whose head is the handsome and charming Lalit Khanna, a widower. Slowly, he develops feelings for Chandni and convinces her to marry him, but she is hesitant at first. Two years later, Chandni finally agrees to marry Lalit and meets his mother Lata, who is glad to have Chandni as her daughter- in-law. On a trip to Switzerland, Lalit meets Rohit who is receiving treatment from professional therapists and physicians. Able to stand now, Rohit eventually becomes friends with Lalit and they share their love-stories, unaware that they love the same woman. Returning to India, Rohit shows up one evening to meet Lalit. Chandni opens the door and they're delighted to see each other. To Chandni's amazement, Rohit reveals he is now not in a wheelchair. They get keyed up with emotion and Rohit seizes this opportunity to propose to her. Chandni tells him that she has moved on and engaged to Lalit, much to Rohit's dismay. Obviously and angered, Rohit is questioned by Chandni that what his family did to her. Regretfully, he leaves. Lalit invites Rohit to his wedding as they became friends. In all subsequent ceremonies, Rohit and Chandni pretend as strangers to spare Lalit. On the wedding day, Rohit drinks a bit too much to drive away from the pain of losing Chandni. He mumbles and stumbles down a flight of stairs. Upon seeing this, Chandni cannot contain herself any longer and screams for him to be saved. She hugs him and starts crying. Lalit realises that Chandni is Rohit's love. Rohit is rushed to the hospital. He regains his health and Chandni agrees to marry him as Lalit sacrifices his love.

CNN-IBN listed it among 'The Cult Characters Yash Chopra Created' while NDTV featured it in its list of 'Yash Chopra's Greatest Creations' stating that the film established Sridevi \\"as the nation's sweetheart\\" and \\"reinforced her position as the reigning actress in Bollywood.\\" Sridevi's iconic 'Chandni Look' revolutionized fashion in North India and became synonymous with the actress, with Rediff stating \\"A luminous Sridevi slips into every possible design in white for a major chunk of the romance and no one complains.\\" Speaking about the look, Yash Chopra told film critic Rajeev Masand \\"While making Chandni, I had a vision of who I wanted this girl to be. I told Sridevi that most of her costumes in the film would be in white.\\" The Tribune wrote \\"Leena Daru scored a winner again when she created the 'Chandni Look' for Sridevi. Every street corner sold the salwar-kameez and dupatta that gave the heroine a refreshingly understated look, rarely seen on the Indian screen.\\" while Mid Day reported \\"Leena Daru dressed Bollywood's beauties for several years. But it was her simple white churidar and kurta with the leheriya dupatta for Sridevi in Chandni that gave the Southern belle an angelic image and caused the Chandni Chowk stores to hit the jackpot with thousands of copies.\\" BizAsia described the effect of the look saying \\"Chopra never quite got over his Sridevi hangover and almost always chose to present his lead heroines in similar outfits (Juhi Chawla in Darr (1993), Madhuri Dixit in Dil To Pagal Hai (1997)), but none of them became half as iconic as Sridevi did after Chandni.\\" The 'Chandni Look' was also highlighted in the film's famous Tandav dance sequence by Sridevi, where Rediff said \\"the actress transformed into a mythical goddess in a white number.\\" Sridevi's chiffon sarees became equally popular with Indian Express writing \\"This movie made the chiffon sari a must- have in every Indian woman's wardrobe.\\" The music of Chandni became a multi- platinum success with Sridevi's famous dance number \\"Mere Haathon Mein Nau Nau Choodiyan Hain\\" finding a place in Rediff's chart of 'Bollywood's Top 25 Wedding Songs.' Sridevi also lent her voice to the film's popular title-track 'Chandni O Meri Chandni' which featured among the 'Top 5 Songs' of Yash Chopra by Hindustan Times. Talking about her role in Chandni, Sridevi said it was \\"a lively and vibrant girl in the first half (who) becomes quiet and goes into a shell in the second half. I loved that transformation and when you have a director like Yash Chopra at the helm, you can be sure that he will make the best out of everything.\\"  Awards  ;37th National Film Awards * Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment - Yash Chopra & T.

Currently it consists of six chōme. According to Minato, as of November 1, 2007, the population in the neighborhood is 14,840. The term Shirokane narrowly refers to Shirokane 1-chōme to Shirokane 6-chōme, but is sometimes used to include the larger neighborhood formerly known as , which encompasses part of Shirokanedai and Takanawa as well as Shirokane. This article deals with the place in the narrow definition. Overview Shirokane is one of the most wealthy neighborhoods in Japan which located in the southwestern part of Minato, Tokyo. It is a quiet residential area that is abundant in undeveloped green space. And also this area is known for its one of the most expensive real estate fee for living in Japan. Shirokane has boundaries with the neighborhoods of Minami-Azabu, Shirokanedai, Takanawa and Ebisu. The Prefectural Highway 305 (Ebisu-dori) divides into odd-numbered (1, 3, 5-chōmes) and even-numbered (2, 4, 6-chōmes) subdistricts designated as industrial and high-rise residential areas, respectively. Along Furukawa river, small factories and shopping streets are developed, and upon the southern hill, a quiet residential area is developed with apartments and schools such as Seishin Joshi Gakuin. The recent opening of a subway allowed the area centered at Shirokane-Takanawa Station to undergo a large redevelopment. There are forest areas owned by academic institutions and private companies such as Seishin Joshi Gakuin and the Kitasato Institute. With the Institute for Nature Study and the Institute of Medical Science in Shirokanedai, these areas forms one of the largest green districts in the special wards of Tokyo. This large green area traces back to daimyō's mansions which existed in Edo period; later, industrialists made their residences in this place, which gave rise to the well-known upper-class neighborhood.  Etymology  During the Ōei era (1394–1428), a government official of the Southern Dynasty who settled here became wealthy. His nickname was Shirokane Chōja (白金長者), which means \\"man who possesses much 'white gold' \\" (白金), a reference to silver. Thus the name of this location is the \\"Silver District\\".

When it debuted in 1993 as NFL Prime Monday, and Monday Night Football was airing on ABC, the pregame show was one of the first cross-pollinations between ESPN and ABC Sports, which each largely operated under separate management at the time. The show was renamed Monday Night Countdown in 1998, and Monday Night Football moved from ABC to ESPN in 2006. The current sponsor is presented by Courtyard by Marriott, starting November 18, 2019 and previous sponsors of the show include UPS, Applebee's and Call of Duty. History=Monday Night Football on ABC era The show was initially hosted by Mike Tirico along with analysts Joe Theismann, Craig James, Phil Simms and Ron Jaworski. Mike Ditka also discussed certain topics and Chris Mortensen brought news and rumors from around the league. John Clayton was also a regular guest on the show. Former presenters include Mike Tirico, Bill Parcells, Michael Irvin, and Sterling Sharpe. During the 2005 season, it enjoyed its best ratings ever and was the highest-rated studio sports show on cable television. On occasion, the crew appeared on-site at the game, but for the most part the show was aired from the studios in Bristol, Connecticut. ESPN Monday Night Football2006= In 2006, the show began appearing at the Monday Night Football site live as the game moved to ESPN from ABC. Stuart Scott moved to host of NFL Primetime which precedes Monday Night Countdown and Chris Berman moved from NFL Primetime to Monday Night Countdown and was joined by returning analysts Tom Jackson and Michael Irvin along with new analyst from Sunday NFL Countdown Steve Young. Ron Jaworski also contributed to the show along with Chris Mortensen, Ed Werder and Sal Paolantonio. Also, in 2006 Monday Night Countdown introduced a new logo and new graphics as part of The Syndicate's new NFL package for ESPN. In the same fashion as all ESPN NFL studio shows, Monday Night Countdown adopted ABC's alternate football musical theme, though presented as a shuffle. =2007= Beginning with the 2007, the show cutback its onsite presence by having its main anchor team at ESPN studio's in Bristol, but still kept a set at the actual game site. =2008= The Bristol team was Berman, Jackson, Mortensen, Mike Ditka, Keyshawn Johnson, and Cris Carter. The on-site team is Scott, Young, and Emmitt Smith. =2009-2012= The Bristol team was Berman, Jackson, Mortensen, Ditka, Johnson, and Carter. The on-site team was Scott, Young, and Matt Millen (later Trent Dilfer) in the third spot. On September 17, 2012, Monday Night Countdown moved up to the 6:30 ET timeslot and expanded to 2 hours. As a result, SportsCenter Monday Kickoff had its runtime cut in half, from 60 minutes to 30 minutes only. Additionally, Monday Night Countdown debuted a new program logo that closely resembles that of Monday Night Football and a new graphics scheme package matching that of Monday Night Football. Also, Monday Night Countdown began using MNF's \\"Heavy Action\\" theme music as this program's own theme music. =2013= Ray Lewis is added to the on-site team after his retirement from the NFL in 2012. On December 23, 2013, the final scheduled Monday Night Football broadcast of that season, Chris Berman was at Candlestick Park in San Francisco covering the 49ers' final home game in that stadium, while Stuart Scott was at ESPN's Bristol studios. The 49ers defeated the Atlanta Falcons, 34-24, in the MNF season finale. That game was also the 36th and final Monday Night Football game — and the last NFL game — ever played at Candlestick Park. =2014= On September 8, 2014, Monday Night Countdown moved to a brand-new set inside Digital Center 2 of ESPN's Bristol studios, which shares the same set as Sunday NFL Countdown and NFL Primetime. However, the Monday Night Football graphics package is still used, but the rundown graphic was changed to match the one used on SportsCenter. 1 week later (September 15, 2014), Monday Night Countdown moved up to the 6:00 p.m. ET timeslot, which resulted in SportsCenter Monday Kickoff not returning for the 2014 season and moving the 6:00 p.m. ET edition of SportsCenter to ESPN2 on Mondays during the NFL season. =2015= Suzy Kolber, who substituted for the then-ailing Stuart Scott during most of the 2014 season, took over Scott's role permanently as an on-site host. She was previously a sideline reporter for Monday Night Football from 2006-2010. Additionally, Monday Night Countdown debuted a new logo resembling its other NFL-themed studio-show properties, along with a new graphics package that is also used for MNF. =2016= With the exception of Chris Berman (who remained in the Bristol studio), the entire Monday Night Countdown crew were moved to the Monday Night Football game site, joining on-site host Suzy Kolber. Meanwhile, Berman was joined in the Bristol studio each week by analysts who work or had previously worked at ESPN. However, Berman and the Monday Night Countdown crew did the show on November 21 from Estadio Azteca in Mexico City for the game between the Oakland Raiders and Houston Texans, and December 12 from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. This was also Berman's final season as a host for ESPN's NFL-themed studio shows. =2017= Suzy Kolber was named host of Monday Night Countdown on March 23, 2017. She replaced Chris Berman, who departed after 30 seasons of hosting NFL-themed studio shows, though he still appeared in occasional segments. In addition to her pregame duties, Kolber now hosts all halftime and post-game shows, normally from the game site; however, the October 9, 2017, November 27, 2017 and December 25, 2017 shows all originated from ESPN's Bristol studio. The Christmas Day episode, which only ran for 45 minutes, did not have Woodson or Young; Rex Ryan did the show. =2019= Woodson left ESPN for Fox, and Hasselbeck left Countdown to take over as a full-time co-analyst role for ESPN’s Thursday Night College Football games. Therefore, the lineup was Suzy Kolber, Adam Schefter, Randy Moss, Steve Young, and Louis Riddick. The show got a new graphics package. The October 28 show originated from Bristol instead of Pittsburgh, probably because the show had been there earlier in the season. =2020= Monday Night Countdown, along with most of ESPN's NFL-themed studio shows, moved to the network's South Street Seaport studios in New York City for the 2020 season. With the exception of Louis Riddick, who switched roles with Booger McFarland & moved to the Monday Night Football broadcast booth (the latter of whom took over Riddick's previous role of studio analyst), the lineup remained the same from the previous season.

Highlights of Sunday's games are shown, with a still represented by a click of a camera. Originally, the Sunday Snapshot consisted of a theme (e.g., upsets) but now is about a player's performance from the previous day's game. *Game Balls: Introduced on October 2, 2017. Kolber and the other analysts give out game balls to those who had an outstanding performance over the weekend. It is similar to the Game Balls that Berman and Tom Jackson gave out on NFL Primetime and other shows. *C'Mon Man!: Introduced on October 27, 2008. During the show, they will each describe a play or series of plays that made them scratch their heads and say, \\"C'Mon Man!\\". They range from plays on the field to actions by fans and other people present at the game. This includes plays from games in the NFL, college and high school football, and the Canadian Football League. Stolen from Ed Lover's popular webseries C'Mon Son! \\"C'Mon Man!\\", which is similar to the weekly \\"Not Top Plays\\" segment on SportsCenter, is sponsored by GEICO. *You Got Mossed!: Introduced in 2016, this segment features highlights of catches by wide receivers in high school football, the CFL, college football, the NFL and even MLB, the NBA and Ultimate Frisbee, while the defenders are being described as getting \\"mossed\\" (hence the term named after ESPN NFL analyst & former NFL wide receiver Randy Moss). *Boomer's Vault: A new segment introduced in 2017, where Chris Berman highlights historic moments from the history of Monday Night Football. For the NFL's 100th season in 2019, the format was changed to a countdown of the top 50 plays in NFL history. *Hometown Heroes: Introduced in 2018, it features a player from the night's game helping out in his team's community. Former *In the Pocket: Former quarterback Steve Young analyzed the performances the league's quarterbacks for Thursday and Sunday games. *Field Pass: Players were shown warming up for the game. Beginning with the November 12, 2018 episode the \\"Field Pass\\" name was not being used, but they were still showing player warmups. For several years, it was presented by Dunkin' Donuts. *Teams at 20: An all-day segment, including on SportsCenter, where various facets of each of the Monday night teams were reviewed. *Sunday Drive: Ron Jaworski analyzed a key drive from the previous day's action, from start to finish. *The Mort Report: Chris Mortensen broke down trade rumors, coaching changes and injuries. *Playmakers: Michael Irvin reviewed the players who made the biggest difference in Sunday's games. *Jacked Up: At the end of the show Tom Jackson counted down the top five biggest hits of the week. In 2006, the format went to 6, and 6 to 4 were done on the show, and 3 to 1 were done at halftime. Only hits that did not result in a penalty or injury were featured in this segment. Discontinued at the start of the 2008 season due to the growing issue of glorifying 'big hits' causing concussions in the game. *Dilfer's Dimes: Trent Dilfer shows the best passes from the week's action from the NFL and college football. The segment was previously on SportsCenter Sunday nights before it moved to Monday Night Countdown in 2016. Dilfer was among the employees laid off by ESPN in late April 2017, so it can be surmised the segment has been discontinued. *Sorry Bro!: a segment similar to \\"C'mon Man!\\" where plays from the previous day were shown, and Kolber and the analysts would end his/her segment by saying \\"Sorry Bro!\\" It only aired once, on September 21, 2015. *Chalk Talk: Jon Gruden interviewed a player or coach from that night's game. It was discontinued after Gruden returned to coaching the Raiders. It was sponsored by Corona, Burger King, Dick's Sporting Goods and Nationwide Insurance.

It encompasses the preparation, combination, and presentation of dishes and the manner in which these dishes are integrated into a meal. An Aristologist is someone who studies or takes part in the art or science of cooking and eating (dining) with particular interests and skills in the preparation, combination and presentation of food dishes, wines, spirits, flavours and tastes - coupled with tasteful and correct presentation of all the courses and components of a meal. The term has been largely superseded by \\"gourmet\\", which is also the older word, borrowed into English in 1820. An Aristologist is likely to place great importance on the experience, skill, and artistic integrity of the chef, and disdain the use of cookbooks, ready-made ingredients, and other conveniences. \\" The Aristologist took a keen interest in the menu, and thought very hard about what red wine he was going to choose to go with his sirloin steak.\\"  Literary record  The word is derived from the Greek άριστον (ariston), meaning \\"breakfast\\" or \\"lunch\\", and the suffix -logy, connoting a systematic discipline. Its earliest attestation in the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1835. Edward Abbot, the author of the first Australian cookbook (The English And Australian Cookery Book — Cookery For The Many, published 1864), described himself as \\"an Australian Aristologist\\". The term has also been used in the mystery novels of American author Rex Stout, whose corpulent protagonist, Nero Wolfe, has a couple of encounters with a society known as the Ten for Aristology, who in his eyes are \\"... witlings, as dining is an art and not a science\\".

The word acetosella is of Latin origin and is derived from an old name for sorrel (Oxalis) which comes from the sour taste experienced when eating the young leaves of the plant.Klingaman, Gerald (23 September 2011). \\"Plant of the Week: Red-Leafed Hibiscus, Latin: Hibiscus acetosella.\\" Division of Agriculture, University of Arkansas. Hibiscus acetosella is also known colloquially as false roselle, maroon mallow, red leaved hibiscus, and red shield hibiscus. It is one of the approximately 200–300 species that are seen in sub-tropic and tropic regions. This ornamental is usually found in abandoned fields or open areas, marshes, and forest clearings. Cranberry hibiscus is a member of a perennial group known as hardy hibiscus. In contrast to the tropical hibiscus, hardy hibiscus can tolerate colder conditions, are more vigorous, longer lasting, and have larger flowers.Knox, Gary W. \\"Hardy Hibiscus for Florida Landscapes\\". University of Florida Extension. Retrieved 2013-06-02 In colder climates, Hibiscus acetosella is easily an annual, but is often regarded as a perennial to zone 8–11. During one season, the plant can grow tall and wide as a shrub- subshrub.Mahr, Susan (21 April 2008). \\"Hibiscus Acetosella.\\" Wisconsin Master Gardener. University of Wisconsin. Characteristics The foliage of cranberry hibiscus is similar to that of the Japanese maple. It has dicot leaves which vary in shape from 3-5-lobed to un-lobed or undivided in the upper leaves of the plant and are generally the size of a small child's hand, about 10×10 cm.\\"PLANTS Profile: Hibiscus acetosella Welw. ex Hiern. African rosemallow\\". United States Department of Agriculture. They tend to be alternate, simple, and deeply cut with crenate or jagged edges. Leaf color is observed as a dark maroon to a patchy red/green appearance. Stipules are linear, measured approximately 1.5 cm in length. Both stems and petioles (3–11 cm in length) are smooth or generally free from hair. Acetosella is further divided into a section called Furcaria, which is a group of approximately 100 species that have non-fleshy calyx or sepals. The sepals contain 10 veins, 5 of which run to the apices of the segments; the other 5 run to the sinuses. Stems tend to be variegated. Flowers are solitary and sit atop a 1 cm long pedicel. They vary in color and are most often the dark maroon that is characteristic of the foliage with darker vein-like markings. Flowers are rarely yellow in color and are about 5 cm {2 inches} deep. Each flower contains numerous stamens at about 2 cm in length. The cranberry hibiscus is bisexual and is thought to be self-pollinating. It produces seeds that are reniform and dark brown with dimensions of 3×2.5 mm.  Genetics  Hibiscus acetosella is an allotetraploid [2n = 4x = 72] with a genome composition of AABB. It is often used to transfer genetic resistance to root-knot nematodes with compatible Hibiscus species. Cranberry hibiscus is often grown after tomatoes and potatoes and related species of which are not resistant to nematodes  Origin  Hibiscus acetosella is thought to have come about via hybridization between Hibiscus asper Hook.f. and Hibiscus surattensis L. secondary to their cultivation. It was first recognized in 1896 by French botanists as a distinct plant and given the name it currently has. The plant was probably first found growing around African villages in the southern DR Congo-Angola-Zambia region. The crop was brought to Brazil and South-East Asia where it was most likely used as sustenance for slaves. It is now considered more popular in Brazil than its original location in Africa, where it is now regularly cultivated and eaten as a spinach-like green.  Living conditions  Cranberry hibiscus is cultivated in medium altitudes in areas of high rainfall although it does do fairly well in droughts. It requires moist soil with good drainage and a range of partial shade to full sun exposure. The plant does well in slightly acidic conditions with a soil pH between 6.1 and 6.5.\\"Cranberry Hibiscus (Hibiscus acetosella, False roselle, African rosemallow).\\" Edibleplantproject.org. Cranberry hibiscus tends to flower late in season when days are shorter. Flowers open for a few hours during the late fall to early winter at midday. Although the plant itself remains in bloom for a few weeks, once open, a flower remains so for just one day. Plants typically succumb to cold weather in the Midwest prior to flowers appearing  Growing at home  Seeds germinate easily within 3–4 days in a container but tend to grow rapidly. Light is not required for germination. Cranberry hibiscus propagates well with cuttings, which will take root in soil or water. The plant can be maintained in an oval form by pinching or cutting it back during the summer. Otherwise, it will have one dominant stem.  Edible properties  Cranberry hibiscus is mostly known for its slightly sour or pleasantly tart young leaves which are commonly used as a vegetable, either raw or cooked. In South America, the leaves are used sparingly in salads and stir-fries. Leaves are eaten in small quantities due to acid content and because they are mucilaginous. Cranberry hibiscus leaves also contribute to the décor of various dishes since they retain their color after being cooked. Flowers are used to make teas or other drinks where they contribute color rather than taste. In Central America the flowers are combined with ice, sugar, lemon, or lime juice and water to make a purple lemonade. The root is edible however thought of as fibrous and distasteful. Contrary to similar species such as the Hibiscus sabdariffa, the calyx or sepals of Hibiscus acetosella is non-fleshy and not eaten. In Angola a tea made from the leaves of cranberry hibiscus are used as a post-fever tonic and to treat anemia. The plant is also utilized to treat myalgias by crushing leaves into cold water to bathe children. The plant is thought to contain polyphenols, a compound that may combat inflammation and is commonly used to treat inflammatory diseases.

Biography  Despain was born in 1940 in Lovell, Wyoming, the oldest of five children to Daniel Gordon Despain and Lillian Gardner. He attended Lovell High School and then studied at the University of Wyoming, receiving a B.S. in Botany in 1966. He did graduate work at the University of Arizona, receiving an M.S. in plant ecology in 1967, and then a PhD in Plant Ecology from the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1971. In the mid 1980s, he was the President of the Wyoming Native Plant Society, and Vice-president for the Biological Section at the Montana Academy of Science. From 1998 to 1999, he was vice-president of the scientific research society Sigma Xi from 1998 to 1999, and President from 1999 to 2001. From 1971 to 2006, he was a research biologist with the National Park Service in Yellowstone National Park, and was instrumental in generating the fire management plans in use by the park since 1972. He generated a vegetation map of the park and did extensive research in fire behavior, fire effects and landscape factors in fire spread. He also worked as an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, testing the utility of remote sensing systems for vegetation and fuels appraisal. Despain retired in 2006, although he is still active in scientific research. He lives in Bozeman, Montana.  Writing = As D.G.
