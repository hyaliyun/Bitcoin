Biography Born Edric Browne in Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago, where his childhood was imbued with the African traditions of Shango and Spiritual Baptist Shouting, he assumed the name George E. Browne in homage to his mentor and family friend, Richard E. Braithwaite,Val Wilmer, \\"George Browne\\" (obituary), The Guardian, 7 April 2007. whose library introduced him to works of black history and activism. Browne joined a Norwegian tanker at the age of 20 and, after a brief stay in Australia, signed off in Scotland in 1941. After befriending other expatriate Trinidadians in Glasgow he relocated to London and began to earn his living as a musician. In 1943 he found luck with a surprise hit, \\"Christmas Calypso.\\" In 1947-48 he co-founded (with Bermudian Ken Gordon (1927-2013), uncle of newsreader Moira Stuart) the Three Just Men group\\"Dr E.F. Gordon‚Äôs Son Ken Gordon Dies At 86\\", Bernews, 7 November 2013. and toured in Europe and North Africa with the trio the following year. During the same time, Browne worked with a minstrel show headlining Westminster's Central Hall, later involving himself as a vocalist in the chorus of a West End revival of the musical Show Boat. Afterwards, he earned extra money with a small group covering current American pop tunes. Utilizing the calypsonian tradition of social commentary, while playing with a rhumba band at the posh Orchid Room, he put together an extemporary few bars in honor of guest Prince Philip. The staff and proprietor were aghast, but when he returned to play the next night, London's upper crust showed up for that very reason. Unfortunately, Browne had scrapped the song after being lectured by an irate manager of the Orchid Room staff. With this success behind him, he toured Paris, returning to London in 1951. In 1952 Tiger signed to Melodisc, the first British company to record calypso music. He inherited the name Young Tiger from the calypsonian Growling Tiger when in 1953 he recorded a cover version of Tiger's song \\"Single Man\\".Jason Ankeny, \\"Young Tiger\\" Answers.com. Young Tiger's hits dating from that same year include \\"Calypso Be\\" and \\"I Was There\\" - the latter being his observations about the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II - and \\"Mamzelle Josephine\\". On 31 January 1955, he participated along with fellow calypsonian Kitchener in a concert billed as \\"The First Caribbean Carnival in London\\" that was held at the Royal Albert Hall.Ray Funk, \\"London‚Äôs first Caribbean Carnival?\\", Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, 23 June 2015. Subsequently, embracing jazz music, Browne recorded with a number of bands, including Humphrey Lyttelton's Paseo Jazz Band. In the 1960s he pursued an acting career for a time - he played the role of Jesus Christ in a passion play produced at the First World Festival of Negro Arts in Senegal in 1966. Abandoning calypso soon after for jazz, Browne collaborated with longtime friend and mentor Lauderic Caton at the underground Soho venue Club du Faubourg and regularly headlined at Oxford and Cambridge University balls. In 1970 he gave up music to open a London restaurant and health club with his then wife. When forced to close it because of rent increases, they moved to the United States, where for a time they had restaurants in Florida and California. He returned to the UK in the late 1980s, living in retirement in Croydon and making ends meet by playing the stock market. His calypso \\"I Was There (At the Coronation)\\" featured on the 2002 Honest Jon compilation London Is the Place for Me 1: Trinidadian Calypso in London, 1950-1956. Following the re-release of his \\"Calypso Be\\" on London Is the Place for Me, Vol. 2 (November 2005), Browne played at the BBC \\"Electric Proms\\" festival in 2006, performing a few songs together with the London is the Place for Me Allstars. Also featured on the Honest Jon's compilations were \\"African Dream\\" and \\"Chicken and Rice\\". Eventually, Browne returned to London, and on 26 October 2006 played a live set for the release of the calypso retrospective London Is the Place for Me, Vol. 2, bringing his name to a new generation of calypso fans. Browne died on 23 March 2007, at the age of 82, with obituaries ranging from West Indies music magazines to mainstream press such as Mojo and Rolling Stone.

Most of the events took place in the Upper South. While the fighting stretched across the entire period, there were extended periods with of little or no action. The Cherokees are Coming, an illustration depicting a scout warning the residents of Knoxville, Tennessee, of the approach of a large Cherokee force in September 1793 The Cherokee leader Dragging Canoe, whom some historians call \\"the Savage Napoleon\\",Goodpasture, p. 27Phelan, p. 43Alderman, p. 37 and his warriors, and other Cherokee fought alongside and together with warriors from several other tribes, most often the Muscogee in the Old Southwest and the Shawnee in the Old Northwest. During the Revolutionary War, they also fought alongside British troops, Loyalist militia, and the King's Carolina Rangers against the rebel colonists, hoping to expel them from their territory. Open warfare broke out in the summer of 1776 along the frontier of the Watauga, Holston, Nolichucky, and Doe rivers in East Tennessee, as well as the colonies (later states) of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. It later spread to settlements along the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee and in Kentucky. The wars can be divided into two phases. The first phase took place from 1776 to 1783, in which the Cherokee fought as allies of the Kingdom of Great Britain against the American colonies. The Cherokee War of 1776 encompassed the entirety of the Cherokee nation. At the end of 1776, the only militant Cherokee were those who migrated with Dragging Canoe to the Chickamauga towns and became known as the \\"Chickamauga Cherokee\\". The second phase lasted from 1783 to 1794. The Cherokee served as proxies of the Viceroyalty of New Spain against the recently formed United States of America. Because they migrated westward to new settlements initially known as the \\"Five Lower Towns\\", referring to their location in the Piedmont, these people became known as the Lower Cherokee. This term was used well into the 19th century. In 1786, Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, a major war chief of the Iroquois, organized the Western Confederacy of tribes to resist American settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. The Lower Cherokee were founding members and fought in the Northwest Indian War that resulted from this conflict. The Chickamauga ended their warfare in November 1794 with the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse. The Northwest Indian War, in which some Cherokee were also involved, ended with the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. Prelude (1763‚Äì75) The French and Indian War and the related European theater conflict known as the Seven Years' War laid many of the foundations for the conflict between the Cherokee and the American settlers on the frontier. These tensions on the frontier broke out into open hostilities with the advent of the American Revolution. =Aftermath of the French and Indian War= A commander of Fort Patrick Henry sent Henry Timberlake as a token of friendship after the Anglo-Cherokee War. Timberlake later took three Cherokee to London, 1763. The action of the French and Indian War in North America included the Anglo-Cherokee War, lasting 1758‚Äì1761. British forces under general James Grant destroyed a number of major Cherokee towns, which were never reoccupied. Kituwa was abandoned, and its former residents migrated west; they took up residence at Mialoquo, called Great Island Town, on the Little Tennessee River among the Overhill Cherokee.Klink and Talman, p. 62 At the end of this conflict, the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Long-Island-on-the-Holston with the Colony of Virginia (1761) and the Treaty of Charlestown with the Province of South Carolina (1762). Conocotocko (Standing Turkey), the First Beloved Man during the conflict, was replaced by Attakullakulla, who was pro-British. Valuing the support of Native Americans, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763. This prohibited colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, in an effort to preserve territory for the native tribes. Many colonials resented the interference with their drive to the vast western lands. The proclamation was a major irritant to the colonists, contributing to their support for the American Revolution and ending interference by the Crown. Treaties and land cessation To resolve the problem of settlers living beyond the line established in the previous treaty, John Stuart, as Superintendent for Southern Indian Affairs, negotiated a treaty signed on October 17, 1768, with the Cherokee surrendering their claims to the Colony of Virginia to the land between the Allegheny Mountains and the Ohio River. Essentially, it covered what is now West Virginia and eastern Kentucky, with a bit of the southwest corner of Pennsylvania. After Pontiac's War (1763‚Äì64), the Iroquois Confederacy ceded to the British government its claims to the hunting grounds between the Ohio and Cumberland rivers, known to them and other Indians as Kain-tuck-ee (Kentucky), in the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix. In 1769, developers and land speculators planned to start a new colony called Vandalia in the territory ceded by the Cherokee. Plans for that fell through, however, and Virginia annexed it as the District of West Augusta in 1774. On June 1, 1773, the Cherokee and the Muskogee ceded their claims to 2 million acres in the northern sector of the Georgia colony, in return for the cancellation of their debts. Most of the Muscogee refused to recognize the treaty, and the British government rejected it.Lavender, p. 4 Dunmore's War (1774) The next year, Daniel Boone led a group to establish a temporary settlement inside the hunting grounds of modern-day Kentucky. In retaliation the Shawnee, Lenape (Delaware), Mingo, and some Cherokee attacked a scouting and forage party, which included Boone's son James. James Boone and Henry Russell (a member of one of the two parties) were captured by the Native Americans and ritually tortured to death. The colonists responded with the beginning of Dunmore's War (1773‚Äì1774). The Cherokee and the Muscogee were active also, mainly confining themselves to small raids on the backcountry settlements of the Carolinas and Georgia.Anderson and Lewis, p. 22 =Early colonial settlements in Upper East Tennessee (1768‚Äì1772)= Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap, George Caleb Bingham, oil on canvas, 1851‚Äì52 The earliest colonial settlement in the vicinity of what became Upper East Tennessee was Sapling Grove (Bristol). The first of the North-of-Holston settlements, it was founded by Evan Shelby, who \\"purchased\\" the land in 1768 from John Buchanan. Jacob Brown began another settlement on the Nolichucky River, and John Carter another in what became known as Carter's Valley (between Clinch River and Beech Creek), both in 1771. Following the Battle of Alamance in 1771, James Robertson led a group of some twelve or thirteen Regulator families from North Carolina to the Watauga River. Each of the groups thought they were within the territorial limits of the colony of Virginia. After a survey proved their mistake, Alexander Cameron, Deputy Superintendent for Indian Affairs, ordered them to leave. Attakullakulla, First Beloved Man (Principal Chief) of the Cherokee, interceded on their behalf. The settlers were allowed to remain, provided no additional people joined them. On May 8, 1772, the settlers on the Watauga and on the Nolichucky signed the Watauga Compact to form the Watauga Association. =Henderson Purchase (1775)= The Wilderness Road and the Transylvania purchase. On March 17, 1775, a group of North Carolina speculators led by Richard Henderson negotiated the Treaty of Watauga at Sycamore Shoals with the older Overhill Cherokee leaders; Oconostota and Attakullakulla, the most prominent, ceded the claim of the Cherokee to the Kain-tuck-ee lands. The Transylvania Land Company believed it was gaining ownership of the land, not realizing that other tribes, such as the Lenape, Shawnee, and Chickasaw, also claimed these lands for hunting. Documented Cherokee towns like Sullen Possum in southeast Kentucky and in other areas of Kentucky did exist with links to what is called the Overhill towns and other Cherokee towns. Dragging Canoe, headman of Great Island Town and son of Attakullakulla, refused to go along with the deal. He told the North Carolina men, \\"You have bought a fair land, but there is a cloud hanging over it; you will find its settlement dark and bloody\\".Evans (1977), \\"Dragging Canoe,\\" p. 179 The governors of Virginia and North Carolina repudiated the Watauga treaty, and Henderson fled to avoid arrest. George Washington also spoke out against it. The Cherokee appealed to John Stuart, the Indian Affairs Superintendent, for help, which he had provided on previous such occasions, but the outbreak of the American Revolution intervened. Henderson and frontiersmen thought the outbreak of the Revolution superseded the judgments of the royal governors. The Transylvania Company began recruiting settlers for the region they had \\"purchased\\". Revolutionary War phase: Cherokee War of 1776 During the Revolutionary War, the Cherokee not only fought against the settlers in the Overmountain region, and later in the Cumberland Basin, defending against territorial settlements, they also fought as allies of Great Britain against American patriots. British strategy was focused on the North, and not so much on the backwoods settlements, especially those in the west. The Cherokee, therefore, were on their own, except for supplies from British ports on the coast and some joint operations in South Carolina. =Flight of the Loyalists= As tensions rose, Loyalist John Stuart, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, was besieged by a mob at his house in Charleston and had to flee for his life. His first stop was St. Augustine in East Florida.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 138 Another noted Loyalist later associated with the Cherokee, Thomas Brown, was not nearly so fortunate. In his home of Brownsborough, Georgia, near Augusta, he was assaulted by a crowd of the Sons of Liberty, tied to a tree, roasted with fire, scalped, tarred, and feathered. After his escape, he took up residence among the Seminole commanding his East Florida Rangers, who fought with them and some of the Lower Muskogee. From St. Augustine, Stuart sent his deputy, Alexander Cameron, and his brother Henry to Mobile to obtain short-term supplies and arms for the Cherokee. Dragging Canoe took a party of 80 warriors to provide security for the pack train. He met Henry Stuart and Cameron (whom he had adopted as a brother) at Mobile on March 1, 1776. He asked how he could help the British against their rebel subjects, and for help with the illegal settlers. The two men told him to wait for regular troops to arrive before taking any action. When the two arrived at Chota, Henry Stuart sent out letters to the frontier settlers. He informed them that they were illegally on Cherokee land and gave them 40 days to leave. In an exercise of propaganda, people sympathetic to the Revolution forged a letter to indicate a large force of regular troops, plus Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Muscgoee, was on the march from Pensacola and planning to pick up reinforcements from the Cherokee. The forged letters alarmed the settlers, who began gathering together in closer, fortified groups, building stations (small forts), and otherwise preparing for an attack.Evans (1977), \\"Dragging Canoe\\", pp. 180‚Äì182 Revolution in 1775, including the locations of the proposed colonies of Charlotiana, Transylvania, and Vandalia =Visit from the northern tribes= In May 1776, partly at the behest of Henry Hamilton, the British governor in Detroit,Murphy, p. 523 the Shawnee chief CornstalkBrown, Old Frontiers, pp. 141‚Äì146 led a delegation from the northern tribes (Shawnee, Lenape, Iroquois, Ottawa, others) to the southern tribes. He traveled to Chota to meet with the southern tribes (Cherokee, Muscogee, Chickasaw, Choctaw) about fighting with the British against their common enemy. Cornstalk called for united action against those they called the \\"Long Knives\\", the squatters who settled and remained in Kain-tuck-ee, or, as the settlers called it, Transylvania. At the close of his speech, Cornstalk offered his war belt, and Dragging Canoe accepted it. Dragging Canoe also accepted belts from the Ottawa and the Iroquois.Calloway, pp. 194‚Äì197 To prepare themselves for the coming campaign, the Overhill Cherokee began raiding into Kentucky, often with the Shawnee. Before the northern delegation had left, Dragging Canoe led a small war party into Kentucky and returned with four scalps to present to Cornstalk before they departed.Hoig, p. 59Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 148‚Äì149 In another raid, a war party led by Hanging Maw, captured three teenage settler girls, Jemima Boone and Elizabeth and Frances Callaway, on July 14 but lost them three days later to a rescue party led by Daniel Boone, father of Jemima, and Richard Callaway, father of Elizabeth and Frances. The Abduction of Daniel Boone's Daughter by the Indians by Charles Ferdinand Wimar (1853) =First Cherokee campaigns= In late June, war parties from the Lower Towns began attacking the frontier of South Carolina.O'Donnell, p. 40Milling, pp. 314‚Äì316 On July 1, the Out, Middle, and Valley Towns sent out war parties raiding the frontiers settlements of North Carolina east of the Blue Ridge coming down the Catawba River.Milling, p. 318 Meanwhile, traders warned the Overmountain settlers of the impending attacks from the Overhill Towns. They had come from Chota bearing word from Nancy Ward, the Beloved Woman (leader or Elder). The Cherokee offensive proved to be disastrous for the attackers. On July 3, a small war party of Cherokee besieged a small fort on the North Carolina frontier. The garrison managed to keep from being overrun until a large body of militia arrived in the rear of besiegers, who then retreated. A 190-strong war party of Cherokee and Loyalist partisans dressed as Cherokee attacked the large fort on the South Carolina frontier known as Lindley's Station. Its 150-man Patriot garrison had just finished building it the day before. After repulsing the attack, the Patriots gave chase, killing two Loyalists and capturing ten, but inflicting no casualties on the Cherokee. Dragging Canoe's forces advanced up the Great Indian Warpath and had a small skirmish with a body of militia numbering twenty who quickly withdrew. Pursuing them and intending to take Fort Lee at Long-Island-on-the-Holston, his force advanced toward the island. However, on July 20, it encountered a larger force of militia six miles from their target, about half the size of his own but desperate, in a stronger position than the small group before. During the \\"Battle of Island Flats\\" which followed, Dragging Canoe was wounded in his hip by a musket ball, and his brother Little Owl incredibly survived after being hit eleven times. His force then withdrew, raiding isolated cabins on the way and returned to the Overhill area with plunder and scalps, after raiding further north into southwestern Virginia. on July 21, Abraham of Chilhowee led his party in attempting to capture Fort Caswell on the Watauga, but his attack was driven off with heavy casualties. Instead of withdrawing, however, he put the garrison under siege, a tactic which had worked well the previous decade with Fort Loudon. After two weeks, though, he and his warriors gave that up. Savanukah's party raided from the outskirts of Carter's Valley far into the Clinch River Valley in Virginia, but those targets contained only small settlements and isolated farmsteads, so he did no real military damage. =Colonial response= The affected colonies of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia conferred and decided that swift and massive retaliation was the only way to preserve peace on the frontier. The colonials gathered militia who retaliated against the Cherokee. North Carolina sent Griffith Rutherford with 2,400 militia to scour the Oconaluftee and Tuckasegee river valleys, and the headwaters of the Little Tennessee and Hiwassee. South Carolina sent 1,800 men to the Savannah, and Georgia sent 200 to attack Cherokee settlements along the Chattahoochee and Tugaloo rivers.Milling, pp. 316‚Äì317 Not long after leaving Fort McGahey on July 23, Rutherford's militia, accompanied by a large contingent of Catawba warriors,Milling pp. 318 encountered an ambush by the Cherokee at the Battle of Cowee Gap in what is now western North Carolina.Hunter, p. 176 After defeating the attackers, he proceeded to a designated rendezvous with the South Carolina militia. On August 1, Cameron and the Cherokee ambushed Andrew Williamson and his South Carolina militia force near the Lower Cherokee town of Isunigu known to whites as Seneca, in the Battle of Twelve Mile Creek. The South Carolina Militia retreated and later joined up with the militia force of Andrew Pickens.Mays, p. 65 The next day, August 2, the joint militia force bivouacked, and Pickens led a party of 25 to forage for food and firewood. In what is known as the Ring Fight, 200 Cherokee surrounded and attacked the party, which withdrew into a ring and were able to hold their attackers at bay until reinforcements arrived. Pickens and his militia defeated the Cherokee on the Tugaloo River in the Battle of Tugaloo, which they then burned on August 10. On August 12, Williamson and Pickens defeated the Cherokee at the Battle of Tamassee. With this, they had completed their destruction of the Lower Towns, Keowee, Estatoe, Seneca, and the rest. Afterwards, they proceeded north to meet up with the North Carolina militia of Griffith Rutherford.O'Donnell, p. 47 Rutherford's militia traversed Swannanoa Gap in the Blue Ridge on September 1, and reached the outskirts of the Out, Valley, and Middle Towns on September 14, at which they started burning towns and crops.O'Donnell, p. 47 Williamson's militia were attacked at the Battle of Black Hole near Franklin, North Carolina on September 19 but were able to fend off the Cherokee and meet up with Rutherford. In all, Williamson, Pickens, and Rutherford destroyed more than 50 towns, burned the houses and food stores, destroyed the orchards, slaughtered livestock, and killed hundreds of Cherokee. They sold captives into slavery, and these were often transported to the Caribbean. Map of the Cherokee invasion of the Washington District, Pendleton District, and Carter's Valley In the meantime, the Continental Army sent Col. William Christian to the lower Little Tennessee Valley with a battalion of Continentals, 500 Virginia militia, 300 North Carolina militia, and 300 rangers.O'Donnell, p. 46 Upon reaching the Little Tennessee in late October, Christian's Virginia force found those towns from whence the militant attackers had sprung‚ÄîGreat Island, Citico (Sitiku), Toqua (Dakwayi), Tuskegee (Taskigi), Chilhowee, and Great Tellico‚Äînot only deserted but burned to the ground by their own former inhabitants, along with all the food and stores that could not be carried away.Anderson and Lewis, p. 157 =Migration to Chickamauga= Oconostota supported making peace with the colonists. Dragging Canoe called for the women, children, and old to be sent below the Hiwassee and for the warriors to burn the towns, then ambush the Virginians at the French Broad River. Oconostota, Attakullakulla, and the older chiefs decided against that plan. Oconostota sent word to the approaching colonial army, offering to exchange Dragging Canoe and Cameron if the Overhill Towns were spared. Dragging Canoe spoke to the council of the Overhill Towns, denouncing the older leaders as rogues and \\"Virginians\\" for their willingness to cede land for an ephemeral safety. He concluded, \\"As for me, I have my young warriors about me. We will have our lands.\\" Alderman, p. 38Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 161 Afterward, he and other militant leaders, including Ostenaco, gathered like-minded Cherokee from the Overhill, Valley, and Hill towns, and migrated to what is now the Chattanooga, Tennessee area, where the Great Indian Warpath crossed the Chickamauga River (South Chickamauga Creek). Since Dragging Canoe made that town his seat of operations, frontier Americans called his faction the \\"Chickamaugas\\". Other Cherokee refugees turned up in Pensacola and wintered there. John McDonald already had a trading post across the Chickamauga River. This provided a link to Henry Stuart, brother of John, in the West Florida capital of Pensacola. Cameron, the British deputy Indian superintendent, accompanied Dragging Canoe to Chickamauga. Nearly all the whites legally resident among the Cherokee were part of the related exodus.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 161, 163 The eleven towns in the Chickamauga area, along with the Hiwassee towns and the towns on the Tellico In March 1777, Cameron sent the refugees to Chickamauga along with a sizable amount of goods. The colonials learned of the materiel and planned to intercept it. When Cameron informed him of the danger, Emistisigua, Paramount Chief of the Upper Muscogee, sent a force of 350 warriors to guard them as well as to assist in rebuilding and waging war.Anderson and Lewis, pp. 157‚Äì158 =Treaties of 1777= Preliminary negotiations between the Overhill Towns and Virginia were held at Fort Patrick Henry in April 1777. Nathaniel Gist, later father of Sequoyah, led the talks for Virginia, while Attakullakulla, Oconostota, and Savanukah headed the delegation of Cherokee. The Cherokee signed the Treaty of Dewitt's Corner with Georgia and South Carolina on May 20 and the Treaty of Fort Henry with Virginia and North Carolina on July 20. They promised to stop warring, with those colonies promising in return to protect them from attack. In the Treaty of Dewitt's Corner, the Lower Towns ceded all their land in modern South Carolina except for a small strip in what is now Oconee County. One provision of the Treaty of Fort Henry required that James Robertson and a small garrison be quartered at Chota on the Little Tennessee. He had been appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for North Carolina, while Joseph Martin had been appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Virginia.Moore and Foster, p. 168O'Donnell, pp. 57‚Äì59 =Targets of the Cherokee= From their new bases, the Cherokee conducted raids against settlers on the Holston, Doe, Watauga, and Nolichucky rivers, on the Cumberland and Red rivers, and those in the isolated frontier stations in between. The Cherokee ambushed parties traveling on the Tennessee River, and on local sections of the many ancient trails that served as \\"highways\\", such as the Great Indian Warpath (Mobile to northeast Canada), the Cisca and St. Augustine Trail (St. Augustine to the French Salt Lick at Nashville), the Cumberland Trail (from the Upper Creek Path to the Great Lakes), and the Nickajack Trail (Nickajack to Augusta). Later, the Cherokee stalked the Natchez Trace and roads improved by the uninvited settlers, such as the Kentucky, Cumberland, and Walton roads. Occasionally, the Cherokee attacked targets in Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky, and the Ohio country.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 161‚Äì172 In contempt of the peace proceedings at Fort Henry in April 1777, Dragging Canoe led a war party that killed a settler named Frederick Calvitt and stole 15 horses from James Robertson, then moved to Carter's Valley, killing the grandparents of David Crockett along with several children near the modern Rogersville, and marauding across the valley. In all the raiders took twelve scalps.Brown, pp. 162‚Äì163 In summer 1777, Deputy Superintendents Cameron and Taitt led a large contingent of Cherokee and Muscogee warriors against the back country settlements of the Carolinas and Georgia.Anderson and Lewis, p. 160 The Cherokee established a camp at the confluence of the Tennessee and Ohio Rivers (near present-day Paducah, Kentucky) to prevent infiltration into the Mississippi in the spring of 1778.Anderson and Lewis, p. 163 Revolutionary War phase: Southern strategy (1778‚Äì1783) In late 1778, British strategy shifted south. As their attention went, so too did their efforts, their armies, and their supplies, including those slated for the Southern Indians. The Southern theater had the added advantage of being home to more Loyalists than the North. With all these new advantages, the Cherokee were able to greatly renew their territorial defense. Both the Cherokee and the Upper Creek signed on for active participation.Anderson and Lewis, p. 164 =British victory in the North= On December 17, 1778, Henry Hamilton captured Fort Vincennes and used it as a base to plan a spring offensive against George Rogers Clark, whose forces had recently seized control of much of the Illinois Country. His plans were to assemble 500 warriors from various Indian nations, including the Cherokee, the Chickasaw, the Shawnee, and others, for a campaign to expel Clark's forces back east, then drive through Kentucky clearing American settlements. McDonald's headquarters at Chickamauga was to be the staging ground and commissary for the Cherokee and the Muscogee.Goodpasture, p. 37 Clark recaptured Fort Vincennes, and Hamilton along with it, on February 25, 1779, after the Siege of Fort Vincennes. The Chickamauga Cherokee turned their sights to the northeast. =Battles in the Deep South= The British captured Savannah on December 29, 1778, with help from Dragging Canoe, John McDonald, and the Cherokee, along with McGillivray's Upper Muscogee force and McIntosh's band of Hitichiti warriors. Just over a month later, January 31, 1779, they captured Augusta, Georgia, as well, though they quickly had to retreat. With these victories, the remaining neutral towns of the Lower Muscogee Threw in their lot with the British side.O'Donnell, pp. 95‚Äì108 Thomas Brown of the King's Carolina Rangers was assigned to the Atlantic District to work with the Cherokee, Muscogee, and Seminole.O'Donnell, p. 89 Charlestown was captured on May 12, 1780, after a siege that began March 29. Along with it, the British took prisoner some 3,000 Patriots, including South Carolina militia leader Andrew Williamson. Upon giving his parole that he would not again take up arms, Williamson became a double agent for the Patriots, according to testimony after the war by Patriot General Nathanael Greene.Toulmin =Fort Nashborough= In early 1779, Robertson and John Donelson traveled overland along the Kentucky Road and founded Fort Nashborough on the Cumberland River. It was the first of many such settlements in the Cumberland area, which subsequently became the focus of attacks by all the tribes in the surrounding region. Leaving a small group there, both returned east. In autumn 1779, Robertson and a group of fellow Wataugans left the east down the Kentucky Road headed for Fort Nashborough. They arrived on Christmas Day 1779 without incident. Donelson journeyed down the Tennessee River with a party that included his family, intending to go across to the mouth of the Cumberland, then upriver to Fort Nashborough. They departed the East Tennessee settlements on February 27, 1780. Eventually, the group did reach its destination, but only after being ambushed several times. In the first encounter near Tuskegee Island on March 7, the Cherokee warriors under Bloody Fellow attacked the boat in the rear. Its passengers had come down with smallpox. They took as captive the one survivor, who was later ransomed by American colonists. The victory proved to be a pyrrhic one for the Cherokee, a smallpox epidemic spread among its people, killing several hundred in the vicinity. Several miles downriver, beginning with the obstruction known as the Suck or the Kettle, the party was fired upon throughout their passage through the Tennessee River Gorge (Cash Canyon); one person died and several were wounded. At Muscle Shoals, the Donelson party was attacked by Muscogee and Chickasaw, up into Hardin County, Tennessee. The Donelson party reached its destination on April 24, 1780. The group included John's daughter Rachel, the future wife of future U.S. Representative, Senator, and President Andrew Jackson, who fought a duel in her honor in 1806. Shortly after his party's arrival at Fort Nashborough, Donelson along with Robertson and others formed the Cumberland Compact. =Overmountain theatre= Robertson heard warning from Chota that Dragging Canoe's warriors were going to attack the Holston area. In addition, he had received intelligence that McDonald's place was the staging area for the northern campaign that Hamilton had been planning to conduct, and that a stockpile of supplies equivalent to that of 100 packhorses was stored there. Small parties of Cherokee began repeated small raids on the Holston frontier shortly thereafter.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 172‚Äì173 Lieutenant Colonel John Sevier In the summer of 1780, Thomas Brown planned to have a joint conference between the Cherokee and Muscogee to plan ways to coordinate their attacks, but those plans were forestalled when Georgians under Elijah Clarke made a concerted effort to retake Augusta in September, where he had his headquarters. His King's Carolina Rangers and 50 Muscogee warriors formed the entire garrison against Clarke's 700 fighters. The arrival of a sizable war party from the Chickamauga and Overhill Towns and a force from Fort Ninety-Six in South Carolina prevented the capture of both, and the Cherokee and Brown's rangers chased Elijah Clarke's army into the arms of John Sevier, wreaking havoc on rebellious settlements along the way.O'Donnell, pp. 103‚Äì104 This set the stage for the Battle of Kings Mountain October 7, 1780, in which Loyalist militia American Volunteers under Patrick Ferguson moved south trying to encircle Clarke; they were defeated by a force of 900 frontiersmen under Sevier and William Campbell, who were referred to as the Overmountain Men. Brown, aware that nearly 1,000 men were away from the American settlements with the militias, urged Dragging Canoe and other Cherokee leaders to strike while they had the opportunity. Under the influence of Savanukah, the Overhill Towns gave their full support to the new offensive. Both Brown and the Cherokee had been expecting a quick victory by Patrick Ferguson and were stunned that he suffered such a resounding defeat so soon. But their planned assault on the settlements was in motion.O'Donnell, pp. 105‚Äì106 Learning of the new invasion from Nancy Ward (her second documented betrayal of Dragging Canoe), Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson sent an expedition of 700 Virginians and North Carolinians against the Cherokee in December 1780, under the command of Sevier. The expedition routed a Cherokee war party at the Battle of Boyd's Creek on December 16.Mooney, pp. 57‚Äì58 After that battle, Sevier's army was joined by forces under Arthur Campbell and Joseph Martin. The combined force marched against the Overhill towns on the Little Tennessee and the Hiwassee, burning seventeen of them, including Chota, Chilhowee, the original Citico, Tellico, Great Hiwassee, and Chestowee, finishing up on January 1, 1781. Afterwards, the Overhill leaders withdrew from further active conflict for a time, though warriors from the Middle and Valley Towns continued to harass colonists on the frontier.O'Donnell, p. 107 Not long after returning home from his destruction of the Overhill towns, Sevier had received word that the warriors from the Middle Towns were bent on revenge. At the beginning of March, Sevier raised a force for a campaign against the Middle and Out Towns east of the mountains. Beginning at Tuckasegee and ending at Cowee, they burned 15 towns, killed 29 Cherokee, and took 9 prisoners.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 196Mooney, pp. 58‚Äì59 While Dragging Canoe and his warriors turned their attentions to the Cumberland, the Shawnee began raiding settlements in Upper East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, the latter by now having become Washington County. In particular they targeted those along the Clinch and Holston Rivers and in Powell's Valley. These Shawnee came down from their homes on the Ohio River by way of the Warriors' Path through the Cumberland Gap. Their attacks continued, along with occasional forays by McGillivray's Upper Muscogee, even after sporadic raids by the Cherokee renewed, until they began to focus all their attention on the Northwest Indian War.Summers, pp. 361‚Äì443 In midsummer 1781, a party of Cherokee came west over the mountains and began raiding the new settlements on the French Broad River. Sevier raised a force of 150 and attacked their camp on Indian Creek.Mooney, p. 59 On July 26, 1781, the Overhill Towns signed the second Treaty of Long-Island-on-the-Holston, this time directly with the Overmountain settlements. In response to incursions by new settlers beyond the limits of the treaties, warriors from the Chickamauga Towns began harassing the Holston frontier in the spring and summer of 1782. In September, an expedition under Sevier once again destroyed many of the towns in the Chickamauga vicinity, and those Cherokee of the former Lower Towns now in North Georgia, from Buffalo Town at the modern Ringgold, Georgia south to Ustanali (Ustanalahi) near modern Calhoun, Georgia, including what he called Vann's Town, as well as Ellijay and Coosawattee. Most of the towns were deserted because having advance warning of the impending attack, Dragging Canoe and his fellow leaders chose relocation westward. Meanwhile, Sevier's army, guided by John Watts, somehow never managed to cross paths with any parties of Cherokee. =Attacks at Chickamauga= At the beginning of April 1779, a group of 300 Cherokee and 50 Loyalist Rangers under Walter Scott, left the Chickamauga Towns headed for a marauding campaign against the frontier settlements in Georgia and South Carolina.Anderson and Lewis, p. 166 Hearing of their departure, Joseph Martin, Indian agent for the Americans at Chota, sent word to Governor Patrick Henry of their absence.O'Donnell, pp. 83‚Äì84 The state governments of Virginia and North Carolina made a joint decision to send an expedition against the Chickamauga Towns, who were thought to be responsible for the raids. Most of those warriors, however, were in South Carolina with Cameron and Dragging Canoe. A thousand Overmountain men under Evan Shelby (father of Isaac Shelby, first governor of the State of Kentucky) and a regiment of Continentals under John Montgomery disembarked on April 10, boating down the Tennessee in a fleet of dugout canoes.Ramsey, p. 186 They arrived in the Chickamauga towns ten days later. For the next two weeks, they destroyed the eleven towns in the immediate area, and most of the food supply, along with McDonald's home, store, and commissary. Because the warriors were on a campaign in Georgia and South Carolina, there was no resistance and only four deaths among the inhabitants. Whatever was not destroyed was confiscated and sold at what became known as Sale Creek.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 173 Timberlake's \\"Draught of the Cherokee Country\\", showing the location of the Overhill towns on the Little Tennessee River (labeled Tennessee River on the map) Upon hearing of the devastation of the towns and loss of all their stores, Dragging Canoe, McDonald, and their men, including the Rangers, returned to Chickamauga and its vicinity.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 174 The Shawnee sent envoys to Chickamauga to find out if the destruction had caused Dragging Canoe's people to lose the will to fight, along with a sizable detachment of warriors to assist them. In response to their inquiries, Dragging Canoe held up the war belts he had accepted when the delegation visited Chota in 1776, and said, \\"We are not yet conquered\\".Evans, \\"Dragging Canoe\\", p. 184 To cement the alliance, the Cherokee responded to the Shawnee gesture by sending nearly 100 warriors north. The towns in the Chickamauga area were rebuilt. Dragging Canoe responded to the Shelby expedition with punitive raids on the frontiers of both North Carolina and Virginia.Anderson and Lewis, p. 193 In midsummer 1779, Cameron arrived at Chickamauga with a company of Loyalist Refugees and convinced the Cherokee to join them on their march to South Carolina. Three hundred took up arms and headed out to maraud the backcountry of Georgia and South Carolina. Later in October, Andrew Williamson's South Carolina militia responded by attacking several towns on the eastern frontier of Cherokee territory and burning their foodstores.O'Donnell, pp. 84‚Äì85Anderson and Lewis, p. 25 =Chickasaw-American war= The Chickasaw transformed from river sentries into attacking warriors in June 1780 when George Rogers Clark and a party of over 500, including some Kaskaskia of the Illinois Confederation, built Fort Jefferson and the surrounding settlement of Clarksville near the mouth of the Ohio, inside their hunting grounds. The building had begun in April and finished before the first attack on June 7. After learning of the trespass, the Chickasaw destroyed the settlement, laid siege to the fort, and began attacking settlers on the Kentucky frontier. They continued attacking the Cumberland and into Kentucky through early the following year. Their last raid was in conjunction with Dragging Canoe's Cherokee, upon Freeland's Station on the Cumberland on January 11, 1781. Three months after the first Chickasaw attack on the Cumberland, on April 2, 1781, the Cherokee launched their largest campaign of the wars against those settlements. This culminated in what became known as the Battle of the Bluff, led by Dragging Canoe. It lasted through to the next day and was the last attack of this war. Afterward, settlers began to abandon these frontier settlements until only three stations were left, a condition which lasted until 1785.Moore, pp. 180‚Äì182 =Lenape refugees= While the Middle Towns warriors kept the Overmountain Men busy, the Chickamauga Towns welcome a sizable party of Lenape warriors seeking refuge from the fighting in the Illinois and Ohio Countries. These were not just warriors down south temporarily but permanent settlers who brought their families.Anderson and Lewis, p. 21 =Politics in the Overhill Towns= In the fall of 1781, the British engineered a coup d'√©tat of sorts that put Savanukah as First Beloved Man in place of the more pacifist Oconostota, who succeeded Attakullakulla. For the next two years, the Overhill Cherokee openly, as they had been doing covertly, supported the efforts of Dragging Canoe and his militant Cherokee. =Death of Alexander Cameron= On December 27, 1781, Alexander Cameron, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Mississippi District, blood brother to Dragging Canoe, and friend to all Cherokee, died in Savannah. He was replaced by John Graham. =Diplomatic mission to Fort St. Louis= A party of Cherokee joined the Lenape, Shawnee, and Chickasaw in a diplomatic visit to the Spanish at Fort St. Louis in the Missouri country in March 1782 seeking a new avenue of obtaining arms and other assistance in the prosecution of their ongoing conflict with the Americans in the Ohio Valley. One group of Cherokee at this meeting led by Standing Turkey (Conocotocko) sought and received permission to settle in Spanish Louisiana, in the region of the White River.Tanner, p. 99 =Migration to the Lower Towns= Upon finishing their move, Dragging Canoe and his people established what whites called the Five Lower Towns downriver from the various natural obstructions in the 26-mile Tennessee River Gorge, known locally as Cash Canyon. Starting with Tuskegee (aka Brown's or Williams') Island and the sandbars on either side of it, these obstructions included the Tumbling Shoals, the Holston Rock, the Kettle (or Suck), the Suck Shoals, the Deadman's Eddy, the Pot, the Skillet, the Pan, and, finally, the Narrows, ending with Hale's Bar. The whole 26 miles was sometimes called The Suck, and the stretch of river was notorious enough to merit mention even by Thomas Jefferson.Moore, p. 182 These navigational hazards were so formidable, in fact, that the French agents attempting to travel upriver to reach Cherokee country during the French and Indian War, intending to establish an outpost at the spot later occupied by British agent McDonald, gave up after several attempts. The Five Lower Towns included Running Water (Amogayunyi), at the current Whiteside in Marion County, Tennessee, where Dragging Canoe made his headquarters; Nickajack (Ani-Kusati- yi, or Koasati place), eight kilometers down the Tennessee River; Long Island (Amoyeligunahita), on the Tennessee just above the Great Creek Crossing; Crow Town (Kagunyi) on the Tennessee, at the mouth of Crow Creek; and Stecoyee (Utsutigwayi, Lookout Mountain Town), at the current site of Trenton, Georgia. Tuskegee Island Town was reoccupied as a lookout post by a small band of warriors to provide advance warning of invasions, and eventually many other settlements in the area were resettled as well.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 175 Because this was a move into the outskirts of Muscogee territory, Dragging Canoe, knowing such a move might be necessary, had previously sent a delegation under Little Owl to meet with Alex McGillivray, the major Muscogee leader in the area, to gain their permission. When the Cherokee moved their base, so too did John McDonald, now deputy to Thomas Brown, along with his own assistant Daniel Ross, making Running Water the base of operations. Graham's deputy, Alexander Campbell, set up his own base at what became Turkeytown. Cherokee continued to migrate westward to join Dragging Canoe's militant band. Many in this influx were Cherokee from North Georgia, who fled the depredations of expeditions such as those of Sevier; a large majority of these were former inhabitants of the original Lower Towns. Cherokee from the Middle, or Hill, Towns also came, a group of whom established a town named Sawtee (Itsati) at the mouth of South Sauta Creek on the Tennessee. Later major settlements included Willstown (Titsohiliyi) near the later Fort Payne; Turkeytown (Gundigaduhunyi), at the head of the Cumberland Trail where the Upper Creek Path crossed the Coosa River near Centre, Alabama; Creek Path (Kusanunnahiyi), near at the intersection of the Great Indian Warpath with the Upper Creek Path at the modern Guntersville, Alabama; Turnip Town (Ulunyi), 7 miles from the present-day Rome, Georgia; and Chatuga (Tsatugi), nearer the site of Rome. Partly because of the large influx from North Georgia added to the fact that they were no longer occupying the Chickamauga area as their main center, Dragging Canoe's followers and others in the area began to be referred to as the Lower Cherokee. The ranks of these new Lower Cherokee were further swelled by runaway slaves, white Tories, Muscogee, Yuchi, Natchez, and Shawnee, plus a few Spanish, French, Irish, and Germans. The town Coosada came into the coalition when its Koasati and Kaskinampo inhabitants joined Dragging Canoe's coalition. The band of Chickasaw living at Ditto's Landing south of Huntsville, Alabama, also joined the coalition. The rest of the Chickasaw, however, were trying to play the Americans and the Spanish against each other with no interest in the British. =Cherokees to the North= In November 1782, twenty representatives from four northern tribes‚ÄîWyandot, Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Potowatami‚Äîtraveled south to consult with Dragging Canoe and his lieutenants at his new headquarters in Running Water Town, which was nestled far back up the hollow from the Tennessee River onto which it opened. Their mission was to gain the help of Dragging Canoe's Cherokee in attacking Pittsburgh and the American settlements in Kentucky and the Illinois country. When the party returned north, Turtle-at-Home, brother of Dragging Canoe, took 70 warriors north to fight alongside the Shawnee. At the beginning of 1783, there were at least three major communities of Cherokee in the region. One lived among the Chalahgawtha (Chillicothe) Shawnee. The second Cherokee community lived among the mixed Wyandot-Mingo towns on the upper Mad River near the later Zanesfield, Ohio.Tanner, pp. 101 A third group of Cherokee is known to have lived among and fought with the Munsee-Lenape, the only portion of the Lenape nation at war with the Americans. Though filled by different warriors shifted back and forth, these three bands remained in the northwest until after the Treaty of Greenville in 1795.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 204‚Äì205 =Georgia Indian war of 1782= At the end of 1781, the Cherokee invaded Georgia once again with a group of Muscogee, this time being met by South Carolina and Georgia troops under Andrew Pickens and Elijah Clarke at the Oconee River after much back country raiding. Evading the American force, the Cherokee withdrew, adopting a scorched earth strategy to deny their foes supplies. The force eventually retreated, opening the back country to further raids.Mooney, p. 59‚Äì60 By the fall of 1782, Lt. Col. Thomas Waters of the Loyalist Rangers, formerly stationed at Fort Ninety-Six in South Carolina, had retreated to the frontier of Cherokee-Muscogee territory just outside Georgia. From his base at the mouth of Long Swamp Creek on Etowah River, he and his remaining rangers, in conjunction with Cherokee and Muscogee warriors, ravaged backwoods homesteads and settlements. The states of South Carolina and Georgia sent out a joint expedition led by Andrew Pickens and Elijah Clarke to put an end to his insurgency. Leaving September 16, they invaded that section of the country, ranging at least as far as Ustanali, where they took prisoners. In all they destroyed thirteen towns and villages. By October 22, Waters and his men had escaped and the Cherokee sued for peace.O'Donnell, pp. 126‚Äì127 =St. Augustine conference= In January 1783, Dragging Canoe and 1,200 Cherokee traveled to St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, for a summit meeting with a delegation of western tribes (Shawnee, Muscogee, Mohawk, Seneca, Lenape, Mingo, Tuscarora, and Choctaw) called for a federation of Indians to oppose the Americans and their frontier colonists. Brown, the British Indian Superintendent, approved the concept.Calloway, p. 264 At Tuckabatchee a few months later, a general council of the major southern tribes (Cherokee, Muscogee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole) plus representatives of smaller groups (Mobile, Catawba, Biloxi, Huoma, etc.) took place to follow up, but plans for the federation were cut short by the signing of the Treaty of Paris. Signed May 30, 1783, the treaty confirmed the northern boundary between the State of Georgia and the Cherokee, with the Cherokee ceding large amounts of land between the Savannah and Chattachoochee Rivers.Evans, \\"Dragging Canoe\\", p. 185 =Overhill politics= In the fall of 1783, the older pacifist leaders replaced Savanukah with another of their number, Corntassel (Kaiyatsatahi, known to history as \\"Old Tassel\\"), and sent messages of peace along with complaints of settler encroachment to Virginia and North Carolina.Mooney, Myths and Sacred Formulas, p. 60 Opposition from pacifist leaders, however, never stopped war parties from traversing the territories of any of the town groups, largely because the average Cherokee supported their cause, nor did it stop small war parties of the Overhill Towns from raiding settlements in East Tennessee, mostly those on the Holston. =Treaty of Paris (1783)= Signed between Great Britain and the United States on September 3, 1783, the Treaty of Paris treaty formally ended the American Revolution. The U.S. had already unilaterally declared hostilities over the previous April. Brown had already received orders from London in June to cease and desist. Following that treaty, Dragging Canoe turned to the Spanish (who still claimed all the territory south of the Cumberland and were now working against the Americans) for support, trading primarily through Pensacola and Mobile. Dragging Canoe also maintained relations with the British governor at Detroit, Alexander McKee, through regular diplomatic missions there under his brothers Little Owl and The Badger (Ukuna).Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 270 With the end of the Revolutionary War, new settlers began flooding into the Overmountain settlements. The reaction from the Cherokee was predictable, only it did not come from the towns on the lower Little Tennessee. Instead, warriors from the Middle Towns east of the mountains on the upper Little Tennessee began retaliation against the settlements on the west side, targeting the newer ones on the Pigeon and French Broad rivers. In late 1783, Major Peter Fine raised a small militia and crossed the mountains to the east side and burned down the town of Cowee.Ramsey, p. 280 =Treaties with the Chickasaw and Muscogee= The Chickasaw signed the Treaty of French Lick with the new United States of America on November 6, 1783, and never again took up arms against it. The Lower Cherokee were also present at the conference and apparently made some sort of agreement to cease their attacks on the Cumberland, for after this Americans settlements in the area began to grow again. Also in November 1783, the pro-American camp of the Lower Muscogee nation signed the Treaty of Augusta with Georgia, ceding their claims to territory in northern Georgia known as the Oconee Country, after the tribe who lived there. This enraged McGillivray, who wanted to keep fighting; he burned the houses of the leaders responsible and sent warriors to raid Georgia settlements.Braund, p. 171 Post-Revolution: New directions (1783‚Äì1788) =Spanish alliance= The Spanish now held East Florida and West Florida in addition to Louisiana, Tejas, Nuevo Mexico, and Nueva California. Partly to hold the Americans at bay and partly to regain lost parts of La Florida, they armed and supplied the Southern Indians both to curry favor and to encourage them to turn their weapons on the frontier settlements. Largely through the efforts of Alex McGillivray, the Spanish signed the Treaty of Pensacola for alliance and commerce with the Upper Muscogee and the Lower Cherokee on May 30, 1784. On June 22, 1784, the Treaty of Mobile was signed with the Choctaw and the Alabama. The Chickasaw, also at this conference, refused to sign because of their treaty with the Americans. With the signing of these two treaties, McDonald and Ross relocated to Turkeytown to consolidate their efforts and business with those of Campbell closer to their Spanish suppliers and to the British trading house of Panton, Leslie & Company in Pensacola. Sponsored by the Spanish, Running Water Town hosted a grand council of western nations and tribes in the summer of 1785 to formulate a strategy for resisting encroachment by settlers from the new United States. Besides the Chickamauga Cherokee, the Upper Muscogee and the Choctaw attended from the South, while representatives from the Shawnee, Lenape, Mingo, Miami, Illinois, Wyandot, Ottawa, Mohawk, Kickapoo, Kaskaskia, Odawa, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, Wabash Confederacy, and the Iroquois League, came from the North. The same parties met again under sponsorship of the British at Detroit in the fall of 1785. The parties at these two councils agreed among themselves and with their sponsors to deal with the Americans as a unit. This laid the groundwork for the confederacy formally established the next year.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 245‚Äì246 =Overmountain region= With these assurances of support, the Cherokee of the Lower Towns renewed raiding the Overmountain settlements that summer. These remained only sporadic until the fall, when an incident between one of the settlers, James Hubbard, and a noted Cherokee leader in the Overhill Towns, Noonday, brought the younger Overhill warriors into the fight and incited them all to more violence.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 240‚Äì241Roosevelt, p. 50 This could be considered the start of a Southwest Indian War, fought by the Cherokee and later the Muscogee too. State of Franklin In May 1785, the settlements of Upper East Tennessee, then comprising four counties of western North Carolina, petitioned the Congress of the Confederation to be recognized as the \\"State of Franklin\\". Even though their petition failed to receive the two-thirds votes necessary to qualify, they proceeded to organize what amounted to a secessionist government, holding their first \\"state\\" assembly in December 1785. One of their chief motives was to retain the foothold they had recently gained in the Cumberland Basin. The Cumberland settlements were included in the government, but being separated by a wide stretch of hostile Cherokee territory, they were essentially autonomous. One of the first acts of the new State of Franklin was to negotiate with the Overhill Towns the Treaty of Dumplin Creek, signed on June 10, 1785, which ceded the \\"territory south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers and west of the Big Pigeon River and east of the ridge dividing Little River from the Tennessee River\\" to the State of Franklin. The Cherokee in the Overhill, Hill, and Valley Towns signed the Treaty of Hopewell with the United States government on November 28, 1785, under duress, the frontier colonials by this time having spread further along the Holston and onto the French Broad. Several leaders from the Lower Cherokee signed, including two from Chickamauga Town (which had been rebuilt) and one from Stecoyee. =Oconee War= In spring 1785, McGillivray had convened a council of war at the dominant Upper Muscogee town of Tuckabatchee about recent incursions of Georgian settlers into the Oconee territory. The council, attended by most of the nations and tribes of the soon-to-be Western Confederacy, decided to go on the warpath against the trespassers, starting with the recent settlements along the Oconee River. McGillivray had already secured support from the Spanish in New Orleans. This began the Oconee War, which lasted from May 1785 until September 1794.Frank Georgia officials signed a new treaty with a few compliant Lower Muscogee micos (headmen) in which the latter ceded the land between the Altamaha and St. Mary's Rivers, and from the head of the latter to the Oconee River. They called this wide stretch of land the Tallassee Country, after the tribe which lived there. =Houston County, Georgia= After the Hopewell Treaty, the legislature of the State of Georgia, which claimed all of what became Mississippi Territory created Houston County, to take in the Great Bend of the Tennessee River. The project was a joint venture between Georgia and the State of Franklin. To stake their claim, Valentine Sevier and 90 men went south to what is now South Pittsburg, Tennessee, and built a stockaded settlement and blockhouse in early December 1785.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 215 The chosen location lay midway between Nickajack and Long Island towns of the Chickamauga-Lower Cherokee. By mid-January 1786, the pioneers tired of the constant life-or-death fighting and ended the project. The Houston County project collapsed, leaving the name open for the current Houston County, Georgia, established in 1821.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 251 In order to prevent a re-occurrence, the Cherokee established the town of Crowmocker on Battle Creek near the site of the Civil War-era Fort McCook. =Spanish conspiracy= Coat of arms of the House of Bourbon in Spain Starting in 1786, the leaders of the State of Franklin and the Cumberland District began secret negotiations with Esteban Rodr√≠guez Mir√≥, governor of Spanish Louisiana, to deliver their regions to the jurisdiction of the Spanish Empire. Those involved included James Robertson, Daniel Smith, and Anthony Bledsoe of the Cumberland District; John Sevier and Joseph Martin of the State of Franklin; James White, recently appointed American Superintendent for Southern Indian Affairs; and James Wilkinson, governor of Kentucky.Green, pp. 120‚Äì138Ramsey, pp. 523‚Äì540 The irony lay in the fact that the Spanish backed the Cherokee and Muscogee harassing their territories. Mir√≥'s negotiations with Wilkinson, initiated by the latter, to bring Kentucky into Spanish control also were separate but simultaneous. The conspiracy went as far as the Franklin and Cumberland officials promising to take the oath of loyalty to Spain and renounce allegiance to any other nation. Robertson even successfully petitioned the North Carolina assembly create the \\"Mero Judicial District\\" for the three Cumberland counties (Davidson, Sumner, Tennessee). There was a convention held in the failing State of Franklin on the question, and those present voted in its favor. A large part of their motivation, besides the desire to secede from North Carolina, was the hope that this course of action would bring relief from Indian attacks. The series of negotiations involved Alex McGillivray, with Robertson and Bledsoe writing him of the Miro District's peaceful intentions toward the Muscogee and simultaneously sending White as emissary to Gardoqui to convey news of their overture.Henderson, Chap. XX =Cherokee war of 1786= Conflict erupted largely because of dissatisfaction over the Treaty of Hopewell, the flames of which were fanned by Dragging Canoe. In the east, it primarily involved warriors from the Overhill and Valley Towns against Franklin, while the Lower Towns to the west primarily raided the Cumberland. In large part elated by their crushing defeat of the attempted Houston County, Cherokee warriors from the Lower Towns raided the Franklin settlements in small parties throughout the spring of 1786. First attacking a homestead on Beaver Creek near the newly established White's Fort (at the modern Knoxville, Tennessee) on July 20, they dispersed into small parties raiding the upper Holston and other parts of Franklin.Mooney, p. 63 Throughout the summer of 1786, Dragging Canoe and his warriors along with a large contingent of Muscogee raided the Cumberland region, with several parties raiding well into Kentucky. After the rise of the \\"local\\" Cherokee, Sevier responded with a force under joint command of Alexander Outlaw and William Cocke, which drove off the raiders from the Holston before marching for Coyatee near the mouth of the Little Tennessee. Once there, they burned the crops and the town's council house. Meanwhile, Sevier led another expedition across the mountains to attack the Valley Towns on the headwaters of the Hiwassee.Gilmore, John Sevier, pp. 75‚Äì84 The end result was the Treaty of Coyatee on August 3, 1786, in which the State of Franklin forced Corntassel, Hanging Maw, Watts, and the other Overhill leaders to cede the remaining land between the boundary set by the Dumplin Treaty and the Little Tennessee River to the State of Franklin.Faulkner, pp. 23, 107Goodpasture, pp. 140‚Äì141Williams, History of the Lost State of Franklin, p. 103 =Formation of the Western Confederacy= In addition to the small bands still operating with the Shawnee, Wyandot-Mingo, and Lenape in the Northwest, a large contingent of Cherokee led by The Glass (Tagwadihi) attended and took an active role in a grand council of western tribes (Six Nations Iroquois, Wyandot, Lenape, Shawnee, Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawotami, Twigtis, Wabash Confedracy, and, of course, the Cherokee themselves) lasting November 28 ‚Äì December 18, 1786, in the Wyandot town of Upper Sandusky just south of the British capital of Detroit.Lowrie and Clarke, Indian Affairs, p. 8 British agents attended, and zealous warriors brought recently acquired scalps.Roosevelt, p. 51 This meeting, initiated by Joseph Brant, the Mohawk leader who was head chief of the Iroquois Six Nations and like Dragging Canoe fought on the side of the British during the American Revolution, led to the formation of the Western Confederacy to resist American incursions into the Old Northwest. Dragging Canoe and his Cherokee were full members of the Confederacy. The purpose of the Confederacy was to coordinate attacks and defense in the Northwest Indian War of 1785‚Äì1795. According to John Norton, Brant's adopted son, it was here in the north that The Glass formed a friendship with his adopted father that lasted well into the 19th century.Klink and Talman, p. 49 The passage of the Northwest Ordinance by the Congress of the Confederation in 1787, establishing the Northwest Territory and essentially giving away the land upon which they lived, only exacerbated the resentment of the tribes in the region. =Trouble with Franklin and Kentucky= In early 1787, encroachments by American settlers became so great that the Overhill Towns held a council on whether to completely abandon their homes on the Little Tennessee for more removed locations to the west. They elected to stay, but the crisis provoked another rise in the small-scale raiding which never really ceased completely. The situation of the Overhill Cherokee was so bad that refugees appeared in Muscogee towns, and the Chickasaw threatened to break the treaty of 1783 and go on the warpath if something were not done to alleviate the situation.Lowrie and Clarke, Indian Affairs, pp. 46‚Äì48 Though they provided auxiliary support against Franklin, the Cherokee of the Lower Towns, playing their role as members of the confederacy, had made Kentucky the target of most of their efforts. A sally from the Kentucky militia led by John Logan mistakenly attacked a hunting party from the Overhill Towns and killed several of its members. In their non- apology to Chota, the Kentuckians warned the Overhill Towns to control Dragging Canoe's warriors or there would be widespread indiscriminate revenge.Roosevelt, pp. 203‚Äì205 =Coldwater Indian war (1785‚Äì1787)= Cumberland River watershed Around 1785, Cherokee and Muscogee warriors bgan to gather in Coldwater town, who then attacked the American settlements along the Cumberland and its environs. The fighting contingent eventually numbered approximately 9 Frenchmen, 35 Cherokee, and 10 Muscogee. Because the townsite was well-hidden and its presence unannounced, James Robertson, commander of the militia in the Cumberland's Davidson and Sumner Counties, at first accused the Lower Cherokee of the new offensives. In 1787, he marched his men to their borders in a show of force, but without an actual attack, then sent an offer of peace to Running Water. In answer, Dragging Canoe sent a delegation of leaders led by Little Owl to Nashville under a flag of truce to explain that his Cherokee were not the responsible parties. Meanwhile, the attacks continued. At the time of the conference in Nashville, two Chickasaw out hunting game along the Tennessee in the vicinity of Muscle Shoals chanced upon Coldwater Town, where they were warmly received and spent the night. Upon returning home to Chickasaw Bluffs, now Memphis, Tennessee, they informed their head man, Piomingo, of their discovery. Piomingo then sent runners to Nashville. Just after these runners had arrived in Nashville, a war party attacked one of its outlying settlements, killing Robertson's brother Mark. In response, Robertson raised a group of 150 volunteers and proceeded south by a circuitous land route, guided by two Chickasaw. Somehow catching the town off guard despite the fact they knew Robertson's force was approaching, they chased its defenders to the river, killing about half of them and wounding many of the rest. They then gathered all the trade goods in the town to be shipped to Nashville by boat, burned the town, and departed.Moore, pp. 182‚Äì187 After the wars, Coldwater Town became the site of Colbert's Ferry, owned by Chickasaw leader George Colbert, the crossing place of the Natchez Trace over the Tennessee River. Post-Revolution: Peak of Cherokee influence (1788‚Äì1792) =Cherokee-Franklin war (1788‚Äì1789)= The conflict between the Cherokee and the Americans in the State of Franklin erupted into its bloodiest and most widespread since 1776, beginning in late spring and lasting well into the beginning of the following year. One important feature of this conflict was the introduction of large numbers of Muscogee warriors fighting in Cherokee war parties, which continued until the end of the Cherokee wars.Lowrie and Clarke, Indian Affairs, p. 47 Isolated massacres In May 1788, a party of Cherokee from Chilhowee came to the house of John Kirk's family on Little River, while he and his oldest son, John Jr., were out. When Kirk and John Jr. returned, they found the other eleven members of their family dead and scalped.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 272 This was the beginning of a Cherokee campaign of raids across the region, to which the frontiers people responded by retreating inside forts and stations.Haywood, p. 197 The various hazards of the Tennessee River Gorge, also known as Cash Canyon or The Suck In May 1788, James Brown of North Carolina departed Long-Island-on-the-Holston by boat, destined for the Cumberland to settle there. When they passed by Williams Island in Chattanooga, Bloody Fellow stopped them, looked around the boat, then let them proceed, meanwhile sending messengers ahead to Running Water. Upon the family's arrival at Nickajack, a party of 40 under mixed-blood John Vann boarded the boat and killed Col. Brown, his two older sons on the boat, and five other young men traveling with the family. Mrs. Brown, the two younger sons, and three daughters were taken prisoner and distributed to different families. When he learned of the massacre the following day, The Breath, Nickajack's headman, was angered. He later adopted into his own family the Browns' son Joseph as a son. Mrs. Brown and one of her daughters were given to the Muscogee and ended up in the personal household of Alex McGillivray.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 272‚Äì275 Franklinite invasion of the Overhill Towns In June 1788, John Sevier, no longer governor of the State of Franklin, raised 100 volunteers and set out for the Overhill Towns. After a brief stop at the Little Tennessee, the group went to Great Hiwassee and burned it to the ground. Then they returned to the Little Tennessee and burned down Tallasee. Returning to Chota, Sevier sent a detachment led by James Hubbard to Chilhowee to punish those responsible for the Kirk massacre. Hubbard's force included John Kirk Jr. Hubbard brought along Corntassel and Hanging Man from Chota. At Chilhowee, Hubbard raised a flag of truce and took Corntassel and Hanging Man to the house of Abraham, still headman of the town. He was there with his son, also bringing along Long Fellow and Fool Warrior. Hubbard posted guards at the door and windows of the cabin, and gave John Kirk Jr. a tomahawk to get his revenge. The murder of the pacifist Overhill chiefs under a flag of truce angered the entire Cherokee nation. Men who had been reluctant to participate took to the warpath. The increase in hostility lasted for several months. Doublehead, Corntassel's brother, was particularly incensed.Haywood, pp. 194‚Äì196 Not only did the Cherokee from the Overhill Towns join those from the Lower Towns on the warpath, so too did a large number of Muscogee warriors.Roosevelt, p. 212 Highlighting the seriousness of the matter, Dragging Canoe came to address the general council of the Nation, meeting at Ustanali on the Coosawattee River (one of the former Lower Towns on the Keowee River relocated to the vicinity of Calhoun, Georgia) to which the seat of the council had been moved. The council elected Little Turkey as First Beloved Man to succeed the murdered chief. The election was contested by Hanging Maw of Coyatee; he had been elected chief headman of the traditional Overhill Towns on the Little Tennessee. Both men had been among those who originally followed Dragging Canoe into the southwest.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 309 Siege of Houston's Station In August 1788, the commander of the garrison at Houston's Station (near the present Maryville, Tennessee) received word that a Cherokee force of nearly 500 was planning to attack his position. He therefore sent a large reconnaissance patrol to the Overhill Towns. Stopping in the town of Citico on the south side of the Little Tennessee, which they found deserted, the patrol scattered throughout the town's orchard and began gathering fruit. Six of them died in the first fusilade, another ten while attempting to escape across the river. With the loss of those men, the garrison at Houston's Station was seriously beleaguered. Only the arrival of a relief force under John Sevier saved the fort from being overrun and its inhabitants slaughtered. With the garrison joining his force, Sevier marched to the Little Tennessee and burned Chilhowee. Attempted invasion of the Lower Towns Lookout Mountain from Moccasin Bend Later in August, Joseph Martin (who was married to Betsy, daughter of Nancy Ward, and living at Chota), with 500 men, marched to the Chickamauga area, intending to penetrate the edge of the Cumberland Mountains to get to the Five Lower Towns. He sent a detachment to secure the pass over the foot of Lookout Mountain, which was ambushed and routed by a large party of Dragging Canoe's warriors, with the Cherokee in hot pursuit.Evans, \\"Last Battle\\", 30‚Äì40 One of the participants later referred to the spot as \\"the place where we made the Virginians turn their backs\\".Klink and Talman, p. 48 According to one of the participants on the other side, Dragging Canoe, John Watts, Bloody Fellow, Kitegisky, The Glass, Little Owl, and Dick Justice were all present at the encounter.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 284Draper Mss. 16: DD-59 Dragging Canoe raised an army of 3,000 Cherokee warriors, which he split into more flexible war bands of hundreds of warriors each. One band was headed by John Watts, with Bloody Fellow, Kitegisky, and The Glass. It included a young warrior named Pathkiller, who later became known as The Ridge. Battles of Gillespie's Station and others In October 1788, Watts' band advanced across country toward White's Fort. Along the way, they attacked Gillespie's Station on the Holston River after capturing settlers who had left the enclosure to work in the fields, storming the stockade when the defender's ammunition ran out, killing the men and some of the women and taking 28 women and children prisoner. They then proceeded to attack White's Fort and Houston's Station, only to be beaten back.Moore, p. 204Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 293‚Äì295 Afterward, the war band wintered at an encampment on the Flint River in present-day Unicoi County, Tennessee as a base of operations.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 297 An attack by another large party against Sherrill's Station on Nolichucky River was driven off by a force commanded by Sevier.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 285‚Äì286 In response to the Cherokee incursions, the settlers increased their retaliatory attacks. Troops under Sevier invaded the Middle and Valley Towns in North Carolina. Bob Benge, with a group of Cherokee warriors, evacuated the general population from Ustalli, on the Hiwassee; they left a rearguard to ensure their escape. After firing the town, Sevier and his group pursued the fleeing inhabitants, and were ambushed at the mouth of the Valley River by Benge's party. The U.S. soldiers went to the village of Coota- cloo-hee and burned down its cornfields, but they were chased off by 400 warriors led by Watts (Young Tassel). Watts' army trailed Sevier's all the way from Coota-cloo-hee back to the Franklin settlements, attacking at random.Evans, \\"Bob Benge\\", p. 100Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 286‚Äì290 Consequently, the Overhill Cherokee and refugees from the Lower and Valley towns virtually abandoned the settlements on the Little Tennessee and dispersed south and west. Chota was the only Overhill town left with many inhabitants. =Council at Coweta= On March 2, 1789, the Lower Muscogee chief town of Coweta hosted a council between their division of the Muscogee Confederacy and the Cherokee. As town headman, John Galphin, half-blood son of former Indian Commissioner for the United States George Galphin, presided. Dragging Canoe and Hanging Maw led the Cherokee delegation. The representative of the two nations present agreed they trusted neither the Americans nor the Spanish and drafted a letter to the government of Great Britain, pledging their loyalty in return for the king's direct assistance. They promised that if this happened, then the Mohawk, the Choctaw, and the Chickasaw would come over. Nothing ever came of the petition.Mastromarino, pp. 291‚Äì294 =Prisoner exchange= John Watts' band on Flint Creek fell upon serious misfortune in January 1789. They were surrounded by a force under John Sevier that was equipped with grasshopper cannons. The gunfire from the Cherokee was so intense, however, that Sevier abandoned his heavy weapons and ordered a cavalry charge that led to savage hand-to-hand fighting. Watt's band lost nearly 150 warriors.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 297‚Äì299 Word of their defeat did not reach Running Water until April, when it arrived with an offer from Sevier for an exchange of prisoners which specifically mentioned the surviving members of the Brown family, including Joseph, who had been adopted first by Kitegisky and later by The Breath.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 275 Among those captured at Flint Creek were Bloody Fellow and Little Turkey's daughter.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 299 Joseph and his sister Polly were brought immediately to Running Water, but when runners were sent to Crow Town to retrieve Jane, their youngest sister, her owner refused to surrender her. Bob Benge, present in Running Water at the time, mounted his horse and hefted his famous axe, saying, \\"I will bring the girl, or the owner's head\\". The next morning he returned with Jane. The three were handed over to Sevier at Coosawattee on April 20. McGillivray delivered Mrs. Brown and Elizabeth to her son William during a trip to Rock Landing, Georgia, in November. George, the other surviving son from the trip, remained with the Muscogee until 1798.Moore, p. 201 =Non-treaty of Swannanoa= The next month, on May 25, 1789, the Cherokee were supposed to sign a peace treaty with the United States at the War Ford on the French Broad River, near Swannanoa, North Carolina. The Americans chose the location because it was scene of a major Cherokee defeat in 1776. The Cherokee leaders never showed, but when the Americans under Andrew Pickens ran across Cherokee on their way to Rock Landing on the Oconee River to meet with the Muscogee, they were assured hostilities were over.Lowrie and Clarke, Indian Affairs, pp. 34, 48 =Doublehead's war= The opposite end of Muscle Shoals from Coldwater Town was occupied in 1790 by a roughly 40-strong warrior party under Doublehead. He had gained permission to establish his town at the head of the Shoals, which was in Chickasaw territory, because the local headman, George Colbert, the mixed-blood leader who later owned Colbert's Ferry at the foot of Muscle Shoals, was his son-in- law. Like the former Coldwater Town, Doublehead's Town was diverse, with Cherokee, Muscogee, Shawnee, and a few Chickasaw. It quickly grew beyond the initial 40 warriors, who carried out many small raids against settlers on the Cumberland and into Kentucky. During one foray in June 1792, his warriors ambushed a canoe carrying the three sons of Valentine Sevier (brother of John) and three others on a scouting expedition searching for his party. They killed the three Seviers and another man; two escaped. Doublehead conducted his operations largely independently of the Lower Cherokee, though he did take part in large operations with them on occasion, such as the invasion of the Cumberland in 1792 and that of the Holston in 1793.Moore, pp. 233 =Treaty of New York (1790)= Dragging Canoe's long-time ally among the Muscogee, Alex McGillivray, led a delegation of twenty-seven leaders north, where they signed the Treaty of New York in August 1790 with the United States government on behalf of the \\"Upper, Middle, and Lower Creek and Seminole composing the Creek nation of Indians\\". In it, McGillivray, who was made an America brigadier general, ceded in the name of the Confederacy the Oconee Country. In return the federal government upheld Muscogee rights to all of the Tallassee Country. Although intended to end the Oconee War, it angered the American settlers expelled from the Tallassee Country and Muscogee who wanted to keep the Oconee Country, so the war continued. The treaty also marked the beginning of the decline of McGillivray's influence in the Muscogee Confederacy and the rise of that of William Augustus Bowles, a bitter rival dating back to the Spanish campaign against Pensacola.Appleton By mid-1791, Bowles wielded enough influence to send large war parties raiding the Cumberland once again despite the treaty.Goodpasture, p. 178 =Muscle Shoals settlement= In January 1791, a group of land speculators named the Tennessee Company from the Southwest Territory, led by James Hubbard and Peter Bryant, attempted to gain control of the Muscle Shoals and its vicinity by building a settlement and fort at the head of the Shoals. They did so against an executive order of President Washington forbidding it, as relayed to them by the governor of the Southwest Territory, William Blount. The Glass came down from Running Water with 60 warriors and descended upon the defenders, captained by Valentine Sevier, brother of John. The Glass told them to leave immediately or be killed, then burned their blockhouse as they departed.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 318‚Äì319 =Bob Benge's war= The primary areas of operations during the Chickamauga Wars Starting in 1791, Benge and his brother The Tail, based at Willstown, began leading attacks against settlers in East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and Kentucky, often in conjunction with Doublehead and his warriors from Coldwater. Eventually, he became one of the most feared warriors on the frontier. =Treaty of Holston (1791)= The Treaty of Holston, signed in July 1791, required the Upper Towns to cede more land in return for continued peace because the U.S. government proved unable to stop or roll back illegal settlements. As it appeared to guarantee Cherokee sovereignty, the chiefs of the Upper Cherokee believed they had the same status as states. Several representatives of the Lower Cherokee participated in the negotiations and signed the treaty, including John Watts, Doublehead, Bloody Fellow, Black Fox (Dragging Canoe's nephew), The Badger (his brother), and Rising Fawn. =Battle of the Wabash= Later in the summer, a small delegation of Cherokee under Dragging Canoe's brother Little Owl traveled north to meet with the Indian leaders of the Western Confederacy, chief among them Blue Jacket of the Shawnee, Little Turtle of the Miami, and Buckongahelas of the Lenape. While they were there, word arrived that Arthur St. Clair, Governor of the Northwest Territory, was planning an invasion against the allied tribes in the north. Little Owl immediately sent word south to Running Water. Dragging Canoe quickly sent a 30-strong war party north under his brother The Badger, where, along with the warriors of Little Owl and Turtle-at-Home they participated in the decisive encounter in November 1791 known as the Battle of the Wabash, the worst defeat ever inflicted by Native Americans upon the American military, the American military body count of which far surpassed that at the more famous Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. After the battle, Little Owl, The Badger, and Turtle-at-Home returned south with most of the warriors who had accompanied the first two. The warriors who had come north years earlier remained in the Ohio region, but the returning warriors brought back a party of 30 Shawnee under the leadership of one known as Shawnee Warrior that frequently operated alongside warriors under Little Owl. =Death of Dragging Canoe= Inspired by news of the northern victory, Dragging Canoe embarked on a mission to unite the native people of his area as had Little Turtle and Blue Jacket by visiting the other major tribes in the region. His embassies to the Lower Muscogee and the Choctaw were successful, but the Chickasaw living to the west refused his overtures. Upon his return, which coincided with that of The Glass and Dick Justice, and of Turtle-at-Home, a huge all-night celebration was held at Stecoyee at which the Eagle Dance was performed in his honor. By the morning of March 1, 1792, Dragging Canoe was dead, as a result of exhaustion from dancing all night, or possibly a heart attack. A procession of honor carried his body to Running Water, where he was buried. By the time of his death, the resistance of the Chickamauga/Lower Cherokee had led to grudging respect from the settlers, as well as the rest of the Cherokee nation. He was even memorialized at the general council of the Nation held in Ustanali on June 28, 1792, by his nephew Black Fox: > The Dragging Canoe has left this world. He was a man of consequence in his > country. He was friend to both his own and the white people.

It is mentioned here publicly that both red and white may > know it, and pay attention to him.Lowrie and Clarke, Indian Affairs, pp. > 271‚Äì272 The minutes of the council list Little Turkey as \\"Great Beloved Man of the whole Nation\\", Hanging Maw as \\"Beloved Man of the Northern Division\\" (Overhill Towns), and The Badger as \\"Beloved Man of the Southern Division\\" (Upper Towns in North Georgia).Lowrie and Clarke, Indian Affairs, p. 271 Such was the respect for him as a leader and patriot of his people that Governor Blount, leader of his greatest enemies, remarked upon hearing of his death that, \\"Dragging Canoe stood second to none in the Nation\\".Lowrie and Clarke, Indian Affairs, p. 263 Post-Revolution: the Watts years (1792‚Äì1795) At his own previous request, Dragging Canoe was succeeded as leader of the Lower Cherokee by John Watts, although The Bowl succeeded him as headman of Running Water.Starr, p. 35 Bloody Fellow and Doublehead continued Dragging Canoe's policy of Indian unity, including an agreement with McGillivray of the Upper Muscogee to build joint blockhouses from which warriors of both tribes could operate at the confluence of the Tennessee and Clinch Rivers, at Running Water and at Muscle Shoals.Durham, p. 87Tennessee River Gorge from Snooper's Rock Watts, Tahlonteeskee, and 'Young Dragging Canoe' (whose actual name was Tsula, or \\"Red Fox\\") traveled to Pensacola in May at the invitation of Arturo O'Neill de Tyrone, Spanish governor of West Florida. They took with them letters of introduction from John McDonald. Once there, they forged a treaty with O'Neill for arms and supplies.Starr, p. 36 Upon returning north, Watts moved his base of operations to Willstown.Lowrie and Clarke, Foreign Relations, pp. 285‚Äì286 Meanwhile, John McDonald, now British Indian Affairs Superintendent, moved to Turkeytown with his assistant Daniel Ross and their families. Some of the older chiefs, such as The Glass of Running Water, The Breath of Nickajack, and Dick Justice of Stecoyee, abstained from active warfare but did nothing to stop the warriors in their towns from taking part in raids and campaigns. The Trans-Appalachian communities formerly of North Carolina became the Southwest Territory of the United States in 1790. For administrative purposes, the territorial government grouped the counties in the Overmountain region together as the Washington District, while those in the Cumberland region became the Mero District, already the name for its judicial district since 1788. Cherokee and Muscogee warriors and their Shawnee guests began raiding both districts of the Southwest Territory.Durham, pp. 80‚Äì81 In April 1792, a Cherokee-Shawnee war party led by Bob Benge and Shawnee Warrior invaded the Holston region and began raids all over the vicinity. In the summer of 1792, a war party from Running Water led by Little Owl and the Shawnee Warrior joined them in their raids. On June 26, the same day that Dragging Canoe was being memorialized at the national council in Ustanali, the combined group of Cherokee, Shawnee, and a few Muscogee destroyed Zeigler's Station in Sumner County. This action led the Governor James Robertson of the Mero District to call up a battalion of troops to spread throughout the region as guards.Moore, pp. 205‚Äì211 =Invasion of the Mero District= On September 7 or 8, 1792, a council of Cherokee meeting at Running Water formally declared war against the United States.Durham, p. 83 Watts orchestrated a large campaign intending to attack the Washington District with a large combined army in four bands of 200 each. When the warriors were mustering at Stecoyee, however, he learned that their planned attack was expected and decided to aim for the Mero District instead. The army Watts led into the Cumberland region was nearly 1,000 strong, including a contingent of cavalry. From their launch point, Tahlonteeskee (Doublehead's brother) and The Tail (Bob Benge's brother) led a party to ambush the Kentucky Road. Doublehead led another to the Cumberland Road. Middle Striker led his party to do the same on the Walton Road. Watts led the main force, made up of 280 Cherokee, Shawnee, and Muscogee warriors plus cavalry, intending to go against the fort at Nashville. He sent out George Fields and John Walker, Jr., as scouts ahead of the army, and they killed the two scouts sent out by James Robertson from Nashville. Near their target on the evening of September 30, Watts's combined force came upon a small fort known as Buchanan's Station, commanded by John Buchanan. Talotiskee, leader of the Muscogee, wanted to attack it immediately, while Watts argued in favor of saving it for the return south. After much bickering, Watts gave in around midnight. The assault proved to be a disaster for Watts. Watts was wounded, and many of his warriors were killed, including Talotiskee and some of Watts' best leaders; Shawnee Warrior, Kitegisky, and Dragging Canoe's brother Little Owl were among those who died in the encounter.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 344‚Äì366Lowrie and Clarke, Indian Affairs, pp. 294‚Äì295 Doublehead's group of 60 ambushed a party of 6 and took one scalp then headed toward Nashville. On their way, they were attacked by a militia force and lost 13 men. Tahlonteeskee's party, meanwhile, stayed out into early October, attacking Black's Station on Crooked Creek, killing three, wounding more, and capturing several horses. Middle Striker's party ambushed a large armed force coming to the Mero District down the Walton Road in November and routed it completely without losing a single man.Hoig, p. 83 In revenge for the deaths at Buchanan's Station, Benge, Doublehead, and his brother Pumpkin Boy led a party of 60 into southwestern Kentucky in early 1793 during which their warriors, in an act initiated by Doublehead, cooked and ate the enemies they had just killed. Afterwards, Doublehead's party returned south and held scalp dances at Stecoyee, Turnip Town, and Willstown, since warriors from those towns had also participated in the raid in addition to his and Benge's groups.Evans, \\"Bob Benge\\", pp. 101‚Äì102 =Spring and summer campaigns, 1793= A party of Muscogee under a mixed-race warrior named Lesley began attacking isolated farmsteads. Lesley's party continued harassment of the Holston settlements until the summer of 1794.Moore, p. 225‚Äì231 Lesley's group was not the only Muscogee party, nor were the Muscogee alone. Warriors from the Upper Towns and some from the Overhill and Valley Towns, also raided the eastern districts in the spring and summer of 1793.Durham, pp. 118‚Äì122 In the Mero District, besides scalping raids, two parties attacked Bledsoe's Station and Greenfield Station in April 1793. Another party attacked Hays' Station in June. In August, the Coushatta from Coosada raided the country around Clarksville, Tennessee, attacking the homestead of the Baker family, killing all but two who escaped and one taken prisoner who was later ransomed at Coosada Town.Moore, p. 215‚Äì220Durham, p. 117 =Peace overtures= After the visit of the Shawnee, Watts sent envoys to Knoxville, then the capital of the Southwest Territory, to meet with Governor William Blount to discuss terms for peace.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 366 The party that was sent from the Lower Towns that May included Bob McLemore, Tahlonteeskee, Captain Charley of Running Water, and Doublehead, among several others. They met at Henry's Station on February 4, 1793, and Blount invited the Lower Cherokee to send a delegation to the Philadelphia to meet with President Washington.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 369‚Äì370 Upper East Tennessee The meeting in Philadelphia was scheduled for June 1793. On the way, the diplomatic party from the Lower Towns stopped in Coyatee because Hanging Maw and other chiefs from the Upper Towns were going also. A large party of Lower Cherokee had been raiding the Upper East, killed two men, and stole twenty horses. On their way out, they passed through Coyatee, to which the pursuit party tracked them. The militia violated their orders not to cross the Little Tennessee, then the border between the Cherokee nation and the Southwest Territory, firing indiscriminately.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 387 In the ensuing chaos, 11 leading men were killed, including Captain Charley, and several wounded, including Hanging Maw, his wife and daughter, Doublehead, and Tahlonteeskee; one of the white delegates was among the dead. The Cherokee, including Watts' hostile warriors, agreed to await the outcome of the subsequent trial. The trial proved to be a farce, in large part because John Beard, the man responsible, was a close friend of John Sevier.Moore, pp. 220‚Äì225Evans, \\"Bob Benge\\", pp. 103‚Äì104 =Invasion of the Eastern Districts= Watts responded to Beard's acquittal by invading the Holston area with one of the largest Indian forces ever seen in the region, over 1,000 Cherokee and Muscogee, plus a few Shawnee, intending to attack Knoxville. The plan was to have four bodies of troops march toward Knoxville separately, converging at a rendezvous point along the way.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 389 In August, Watts attacked Henry's Station with a force of 200 but fell back after sustaining overwhelming gunfire coming from the fort. The four columns converged a month later near the present Loudon, Tennessee, and proceeded toward their target. On the way, the Cherokee leaders were discussing among themselves whether to kill all the inhabitants of Knoxville, or just the men, James Vann advocating the latter while Doublehead argued for the former.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 389‚Äì390 Further on the way, they encountered a small settlement called Cavett's Station on September 25, 1793. After they had surrounded the place, Benge negotiated with the inhabitants, agreeing that if they surrendered, their lives would be spared.Faulkner, p. 63 However, after the settlers had walked out, Doublehead's group and his Muscogee allies attacked and began killing them, over the pleas of Benge and the others. Vann managed to grab one small boy and pull him onto his saddle, only to have Doublehead smash the boy's skull with an axe. Watts intervened in time to save another young boy, handing him to Vann, who put the boy behind him on his horse and later handed him over to three of the Muscogee for safe- keeping; one of the Muscogee chiefs killed the boy and scalped him a few days later.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 390‚Äì391Wilkins, pp. 25‚Äì26Faulkner, pp. 76‚Äì80Ramsey, p. 581Ehle, pp 44‚Äì46 Because of this incident, Vann called Doublehead \\"Babykiller\\" (deliberately parodying the honorable title \\"Mankiller\\") for the remainder of his life; and it also began a lengthy feud which defined the politics of the early 19th century Cherokee Nation and only ended in 1807 with Doublehead's death at Vann's orders.Miles, p. 36 By this time, tensions among the Cherokee broke out into such vehement arguments that the force broke up, with the main group retiring south.Wilkins, p. 26 =Battle of Hightower= Sevier countered the invasion with an invasion and occupation of Ustanali, which had been deserted; there was no fighting there other than an indecisive skirmish with a Cherokee-Muscogee scouting party. He and his men then followed the Cherokee-Muscogee force south to the town of Etowah (near the site of present-day Cartersville, Georgia across the Etowah River from the Etowah Indian Mounds), leading to the \\"Battle of Hightower\\" on October 17, 1793. His force defeated their opponents soundly, then went on to destroy several Cherokee villages to the west before retiring to the Southwest Territory. The battle was the last pitched battle of the wars between the Cherokee and the American frontier people. =Spring and summer 1794= Between January and September 1794, there were more than forty raids by war parties of both Cherokee and Muscogee on the Mero District.Brown,Old Frontiers, 418 On the part of the Cherokee, these were mostly carried out by Doublehead.Brown,Old Frontiers, p. 397‚Äì398 These raids precipitated the Nickajack Expedition in September which ended the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars once and for all.Durham, p. 166 Meanwhile, Bob Benge attacked Washington District and Southwest Virginia, losing his life in the latter on April 6, 1794. The militia sent his red-haired scalp to Governor Henry Lee III.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 400‚Äì402 Benge was not alone in raiding the Eastern Districts. Fifty horses were stolen in the region that same month. Twenty-five warriors attacked the Town Creek blockhouse. An entire family save one was massacred south of the French Broad. There were many other attacks.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 402‚Äì403Durham, 166‚Äì167 Frustrated with the governor's call for restraint, John Beard, leader of the chase group that attacked the diplomatic party, organized a party of 150 men in the Washington District and attacked the Hiwasee Towns, burning two, including Great Hiwassee, and killing several Cherokee.Durham, pp. 135‚Äì137 Against orders, George Doherty of the Hamilton District militia mustered his men and attacked Great Tellico, burning it to the ground, then crossed the mountains into the Valley Towns, in which they burned at least two towns and several acres of crops.Durham, pp. 137‚Äì138 On June 9, 1794, a party of Cherokee under Whitemankiller (George Fields) overtook a river party under William Scott at Muscle Shoals. They killed its white passengers, looted the goods, and took the African-American slaves as captives.Mooney, p. 77 On June 26, 1794, the federal government and the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Philadelphia, which essentially reaffirmed the land cessions of the 1785 Treaty of Hopwell and the 1791 Treaty of Holston. Both the Doublehead and Bloody Fellow signed it.HaysEvarts, pp. 30‚Äì31 =End of Lesley's war party= In July 1794, Hanging Maw sent his men along with the volunteers from the Holston settlements to pursue Lesley's Muscogee war party, killing two and handing over a third to the whites for trial and execution on August 4.Haywood, p. 323 Two days later, a small war party of Muscogee crossed the Tennessee River at Chestua Creek in modern Bradley County. Hanging Maw called up his warriors, 50 of whom joined with federal troops in pursuit, while the rest guarded Coyatee. They caught up with the party they were pursuing on August 12 near Craig's Station and defeated them.Haywood, pp. 323‚Äì325 Different Muscogee war parties, however, escaped their pursuers and attacked the Holston frontier for the rest of the month.Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 421 =Nickajack Expedition and peace treaty= Desiring to end the wars once and for all, Robertson sent a detachment of U.S. regular troops, Mero District militia, and Kentucky volunteers to the Five Lower Towns under U.S. Army Major James Ore. Guided by knowledgeable locals, including former captive Joseph Brown, Ore's army traveled down the Cisca and St. Augustine Trail toward the Five Lower Towns.Mooney, p. 78Brown, Old Frontiers, p. 422 On September 13, the army attacked Nickajack without warning, slaughtering many of the inhabitants, including its pacifist chief The Breath. After torching the houses, the soldiers went upriver and burned Running Water, whose residents had long fled. Joseph Brown fought alongside the soldiers but tried to spare women and children. The Cherokee casualties were relatively light, as the majority of the population of both towns were in Willstown attending a major stickball game.Mooney, pp. 78‚Äì79Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 421‚Äì431The Tellico Blockhouse site, with posts and stone fill showing the original layout Watts finally decided to call for peace: he was discouraged by the destruction of the two towns, the death of Bob Benge in April, and the recent defeat of the Western Confederacy by General \\"Mad Anthony\\" Wayne's army at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. More than 100 Cherokee had fought there. The loss of support from the Spanish, who had their own problems against France in the War of the First Coalition, convinced Watts to end the fighting. On November 7, 1794, he made the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse. It was notable for not requiring any more land cessions by the Cherokee, other than finally ended the series of conflicts, which was notable for not requiring any further cession of land other than requiring the Lower Cherokee to recognize the cessions of the Holston Treaty. This led to a period of relative peace into the 19th century.Brown, Old Frontiers, pp. 433‚Äì436 The Muscogee kept on fighting after the destruction of Nickajack and Running Water and the following peace between the Lower Cherokee and the United States. In October 1794, they attacked Bledsoe's Station again. In November, they attacked Sevier's Station and massacred fourteen of the inhabitants, Valentine Sevier being one of the few survivors. In December 1794, a force of Cherokee warriors from the Upper Towns stopped a Muscogee campaign against the frontier settlements of the state of Georgia and warned them to cease attacking the Southwest Territory's Eastern Districts as well.Durham, p. 189 In early January 1795, however, the Chickasaw, who had sent warriors to take part in the Army of the Northwest, began killing Muscogee warriors found in Middle Tennessee as allies of the United States and taking their scalps, so in March, the Muscogee began to turn their attentions away from the Cumberland to the Chickasaw, over the entreaties of the Cherokee and the Choctaw. Aftermath Following the peace treaty, leaders from the Lower Cherokee were dominant in national affairs. When the national government of all the Cherokee was organized, the first three persons to hold the office of Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation ‚Äì Little Turkey (1788‚Äì1801), Black Fox (1801‚Äì1811), and Pathkiller (1811‚Äì1827) ‚Äì had previously served as warriors under Dragging Canoe, as had the first two Speakers of the Cherokee National Council, established in 1794, Doublehead and Turtle-at-Home. The domination of the Cherokee Nation by the former warriors from the Lower Towns continued well into the 19th century. Even after the revolt of the young chiefs of the Upper Towns, the Lower Towns were a major voice, and the \\"young chiefs\\" of the Upper Towns who dominated that region had themselves previously been warriors with Dragging Canoe and Watts. Because of the continuing hostilities that followed the Revolution, the United States placed one of the two permanent garrisons of the new country at Fort Southwest Point at the confluence of the Tennessee and Clinch Rivers; the other was at Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania.

They were unable to baptize any Indians. Catholic missionaries, led by French-Canadian Fathers Fran√ßois Norbert Blanchet and Modeste Demers, arrived in 1838. They delivered the first Catholic mass between the Rocky Mountains and the Cascade Range in 1839St. Paul Mission Historical Society and baptized 19 Indians, but were unable to establish a permanent mission. Their efforts were more focused on St. Paul Roman Catholic Church, in the Willamette Valley. Following Belgian Father DeSmet's preaching to the Sxoielpi (Colville Indians) in August 1845, a small log chapel was built. Two years later the present hand-hewn log church replaced it. Sometime around 1869, St. Paul's Mission was abandoned in favor of a location seven miles north of the present city of Colville. Damaged by fire in 1910, the present structure was restored in 1939‚Äì40.St. Paul's Mission at Spokane Outdoors References  External links  *washington.edu Photograph: St. Paul's Indian Mission, near Kettle Falls, Washington, 1888 Category:Catholic missions Category:History of Washington (state) Category:Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Stevens County, Washington Category:Religious buildings and structures in Washington (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Stevens County, Washington ","title":"St. Paul's Mission"},{"id":"7666353","text":"Ashill is a small hamlet in west Cornwall, England, United Kingdom in the valley of the Red River about 2 miles north west of Camborne.Ordnance Survey 1:50000 Landranger map, Sheet 203, The Red River Nature reserve lies east of the hamlet.

Bred in Maryland by William L. Brann and Robert S. Castle, he raced under the colors of their Branncastle Farm. Racing career Racing at age two, Challedon won four of his six but was outshone by another colt named El Chico, who was voted that year's U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Colt. At age three, under jockey George Seabo, Challedon finished second in the 1939 Kentucky Derby, eight lengths behind future Hall of Fame colt Johnstown. Then, in the Preakness Stakes, Challedon won by a length and a half with the heavily favored Johnstown finishing off the board. For trainer Louis J. Schaefer, Challedon's win meant he became the first person to have both ridden and trained a Preakness Stakes winner. His feat would only be matched 30 years later by Johnny Longden. Challedon wasn't eligible to compete in the final leg of the U.S. Triple Crown and as such Johnstown had an easy time in winning the Belmont Stakes. However, Challedon's wins in eight other important races that year, including a world record performance in the Tranter Purse raced at Keeneland Race Course, earned him the U.S. Champion 3-Yr-Old Colt honors. In a poll conducted by the Turf and Sport Digest, Challedon was voted Horse of the Year, taking 156 of the possible 208 votes ahead of the two-year-old Bimelech, who received 36. In 1940, the four-year-old Challedon continued his winning ways, claiming victory under jockey George Woolf in the Hollywood Gold Cup and the Whitney Stakes. Beginning in September 1940, Don Cameron trained Challedon for owner William L. Brann and won the Pimlico Special and Havre de Grace Handicap. Challedon still remains the only two-time winner of the prestigious grade one Pimlico Special Handicap. Cameron left Brann's employ in February 1941 and the horse's training was taken over by Whitey Whitehill. Challedon was voted 1940 U.S. Champion Male Handicap Horse and for the second straight year earned U.S. Horse of the Year honors, topping the Turf and Sport Digest poll with 84 votes ahead of Seabiscuit who received 34.  Five-year-old season  As a five-year-old, Challedon suffered a tendon injury and was bothered by cracks on the inside of a forefoot that saw him win no purse money. His season ended after just three races. The following year, for new trainer Edward Christmas Challedon returned to the winner's circle twice, including in the Philadelphia Handicap, but had lost his drive and was retired to stand at stud at Gallaher Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. While not a spectacular success as a sire, Challedon did produce thirteen stakes winners before passing away at the age of twenty-two after breaking a leg in his paddock. In 1977, he was inducted into the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Relaunched in 2012, the business is headquartered in Chicago. Previously, White, Weld & Co. was a Boston-based investment bank, historically managed by Boston Brahmins until its sale to Merrill Lynch in 1978. The Weld family name can be traced back to the founding of Massachusetts in the 1630s. History White, Weld & Co. was founded in Boston in the nineteenth century, originally to finance overseas trade. In 1929 it managed Airstocks, a short-lived venture but important because it was an early financial concern exclusively pertaining to airlines and aviation. It developed into a small, well-connected New York investment bank by the twentieth century and a bastion of the WASP establishment. For example, George Herbert Walker, Jr., uncle of the first President Bush, became an executive of White, Weld when his firm G. H. Walker & Co. was bought by them in the early 1970s. Paul Hallingby was CEO, Nigel S. MacEwan was President, and Charles J. Fuhrmann II, Steve Hammerman, Harold Janeway, Charles C. Lee, Roberts W. Brokaw III, and George G. Montgomery, Jr. were Senior Vice Presidents when the company was sold to Merrill Lynch. As stock markets became more retail- oriented and investment banking became more capital intensive, the firm decided it could not compete and put itself up for sale. One of the firm's most prominent transactions in its final period was the IPO of Walmart in 1970 with Stephens Inc. =Relationship with Credit Suisse= One of its most successful ventures was an international investment banking partnership founded in 1970 by Robert L. Genillard as a Managing Partner of White, Weld & Co, with Credit Suisse, called Soci√©t√© Anonyme du Credit Suisse et de White Weld ‚Äì or Credit Suisse White Weld. Sir John Craven, later head of Morgan Grenfell, led Credit Suisse White Weld from 1975 to 1978. Furthermore, Oswald Gruebel, Credit Suisse chief from 2004 to 2007, began his career in 1970 at Credit Suisse White Weld. When White Weld was purchased by Merrill Lynch, it left the partnership with Credit Suisse and was replaced by First Boston thus creating the Credit Suisse First Boston business in London. The Swiss private banking division of White Weld, founded in 1954 as White Weld & Co. AG, lives on as Clariden Bank.

History The bandstand, with the pond in the background, both dating from the Irish International Exhibition in 1907. The land used for the park was given to the city by the 14th Earl of Pembroke whose family name was Herbert. In 1907, the World Fair known as the Irish International Exhibition was held in Ballsbridge. When the structures had been dismantled, the site was developed as the current public park, with the bandstand and pond being the only remaining structures from the time. It is now maintained by Dublin City Council. The former site of the Johnston, Mooney & O'Brien bakery bordered the park and when that site was redeveloped as the Herbert Park Hotel, a new entrance was opened at the easternmost end of the park. Amenities Common Carp in the pond, Herbert Park, Dublin, Ireland The park is thirty-two acres in size and is in two halves, divided by a road, also called Herbert Park. A full circuit of the park's perimeter is almost exactly one mile (1.57 km), a fact used by runners and walkers to measure their progress. The larger half, on the south side of the road, is bounded by the River Dodder, houses, and includes a number of soccer pitches, formal gardens, and a large duck pond and an older public children's playground. A gazebo is also present in the North- Eastern corner of the park at the entrance to the Herbert Park Hotel. The northern half is home to the newly refurbished public children's playground, a number of tennis courts, and the bowling green of Herbert Park Bowling Club. The park's pond has proven to be an excellent location for breeding of carp. In February 2006 the pond was nearly completely emptied in order for cleaning to take place. The carp were removed to alternative locations. These carp were up to in length. In spring 2009, the pond was re-stocked (see picture).

Her style is considered ax√© but her music also steers into samba and MPB territory, at times drawing on African rhythms and reggae. Menezes is best known in Brazil for her song \\"Me Abra√ßa e Me Beija\\", a major hit in 1990. She also scored another hit with \\"Dandalunda\\", a song which became the unofficial anthem of the 2003 Salvador carnival. Menezes has achieved superstardom in her native Bahia but only moderate success in wider Brazil. She is famed for her energetic live performances and regularly tours and performs at carnival celebrations. In 1990, one of Menezes's tracks \\"Elegib√¥ (Uma Historia De Ifa)\\" was used in the Mickey Rourke film Wild Orchid. This prompted Island Records in the US to release a compilation album of some of her older material from Brazil on their subsidiary label, Mango. The album, simply titled Elegib√¥, was an instant hit, reaching # 1 on the Billboard World Music chart at a time when David Byrne was championing Brazilian music in the US. The title track itself became a regular staple at clubs playing so-called world music throughout the US and Europe. The album also received a full release in the UK, Germany and France. A single, \\"Tenda do Amor\\", was also released from the album in some European territories. Menezes toured internationally on the back of this album, generating a lot of press in the process. A second US-released follow- up album Kindala, released late 1991, but repackaged in some territories from the Brazilian version of the same name, also achieved some success. This release also gave Menezes a minor hit album in France too. In 2001, Menezes released the highly acclaimed Afropopbrasileiro (also known as \\"Maga\\") showcasing her trademark fusion of afro-Brazilian beats. The album was produced by Carlinhos Brown of Tribalistas fame and was well received in Brazil and internationally. Menezes also co-wrote and performed on the 2003 Tribalistas hit \\"Passe Em Casa\\", from the million-selling Tribalistas album. Her 2005 single, \\"Como Tu\\", a duet with Brazilian superstar Ivete Sangalo was released amidst much hype because Sangalo was achieving platinum album sales at the time. The track reached the lower reaches of the airplay Top 30 in Brazil but failed to emulate the success of recent Sangalo hits. The hit single was lifted from Menezes' 2005 album release Pra Voc√™; the album received lukewarm reviews, possibly owing to a more poppier sound than previous releases. A second single, the reggae-tinged \\"Miragem na esquina\\" performed poorly at radio. In 2006, the album Pra Voc√™ received a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Brazilian Contemporary Pop Album\\". More recently, Menezes participated on the track \\"Beijo Descarado\\" by Timbalada which achieved some airplay success in Brazil during the 2007 Carnival celebrations. In 2010, an acoustic version of her 2008 album Naturalmente was released. The album was recorded at Ilha dos Sapos and featured guests like Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown and Portuguese singer Luis Represas. Menezes remains one of the most dynamic and popular of the contemporary Brazilian artists achieving international recognition.

Very little of the medieval structures is preserved. =Ottoman period= The castle was rebuilt in the 18th century by Zahir al- Umar, Bedouin ruler of the Galilee. In 1752, a mosque was constructed in Hunin.

The situation is on a low ridge just before the hills drop down to the east to the Huleh Valley; the hills round are uncultivated, covered with low scrub, but in the valleys there is some arable land.

Following the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and the unratified and later annulled Treaty of S√®vres, stemming from the San Remo conference, the 1920 boundary extended the British-controlled area to north of the Sykes-Picot line, a straight line between the midpoint of the Sea of Galilee and Nahariya. The international boundary between Palestine and Lebanon was finally agreed upon by Great Britain and France in 1923, in conjunction with the Treaty of Lausanne, after Britain had been given a League of Nations mandate for Palestine in 1922.Exchange of Notes Constituting an Agreement respecting the boundary line between Syria and Palestine from the Mediterranean to El Hamm√©.

During a meeting in August 1948, the mukhtars of Hunin and other Shi'ite villages met with the Jews of kibbutz Kfar Giladi, declaring their willingness to be good citizens of Israel. Their proposal was conveyed to the Israeli government, where it received enthusiastic support from the Minorities Minister Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit. A report was made by the Ministry of Minority Affairs recommending that such an agreement be reached with the 4,700 or so Shi'ites in the region to promote friendly relations with southern Lebanon, to take advantage of the Shi'ites' poor relationship with the majority Sunnis, and to enhance the prospect of a future extension of the border. This proposal was not accepted, despite the support of the Minister of Minority Affairs, Sheetrit. In August, more inhabitants of Hunin were forced to flee by the IDF.Morris, 2004, p. 249 On 3 September 1948, the IDF raided the village blowing up 20 houses, killing a son of the mukhtar and 19 others and expelling the remaining villagers. Most of the villagers took refuge in Shiite villages in Lebanon. In 1951, Moshav Margaliot was established just south of the village site.

He was affiliated with Indymedia. On October 27, 2006 during a labor dispute in the Mexican city of Oaxaca, Will was shot twice, possibly by government-aligned paramilitaries, resulting in his death. Early life Brad Will (far right) at the Dreamtime Village, about 1993 Will was born in Evanston, Illinois, and raised in Kenilworth. He graduated from New Trier High School in 1988, then attended Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he earned a B.A. in English. Beginning in the summer of 1991, he was a regular attendee at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, the summer writing program of Naropa University and was a teaching assistant to Peter Lamborn Wilson (a.k.a. Hakim Bey). In 1995, after spending time at Dreamtime Village in southwest Wisconsin, he moved to Manhattan where he squatted on the Lower East Side before moving to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Activism =U.S.= At Naropa, Will participated in a satirical performance art piece designed to mock the Colorado socially conservative Christian community and protest a proposed amendment to the Colorado constitution which sought to limit gay rights. Will pretended to marry another man in a ceremony conducted by Peter Lamborn Wilson, a Universal Life Church-ordained minister. The mock ceremony included a procession of their wedding party in drag, parading in front of a Promise Keepers event in Boulder, Colorado. While in New York City, Will became involved in the squatters movement of the Lower East Side, and also became involved in what has become known as freeganism, an effort to live outside the mainstream economic grid by means that includes collecting and eating food discarded by stores and food manufacturers. He fought the removal of community gardens, including the Chico Mendez Mural Garden on the Lower East Side, named after Brazilian activist Chico Mendes. Will was an active participant in protests across the country, usually for various social justice and human rights causes, and was involved with environmental movements such as Earth First! and the Fall Creek Tree Village in the Willamette National Forest outside Eugene, Oregon. Will gained some notoriety for his efforts to prevent New York City from demolishing a squat on Fifth Street in the Lower East Side. When construction crews arrived at the building to begin taking it down, he stood atop the roof waving his arms. His efforts stalled the demolition, but the city eventually leveled the building, which housed a caf√©, a meeting place and a performance space. Will later talked about the building in a program produced by Paper Tiger Television called \\"ABC Survives, Fifth Street Buried Alive\\". > We were making a home out of a crumbling building. The interior of the > building needed help, and we brought that building back to life. It was > standing strong. And the only reason it was standing was because people were > living in it.

That building is over a hundred years old. > It was standing strong. Will was a proponent of anti-corporate media and he hosted his own program on Steal This Radio, a Lower East Side-based pirate radio station. In 1998, he and partner Hazel spoke at the Ecosaloon, a weekly activism forum held on Tuesday evenings at the Wetlands Preserve nightclub. Their presentation connected the struggle to defend the forests of the Pacific Northwest with the fight against the gentrification of Manhattan's Lower East Side. After helping to organize Buy Nothing Day and a Reclaim the Streets protest in Times Square, Will traveled to Seattle for the 1999 WTO protests, and was a long-standing participant in the New York City Direct Action Network (DAN) and New York Independent Media Center (IMC). In August 2001 he joined participants for a roving exploration of usable food in Tribeca garbage; they were accompanied by a TV crew from PBS's Life 360. In his latter years, Will began recording documentary videos, releasing them on the internet through the Indymedia network of websites. During the summer of 2006, Will continued videotaping demonstrations, including a June 15 protest at the Mexican Consulate in response to a police incursion into a teacher's plant√≥n (encampment). On June 29 he video-recorded and helped organize a protest against Victoria's Secret at the Manhattan Mall in response to the resources used to print the high volume of mail-order catalogs which the company mails out. He also filmed a street theater performance by the group A for Anarchy, organized in response to the release of the film V for Vendetta. At the time of his death, he was working on a documentary about folk punk music. =International= In 2000, while visiting the Czech Republic Will attended a protest in Prague against the International Monetary Fund Summit. He later traveled through South America while participating in anti-globalization. He reached Ecuador, Argentina, Chiapas and Brazil in that trip. Death Traveling under a tourist visa, Will arrived in Oaxaca in early October 2006 in order to document and film the teachers' strike. On October 27, he was videotaping near a barricade erected by pro-strike protesters when he was shot twice. In the last few minutes of the video Will filmed before being shot, voices speaking in Spanish are heard demanding that filming be stopped and cameras be turned off. In the final seconds of the video a voice in Spanish reprimands Will for not having turned off the camera. In the middle of this statement a gunshot is heard, there is a scream, the camera pans down to the ground and the video ends. Will died while being carried from the area in search of medical help. Two others, Esteban Zurita L√≥pez and teacher Emilio Alonso Fabi√°n, were also killed. Several others were injured. 26 protesters were ultimately murdered during this mobilization. A truth commission later classified his death as an \\"extrajudicial execution\\". During a news conference on October 29, 2006, Oaxaca mayor Manuel Mart√≠nez said that four men, all local public officials, were being detained in connection with the shooting. Reaction =Federal Police mobilized= Later on the day of the shooting, the Oaxaca airport was closed to commercial flights as the Federal Police arrived to reestablish government control of the city. The army was also mobilized to provide intelligence support to the police, but not to engage directly with protesters. APPO representatives declared their intention to resist the government's armed response to the crisis. At the beginning of November, violent clashes continued between protesters and police. The government claimed that the Federal Police that entered Oaxaca were unarmed. =Demonstrations at Mexican consulates= On October 30, more than 200 protesters convened outside the Mexican consulate in New York City to deplore the killing of Will and others and to demand an end to the violence. The protest was organized by the grassroots group named in his honor, The Friends of Brad Will. =Committee to Protect Journalists= The Committee to Protect Journalists sent an open letter on October 30 to the Mexican attorney general calling on the Mexican government to launch an investigation into Will's death. The statement said that David Vega Vera, special independent prosecutor, had begun gathering information related to the case. =Commemoration and memorial= Poster of Will at the 2006 New York City Halloween Parade On November 11 and 12, 2006, Friends of Brad Will organized a gathering in New York City to commemorate Will's life. The event included a memorial service at St Mark's Church in-the-Bowery attended by 250 people, as well as speeches and concerts.Anderson, Lincoln. \\"Brad Will gets a loving, raucous, anarchist sendoff\\", The Villager, November 15‚Äì21, 2006. Outside the church was an array of freegan food as well as a pile of Will's personal possessions, from which attendees were urged to take. It was followed by a procession through the East Village described by The Villager as \\"jubilant and rowdy\\" and culminated in marchers breaking into the former Charas/El Bohio, inside which they briefly cavorted, scrawled graffiti, twirled fire bolas and cycled. =Brad= David Rovics wrote a song about his life and death, titled 'Brad'.

The band is known for the biting wit of their lyrics. They have released four full length albums: Mammal Insect Marriage (1983) (on Ludwig Van Ear Records), The Day the Music Died (1985) and Ghostride (1989) (both on It's Only a Record Records), and a self-titled CD (1998). They have also released two tapes, Curiosity Rocks (1982 - allegedly recorded in only 6 hours) and Rock With Your Sock On (1987), as well as an EP, Models (1987). And, finally, a 37-song career overview entitled I Did a Power Slide in the Taco Stand: Anthology 1982-2001 was released in 2004. Steve Albini, the famed punk rock musician and recording engineer, said the group played \\"good funny music\\". Albini also played with Tiller in the band Army. The band line-up as of 2004 was Jay Tiller on vocals and guitar, Neil Socol on bass, and Rusty on drums. Couch Flambeau was formed by two Greendale, WI High School friends, guitarist Jay Tiller and drummer Ron Faiola (a.k.a. Ron Ford/Giant Wow) in 1980. Their first shows were in the fall of 1981 at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee's dormitories under the name Couch Potatoes. For these shows, Tiller and Faiola would wear pyjamas and paper bags over their heads while playing early versions of songs that ended up on the first Couch Potatoes release, Curiosity Rocks. By the spring of 1982, bassist Neil Socol was added to the lineup and the Couch Potatoes played an early gig at the Starship, one of only two Milwaukee punk clubs. Two songs (\\"Mobile Home\\" and \\"I'm a Waiter\\") recorded at that show became DJ favorites on the fledgling college radio station WMSE. Constant airplay earned the Couch Potatoes a large cult following in Milwaukee, which led to more local shows and the recording of the \\"Curiosity Rocks\\" cassette release in the fall of 1982. Eventually the band decided to replace the name Couch Potatoes (based on characters in a Robert Armstrong \\"Mickey Rat\\" comic book) with a more \\"original\\" name. Faiola came up with Couch Flambeau after seeing a Canadian fire prevention movie where a cat goes looking for \\"mouse flambeau.\\" 1982 to 1986 were the band's most active years in Milwaukee, which found them headlining clubs and opening concerts for the Violent Femmes, The Replacements, The Damned, and the Butthole Surfers. They also introduced Evanston, Illinois's Big Black to Milwaukee audiences at the legendary Cafe Voltaire. During the Models sessions in 1986, Faiola left the band to pursue a film career and Madison, Wisconsin drummer Meredith Young (Appliances SFB) played a few shows with Couch Flambeau until Tiller's art school friend Joe Hausch joined in late 1986. While Hausch played the live Flambeau shows, Tiller played the drums on studio recordings. Hausch left the band in late 1994 and current drummer Rusty has been with Flambeau since then. Eventually, Tiller became a State Sheriff for the state of Wisconsin.

Biography Born in Antwerp, he lived for at least four decades in Naples, probably starting from 1626 and definitely from the 1630s.Biographical details at The Netherlands Institute for Art History He became very wealthy from his trading activities, mainly with the Flemish and Dutch provinces and from banking, including as a financier to Philip IV, King of Spain. Feast of Herod, painted by Peter Paul Rubens for Gaspar Roomer He owned a sumptuous villa called 'Villa Bisignano' (also referred to now as 'Villa Roomer') in the Barra neighborhood of Naples. The balustrades in the villa, perhaps at his suggestion, are decorated with carvings of warriors and hunchbacks, based on northern European prints. The contemporary historian Giulio Cesare Capaccio also recorded ‚Äòmarvellous ornaments that came all the way from China‚Äô. Roomer owned chinoiserie furniture and may have played a role in popularizing this style in Naples. He was active in the trade of paintings between Southern and Northern Italy through such agents as the Flemish artists and traders Cornelis de Wael and Abraham Brueghel, who were resident in Genoa and Rome.Renato Ruotolo. \\"Roomer, Gaspar.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 21 Nov. 2013 Art collecting and patronage Gaspar Roomer was part of a group of private patrons and collectors in Naples, which also included his fellow countryman Ferdinand Vandeneynden, who contributed to a more modern and outward-looking taste in painting in Naples starting from the mid 1630s.Lattuada, Riccardo. \\"Naples: patronage and collecting.\\" The Oxford Companion to Western Art. Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 21 Nov. 2013 Roomer's taste was both contemporary and broad in style, and across nationalities. He collected works by Flemish and Dutch masters together with those of local painters. He collected across various genres including Caravaggist paintings, landscapes and genre paintings. Roomer was unique among 17th-century collectors in acquiring many non-religious works. He was also an avid collector of drawings. When he died in 1674, his art collection contained over 1,500 paintings. His collection was dispersed throughout Europe after his death. He was a patron of artists. In the late 1630s he commissioned from Rubens the Feast of Herod (now in the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh).Rubens' the Feast of Herod in the National Gallery of Scotland This Rubens painting may have contributed to the introduction to Naples of a neo-Venetian style that would impact on the evolution of the local Baroque. He also invited the local painter Aniello Falcone to paint frescos in his villa. This cycle on the History of Moses in the Villa Roomer is the only complete surviving fresco cycle of this artist.Aniello Falcone at artist finder As a trader and patron of the arts, Roomer acted as a conduit for the dispersion of styles in Naples.

She was given a lifetime ban from competition after failing a drug test at the 2008 Summer Olympics, her second doping offense.  Personal life  Blonska was born as Lyudmyla Leonidivna Shevchuk on 9 November 1977 in Simferopol, Crimea, Ukrainian SSR. In 2000, she graduated from the Kharkiv Institute as a trainer and teacher of physical culture. She then moved to Brovary with fellow athlete Serhiy Blonskyy, whom she married. They have two children ‚Äì Iryna (born 15 May 2001) and Oleksandr (born 23 June 2004).  Career  Blonska practiced rhythmic gymnastics from age five to ten. She then switched to basketball and later judo and cycle racing. At age 14 she was introduced to athletics by a local coach. In 1993, Blonska participated in the Ukrainian Youth Championships in Odessa, entering the heptathlon competition for the first time. She recalls crying out of fear before the 800m event, but then falling in love with heptathlon after scoring good results. In 1995, after finishing school, Blonska moved to the capital, Kiev, to begin training as member of the Ukrainian youth team. Five months later she received an invitation to study at the Institute of Sports and Physical Culture in Kharkiv. She found herself without a trainer and had to coach herself for a year and a half, while working at night to make ends meet. In 1998, Blonska achieved 3rd place in the national championships with 5554 points and, in 1999, improved her personal best (PB) to 5765. In May 2002, a year after becoming a mother, Blonska won the National Championship with a PB of 6039 and qualified for the European Championships in Munich. There she finished thirteenth and soon thereafter tested positive for steroids. She has said she was willing to appeal the IAAF's decision, but lacked the financial backing to do so. She served a two-year ban, before returning to the sport. Blonska generally performed better after her ban than before it was imposed. She won the gold medal at the 2005 Universiade and finished fifth at the 2006 European Championships. She won the gold medal at the 2006 World Indoor Championships in the pentathlon. Blonska's personal best heptathlon score is 6832 points, a Ukrainian record, achieved in August 2007 in Osaka where she won the silver medal. Just prior to the Beijing Olympics, she finished eighth in pentathlon at the World Indoor Championships. At the 2008 Olympics, Blonska won silver in the women's heptathlon, but she was quickly disqualified and lost her medal after she tested positive for the anabolic steroid methyltestosterone. She had qualified for the long jump final, but the International Olympic Committee decided to expel her from the Games completely. As this was her second doping offence she was given a lifetime ban from competitive athletics. Her husband was also banned for life.

Humphrey, Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing (University of California Press, 1986), p. 9. Some taraxippoi were associated with the Greek hero cults or with Poseidon in his aspect as a god of horses () who brought about the death of Hippolytus.Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 9. Pausanias, the ancient source offering the greatest number of explanations, regards it as an epithet rather than a single entity.Robert Parker, On Greek Religion (Cornell University Press, 2011), pp. 105‚Äì106; Robert Kugelmann, The Windows of Soul: Psychological Physiology of the Human Eye and Primary Glaucoma (Associated University Presses, 1983), pp. 90‚Äì91. Origin The most notoriousRobin Hard, The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology Based on H. J. Rose's Handbook of Greek Mythology (Routledge, 2004), p. 432; Pausanias (6.20.19) says the Olympian Taraxippos was the most terrifying. of the taraxippoi was the Taraxippos Olympios at Olympia. Pausanias describes the site: Horse- and chariot-races were a part of funeral games from the Homeric era. The use of a hero's tomb or an altar as the turning-post of a racetrack originates in rituals for the dead.Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 258. In the Iliad, Achilles kills Hector in retribution for the death of his friend Patroclus, then drives his chariot around the funeral pyre three times, dragging the Trojan prince's body. This magical encircling may originally have been a binding propitiation of the dead, to assure their successful passage into the afterlife and keep them from returning.Gregory Nagy, Greek Mythology and Poetics (Cornell University Press, 1990), pp. 219‚Äì220. The horse had been established as a funerary animal by the Archaic era. Commemorative art in Greece, the Etruscan civilization and ancient Rome often depicts a chariot scene or the deceased riding a horse into the afterlife.Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 62. The design of the turning posts (metae) on a Roman race course was derived from Etruscan funeral monuments, and the far turn of the Circus Maximus skirted an underground altar used for the Consualia festival at which \\"Equestrian Neptune\\" (the Roman equivalent of Poseidon Hippos, ) was honored.Humphrey, Roman Circuses, pp. 15, 62. The turn of a racetrack is the most likely spot for a crash, and so the natural dangers of a sharp curve combined with the sacral aura of a tomb or other religious site led to a belief in a supernatural presence.Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 258; Paul Plass, The Game of Death in Ancient Rome: Arena Sport and Political Suicide (University of Wisconsin Press, 1995), p. 40. Race horses were often adorned with good-luck charms or amulets to ward off malevolence.Eva D'Ambra, \\"Racing with Death: Circus Sarcophagi and the Commemoration of Children in Roman Italy\\" in Constructions of Childhood in Ancient Greece and Italy (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 2007), p. 351. Examples Some said the source of terror at Olympia was the ghost of Oenomaus, harming chariot racers as he had harmed suitors of Hippodamia. Others say it was a tomb of Myrtilus, who caused the death of Oenomaus.William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology Others said it was the tomb of an Earth-born giant, Ischenus.Lycophron, Alexandra 31, note on Ischenus. At the Isthmian Games, the Taraxippos Isthmios was the ghost of Glaucus of Pontiae, who was torn apart by his own horses.Pausanias, Guide to Greece 6.20.19. The Taraxippos Nemeios caused horses to panic during the Nemean Games: \\"At Nemea of the Argives there was no hero who harmed the horses, but above the turning-point of the chariots rose a rock, red in color, and the flash from it terrified the horses, just as though it had been fire.\\"Pausanias, Guide to Greece 6.20.19.

Hardal Jews are also known as Torani (lit., \\"Torah-oriented\\") or Torani-Leumi. Description On yeshiva.org.il, \\"Chardal\\" is described as, \\"The people who classify themselves as 'Charedi Leumi', or 'Chardal', try to keep the Mitzvot strictly, Kalah Kechamurah [light and weighty matters alike], while being involved in the national life in the state, and in the settling of Eretz Yisrael.\\" It has also been explained as the \\"Anglo Orthodox religious sector who follow a Charedi lifestyle, yet may also serve in the army in religious units, attend a Hesder yeshiva, and pursue a work career\\". Yet another explanation is, \\"those connected to the seriousness of Torah learning and stricter observance of Jewish Law - like the Charedim - but who are Zionist and have a more positive view of the secular world and Israel, like the dati leumi camp\\". The term Hardal is sometimes used to refer to those coming from the Haredi world who join Nahal Haredi (the shortened army service for Yeshiva graduates) and continue to live within the broader Hardal world. It is also sometimes used for American yeshivish Jews who moved to Israel and support the state. History The term Hardal is part of a broad process of certain groups of Religious Zionist youth becoming more strict in certain religious observances, and more ideologically driven by the thought of Zvi Yehuda Kook (son of Abraham Isaac Kook). In the late 1970s, graduates of Mercaz HaRav yeshiva began to reject certain aspects of the Religious Zionist and Bnei Akiva lifestyle. According to some sources, the term Hardal was created at a meeting of the youth group EZRA in 1990. (Ezra is the Poalei Agudah youth group associated with Torah im Derech Eretz.) In later years, the term Hardal became a group that actually started separating itself from the broader religious Zionist community in order to dedicate itself to leading a life dedicated to strict Jewish practice, without the influence of outside culture. There was emphasis placed on modesty in dress, and early marriage. Shlomo Aviner was a major ideologue for this group. In recent years, it refers to those under the influence of Zvi Thau, who left Yeshivat Merkaz HaRav to found the more Hardalic Yeshivat Har Hamor. Thau rejects secular studies and secular influences. He is also against any academic influence on teachers colleges, rejecting the influence of modern educational psychology, and modern approaches to the study of the Bible. Those who follow this approach are called followers of Yeshivat HaKav - \\"Yeshivot that follow the line\\". Characteristics Several characteristics differentiate Hardalim from both the Haredi and the mainstream Modern Orthodox religious Zionist world: Ashkenazi Hardalim might use the modern Hebrew/Sephardic pronunciation of the Hebrew language when praying, as modern Orthodox religious Zionists also do; this in contrast to Ashkenazi Haredim, who continue their tradition of using the Ashkenazi pronunciation of Hebrew. Notable is the absence of Yiddish in Hardal society and speech. Many Hardali families have chosen not to own a television, and are not consumers of the general popular culture, in contrast to Modern Orthodox religious Zionists. Hardalim typically dress like most Modern Orthodox religious Zionists would, but place a slightly larger emphasis on appearing neat, wearing their tzitzit out of their pants, and wearing a significantly larger kippah. Like other religious Zionists, they usually wear colored knitted kippahs. In contrast to Haredim, many Hardalim do not wear only white shirts or a black outfit, and only a handful of Hardalim wear a jacket and a hat; these are usually only worn by the highest levels of rabbinic leadership of the Hardal world. Hardalim see the return to the land and its building as a very important mitzvah, since they believe we are in the dawn of the Messianic Age. Therefore, hiking in the land, building settlements, and knowledge of its flora and fauna are considered as mitzvot. Most Hardalim say prayers for the State of Israel, mark the Israeli Independence Day, and Hardali men serve in the Israel Defense Forces, while most Haredim do not. An exception forms the small group of extreme right-wing Hardalim who firmly oppose the current State of Israel and want it dismantled, to subsequently replace it with a Torah-based theocracy. Hardalim fiercely opposed Israel's mass expulsion of Jews from the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria in 2005. While some Haredim also opposed the retreat and destruction of the Jewish communities, the Haredi rabbis did not condone active opposition; most (with the notable exception of Chabad Lubavitch) adopted a neutral, passively resisting, or even supportive attitude. Hardalim will usually respect the Da'as Torah of a personal rabbi, but are not as dependent as Haredim, who publicly and privately strictly adhere to the advice of their rabbinical leadership. In contrast, Modern Orthodox religious Zionists might have a personal rabbi, but are usually more independent. Unlike their Modern Orthodox counterparts, Hardali men often grow payot (sidelocks), and an untrimmed beard. Hardali women usually dress in clothing styles that are banned from the Haredi world for reasons of tzniut, such as shirts with texts on them (for example, against the expulsion of Jews from Gaza settlements in 2005), and bare feet in sandals. Internal divisions Hardalim have in common the belief, most identified with Abraham Isaac Kook, that the Zionist movement and the state of Israel play a central role in the Messianic process. This belief is tested when the state takes steps that seem to undermine the Messianic process, particularly removing Jewish residents from settlements, and transferring the parts of Land of Israel to non-Jewish control. Hardalim variously lean towards one of two general approaches to this conflict. * One approach resists compromising on Jewish control of the Land of Israel, even when this means conflict with the state of Israel. Thus, Hardalim comprised many of the most forceful opponents of anti-disengagement movement in the 2000s, and continue to actively oppose the removal of small settlements unauthorized by the government. Generally, this opposition is passive and verbal, but in rare cases, it has gone as far as vandalism of Israeli army property or stone-throwing at soldiers. * A second approach, the \\"statist\\" approach, is more willing to accept the government's policy decisions and the \\"will of the Jewish people\\", even when it seems to conflict with other religious priorities. This group sees the State of Israel as an \\"entity of holiness\\" whose decisions have intrinsic value even when in tension with other religious values. This stream is identified with Yeshivat Har Hamor, which split off in 1997 from the flagship Hardali yeshiva Yeshivat Merkaz HaRav due to these and other theological differences. The term statist also refers to many more moderate religious Zionists, who are willing to accept the \\"will of the Jewish people\\" as a consideration when it comes to many other issues, such as the secular nature of society. This latter group predates the Hardal movement by decades, and is identified much more with the mainstream Religious Zionist movement than with the Hardalim. Schools There are schools for both boys and girls located in Jerusalem, as well as in Ramat Beit Shemesh (Ahavat Yisrael). Their philosophy is \\"To adhere to an open Haredi approach to Halakha and lifestyle, while at the same time leaving the possibility for army service and university studies as a goal\\".https://www.nbn.org.il/aliyahpedia/community-a-housing/community-guide- beta-listings/12279-rappaport-boys-ramot-jerusalem.html Locations Many Hardalim live in West Bank settlements. The settlement town of Kiryat Arba, led by its Dov Lior, is considered a Hardal stronghold, as is the town of Beit El, led by Rabbis Melamed and Shlomo Aviner. Hardalim are also predominant in many other settlements, including Yitzhar, Bat Ayin, Ofra, Shilo, and the Jewish parts of Hebron. There are yeshivot in Ramat Gan and Yerucham that are seen as Hardal yeshivot. Some Jerusalem neighborhoods are also Hardal strongholds, such as Har Nof, Kiryat Moshe, and the Jewish Quarter of the Old City.

After working at various law firms, he took over his family's mail-order business and then worked as an insurance adjuster. He is chiefly known for his memoir of his year spent working for Justice McReynolds.  Life  = Early life = Knox was born in 1907, in Oak Park, Illinois to James Samuel Knox and Elizabeth Knox (n√©e Frush). In high school, he began writing pen pal letters to celebrities. He began with Civil War veterans and proceeded to such luminaries of the day as Helen Keller, William Howard Taft, and Admiral Byrd. He established an ongoing correspondence with members of the United States Supreme Court, including Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Benjamin N. Cardozo, and Willis Van Devanter. His most sustained correspondence was with Van Devanter, one of the conservative \\"Four Horsemen\\" of the Supreme Court. Knox did undergraduate work at the University of Chicago (Ph.B. 1930) and then studied law at Northwestern University School of Law (J.D. 1934) and the Harvard Law School (LL.M. 1936). He was an indefatigable diarist, generating more than 750 pages of scrapbook, commentary and written recollection by the time he reached college. At one time, Knox claimed that he intended to surpass Samuel Pepys as a diarist. = The year in Washington = After his graduation from Harvard, Knox sought employment with Van Devanter. Van Devanter recommended Knox to fellow justice James Clark McReynolds, who had three clerks during his time on the bench, beginning in 1927 with Maurice Mahoney for seven years, followed by John Knox for one term, and finally John McHale who came to him from Justice van Devanter on the latter's retirement and remained with him until 1941. Only after accepting the job did Knox learn that McReynolds was difficult to work for. Knox served as private secretary and law clerk to McReynolds during the Supreme Court's October 1936 term.Swaine, Robert T. (1948). The Cravath Firm and its Predecessors 1819‚Äì1948, vol III, p. 175, entry for John Knox. Knox would later write a long memoir of that experience, A Year in the Life of a Supreme Court Clerk in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Washington, centered mostly on his relations with McReynolds and McReynolds's two black servants, but also containing observations on other members of the Supreme Court at that time, and the historical period in general. Such memoirs are rare; few other law clerks to Supreme Court justices have documented the experience, and Knox's memoir, though not the first published, represents one of the earliest such documents. = Subsequent career = Knox‚Äôs clerkship ended when McReynolds fired him for taking time off to sit for the Washington, D.C. bar examination, which Knox failed. The remainder of his life was a succession of personal and professional disappointments. He returned to Illinois in 1937. He initially landed, from 1938 to 1942, a position with a prestigious Chicago law firm (Loesch, Scofield, Loesch & Burke) but was fired when he failed the Illinois bar examination. Although Knox finally passed the exam (on his third attempt), he never acquired a secure and permanent position with a firm. From 1942 to 1945, he worked as Senior Attorney, U.S. War Production Board, Region VI, and from 1945 to early 1947 at the Cravath law firm in New York City. An attempt at running his family's already faltering mail-order book business after his father's death proved disastrous, but Knox eventually found his niche in the Chicago claims office of the Allstate Insurance Company, a Sears subsidiary, working there until his retirement in 1973. Knox was a member of the Bars of Illinois, New York and of the Supreme Court of the United States. He also belonged to the Society of Mayflower Descendants, the Society of Colonial Wars, the Sons of the American Revolution, the Sons of the Revolution, and the Society of the War of 1812. Knox's club at Harvard was Lincoln's Inn. The dwindling value of the Sears stock on which Knox's retirement income was based made his last years difficult. A lonely bachelor who struggled with prostate cancer the last decade of his life, Knox died in 1997 in Oak Park, leaving many of his papers (including his letters from Civil War Veterans) to Harvard Law School.

The heiress to a wine merchant's business, she is also an amateur sleuth, living in Ancient Rome during the reign of Augustus Caesar. Character history Claudia was born in the Subura, a slum of Rome in about 35 BC (as of the first novel, taking place in 13 BC, she is twenty-two years old). Her father was a camp follower with the Roman Army, who died under mysterious circumstances in Gaul when Claudia was only ten. A short time later, her mother committed suicide. Forced to make her own way in the world, Claudia earned a meager living as a striptease dancer in a tavern (and occasional prostitute). Eventually, she married wealthy wine merchant Gaius Seferius, a businesslike arrangement through which she gained security, in exchange for allowing Gaius to gain a young, beautiful, and lively trophy wife. A few years after their marriage, Gaius died unexpectedly, leaving his entire estate to Claudia. Unwilling to admit a woman, the Winemakers' Guild offered to buy her out, but she was too proud to accept. Thereafter, the Guild has tried, in all manner of ways, to drive her out of business. Unwilling to give up, Claudia has fought a never-ending battle to keep the business afloat, including engaging in a host of semi-legal or illegal schemes to cut costs and raise capital. In the course of her life, she also takes a keen interest in several mysteries, both in Rome and throughout the Empire, applying her quick wit and investigative skills. =Family and friends= Claudia's greatest admirer is Marcus Cornelius Orbilio, an investigator with the Imperial Security Police, of patrician rank. A dogged and clever detective, Orbilio is aware of most, if not all, of the crooked dealings she engages in to survive, but refrains from turning her in because he is so deeply in love with her - and because, despite what she might think, her dealings are often petty crimes compared with the murders, rapes, and conspiracies against the state he is usually investigating. Claudia lives in a state of denial about her own attraction to Orbilio, instead viewing him as her nemesis, angling to win election to the Senate by catching her in her illegal activities. This fear of exposure often comes between them, though they do manage to collaborate on several bigger cases. Claudia also inherited Gaius's family as her in-laws, including his shrewish sister, Julia, Julia's lecherous husband, Marcellus, and Gaius's daughter by his first wife, a sullen teenager named Flavia.

Lawrence (December 22, 1892 ‚Äì June 12, 1970) was a United States Army colonel who would survive the Bataan Death March to later become the first Executive Vice President of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). Early life and career A native of Guyton, Georgia, Lawrence enlisted in the United States Army in 1915 where he served for 33 years, including both World War I and World War II. Assignment to the Philippines By the start of World War II, Lawrence was a lieutenant-colonel in the United States Army Quartermaster Corps serving in the Philippines when Japan invaded the country on December 22, 1941, as part of the Asian nation's Pacific conquests, now known as the Battle of the Philippines. During this time, the quartermasters (including Lawrence) attempted to purchase as much food as possible to outlast the invaders, but were stopped by their own commanding generals. This accounted for losses of 10 million pounds of rice as a result in one instance. In Lawrence's case at Tarlac where he served as depot commander, he had planned on seizing about 2,000 cases of canned food, mostly fish and corned beef, and a large amount of clothing from Japanese firms stationed in the Philippines, but was refused by General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters claiming that Lawrence had no right to confiscate these items. In fact, MacArthur's staff threatened the lieutenant-colonel with court martial if he attempted to take those supplies. The supplies were not taken as a result and were later destroyed during the Battle of Bataan. World War II During the battle, food supplies became so scarce that soldiers became hunters in an effort to stay alive. Even though American and Filipino forces would be victorious in early battles, they could not hold on and Bataan fell on April 8, 1942. Lawrence was among the 15,000 Americans who surrendered with 60,000 Filipinos and were forced into the Bataan Death March. He survived the march and would spend the rest of the war as a prisoner of war. Lawrence was discharged from the US Army in 1948 after the end of World War II. He would earn the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Mexican Border Service Medal, the World War I Victory Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, and the American Defense of the Pacific medal. Institute of Food Technologists service After retirement from the Army, Lawrence agreed to become the first Executive Secretary (now Executive Vice President) of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) in 1949. He took over the secretary's role from Carl R. Fellers, head of the food technology department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and moved the national offices to its present location in Chicago. Lawrence's tenure as Executive Secretary would see IFT grow from 3,000 members in 1949 to 6,000 members at the time of his retirement from the IFT in 1961. Post-IFT activities Following IFT, Lawrence served as advisor to the president of the National Florasynth Laboratory in Chicago until he retired for good in 1963. He and his wife then moved to Romney, West Virginia, where he lived until his death in 1970. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. References * Goldblith, S.A. (1993).

By about 1180/82 he assumed the title of Duke of Merania, referring to the Adriatic seacoast of Kvarner which his ancestors had conquered in the 1060s and annexed to Istria and Carniola.Milko Kos, Zgodovina Slovencev: od naselitve do reformacije (Ljubljana, 1933), p. 142 Life Berthold was the son of Count Berthold III of Andechs and his wife Hedwig of Wittelsbach. His father had been a loyal vassal of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and in turn was enfeoffed with the Istrian march upon the death of the Sponheim margrave Engelbert III. Young Berthold IV first appeared in 1170 and was mentioned as Count of Andechs in an 1172 deed. In 1175 he served as co-ruler in the March of Istria. After Emperor Frederick deposed Duke Henry the Lion in 1180, his mother's relative Otto of Wittelsbach received the Duchy of Bavaria, while Berthold received the Duchy of Merania. The rule over the self-styled \\"Merania\\" actually encompassed the same area as the old Istrian margraviate, and did not constitute a separate administrative or political entity; however, its ruler gained prestige from his new ducal title, and the comital House of Andechs was elevated to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1186, he accompanied Emperor Frederick's son Henry VI to Italy and his marriage with Constance of Sicily. In 1189, he led the third division of the imperial army and was its standard-bearer on the Third Crusade, in which he led the Crusaders with Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia in the Battle of Philomelion in 1190. In 1195, he appeared as Vogt (reeve) of Tegernsee Abbey in Bavaria. Berthold committed himself to join the Crusade of 1197, however, he did not participate until Henry's death in the same year. Though he had opposed the emperor's Erbreichsplan, he backed the claims of Henry's younger brother Philip of Swabia against the politics of Pope Innocent III who supported Philip's Welf rival Otto IV. At this juncture, the House of Andechs was at the height of its power and influence, with extended possessions stretching from Franconia down to the Adriatic. Berthold died in 1204 and was buried at the Andechs private monastery in Die√üen, Bavaria. Marriage and issue Berthold, Agnes and their family, Hedwig Codex, 1353 About 1180, Berthold married Agnes of Rochlitz, a daughter of Margrave Dedi III of Lusatia from the Saxon House of Wettin. They had: * Otto I (d. 1234), succeeded his father as Duke of Merania, married Beatrice II of Hohenstaufen, daughter of Count Otto I of Burgundy, became Count palatine of Burgundy in 1211 *Ekbert (d. 1237), Bishop of Bamberg from 1203, guardian of his nephew Otto II from 1234 *Henry II (d. 1228), Margrave of Istria and Carniola from 1204, married Sophia of Weichselburg, heiress of the estates in the Windic March and Metlika *Hedwig (1174‚Äì1243), married Henry I the Bearded, Duke of Silesia, became High Duchess of Poland in 1232, canonized by the Catholic Church in 1267 *Gertrude (d. 1213), married Andrew II, became Queen of Hungary in 1205, murdered *Agnes (d. 1201), married King Philip II of France and became French consort in 1196, repudiated in 1200 *Berthold (d. 1251), Archbishop of Kalocsa from 1206, Patriarch of Aquileia from 1218 While passing through Serbia on the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa met the Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja in Ni≈° on 27 July 1189. There it was negotiated that a daughter of Berthold would marry Tohu, son of Prince Miroslav of Zahumlje on the feast of Saint George next (24 April 1190). This marriage does not seem to have taken place and the Historia de Expeditione Friderici Imperatoris does not name the daughter.

CDSs are designed to enforce domain separation and typically include some form of content filtering, which is used to designate information that is unauthorized for transfer between security domains or levels of classification, such as between different military divisions, intelligence agencies, or other operations which critically depend on the timely sharing of potentially sensitive information. The goal of a CDS is to allow a trusted network domain to exchange information with other domains, either one-way or bidirectionally, without introducing the potential for security threats that would normally come with network connectivity. Although the goal is 100% assurance, this is not possible in practice, thus CDS development, assessment, and deployment are based on comprehensive risk management. Due to the sensitive nature of their use, every aspect of an accredited CDS must be rigorously evaluated under what is known as a Lab-Based Security Assessment (LBSA) in order to reduce the potential vulnerabilities and risks to the system itself and those to which it will be deployed. The evaluation and accreditation of CDSs in the United States is primarily under the authority of the National Cross Domain Strategy and Management Office (NCDSMO) within the National Security Agency (NSA). The three primary elements demanded from cross domain solutions are: # Data confidentiality; most often imposed by hardware-enforced one-way data transfer # Data integrity: content management using filtering for viruses and malware; content examination utilities; in high-to-low security transfer audited human review # Data availability: security-hardened operating systems, role-based administration access, redundant hardware, etc. The acceptance criteria for information transfer across domains or cross-domain interoperability is based on the security policy implemented within the solution. This policy may be simple (e.g., antivirus scanning and whitelist [or \\"allowlist\\"] check before transfer between peer networks) or complex (e.g., multiple content filters and a human reviewer must examine, redact, and approve a document before release from a high security domainSlater, T. \\"Cross-Domain Interoperability\\", Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium - NCOIC, 2013). Unidirectional networks are often used to move information from low security domains to secret enclaves while assuring that information cannot escape. Cross-domain solutions often include a High Assurance Guard. Though cross-domain solutions have, as of 2019, historically been most typical in military, intelligence and law enforcement environments, there is also a use case for cross domain solutions in industry. Many industrial settings have control systems and analytic systems which are, or should be, in different security domains. One example is the flight control and infotainment systems on an airliner. Given the wide variety of use cases in industry, different levels of third party accreditation and certification of aspects of the cross-domain solution will be appropriate for different applications, and can be found among different providers.  Types of Cross Domain Solutions  There are three types of cross domain solutions (CDS) according to Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 854001p. These types are broken down into Access, Transfer, and Multi- level solutions (MLS) and all must included in the cross domain baseline list prior to Department of Defense specific site implementations. Access Solution \\"An access solution describes a user‚Äôs ability to view and manipulate information from domains of differing security levels and caveats. In theory, the ideal solution respects separation requirements between domains by preventing overlaps of data between domains, which ensures data of differing classifications cannot ‚Äòleak‚Äô (i.e. data spill) between networks at any host layer of the OSI/TCP model. In practice, however, data spills are an ever- present concern that system designers attempt to mitigate within acceptable risk levels. For this reason, data transfer is addressed as a separate CDS\\". Transfer Solution A transfer CDS simply offers the ability to move information between security domains that are of different classification level or different caveat of the same classification level. Transfer solutions must be evaluated to ensure the guard is capable of respecting all constrictions of the various domains that require protection. Multi-level Solutions \\"Access and transfer solutions rely on multiple single level (MSL) systems that maintain the separation of domains; this architecture is considered multiple individual levels of security (MILS). A multi-level solution (MLS) differs from MILS architecture by storing all data in a single domain. The solution uses trusted labeling and integrated Mandatory Access Control (MAC) schema to parse data according to user credentials and clearance in order to authenticate read and right privileges. In this manner, an MLS is considered an all-in-one CDS, encompassing both access and data transfer capabilities.\\"  Unintended consequences  In previous decades, multilevel security (MLS) technologies were developed and implemented that enabled objective and deterministic security, but left little wiggle room for subjective and discretionary interpretation. These enforced mandatory access control (MAC) with near certainty. This rigidity prevented simpler solutions that would seem acceptable on the surface. Automated information systems have enabled extensive information sharing that is sometimes contrary to the need to avoid sharing secrets with adversaries. The need for information sharing has led to the need to depart from the rigidity of MAC in favor of balancing need to protect with need to share. When the ‚Äòbalance‚Äô is decided at the discretion of users, the access control is called discretionary access control (DAC) that is more tolerant of actions that manage risk where MAC requires risk avoidance. Allowing users and systems to manage the risk of sharing information is in some way contrary to the original motivation for MAC. The unintended consequences of sharing can be complex to analyze and should not necessarily be left to the discretion of users who may have a narrow focus on their own critical need. These documents provide standards guidance on risk management: # , SP 800-53 Rev3 # , Instruction No. 1253 References Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO), Cross Domain Overlay, 1 December 2011, ver 1.0; provides extensive security control guidance to implement CDS platform address security controls for hardware and software, enforced with advanced inspections.

Their largely instrumental sound builds bridges between classical music and post-rock, shoegaze, space rock and drone music, often resulting in their being described as an orchestral extension of the work of The Velvet Underground and Spacemen 3.Allmusic review of The Flowers of Hell album Led by synesthete composer Greg Jarvis, much of their repertoire is an exploration of the timbre-to-shape synesthesia that causes Jarvis to involuntarily perceive all sounds as floating abstract visual forms. The group's music has been championed by Lou Reed, Kevin Shields (My Bloody Valentine),Now magazine Perlich's PicksMondo magazine concert review and Pete 'Sonic Boom' Kember (Spacemen 3) who mentored the group through the creation of their debut album, and numerous others. They have had positive coverage from media including Rolling Stone, NME, Pitchfork, and BBC Radio. In 2020, their decade old Come Hell Or High Water LP was put on display in the Tate Britain's exhibition of works by the 19th century Art Nouveau illustratorAubrey Beardsley. The group's final performance before the coronavirus lockdown took place at the exhibition's opening gala.  History  The Flowers of Hell moniker comes from an old blues concept of transformation whereby the misery and toil of the musician results in the pleasure of the listener. The name was first used by the group‚Äôs founder Greg Jarvis on tracks included on various UK newspaper and magazine covermount CDs in 2002 and 2003, of which just under two million units were distributed. Jarvis expanded the project into a London-based live act in 2005 with the founding six piece line up consisting of himself as the principal guitarist, Guri Hummelsund on drums, Abi Fry on viola (later of British Sea Power and Bat For Lashes), Owen James on trumpet, Ruth Barlow as the accompanying guitarist, and Steve Head on Hammond organ. In early 2008, following a move back to his native Toronto after a decade spent abroad in London and Eastern Europe, Jarvis debuted a North American branch of the group as an opening act for Spectrum (one of the post-Spacemen 3 projects of Pete ‚ÄòSonic Boom‚Äô Kember). The Flowers of Hell have since operated on both continents simultaneously with Jarvis going back and forth for concerts and all members contributing to recordings. Throughout the band‚Äôs evolution, Jarvis has remained as its main composer and producer. Jarvis is an audio- visual synaesthete and his compositions and productions are largely based upon the abstract visions he involuntarily experiences when hearing sounds. Synaesthesia is a cognitive trait found in 4% of the population who are born with two (or more) senses intermingled. With the timbre-to-shape variant that, differing sonic timbres give rise to a visual language of sound. Notable events in the group's history include a 2020 performance at the Tate Britain where their Come Hell Or High Water LP was on display, a 2019 performance for an audience of synesthetes at the Moscow Conservatory, NASA's mission control staff declaring their fandom and synchronizing The Flowers of Hell song Sympathy For Vengeance with fresh Discovery shuttle footage, Lou Reed highly praising the group and starting his final radio show with three of their recordings,, My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields inviting the group to open for one of the eight dates on their 2008 reunion tour, and closing the Intersection Festival of experimental classical music on Toronto's main square in 2011 and 2015. In 2010 Greg Jarvis made headlines after being detained in Sentani, West Papua by rebel soldiers from the Organisasi Papua Merdeka - Jarvis was mistaken for a spy and used a ukulele to prove he was a musician.  Collaborators  The group's early albums saw them collaborate with many musicians who‚Äôve been side players or leaders in well established acts from the experimental side of the indie rock genre. Performers who have guested on Flowers Of Hell recordings and/or live shows include Peter ‚ÄòSonic Boom‚Äô Kember (Spacemen 3), Will Carruthers (Spacemen 3, Spiritualized, Brian Jonestown Massacre), Ray Dickaty (Spiritualized), Ivan Kral (Patti Smith Group, Iggy Pop's band), Ivo Posp√≠≈°il (DG 307, Gar√°≈æ),Adams, Gregory.

The civil parish is called Burston and Shimpling. It covers an area of and had a population of 568 in 234 households at the 2011 Census. Burston is famous as the site of the Burston Strike School, the longest strike in history. In 1949, the Strike School building was registered as an educational charity. There are four self-perpetuating trustees who manage the school and try to develop it as a museum, visitor centre, educational archive, and village amenity. A rally to commemorate the school and the longest strike in UK history has been organised on the first Sunday in September every year since 1984 by the Transport and General Workers' Union and supported by other unions. St Mary's Church, though recognised as not the most exciting or interesting church in Norfolk,Norfolk Churches is notable for the role played in the Burston strike by its rector, the Reverend Charles Tucker Eland. The tower collapsed in the 18th century, and with the nave and chancel altered in Victorian times, it has something of the appearance of a barn. The church stands in a tree shaded graveyard, in which are the graves of Kitty Higdon and Tom Higdon, the teachers at the centre of the school strike. With a declining congregation, St Mary is now used partly as a school hall. The modern chance is housed in the chancel, behind an iron screen separating it from the nave. The church is a grade II* listed building Burston once had its own Burston railway station with services on the Great Eastern Main Line between Norwich and London. In 2015, it was announced that OHMO Entertainment UK would be producing a full-length feature film based on the strikes of 1914, and filming would take place in the village.

System high pertains to the IA features of information processed, and specifically not to the strength or trustworthiness of the system. System high mode is distinguished from other modes (such as multilevel security) by its lack of need for the system to contribute to the protection or separation of unequal security classifications. In particular, this precludes use of the features of objects (e.g. content or format) produced by or exposed to an AIS operating in system high mode as criteria to securely downgrade those objects. As a result, all information in a system high AIS is treated as if it were classified at the highest security level of any data in the AIS. For example, Unclassified information can exist in a secret system high computer but it must be treated as secret, therefore it can never be shared with unclassified destinations (unless downgraded by reliable human review, which itself is risky because of lack of omniscient humans.) There is no known technology to securely declassify system high information by automated means because no reliable features of the data can be trusted after having been potentially corrupted by the system high host. When unreliable means are used (including cross-domain solutions and bypass guards) a serious risk of system exploitation via the bypass is introduced. Nevertheless, it has been done where the resulting risk is overlooked or accepted. Example: When Daniel is granted access a computer system that uses System High mode, Daniel must have a valid security clearance for all information processed by the system and valid \\"need to know\\" for some, but not necessary all, informations processes by the system.

The 103rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Colorado Rockies and the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox; the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games. It was the Rockies' first appearance in a World Series. The Red Sox's victory was their second World Series championship in four seasons and their seventh overall; it also marked the third sweep in four years by the AL champions. The series began on Wednesday, October 24 and ended on Sunday, October 28. Terry Francona became the second Red Sox manager to win two World Series titles, following Bill Carrigan, who won the 1915 and 1916 World Series. Including the last three games of the AL Championship Series, the Red Sox outscored their opposition 59‚Äì15 over their final seven games. Francona also became the first manager to win his first 8 World Series games. The Rockies, meanwhile, became the first NL team to get swept in a World Series after sweeping the League Championship Series, and just the second team ever to suffer such a fate, following the Oakland Athletics in 1990. This fate would again be suffered by the 2012 Detroit Tigers, being swept by the San Francisco Giants in the World Series after sweeping the New York Yankees in the ALCS. Background The Rockies entered the Series having won 21 of their last 22 games, going back to the end of the regular season, including sweeps of the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS and the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLCS. They also beat the San Diego Padres in the NL Wild Card tie-breaker. The Red Sox swept the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the ALDS and defeated the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS after trailing three games to one, taking the final three contests by a combined score of 30‚Äì5. Neither participating team was in the previous year's postseason. The Rockies' eight-day layoff was the longest in MLB postseason history, caused by their sweep in the NLCS, the ALCS going seven games, and scheduling by MLB. Per the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Red Sox had home-field advantage in the World Series following the American League's 5‚Äì4 win in the 2007 All-Star Game. The first two games took place in Boston, with games 3 and 4 in Denver. Summary Matchups =Game 1= The Red Sox cruised to a blowout win in Game 1 behind ALCS MVP Josh Beckett, who struck out nine batters, including the first four he faced, over seven innings en route to his fourth win of the 2007 postseason. Mike Timlin and √âric Gagn√© pitched a perfect eighth and ninth, respectively. Boston Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski threw the ceremonial first pitch, as he had done before Game 1 in 2004. Rookie Dustin Pedroia led off the Sox' first inning with a home run over the Green Monster in Fenway Park off of Jeff Francis. Pedroia's homer was only the second lead-off home run to start a World Series (the only other one was hit by Baltimore's Don Buford in 1969). Kevin Youkilis then doubled to right, moved to third on David Ortiz's groundout, and scored on Manny Ramirez's single. After Mike Lowell flew out, Jason Varitek singled before J. D. Drew doubled to score Ramirez and make it 3-0 Red Sox. The Rockies got on the board in the second when Garrett Atkins doubled with one out off Beckett and scored on Troy Tulowitzki's double one out later, but the Red Sox got that run back off of Francis when Youkilis walked with two outs and scored on Ortiz's double. In the fourth, the Red Sox loaded the bases with two outs on a single, double, and intentional walk when Varitek's two-run double put them up 6‚Äì1. They put the game out of reach with seven runs in the fifth. Julio Lugo hit a leadoff single off of reliever Franklin Morales before Jacoby Ellsbury bunted into a forceout at second. After Pedroia popped out, a balk moved Ellsbury to second before he scored on Youkilis's double. Ortiz's double and Ramirez's single scored a run each. The Red Sox loaded the bases on a double and walk before Drew's single scored another run. Ryan Speier relieved Morales and walked all three batters he faced to force in three more Boston runs. Matt Herges relieved Speier and got Youkilis to fly out to right to end the inning. Though Herges and two relievers held Boston scoreless for the rest of the game, the Red Sox finished with 13 runs, the most ever in a World Series Game 1, and tied another record with nine extra base hits. The last 11 of the Red Sox runs came with two outs. =Game 2= The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Andrew Madden, a 13-year-old heart transplant recipient, accompanied by Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame member Dwight Evans. After the debacle of Game 1, Colorado appeared to return to form, scoring quickly on a groundout by Todd Helton with runners on second and third in the first. However, this would be the only time the Rockies ever led in the series as postseason veteran Curt Schilling ( IP, one run, four hits) and Boston's bullpen (Okajima, IP; Papelbon, IP) allowed no other runs in the contest. The Red Sox tied the game in the fourth off of Ubaldo Jimenez on Jason Varitek's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third, then took the lead next inning on Mike Lowell's RBI double with runners on first and second. Matt Holliday had four of Colorado's five hits in Game 2, including a base hit off Papelbon with two outs in the eighth. Before throwing another pitch, Papelbon caught Holliday leaning too far off first base and picked him off‚ÄîPapelbon's first career pickoff. =Game 3= This was the first World Series game ever played in Colorado. At 4 hours 19 minutes, it became the longest nine-inning game in World Series history until game five of 2017. Game 3 was also the 600th World Series game ever played. Starting pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka pitched five innings of scoreless ball and left in the sixth with no runs allowed. The Red Sox struck first with a six-run third inning. Rookie Jacoby Ellsbury hit a leadoff double, moved to third on Dustin Pedroia's single, and scored on David Ortiz's double. After Manny Ramirez was intentionally walked, Mike Lowell's single scored two more runs. J. D. Drew popped out before Ramirez was thrown out at home on Jason Varitek's single with Lowell advancing to third. After Julio Lugo walked to load the bases, Matsuzaka hit a two-run single for his first base hit and RBI in the Major Leagues. Ellsbury capped the scoring with his second double of the inning to knock Colorado starter Josh Fogg out of the game. The Rockies' bats came to life in the sixth and seventh innings against a normally-solid but now-shaky Boston bullpen. After Matsuzaka walked two straight in the sixth with one out, reliever Javier L√≥pez allowed back-to-back RBI singles to Brad Hawpe and Yorvit Torrealba. Mike Timlin allowed two straight leadoff singles in the seventh before NLCS MVP Matt Holliday brought the Rockies to within one run with a three-run home run off Hideki Okajima. Brian Fuentes gave back those runs in the eighth by walking Lugo with one out and allowing a subsequent single to Coco Crisp before Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia, who had four and three hits, respectively, on the night (the first time in World Series history two rookies had at least three hits in a game) hit back-to-back RBI doubles, raising Boston's lead to 9‚Äì5. Jonathan Papelbon came on for a four-out save, getting Holliday to fly out on one pitch, leaving runners on first and second. Jason Varitek would tack on Boston's tenth run in the top of the ninth off of LaTroy Hawkins with a sacrifice fly, scoring Mike Lowell who, not generally considered a stolen base threat, had just stolen third base‚Äîthe first time a Red Sox baserunner stole third base in the World Series since 1975‚Äîafter hitting a leadoff single and moving to second on a sacrifice bunt. Papelbon came back out in the bottom of the ninth to complete the save, getting the first two outs before surrendering a two-out triple to Brad Hawpe, then finishing the game with a groundout from Yorvit Torrealba. The Red Sox took Game 3 by a final score of 10‚Äì5. The Red Sox continued to set World Series records during Game 3: *Ellsbury (four hits) and Pedroia (three) combined to score three runs and drive in four, while being the first rookies to bat 1‚Äì2 in a World Series lineup. *Ellsbury became the third rookie in Series history with four hits in a game, joining Freddie Lindstrom of the New York Giants (Game 5, 1924) and Joe Garagiola of the Cardinals (Game 4, 1946). *Matsuzaka became the first Japanese pitcher to start and win a World Series game. The only pitchers in Red Sox history, other than Matsuzaka, to have two RBI and be the winning pitcher were Babe Ruth in and Cy Young in . *The Red Sox' 16 doubles tied a World Series record, set by the Champion Cardinals. The Red Sox would break the record in Game 4, finishing with 18. =Game 4= The Red Sox struck early. Rookie Jacoby Ellsbury began the first inning with a double and was advanced by Dustin Pedroia with a groundout, followed by an RBI single from David Ortiz. In the seventh inning, series MVP Mike Lowell hit a home run to give Boston a 3‚Äì0 lead and knock starter Aaron Cook out of the game. Lowell also hit a leadoff double in the fifth and scored on Jason Varitek's single. The Colorado offense answered when left fielder Brad Hawpe hit a home run off of a Manny Delcarmen fastball, bringing the Rockies within two. Relief pitcher Brian Fuentes gave back that run abruptly, allowing Boston pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty to hit a ball into the left field stands on the first pitch of the inning, extending the Red Sox lead to 4‚Äì1. In the bottom of the inning Boston pitcher Hideki Okajima allowed a one-out single to Todd Helton followed by a Garrett Atkins two-run home run, bringing the Rockies within one. Jonathan Papelbon relieved Okajima and earned his third save of the series. At 12:06 a.m. EDT on Monday, October 29, Papelbon struck out Colorado pinch hitter Seth Smith for the final out of the 2007 season. Boston had won its second World Series title in four years and seventh all-time. The Rockies became the third team in Series history (the 1937 Yankees and 1966 Orioles were the others) not to commit an error in a World Series of any length.

Ticket controversy The countdown page seen by many people attempting to buy World Series tickets: when the countdown completed it would either load a page to select seats or just restart the countdown. On October 17, 2007, a week before the first game of the World Series, the Colorado Rockies announced that tickets would be made available to the general public via online sales only, despite prior arrangements to sell the tickets at local retail outlets. Five days later, California-based ticket vendor Paciolan, Inc., the sole contractor authorized by the Colorado Rockies to distribute tickets, was forced to suspend sales after less than an hour due to an exorbitant number of purchase attempts. The Rockies organization said that they were the victims of a denial-of-service attack. The FBI started its own investigation into these claims. Ticket sales resumed the next day, with all three home games selling out within hours. The Red Sox also relied primarily on online sales to sell the game tickets, although some Fenway Park tickets were sold on the phone and at the box office. The Sox held a random drawing for the right to buy post season tickets on October 15, and winners bought tickets at a private online sale. Street prices were lower in Boston this time than in 2004: the average price, according to StubHub, was about $1500 in 2007, down about $300 from three years previously. Some Sox fans found that it was cheaper to travel to Denver to see World Series games than to pay the street price for Boston game tickets. Celebration While the celebratory crowd at Kenmore Square was not as unruly as in 2004, cars were overturned and 37 arrests were made. The Red Sox victory parade, yet again in duck boats and called a \\"Rolling Rally\\" as in 2004, was on October 30, 2007 with closer Jonathan Papelbon doing his infamous \\"Riverdance\\" while local punk band the Dropkick Murphys played their hit \\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\\". The Red Sox World Series win in 2007 continued the success of Boston-area teams in recent years. The Celtics won their 17th championship, their first championship since , the last time the Red Sox lost in the World Series, months later. Furthermore, the New England Patriots had victories in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018, the Boston Bruins in , and the Red Sox three years earlier in and six years later in and five years after that in . Quotes from the Series All quotes are from Joe Buck unless otherwise noted. Broadcasting The World Series was televised by Fox in the United States, with Joe Buck and Tim McCarver as booth announcers. The starting time for each television broadcast was 8:00 pm EDT (6:00 pm MDT). The series broke with the recent tradition of starting the World Series on a Saturday, as Major League Baseball had become convinced that weekend games drew lower television ratings. Prior to this season, every World Series since 1985 had opened on a Saturday, with the exception of the 1990 World Series. This was the first World Series to start on a Wednesday since 1968. Rogers Sportsnet (RSN) in Canada used the MLB International feed with Dave O'Brien and Rick Sutcliffe as booth announcers. NASN showed the games live to most of Europe, while in the UK, all games were shown terrestrially on Five. NHK aired the Series in Japan. On radio, the Series was broadcast nationally by ESPN Radio, with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan announcing. Locally, Joe Castiglione and Glenn Geffner called the Series for the Red Sox on WRKO in Boston, while Jack Corrigan and Jeff Kingery called it for the Rockies on KOA in Denver. Per contractual obligation, the non-flagship stations on the teams' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts.

She was the first female sports reporter for the Miami Herald in 1981, the first woman at the Washington Post on the Washington Redskins beat in 1985, and the first president of the Association for Women in Sports Media in 1988.  Career  Brennan received bachelor's and master's degrees from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. After graduating, she began working for the Miami Herald, becoming the Herald's first female sports reporter in 1981. She covered the Miami Hurricanes during their trip to the 1984 Orange Bowl national championship game, after which she wrote her first book, The Miracle of Miami. At the game, she connected with former classmate Michael Wilbon, who recommended her to his Washington Post editors; she joined the Post's sports staff shortly thereafter. She covered the Washington Redskins beat for three years, then moved on to covering the Olympic Games. She worked for the Post for 12 years before joining USA Today as its national sports columnist in 1997. She has written seven books on sports, including best-selling Inside Edge, about Olympic figure skating, which was named one of the top 100 sports books of all time by Sports Illustrated in 2002. She is an on-air commentator for ABC News, CNN, PBS NewsHour, and NPR. She has covered every Olympic Games, summer and winter, since the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. = Advocacy = In 1988, Brennan was elected the first president of the Association for Women in Sports Media. A longtime advocate for women in sports journalism, she started AWSM's scholarship-internship program for female journalism students, which has honored more than 140 students. She funds two of the scholarships, which are named after her late parents. Brennan, a nationally known speaker, has written and spoken on issues ranging from the importance of Title IX to the behavior of professional athletes to the scourge of performance-enhancing drug use in sports. Her USA Today columns on Augusta National Golf Club helped trigger the national debate on the club's lack of female members. Brennan is a leading voice on many topics involving sports in society, including the Ray Rice/domestic violence story. She is among the sports journalists to publicly pledge to no longer use the Washington Redskins name in her columns.  Personal life  Brennan is from Toledo, Ohio. Her relationship with her father in the context of sports fandom is covered in her memoir, Best Seat in the House. Brennan is a member of the Board of Trustees of Northwestern University and a national trustee at the University of Toledo.

GSI3D has been further developed and is now solely available as INSIGHT's SubsurfaceViewer MX. The software is written in Java and data is stored in extensible mark-up language XML.  A brief outline of the methodology  GSI3D utilises a digital elevation model, surface geological linework and downhole borehole and geophysical data to enable the geologist to construct cross sections by correlating boreholes and the outcrops to produce a geological fence diagram. Mathematical interpolation between the nodes along the drawn sections and the limits of the units produces a solid model comprising a stack of triangulated objects each corresponding to one of the geological units present. Scientists draw their sections based on facts such as borehole logs correlated by intuition ‚Äì the shape 'looks right' to a geologist. This 'looks right' element pulls on the geologists' wealth of understanding of earth processes, examination of exposures and theoretical knowledge gathered over a career in geology. GSI3D enables the efficient capture of tacit and implicit knowledge which was until now trapped in geologist's heads.  GSI3D Research Consortium  Between April 2010 and April 2015, The British Geological Survey operated the 5-year GSI3D Research Consortium under license from INSIGHT GmbH. This not-for-profit consortium provided subscription-based access to a BGS-customized version of GSI3D along with a website and support package as a platform to develop a geological modelling community based around the cross-section methodology. The consortium successfully brought together Geological Surveys, commercial companies and academics from around the globe.

(June 27, 1900 - February 7, 1977) was a Roman Catholic priest in the Maryknoll Order. In 1945 he founded of The Christophers, a Christian inspirational group which broadcast a weekly inspirational television show (of the same name) on ABC. ABC canceled the show in the mid-1960s; Keller continued to produce it, however, and it is still syndicated to local television stations. The Christophers also award the Christopher Awards each year, primarily to media that exemplify the human spirit, and have a weekly syndicated radio show. Early years Keller's father was an Irish immigrant named James Kelleher, who changed his name to Keller to avoid anti-Irish sentiment. His mother, Margaret Selby, was Irish on her mother's side and Portuguese on her father's. James Jr. was born in 1900 in Oakland, California, the fourth of six children in a devout Roman Catholic household.Out to Change the World (a biography of Fr. James Keller) by James Armstrong, Crossroad Publishing Company (New York, 1984), p. 11. This work will be cited as \\"Armstrong\\" hereafter.Cherishing Maryknoll's History by Fr. Dennis Moorman, MM After a brief stint in the US Army, Keller entered a seminary in Menlo Park, California. After two years, he was inspired by contacts with Father Thomas F. Price and Father James Anthony Walsh, leaders of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, more familiarly known as Maryknoll. In 1921, he left California, to attend the Maryknoll Seminary in Ossining, New York. He spent the summer of 1922 doing orderly work and watching medical and surgical procedures at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York, in order to prepare himself for mission work in areas without medical care. In 1923, he was ordained subdeacon and made a commitment to lifetime celibacy. He then continued his education at Catholic University in Washington, D.C., where he received his baccalaureate and, the following year, a master's degree in medieval history. From a professor, Peter Guilday, he learned the importance of historical trends as opposed to individual occurrences.Armstrong, p.13. In 1925 he was, atypically, ordained in his parish church in Oakland, CA., largely because his archbishop thought he would get a better crowd, which would be exposed to the Maryknoll movement.Armstrong p. 13. He was surprised when he was told to remain in California for a vacation while awaiting assignment. Then he learned that Fr. McCormack, who headed the small Maryknoll chapter in San Francisco, had been assigned to a mission in China, and that he was to take over as chapter head at the age of 25, fresh out of school. Keller never received an overseas mission assignment. Keller starred in a 1951 documentary called You Can Change the World that was based on his teachings. He went on to be the host of a 1950s and 1960s television show called Christopher Closeup.

It takes its title from a gramophone recording of Pablo de Sarasate's violin composition, Zigeunerweisen, which features prominently in the story. The film makes the first part of Suzuki's Taish≈ç Roman Trilogy, followed by Kagero-za (1981) and Yumeji (1991), surrealistic psychological dramas and ghost stories linked by style, themes and the Taish≈ç period (1912-1926) setting. All three were produced by Genjiro Arato. When exhibitors declined to screen the film, Arato screened it himself in an inflatable, mobile tent to great success. It won Honourable Mention at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival, was nominated for nine Japanese Academy Awards and won four, including best director and best film, and was voted the number one Japanese film of the 1980s by Japanese critics. Plot Vacationing in a small seaside village, Aochi, a professor of German, runs into Nakasago, a former colleague turned nomad. Nakasago is being pursued by an angry mob for allegedly seducing and killing a fisherman's wife. Police intervene and Aochi vouches for his friend, preventing his arrest. The two catch up over dinner where they are entertained by and become smitten with the mourning geisha Koine. Six months later, Aochi visits his friend and is shocked to find that he has settled down and is having a child with Sono, a woman who bears a remarkable resemblance to Koine. Nakasago plays him a recording of Zigeunerweisen and they discuss inaudible mumbling on the record. Nakasago suddenly takes to the road again with Koine, leaving Sono to birth their child alone. Both men enter affairs with the other's wife. Sono later dies of the flu and is replaced by Koine as a surrogate mother. Nakasago takes to the road yet again. Aochi learns of Nakasago's death in a landslide. Koine visits Aochi and requests the return of the Zigeunerweisen record but he is sure he never borrowed it. Cast * Yoshio Harada as Nakasago * Naoko Otani as Koine/Sono * Toshiya Fujita as Aochi * Michiyo Okusu as Shuko, Aochi's wife * Kisako Makishi as Taeko * Kirin Kiki as Kimi * Akaji Maro as Blind Man * Sumie Sasaki as Maid in a hotel * Isao Tamagawa as Doctor Amaki * Hatsuo Yamaya as a Policeman Production Director Seijun Suzuki was ostensibly terminated from his contract with Nikkatsu Studios in 1968 for making \\"movies that make no sense and no money\\" and subsequently blacklisted. In the proceeding years he met frequently with his crew at his home in developing ideas for new projects. This resulted in Zigeunerweisen and Kagero-za‚Äîthe first two films in what would become Suzuki's Taish≈ç Roman Trilogy. Suzuki felt that action films were falling out of favour and wanted to create a new type of film. Writer Y≈çz≈ç Tanaka lived close by and visited Suzuki regularly where they infrequently discussed the film during games of Go. The story was based on Hyakken Uchida's novel, Disk of Sarasate. It was felt to be too short and was expanded from their conversations. For example, when Tanaka's uncle died during that time, he noticed that his cremated bones were pink. This was incorporated into the screenplay. Suzuki's de facto blacklisting ended with the release of his critically and commercially unsuccessful 1977 film A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness. The money to finance Zigeunerweisen only became available in 1979 when Suzuki met then‚Äìtheatre producer Genjiro Arato. Thus it became their first fully independently produced film. It was shot on location in Japan. Style and themes Zigeunerweisen is a departure from director Suzuki Seijun's Nikkatsu films in many ways. It was shot entirely on location without access to studio resources; it runs 144 minutes, in contrast to the former's 90-minute maximum; and its intellectual characters and period setting and subject matter invited a more literary audience as opposed to the younger genre fans that formed Suzuki's cult following. On the other hand, freed of studio constraints, Suzuki was able to carry his style even further in the direction his genre work had taken and abandon traditional narrative entirely in favour of random occurrences and incongruous and misleading associations. He presents, comments on and challenges the conceptions of the Taish≈ç era, specifically the wide introduction and assimilation of Western culture into Japan and its effect on the Japanese identity. Releases and reception Producer Genjiro Arato was unable to procure exhibitors for Zigeunerweisen and exhibited the film himself with his company Cinema Placet in a specially- built, inflatable, mobile tent. The film was initially screened beside the Tokyo Dome on April 1, 1980. The film was an immediate success and was quickly picked up for a wide release. In its 22-week run it sold 56 000 seats, where 10 000 was generally considered a success for an independent film. Critics named Zigeunerweisen the \\"must-see\\" film of 1980, it garnered four Japanese Academy Awards and reignited Suzuki's career. Little More Co. re-released the full Taish≈ç Roman Trilogy theatrically on April 28, 2001, in the Deep Seijun retrospective. In conjunction they released the trilogy on DVD (without English subtitles), marking its debut on home video. The film was not distributed internationally but did appear in film festivals and retrospectives. It was screened in competition at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival and appeared in the first British retrospective of Suzuki's films at the 1988 Edinburgh International Film Festival. In North American, Kino International released a DVD edition of the film on March 7, 2006. It features a 25-minute interview with Suzuki discussing the making of the Taish≈ç Roman Trilogy, a biography and filmography of the same, the theatrical trailer and a gallery of promotional material and photographs. The DVD is also available in a box set encompassing the trilogy. Awards Zigeunerweisen received nine nominations at the 1981 Japanese Academy Awards and won in four categories, Best Film, Suzuki won for Best Director, Takeo Kimura for Best Art Director and Michiyo Okusu for Best Supporting Actress. Also nominated were Naoko Otani for Best Actress, Toshiya Fujita for Best Supporting Actor, Y≈çz≈ç Tanaka for Best Screenplay, Kazue Nagatsuka for Best Cinematography and Mitsuo Onishi for Best Lighting. At the Kinema Junpo Awards, it duplicated the same four wins plus a fifth Best Actress award for Naoko Otani. At the Yokohama Film Festival it won Best Film, Director and Cinematographer. Further prizes include the Blue Ribbon Awards (Best Director), Hochi Film Awards (Special Award) and the Mainichi Film Concurs (Best Screenplay and Best Cinematographer). The film was also voted the best Japanese film of the 1980s by Japanese film critics. On the international front, the film won Honourable Mention at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival in 1981.

Howe's kidnapping and killing by being thrown from a bridge became a cause c√©l√®bre in Pennsylvania, receiving widespread media attention for over a decade. Finally, in September 2006, Eldred ‚ÄúTed‚Äù Walker, James O'Brien, and Timothy O'Brien were convicted for participation in Howe's murder. Background Around 8pm on October 27, Howe was walking home from a Girl Scouts Halloween party in Oil City, Pennsylvania, when she was abducted at the corner of West First Street and Reed Street, two blocks from home. A local resident, Dan Paden, however, witnessed the kidnapping, thereby providing investigators with details of the circumstances, the abductor and the getaway vehicle used. Two days later, a member of Howe's family found a piece of her gymnast costume near an abandoned railroad bed in a rural, wooded area in the nearby township of Rockland. Despite a search of the area the day before, Howe's body was found about 200 yards from where the clothing was found the next morning. Howe's abductors had thrown her alive from a railroad trestle bridge into a dry, rocky creek bed near Coulter's Hole in Rockland, and she had died of blunt force trauma to the head and chest caused by the fall. Investigation The mystery of Howe's disappearance and murder continued for nearly ten years until the investigation had a major breakthrough. In 2002, a DNA sample taken from Oil City resident James O'Brien, who was serving a prison sentence for attempting to kidnap an Oil City woman in 1995, matched a sample of seminal DNA found on Howe's body in tests run by the FBI lab in Washington, D.C. O‚ÄôBrien had not been a suspect earlier as investigators mistakenly believed he was in jail at the time of the attack, and neither of the brothers fit the eyewitness description. The DNA revelation intensified the investigation, with increased presence in the area by the FBI and the Pennsylvania State Police, with the latter searching the home of Eldred \\"Ted\\" Walker, who said he may have opened his home to some \\"really bad\\" people once who may have done \\"a disgusting thing.\\" An early suspect, Walker and one of his vehicles had resembled those provided by the witness, but the investigation at the time stalled as his DNA did not match.  Trial  In September 2006, Walker, as part of a plea bargain, pleaded guilty to kidnapping and third degree murder and agreed to testify against the O'Brien brothers. In court, he admitted grabbing Howe and passing her to the O‚ÄôBriens who were waiting in a parked car. He also admitted knowing the brothers were upstairs in his house with the girl as he heard her crying. He, however, denied any involvement in her death. In October, as the trial ended, the brothers were found guilty of kidnapping, conspiracy and second and third-degree murder, but were acquitted on charges of first degree murder and rape. Legacy Following Howe's murder, the Oil City Council voted to prohibit night-time trick-or-treating. The ban remained in place for 15 years, before being lifted in time for Halloween 2008.

The name of the group is derived from the Greek word christophoros, which means \\"Christ-bearer\\". Although the founders were Maryknoll priests, and the Roman Catholic orientation is overt, The Christophers preach a doctrine of religious tolerance and intend their publications to be generally relevant to those of all faiths. Founding The early hints of the Cold War revived historical suspicion of Roman Catholic loyalty to the United States. In 1949, Time printed a debate between a Jesuit priest and Professor Walter Bowie of New York's Union Theological Seminary. Bowie stated that there was \\"a clearly stated Roman Catholic purpose to make America Catholic\\" and to jeopardize \\"the religious and civil liberties which have been the glory of Protestant countries . . . .\\"Time, September 05, 1949 In response, a number of Roman Catholics began to find new ways of commending the Church and its ideal to the public, including the new medium of television. Perhaps the most notable of these men was Bishop Fulton Sheen. The most popular and influential television presentation, however, was The Christophers, a weekly half-hour program aired on ABC beginning in 1945. Keller avoided theology and philosophy, going \\"straight for the watcher's heart.\\"Page 171, Modern American Religion, Volume 3, by Martin E. Marty (University of Chicago Press, 1999), , . To espouse the aims of The Christophers, Keller wrote an article for the conservative American Ecclesiastical Review entitled \\"What About the Hundred Million?\\" In it, he addressed the needs of Americans (including those from Protestant or other non-Catholic backgrounds) who had no connection to organized religion. Mission and activities The motto of both the television show and The Christophers ‚Äì \\"It's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness\\". The saying is reflected in the television show's theme song, \\"One Little Candle\\". It also reflects the philosophical orientation of the organization, which emphasizes positive action to create a better world in such various arenas as political honesty, caring for the sick and poor, and dealing with substance abuse. Although the foundation and media presentations are overtly Roman Catholic, they are intended to be ecumenical in scope. The organization states that it is \\"rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition of service to God and humanity\\" and that \\"the Christophers embrace people of every nation, religion and age level.\\" The Christophers are based in New York City. Their newsletter, Christopher News Notes, is published 10 times a year. They have produced a weekly television show (Christopher Closeup) since 1952, often featuring interviews with celebrities. Interviewees have included Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Ken Burns, Daniel Rodr√≠guez, Andrew Weil, and Tim Russert. Other incarnations of the show have included dramatic features, with guest stars Don Ameche, James Cagney, and Ricardo Montalban, among others. The show was originally broadcast on ABC, but has since changed its name to Christopher Closeup and has been relegated to limited syndication by local cable channels. It also syndicates a weekly radio program of the same name. The Christopher Awards The Christopher Awards, made annually since 1949, salute media that \\"remind audiences and readers of their worth, individuality and power to positively impact and shape our world\\". Recipients receive a bronze medallion, in diameter, depicting a kneeling pilgrim, on whose back sits a radiant child. The awards have seven categories. Multiple awards are given each year in four categories: Books for Adults, Books for Young People, Feature Films, and Radio & Television. Three other categories generally have a single recipient: the Christopher Leadership Award, the Christopher Life Achievement Award, and the Special Christopher Award. The stated criteria are that nominees \\"exhibit exceptional artistic and technical proficiency, be able to impact the widest possible audience, and, above all, they must affirm the highest values of the human spirit.\\" Potential winners are nominated and reviewed throughout the year by panels of media professionals, members of The Christophers‚Äô staff with expertise in film, TV and publishing, and by specially supervised children‚Äôs reading groups. Awards are not limited to those with religious content, and adult content does not disqualify a work; \\"R-rated\\" movies, for example, are eligible for awards. Other activities The Christophers also offer The Christopher Leadership Course, a course in public speaking and leadership. This course is held in many locations in the US, Canada and other countries.

These arms were recorded at the heraldic visitation of Yorkshire in 1666. By the time that the borough was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, silver owls had been added both as crest above the shield, and as supporters on either side. These additions were not authorised, however, and in 1920 application was made by Leeds County Borough Council to the College of Arms to have these additions officially granted. In the following year the grant of crest and supporters was made, with the colouring of the owls altered to \\"proper\\", or natural colourings. Gold ducal coronets were added to the supporters for further heraldic difference.Letters patent dated November 7, 1921 In 1974, the county borough was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of a much larger Metropolitan District of Leeds.

Waugh in 1926Frank Albert Waugh (July 8, 1869 ‚Äì March 20, 1943) was an American landscape architect whose career focused upon recreational uses of national forests, the production of a highly natural style of landscape design, and the implementation of ecology as a basis for choices in landscape design. He essentially pioneered the role of the landscape architect as an integral part of national forest design and development through such projects as the Mount Hood Scenic Byway and the Bryce Canyon scenic roadway. His ideas spread via his diverse writings, including Recreation Uses in the National Forests and The Natural Style in Landscape Gardening. He also wrote prolifically about education, agriculture, and social issues in such works as The Agricultural College and Rural Improvement. Biography Frank A. Waugh was born in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, but his studies and career would take him far from his birthplace. Waugh earned his B.S. degree in 1891 from Kansas State Agricultural College and a subsequent M.S. from Oklahoma State Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1893. He worked in the newspaper business in Topeka, Kansas, Helena, Montana, and Denver, Colorado.\\"Today Is Anniversary Of Birthday of Sheboygan Falls Man Now a Famous Educator.\\" The Sheboygan Press 8 July 1929. In 1895, graduate studies in landscape architecture and horticulture would take him to Cornell University, Europe, and finally to the University of Vermont. He found his way to the Massachusetts Agricultural College, now the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he became the head of the agriculture division and founded an undergraduate landscape gardening program in 1903, only the second program of its kind in the United States. He was one of the first practitioners to formally recognize American landscape architecture history. His son, Frederick V. Waugh, became a notable agricultural economist and his granddaughter, Margaret Maxfield, became a notable mathematician. His other son, Albert E. Waugh, served as provost at the University of Connecticut from 1950 to 1965. Accomplishments Frank Waugh's Book of Landscape Gardening has become a classic in its field. Waugh begins each edition of his text with the sentence: ‚ÄúLandscape gardening is eminently a fine art.‚Äù He covers general principles of design and discusses three basic styles ‚Äì the natural, the architectural and the picturesque. The book was praised for achieving ‚Äúa balance between well- known period examples and solutions‚Äù which was achievable by all who attempted them. The photographs included in the book, taken by Waugh, are landscapes ‚Äì ranging from Europe and Japan to unique regions in the United States. In his text, Waugh also includes several plant lists of the regional foliage. Waugh was an avid writer of magazine articles and books with writings on technical horticulture (Systematic pomology, 1903), landscape architecture (Formal Design In Landscape Architecture, 1927), education (The Agricultural College, 1916), gardening (Everybody‚Äôs Garden, 1937), and society (Rural Improvement, 1914). In 1917, Waugh was hired by the U.S. Forest Service as a consultant for the recreational development of national forests. Over a five-month period, he visited forests across the country and evaluated their facilities, both private and public, including camp and picnic grounds, summer resorts, and other aspects of forest recreation. Most importantly, he compared the value of forest recreation to that of the urban realm, estimating that forest recreation was worth $7.5 million annually, roughly equal to the value of urban recreation. He published his findings in Recreation Uses in the National Forests, which was the first comprehensive study of national forest recreational use. Another major project that Waugh embarked upon was the design of the little town that bordered one of the natural wonders of the world and a vital U.S. national monument, the Grand Canyon of Arizona. The town consisted of 300 to 400 people and, at the time, a tourist population of about 200 annually. In the design, Waugh realized that the purpose of this town was to provide for the tourists who came to see this great wonder. He believed that yellow pines should be saved and that the pi√±on and cedar that were planted along streets should be removed. By creating a scattered canopy by taking away the formality in the trees, Waugh believed it would unify the natural and undomesticated surroundings with the overall presentation of the town. Influences Beechwood, co-designed by Waugh mentor Andrew Jackson Downing, was once an Astor family mansion and is now a historic house museum in Newport, Rhode Island. A circa-1920 garden in the Berlin-Wannsee area, designed by Willy Lange, who also influenced Waugh. Social movements of the time had a significant effect on the life and career of Frank Waugh. During the Civil War era, the concept of preserving natural monuments became prominent. This movement began with a grant from Congress on June 30, 1864, for the preservation of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees. Primarily chosen for their natural scenic qualities, these new national parks served as the first precedents for the early twentieth century trend in reserving scenic wild lands for public use, in which Frank Waugh was influential. In 1917, Waugh published The Natural Style in Landscape Gardening, which was based on the imitation of natural forms and the use of native vegetation in landscaping. His advocacy for this style can be traced back to Andrew Jackson Downing, who had heavily influenced Waugh. Downing held native plants in high regard and spoke of their potential to recreate the scenery of the wilderness, thus contributing to an appreciation of America's native plants. Another influence was Frederick Law Olmsted, a contemporary of Downing whose use of native species in mass plantings at Biltmore, the Vanderbilt estate near Asheville, North Carolina, in 1890 began a trend characterized by the use of native plants in preference to exotics among landscape designers. Downing's designs were also based on the principle of vistas. Waugh's scenic byway designs for Bryce Canyon and Mount Hood represent this principle. These byways feature ‚Äúparagraphic‚Äù vistas which appear sequentially at turns along the road, accompanied by turn-offs for stopping and taking in the view. Waugh's designs also incorporated the concept of ecology through the use of plantings characterized by natural association of plant species, in conjunction with environmental conditions. Having studied in Germany, Waugh was influenced by such Germans as Willy Lange, whom Waugh credited with the best explanation of ecological principles. Additionally, the curator and the planting foreman of the Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Garden, Dr. Adolf Engler and Dr. K. Peters, used mass plantings in response to soil and drainage. Waugh's designs were driven by these developments in vegetation use, which he believed were essential to the character of his natural style. It is no wonder that he developed a taste for native vegetation and natural scenery, considering that these elements coincided with the concept of a place's ecological scheme and overall spirit. Another conceptual requirement for Waugh's naturalistic style of gardening was the open lawn. He believed that they were the natural foundation for a natural landscape. With English influences such as the large estate garden at Stowe in England, the wide-open lawn reigned supreme, implying the values of naturalistic landscaping through little manipulation of planting arrangements and circulation patterns. The influence of the emphasis on the lawn can be seen throughout America, and although it may have lost most of the naturalistic symbolism behind it, the \\"great American lawn\\" continues to be popular today. Although Frank Waugh was known as a naturalistic designer, his book Formal Design in Landscape Architecture exemplifies his thorough knowledge and understanding of the formal style of garden design. He believed that there are settings which require the strict guidelines of formal garden design and that certain sites call for loose, naturalistic design concepts. Formal design, in the eyes of Waugh, requires all the parts of the garden to be symmetrically balanced. This is not to say that informal gardening is not balanced, but it lacks the formality of bilateral symmetry and radial symmetry that the formal garden design strictly abides by. Significance Ultimately, Waugh was a pioneer in landscape architecture, in that he recognized the role of landscape architects as integral in the development of national forests and parklands and their roads, trails, campgrounds, and picnic spots. This was especially influential in terms of the national forests, whose uses prior to 1917 were primarily characterized by timber production and livestock grazing. Along with his contemporary Henry Hubbard, Waugh fostered the creation of a landscape design style that was uniquely American. His writings of an ecological approach to design were unique as well and rather unprecedented in terms of American literature. Furthermore, his extensive study and publications of mass plantings laid a philosophical and practical foundation for naturalized landscape design, as might be expressed today through re-vegetation practices. Waugh retired from teaching in 1939, just four years before his death. In addition to his endeavors in national forest design, he also designed college campuses, including Kansas State University and Oklahoma State University. He also made detailed etchings of nature scenes and played the flute daily. He and his wife, Alice, had six children. Many of them achieved great successes, including such accomplishments as designing public sculptures in Washington D.C. and inventing the United States federal food stamp program. Although he was a man of small physical stature, being just over five feet tall, his charisma was widely felt and influenced his family, colleagues, and students alike. His achievements and influence were very much driven by his overall impression of place.

About the song As the baronial couple profess their love for one another, the Baron is simultaneously trying to kill his wife through a variety of barbaric means, yet his attempts always fail. Despite the obvious attempts on her life, the Baroness completely overlooks the fact that her husband wants her dead, even after he triggers an axe to fall on her head, a barbed spike to fall from the chandelier, and a trap door to open under her. The song is a humorous take on couples who maintain a fa√ßade of undying love, but have secretly grown to despise one another. Songwriters The song was written by Robert B. Sherman & Richard M. Sherman (also known as the \\"Sherman Brothers\\"). The instrumental version of this song is called the traditional Vulgarian dance which is accompanied by a brass band in the waltz's rhythm.

At different times it has been governed by Berber, Roman, Arab, Portuguese, Spanish, French, British, and Moroccan regimes. It has had an important position in the region as a port city, making it valuable to a series of conquerors during its early history. The original Berber name, Anfa (meaning: \\"hill\\" in English), was used by the locals until the earthquake of 1755 destroyed the city. When Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah rebuilt the city's medina, he gave it the name \\"ad-DƒÅr al-Bay·∏çƒÅ æ\\" () a literal translation of Casablanca into Arabic. French forces occupied the city in 1907 and adopted the Spanish name, Casablanca. The name Anfa now refers to an area within Casablanca, slightly West of the 18th century medina. Roman Anfa Leo Africanus defined Anfa as a city built by the Romans in his famous Descrittione dell‚ÄôAfrica (Description of Africa), written in the 16th century. The area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by the Berbers by about the 10th century BC.Casablanca - Jewish Virtual Library It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later by the Romans.LexicOrient Roman coin of Juba II similar to those found in a wreckage inside Roman Anfa port Romans occupied the area in 15 BC and created the important commercial port know later as AnfaRoman Casablanca, directly connected to the Mogador island in the Iles Purpuraires of southern Mauritania. From there they obtained a special dye, that colored the purple stripe in Imperial Roman Senatorial togas. The expedition of Juba II to discover the Canary islands and Madeira probably departed from Anfa. The Roman port, probably called initially Anfus in Latin language, was part of a Berber client state of Rome until Emperor Augustus. When Rome annexed Ptolemy of Mauretania's kingdom, Anfa was incorporated into the Roman Empire by Caligula. But this was done only nominally because the Roman limes was a few dozen kilometers north of the port (the Roman military fortifications of Mauretania Tingitana were just a few kilometers south of the Roman colonia named Sala Colonia). However, Roman Anfa--connected mainly by commerce and by socio-cultural ties to Volubilis (\\"autonomous\\" from Rome since 285 AD)--lasted until the 5th century, when Vandals conquered Roman northwestern Africa. A Roman wreck of the 2nd century, from which were salvaged 169 silver coins, shows that the Romans appreciated this useful port for commerce. There is even evidence of oil commerce with Roman Volubilis and Tingis in the 3rd century. Probably there was a small community of Christians (linked to Roman merchants) in the port city until the fifth/sixth century.  Barghawata  A large Berber tribe, the Barghawata, settled in the area between the rivers Bou Regreg to the north and Oum er-Rbia to the south.Roman Anfa It established itself as an independent Berber kingdom in Tamasna around in 744 AD following the Berber Revolt against the Umayyad Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik. It remained until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068 AD. The Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min drove the Barghawata out of Tamasna in 1149, and replaced them with Bedouin Arab tribes, notably Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym.S.

Early modern period Animation modeling the tsunamis caused by the earthquake of 1755, which destroyed the settlement at Anfa During the 14th century, under the Zenata Merinid Dynasty, the town rose in importance as a port and in the early 15th century, became independent once again. It emerged as a safe harbor for Barbary pirates. In 1468, the city was captured and destroyed by the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves under Rei Afonso V the African. The Portuguese used the ruins to build a military fortress in 1515. The village that grew up around it was called \\"Casa Branca\\", meaning \\"White House\\" in Portuguese. After the death of Rei Sebastian in the massive Portuguese defeat at the hands of the Moroccan Saadi Empire in the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir and the ensuing crisis of succession, Casablanca came under Spanish occupation under the Iberian Union, from 1580 to 1640. They eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 AD following an earthquake which destroyed it. Artifacts in the Jewish Museum of Casablanca. The town and the medina of Casablanca as it is today was founded in 1770 AD by Sultan Muhammad III ben Abdallah (1756‚Äì1790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail. Built with the aid of Spaniards, the town was called Casa Blanca (white house in Spanish) translated Dar el Beida in Arabic.  19th century  bombed the city, prepared by the French doctor and published in the 10 August 1907 issue of L'Illustration. The first German consulate in Morocco was in Casablanca. In the 19th century Casablanca became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing Morocco's now famous national drink, gunpowder tea). By the 1860s, there were around 5,000 residents, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s.Pennel, CR: Morocco from Empire to Independence, Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 121 Casablanca grew due to the prot√©g√© system, through which Moroccans protected by European powers became independent of the Makhzen. Casablanca was also one of the main Atlantic ports to receive Jewish migrants from the Moroccan hinterlands following the mission of Moses Montefiore to Morocco in 1864. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in the town, at first administrators within a sovereign sultanate, in 1906. By 1921, this was to rise to 110,000, largely through the development of bidonvilles. > \\"Whereas Casablanca appears somewhat forbidding and hostile from the sea, it > could not present a more welcoming picture to those traveling from inland. > Its leafy gardens are topped by willowy palm trees, crenelated walls, flat > roofs, and whitewashed minarets dazzling in the African sun; all this offers > a striking backdrop against the deep blue of the natural haven that cradles > svelte yachts and burly black and red steamboats.\\" \\\\- French rule = French Invasion = Sidi Belyut Mausoleum.

Gloire shelling the city with artillery fire during the bombardment of Casablanca August 1907. Following the Treaty of Algeciras in 1906, which granted the French holding company La Compagnie Marocaine rights to build modern ports in Casablanca and in Asfi, construction at the port of Casablanca began on May 2, 1907. A narrow gauge railway extending from the port to a quarry in Roches Noires for stones to build the breakwater, passed over the Sidi Belyout necropolis, an area held sacred by the Moroccans. In addition, the French had started to control the customs. On July 28, a delegation representing the tribes of the Chaouia, led by Hajj Hamou of the Ouled Hariz tribe, pressed Abu Bakr Bin Buzaid (ÿ®Ÿàÿ®ŸÉÿ± ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ®Ÿàÿ≤ŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸàŸä), qaid of Casablanca and representative of Sultan Abdelaziz and the Makhzen in the city, with 3 demands: the removal of the French officers from the customs house, an immediate halt on the construction of the port, and the destruction of the railroad. The pasha equivocated and postponed his decision to mid-day on July 30, by which time regional tribesmen had populated the city and started an insurrection. A group waited for the train to make its way out to Roches Noires to pick up rocks from the quarry, then piled rocks onto the tracks behind it to isolate it. When the train returned, it was ambushed and the French, Spanish, and Italian workers aboard were killed and the train destroyed.

From August 5‚Äì7, a fleet of French armored cruisers bombarded Casablanca and French troops were landed, marking the beginning of the invasion of Morocco. The French then took control of Casablanca and the Chaouia. This effectively began the process of colonization, although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the signature of the Treaty of Fez March 30, 1912. = Commercial explosion = The city overflowed outside of its walls; a West African quarter and a mass of sordid adobe constructions. were built around Bab Marrakesh.

In 1913, Lyautey invited Henri Prost to handle the urban planning of Moroccan cities, and his work in Casablanca was lauded for applying principles of urbanization.Cohen, Jean-Louis. Henri Prost and Casablanca: the art of making successful cities (1912-1940). The New City, (fall 1996), ‚Ññ 3, p. 106-121. The ville europ√©enne or \\"European city\\" fanned out Eastward around Casablanca's medina, or‚Äîas the French called it‚Äîla ville indig√®ne. The area just outside the eastern walls of the medina, which had previously been used as a market space, Assouq Elkbiir (ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸàŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ®Ÿäÿ±) the \\"big market\\", was transformed into Place de France, now known as United Nations Square. Dominated by the clock tower built in 1908, it demarked a contact point between the Moroccan medina and the European nouvelle ville. In 1915, the French authorities held the Exposition Franco-Marocaine, a display of French soft power after the bombardment of the city in 1907 and during the ongoing pacification or wars of occupation‚Äînotably the Zaian War‚Äîand an opportunity to inventory Morocco's resources and crafts. In 1930, Casablanca hosted a round of the Formula One world championship. The race was held at the new Anfa Racecourse. In 1958, the race was held at Ain-Diab circuit - (see Moroccan Grand Prix). In 1983, Casablanca hosted the Mediterranean Games. An equestrian statue of Hubert Lyautey Antoine Marchisio and Fran√ßois Cogn√©, installed at Place Lyautey in 1938. Under Lyautey's tenure, Casablanca transformed into Morocco's economic center and Africa's biggest port. Casablanca's street plan is based on that of a French architect named Henri Prost, who placed the center of the city where the main market of Anfa had been. From this point all main streets radiate to the east and to the south. A 1937-1938 typhoid fever outbreak was exploited by colonial authorities to justify the appropriation of urban spaces in Casablanca. Bidonvilles were cleated out of the center and their residents displaced. The famous 1942 film Casablanca underlined the city's colonial status at the time‚Äîdepicting it as the scene of a power struggle between competing European powers, carried out without any reference to the local population, and with the film's vast cosmopolitan cast of characters (American, French, German, Czech and some other nationalities) including not a single Arab. =World War II= Casablanca was an important strategic port during World War II. In November 1942, the British and Americans organised a 3-pronged attack on North Africa (Operation Torch), of which the westernmost one was at Casablanca. The Task Force landed before daybreak on 8 November 1942, at three points in Morocco: Asfi (Operation Blackstone), Fedala (Operation Brushwood, the largest landing with 19,000 men), and Mehdiya-Port Lyautey (Operation Goalpost). Because it was hoped that the French would not resist, there were no preliminary bombardments. This proved to be a costly error as French defenses took a toll of American landing forces. On the night of 7 November, pro-Allied General Antoine B√©thouart attempted a coup d'etat against the French command in Morocco, so that he could surrender to the Allies the next day. His forces surrounded the villa of General Charles Nogu√®s, the Vichy-loyal high commissioner. However, Nogu√®s telephoned loyal forces, who stopped the coup. In addition, the coup attempt alerted Nogu√®s to the impending Allied invasion, and he immediately bolstered French coastal defenses.

At Safi, the objective being capturing the port facilities to land the Western Task Force's medium tanks, the landings were mostly successful. The landings were begun without covering fire, in the hope that the French would not resist at all. However, once French coastal batteries opened fire, Allied warships returned fire. By the time General Ernest Harmon's 2nd Armored Division arrived, French snipers had pinned the assault troops (most of whom were in combat for the first time) on Safi's beaches. Most of the landings occurred behind schedule. Carrier aircraft destroyed a French truck convoy bringing reinforcements to the beach defenses. Safi surrendered on the afternoon of 8 November. By 10 November, the remaining defenders were pinned down, and the bulk of Harmon's forces raced to join the siege of Casablanca. At Port-Lyautey, the landing troops were uncertain of their position, and the second wave was delayed. This gave the French defenders time to organize resistance, and the remaining landings were conducted under artillery bombardment. With the assistance of air support from the carriers, the troops pushed ahead, and the objectives were captured. At Fedala, weather disrupted the landings. The landing beaches again came under French fire after daybreak. Patton landed at 08:00, and the beachheads were secured later in the day. The Americans surrounded the port of Casablanca by 10 November, and the city surrendered an hour before the final assault was due to take place. Casablanca hosted the Casablanca Conference -called even \\"Anfa Conference\\"- in 1943 (from January 14 to January 24), in which Churchill and Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Casablanca was the site of a large American air base, which was the staging area for all American aircraft for the European Theater of Operations during World War II.  Post-war period  In April 1953, film Salut Casa!‚Äîa \\"pseudo-documentary\\" propaganda piece intended for French audiences‚Äîplayed at the Cannes Film Festival. The film shows the colonial machine carrying out its mission civilizatrice at full steam. The French government described Casablanca as a \\"laboratory of urbanism,\\" and the French urbanist Michel √âcochard‚Äîdirector of the Service de l‚ÄôUrbanisme, Casablanca's urban planning office at the time‚Äîfeatured prominently in the film, discussing how challenges such as internal migration and rapid urbanization were being handled in Casablanca. In July of the same year, Morocco and its Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA) had its own section at the Congr√®s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne or CIAM. The architects from Morocco presented an intense study of daily life in Casablanca's bidonvilles. To consider the ad-hoc huts built by penniless immigrants from rural parts of the country worthy of study‚Äîlet alone to hold them as examples for modernist architects to learn from‚Äîwas radical and revolutionary, and caused a schism among modernists. Young architects of the controversial Team X, such as Shadrach Woods, Alexis Josic, and Georges Candilis were active in Casablanca designing cit√©s, modular public housing units, that took vernacular life into account. Elie Azagury, the first Moroccan modernist architect, led GAMMA after independence in 1956.  Toward Independence  The Maghrebi labor unionist Farhat Hached's assassination at the hands of French foreign intelligence sparked violent protests in Casablanca December 1952. During the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major center of anti-colonial struggle. In 1947, when the Sultan went to the Tangier International Zone to deliver a speech requesting independence from colonial powers, the first stage of the Revolution of the King and the People, French colonial forces instigated a conflict between Senegalese Tirailleurs serving the French colonial empire and Moroccan locals in a failed attempt to sabotage the Sultan's journey to Tangier. This massacre, remembered in Casablanca as Darbat Salighan (), lasted for about 24 hours from April 7‚Äì8, 1947, as the tirailleurs fired randomly into residential buildings in working-class neighborhoods, killing between 180 and 1000 Moroccan civilians. The Sultan returned to Casablanca to comfort the families of the victims, then proceeded to Tangier to deliver the historic speech. Riots overrun Casablanca due to discontent with French rule. Universal Newsreel, 21 July 1955 The assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by La Main Rouge‚Äîthe clandestine militant wing of French intelligence‚Äîsparked protests in cities around the world and riots in Casablanca from December 7‚Äì8, 1952. The Union G√©n√©rale des Syndicats Conf√©d√©r√©s du Maroc (UGSCM) and the Istiqlal Party organized a general strike in the Carri√®res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi on December 7. On December 24, 1953, in response to violence and abuses from French colonists culminating in the forced exile of Sultan Mohammed V on Eid al-Adha, Mohammed Zerktouni orchestrated the bombing of the Central Market, killing 16 people. Since independence Morocco regained independence from France on 2 March 1956. = Casablanca Group = January 4‚Äì7, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. King Muhammad V received attendance were Gamal Abd An-Nasser of the United Arab Republic, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Modibo Ke√Øta of Mali, and Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© of Guinea, as well as Ferhat Abbas, president of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. Notably absent was Patrice Lumumba of the Republic of the Congo, who had been in prison since September 1960. This conference gave birth to the pan-Africanist Casablanca Group or the \\"Casablanca Bloc\\" and ultimately to the African Union. = Jewish emigration = Casablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.Fr√©d√©ric Ab√©cassis.

Archived.\\"Il y avait au moins quinze mille lyc√©ens. Je n'avais jamais vu un rassemblement d'adolescents aussi impressionnant\\" as quoted in Brousky, 2005.Parker & Boum, Historical Dictionary of Morocco (2006), p. 213. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but were violently dispersed. The following day, students returned to Lyc√©e Mohammed V along with workers, the unemployed, and the poor, this time vandalizing stores, burning buses and cars, throwing stones, and chanting slogans against King Hassan II, who since assuming the throne in 1961, had consolidated political power within monarchy and gone to war with the newly independent, newly socialist Algeria.Miller, A History of Modern Morocco (2013), pp. 162‚Äì166. The National Union of the Students of Morocco‚Äîa nationalist, anti-colonial student group affiliated with Mehdi Ben Barka's party, the National Union of Popular Forces‚Äîovertly opposed and criticized Hassan II.Miller, A History of Modern Morocco (2013), pp. 162‚Äì168‚Äì169.Parker & Boum, Historical Dictionary of Morocco (2006), p. 344. The riots were repressed with tanks deployed for two days, and General Mohamed Oufkir fired on the crowd from a helicopter.Rollinde, Le Mouvement marocain des droits de l'Homme (2003), p. 123. ‚ÄúLa r√©pression est instantan√©e, l'arm√©e apporte son renfort √† la police et le g√©n√©ral Oukfir n'h√©site pas a mitrailler la foule depuis un h√©licoptre.

The king blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: \\"Allow me to tell you that there is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.‚Äù‚ÄùPermettez-moi de vous dire qu'il n'y a pas de danger aussi grave pour l'Etat que celui d'un pr√©tendu intellectuel. Il aurait mieux valu que vous soyez tous illettr√©s.‚Äù Quoted in Rollinde, Le Mouvement marocain des droits de l'Homme (2003), p. 123.Susan Ossman, Picturing Casablanca: Portraits of Power in a Modern City; University of California Press, 1994; p. 37. = 1965 Arab League Summit = Egyptian President Gamal Abd An-Nasser addressing the 1965 Arab League Summit in Casablanca.A secret Arab League summit was held in Casablanca September 1965. Shlomo Gazit of Israeli intelligence said that Hassan II invited Mossad and Shin Bet agents to bug the Casablanca hotel where the conference would be held to record the conversations of the Arab leaders. This information was instrumental in the heavy military defeats of Egypt, Jordan and Syria to the Israelis in the Six-Day War. Prior to the war, King Hassan II had developed a reciprocal relationship with the Israeli intelligence, who had assisted him in carrying out an operation in France to abduct and 'disappear' Mehdi Ben Barka, a leftist Moroccan leader who had been based in Paris. = Years of Lead = During the \\"Years of Lead,\\" Derb Moulay Cherif Prison in Hay Muhammadi was used as a secret prison for the interrogation and torture of dissidents of Hassan II. Among others, the Jewish Moroccan activist Abraham Serfaty of the radical Moroccan leftist group Ila al-Amam was tortured there. The poet and activist Saida Menebhi died there on December 11, 1977 after a 34-day hunger strike. The music of Nass El Ghiwane represents some of the art that was created in opposition to the oppressive regime.  1981 riots  On May 29, 1981, riots broke out in Casablanca. At a time when Morocco was strained from six years in the Western Sahara War, a general strike was organized in response to increases in the cost of basic foods. Thousands of young people from the bidonvilles surrounding Casablanca formed mobs and stoned symbols of wealth in the city, including buses, banks, pharmacies, grocery stores, and expensive cars. Police and military units fired into the crowds. The official death toll according to the government was 66, while the opposition reported it was 637, most of whom were youths from the slums shot to death. This intifada was the first of two IMF riots in Morocco‚Äîdubbed the \\"Hunger Revolts\\" by the international press‚Äîthe second of which took place in 1984 primarily in northern cities such as Nador, Husseima, Tetuan, and al-Qasr al-Kebir. = Globalization and modernization = The first McDonald's franchise on the African continent and in the Arab world opened on Ain Diab in 1992. The city is now developing a tourism industry. Casablanca has become the economic and business capital of Morocco, while Rabat is the political capital. In March 2000, women's groups organised demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new Mudawana, or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists. On May 16, 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. A string of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. A suspected militant blew himself up at a Casablanca internet cafe on March 11, 2007. On April 10, three suicide bombers blew themselves up during a police raid of their safe house.Terror Cell: 'Police Hold Fifth Man' April 12, 2007 Two days later, police set up barricades around the city and detained two more men who had escaped the raid.Casablanca on alert after suicide bombings April 12, 2007 On April 14, two brothers blew themselves up in downtown Casablanca, one near the American Consulate, and one a few blocks away near the American Language Center. Only one person was injured aside from the bombers, but the Consulate was closed for more than a month.U.S. Shuts Morocco Consulate After Bomb April 15, 2007 tram on line ÿ∑1 passes in front of the recently renovated Casa Voyageurs train station in 2018.

It uses an onboard system to control the vertical movement of the vehicle's wheels relative to the chassis or vehicle body rather than the passive suspension provided by large springs where the movement is determined entirely by the road surface. So-called active suspensions are divided into two classes: real active suspensions, and adaptive or semi-active suspensions. While adaptive suspensions only vary shock absorber firmness to match changing road or dynamic conditions, active suspensions use some type of actuator to raise and lower the chassis independently at each wheel. These technologies allow car manufacturers to achieve a greater degree of ride quality and car handling by keeping the tires perpendicular to the road in corners, allowing better traction and control. An onboard computer detects body movement from sensors throughout the vehicle and, using that data, controls the action of the active and semi-active suspensions. The system virtually eliminates body roll and pitch variation in many driving situations including cornering, accelerating, and braking.  Principle  50px 50px 50px Skyhook theory is that the ideal suspension would let the vehicle maintain a stable posture as if suspended by an imaginary hook in the sky, unaffected by road conditions. Since an actual skyhook is impractical, real active suspension systems are based on actuator operations. The imaginary line (of zero vertical acceleration) is calculated based on the value provided by an acceleration sensor installed on the body of the vehicle (see Figure 3). The dynamic elements comprise only the linear spring and the linear damper; therefore, no complicated calculations are necessary. A vehicle contacts the ground through the spring and damper in a normal spring damper suspension, as in Figure 1. To achieve the same level of stability as the Skyhook theory, the vehicle must contact the ground through the spring, and the imaginary line with the damper, as in Figure 2. Theoretically, in a case where the coefficient of the damper reaches an infinite value, the vehicle will be in a state where it is completely fixed to the imaginary line, thus the vehicle will not shake.  Active  Active suspensions, the first to be introduced, use separate actuators which can exert an independent force on the suspension to improve the riding characteristics. The drawbacks of this design are high cost, added complication and mass of the apparatus, and the need for frequent maintenance on some implementations. Maintenance can require specialised tools, and some problems can be difficult to diagnose. = Hydraulic actuation = Hydraulically actuated suspensions are controlled with the use of hydraulics. The first example appeared in 1954, with the Hydropneumatic suspension developed by Paul Mag√®s at Citro√´n. The hydraulic pressure is supplied by a high pressure radial piston hydraulic pump. Sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle ride level, constantly supplying the hydraulic height correctors with new data. In a matter of a few seconds, the suspension generates counter forces to raise or lower the body. During driving maneuvers, the encased nitrogen compresses instantly, offering six times the compressibility of the steel springs used by vehicles up to this time. In practice, the system has always incorporated the desirable self-levelling suspension and height adjustable suspension features, with the latter now tied to vehicle speed for improved aerodynamic performance, as the vehicle lowers itself at high speed. This system performed remarkably well in straight ahead driving, including over uneven surfaces, but had little control over roll stiffness. Millions of production vehicles have been built with variations on this system. = Electronic actuation of hydraulic suspension= Colin Chapman developed the original concept of computer management of hydraulic suspension in the 1980s to improve cornering in racing cars. Lotus fitted and developed a prototype system to a 1985 Excel with electro-hydraulic active suspension, but never offered it for sale to the public, although many demonstration cars were built for other manufacturers. Sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle ride level, constantly supplying the computer with new data. As the computer receives and processes data, it operates the hydraulic servos, mounted beside each wheel. Almost instantly, the servo-regulated suspension generates counter forces to body lean, dive, and squat during driving maneuvers. Williams Grand Prix Engineering prepared an active suspension for F1 cars in 1992, creating such successful cars that the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile decided to ban the technology. Computer Active Technology Suspension (CATS) co-ordinates the best possible balance between ride quality and handling by analysing road conditions and making up to 3,000 adjustments every second to the suspension settings via electronically controlled dampers. The 1999 Mercedes-Benz CL-Class (C215) introduced Active Body Control, where high pressure hydraulic servos are controlled by electronic computing, and this feature is still available. Vehicles can be designed to actively lean into curves to improve occupant comfort. = Active anti-roll bar= Active anti-roll bar stiffens under command of the driver or suspension Electronic control unit (ECU) during hard cornering. First production car was Mitsubishi Mirage Cyborg in 1988. = Electromagnetic recuperative = In fully active electronically controlled production cars, the application of electric servos and motors married to electronic computing allows for flat cornering and instant reactions to road conditions. The Bose Corporation has a proof of concept model. The founder of Bose, Amar Bose, had been working on exotic suspensions for many years while he was an MIT professor. Electromagnetic active suspension uses linear electromagnetic motors attached to each wheel. It provides extremely fast response, and allows regeneration of power consumed, by using the motors as generators. This nearly surmounts the issues of slow response times and high power consumption of hydraulic systems. Electronically controlled active suspension system (ECASS) technology was patented by the University of Texas Center for Electromechanics in the 1990s and has been developed by L-3 Electronic Systems for use on military vehicles. The ECASS-equipped HMMWV exceeded the performance specifications for all performance evaluations in terms of absorbed power to the vehicle operator, stability and handling. =Active Wheel= *Michelin's Active Wheel from 2004 incorporates an in-wheel electrical suspension motor that controls torque distribution, traction, turning maneuvers, pitch, roll and suspension damping for that wheel, in addition to an in-wheel electric traction motor. *Audi active electromechanical suspension system introduced in 2017. It drives each wheel individually and adapts to the prevailing road conditions. Each wheel has an electric motor which is powered by the 48-volt main electrical system. Additional components include gears, a rotary tube together with internal titanium torsion bar and a lever which exerts up to 1,100 Nm (811.3 lb-ft) on the suspension via a coupling rod. Thanks to the front camera, the sedan detects bumps in the road early on and predictively adjusts the active suspension. Even before the car reaches a bump in the road, the preview function developed by Audi transmits the right amount of travel to the actuators and actively controls the suspension. The computer-controlled motors can sense imperfection on the road, and can raise the suspension up from the wheel which would go over the undulation, thus aiding the ride quality. The system will direct the motors on the outside to push up or pull down the suspension while cornering. This will result in a flatter drive and reduced body-roll around corners which in turn means more confident handling dynamics.  Adaptive and Semi-Active  Adaptive or semi-active systems can only change the viscous damping coefficient of the shock absorber, and do not add energy to the suspension system. While adaptative suspensions have generally a slow time response and a limited number of damping coefficient values, semi-active suspensions have time response close to a few milliseconds and can provide a wide range of damping values. Therefore, adaptative suspensions usually only propose different riding modes (comfort, normal, sport...) corresponding to different damping coefficients, while semi-active suspensions modify the damping in real time, depending on the road conditions and the dynamics of the car. Though limited in their intervention (for example, the control force can never have different direction than the current vector of velocity of the suspension), semi-active suspensions are less expensive to design and consume far less energy. In recent times, research in semi-active suspensions has continued to advance with respect to their capabilities, narrowing the gap between semi-active and fully active suspension systems. = Solenoid/valve actuated = This type is the most economic and basic type of semi-active suspensions. They consist of a solenoid valve which alters the flow of the hydraulic medium inside the shock absorber, therefore changing the damping characteristics of the suspension setup. The solenoids are wired to the controlling computer, which sends them commands depending on the control algorithm (usually the so-called \\"Sky-Hook\\" technique). This type of system is used in Cadillac's Computer Command Ride (CCR) suspension system. The first production car was the Toyota Soarer with semi-active Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension, from 1983. = Magnetorheological damper = Another fairly recent method incorporates magnetorheological dampers with a brand name MagneRide. It was initially developed by Delphi Corporation for GM and was standard, as many other new technologies, for Cadillac STS (from model 2002), and on some other GM models from 2003. This was an upgrade for semi-active systems (\\"automatic road- sensing suspensions\\") used in upscale GM vehicles for decades. It allows, together with faster modern computers, changing the stiffness of all wheel suspensions independently. These dampers are finding increased usage in the US and already leases to some foreign brands, mostly in more expensive vehicles. This system was in development for 25 years. The damper fluid contains metallic particles. Through the onboard computer, the dampers' compliance characteristics are controlled by an electromagnet. Essentially, increasing the current flow into the damper magnetic circuit increases the circuit magnetic flux. This in turn causes the metal particles to change their alignment, which increases fluid viscosity thereby raising the compression/rebound rates, while a decrease softens the effect of the dampers by aligning the particles in the opposite direction. If we imagine the metal particles as dinner plates then whilst aligned so they are on edge - viscosity is minimised. At the other end of the spectrum they will be aligned at 90 degrees so flat. Thus making the fluid much more viscous. It is the electric field produced by the electromagnet that changes the alignment of the metal particles. Information from wheel sensors (about suspension extension), steering, acceleration sensors - and other data, is used to calculate the optimal stiffness at that point in time. The fast reaction of the system (milliseconds) allows, for instance, making a softer passing by a single wheel over a bump in the road at a particular instant in time.

Performed at Whitehall Palace on 2 February 1609, it marks a notable development in the masque form, in that Jonson defines and elaborates the anti-masque for the first time in its pages. Masque development In his preceding masques, Jonson had been experimenting with elements of sharper opposition and variety: The Masque of Blackness (1605) and The Masque of Beauty (1608), both written for and featuring Queen Anne, form a contrasting and complementary pairing; Hymenaei (1606) contained two contrasting sets of masquers; and The Hue and Cry After Cupid (1608) featured twelve boy torchbearers \\"in antic attire.\\" In the case of The Masque of Queens, Jonson writes that Queen Anne \\"had commanded me to think on some dance or show that might precede hers and have the place of a foil or false masque....\\" Jonson responded with a dance for a dozen female figures \\"in the habit of hags or witches...the opposites to good Fame...,\\" to supply \\"a spectacle of strangeness....\\" The show A mistress witch and her eleven disciples all dance, then each witch testifies her crimes and outrages to her mistress, before they fall once again into \\"a magical dance, full of preposterous change and gesticulation.\\" Their antics are interrupted and dispelled by the intrusion of the masque proper: the House of Fame is displayed, with twelve virtuous Queens, their apotheosis being \\"Bel-Anna.\\" In addition to Anne, the roles of the Queens were filled by eleven ladies of the court:http://www.hollowaypages.com/jonson1692fame.htm * Countess of Arundel, Althea Howard (n√©e Talbot) * Countess of Bedford, Lucy Russell (n√©e Harington) * Countess of Derby, Elizabeth Stanley (n√©e de Vere) * Countess of Essex, Frances Howard (later Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset) * Countess of Huntingdon, Elizabeth Hastings (n√©e Stanley) * Countess of Montgomery, Susan Herbert (n√©e de Vere) * Vicountess of Cranbourne, Catherine Cecil (n√©e Howard) (daughter of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk) * Lady Anne Clifford * Lady Elizabeth Guilford (n√©e Somerset, daughter of Elizabeth Somerset, Countess of Worcester) * Lady Anne Winter (n√©e Somerset, daughter of Elizabeth Somerset, Countess of Worcester) * Lady Windsore (Katherine, n√©e Somerset, daughter of Elizabeth Somerset, Countess of Worcester; married Thomas Windsor, 6th Baron Windsor) In this and the masques that followed at Court, the characters in the masque proper were generally \\"personated\\" by members of the Court; but the undignified anti-masque roles were filled by professional actors from the organized companies. Significance Jonson's use of witches in the anti- masque is an interesting commentary on the witch craze of the era. More generally, the invention of the anti-masque shaped the art form of the masque for the remainder of its life. Some modern critics, approaching the masque from a more skeptical if not jaundiced perspective than that of its creators and participants, see the anti-masque as a subversion of the surface intent of the performance. (\\"But this antimasque quite eclipses its masque. The queens are mere wax-works after the witches\\" -- the verdict of The Cambridge History of English and American Literature.) In the end, the disorderly and disruptive forces of the anti-masque are always driven off by a re-established order (which is always \\"the established order\\"); but that order is presented in a hyper-idealized style that contrasts sharply with the flawed and limited humans who are enacting the parts (and the courtiers and other dependants in the audience know those flaws and limits all too well). In this interpretation, the anti-masque undermines the intention of the performance, giving it an effect opposite to the one intended. In the anti-masque, the Stuarts are, perhaps, unwittingly subverting their authority. Texts The Masque of Queens was published soon after its performance, by the command of Crown Prince Henry, with a dedication to the Crown Prince. The work was entered into the Stationers' Register on February 22, 1609, and the edition that followed was printed by Nicholas Okes for the booksellers Richard Bonian and Henry Walley. After its initial quarto printing in 1609, The Masque of Queens was one of the fourteen masques included by Jonson in the 1616 folio collection of his Works. The work also exists in a manuscript in Jonson's hand, now Royal MS. 18 in the collection of the British Library. References * Chambers, E. K.

As we would alternate in reading and working, this became the first part of the name: NamNam. The 'Bulu' has a totally different background. As we would use to go for a beer every now and then, we picked the BULU from an engraving that you could find on Swiss beer glasses from 'Cardinal' beer, just saying 3dl / BULU. What BULU means exactly, we have no clue, but we added it to the band name. There you go: NamNamBulu. Well.... NNB never got far back then. Stefan made some instrumental pieces, that I might still find on a MD (Minidisk) somewhere. But it wasn't until I met Vasi, that we picked up the name again - even though it might sound a bit funny still :).

From the 1950s, when El Paso‚Äôs per capita income levels were 20 percent higher than the Texas average, El Paso's per capita income level began a steep decline. By 2000, levels had fallen to 30 percent below the state average. Unite El Paso successfully identified major new initiatives to reverse this decline and create a consensus vision for a new, more prosperous El Paso. To launch that vision as one of several initiatives, the group defined a goal of a new four-year medical school as the anchor of a Medical Center of the Americas. =Court of Inquiry= In 1994, Shapleigh, at the request of Judge Edward Marquez of the 65th District Court, was sworn in as an ad litem for the El Paso Court of Inquiry. Several prominent El Paso lawyers joined Judge Marquez to investigate whether the constitutional rights of the citizens of El Paso had been denied due to historically inadequate funding in the areas of transportation, mental health, and nutrition. Judge Marquez later issued an historic and groundbreaking report that identified significant disparities in funding that affected border economic and educational outcomes. Among the several findings in the report, some later became important statewide issues, including state highway funding. In 1999, then Texas Comptroller John Sharp issued a report outlining the various inequities faced by Texas border communities when compared to the rest of the state. Texas Senate career =Legislative record= In June 2009, Shapleigh completed his seventh session as a legislator. During his tenure as a state Senator, he has authored more than 600 bills, with particular focus on education, economic development, infrastructure, technology, veteran, and health care issues. Additionally, he has been integral in helping prepare the state for the Department of Defense's periodic reassessment of infrastructure needs, or base realignment and closure (BRAC). Shapleigh was appointed Chair of the Subcommittee on Base Realignment and Closure in 2004 and continues to lead that subcommittee. He also serves as Vice Chair of the Veteran Affairs & Military Installations Committee. Additionally, Shapleigh is a member of the Health & Human Services, Nominations, and Transportation & Homeland Security Committees. Some of the key pieces of legislation filed and passed by Shapleigh include: *Senate Bill 1368 (81st Texas Legislature). In 2009, Shapleigh passed legislation that created the El Paso County Ethics Commission, the first of its kind in Texas. S.B. 1368 will allow the county to establish an independent ethics commission that will adopt, publish and enforce an ethics code governing county public servants. *Senate Bill 962 (80th Texas Legislature). In 2007, Shapleigh passed legislation that helps El Paso secure state funding to build the fourteen new schools that troops and families moving into the community as a result of base realignment and closure. *Senate Bill 1479 (79th Texas Legislature). In 2005, Shapleigh passed the Texas Soldier's Payday Protection Act to prevent predatory lending abuses on Texas soldiers. S.B. 1479 barred lenders from taking certain actions against military personnel, including barring collection activities during deployment and requiring lenders to make disclosures to military customers regarding these restrictions. *Senate Bill 652 (78th Texas Legislature). In 2003, Shapleigh spearheaded the state's preparation for the 2005 BRAC round by authoring the omnibus Texas Military Preparedness Act. *Senate Bill 749 (77th Texas Legislature). In 2001, Shapleigh passed S.B. 749, which allowed the state agency responsible for environmental regulation to have the ability to work closely with Mexican counterparts on projects of mutual concern. *Senate Bill 974 (76th Texas Legislature). In 1999, Shapleigh authored the legislation that launched Texas Online, one of the best state online government website in the U.S. *Senate Bill 758 (75th Texas Legislature). In 1997, Shapleigh's passed legislation that increased criminal penalties for graffiti offenders, created a graffiti eradication fund, and required businesses to restrict access to aerosol paint. Additional information regarding Shapleigh's sessions in review may be found on his website. =El Paso Economic Summit= As a result of the Unite El Paso movement, Shapleigh organized the 1998 El Paso Economic Summit, along with civic leaders such as Woody Hunt, UTEP President Diana Natalicio, and Mayor Carlos Ramirez. Hundreds assembled at UTEP to describe a communitywide effort to build capacity for higher wage jobs in El Paso. At that gathering, the number one goal for El Paso's future was identified as establishing a four-year medical school as the anchor of a joint institution Medical Center of the Americas. Soon thereafter, Shapleigh, County Attorney Jos√© Rodriguez, Woody Hunt, Robert Brown, John Montford, and others joined in discussions about how best to establish the medical school and which institution should carry the mission forward. As a result, the Texas Tech University System Board of Regents made establishing a four-year medical school in El Paso an important goal of the System. Over the coming legislative sessions, incremental progress was made in establishing the state's ninth medical school and first since 1977. In 2009, the first new medical students at El Paso's medical school began their studies at the campus. The El Paso Medical School was the first new medical school to be established in the U.S. in 30 years. The school also is the only four-year medical school on the United States/Mexico border. =Community Scholars= Shapleigh co-founded Community Scholars, Inc., El Paso's youth leadership program. With a vision of developing the regional community leaders of tomorrow, Community Scholars is a youth leadership development internship program that provides public policy research opportunities for high school sophomores, juniors, and college students. The summer program began in 1998 and operates under Community Scholars, Inc., a grass roots nonprofit corporation. =Texas Eleven= Shapleigh was one of the Texas Eleven, a group of Democratic Texas State Senators who broke quorum and removed to New Mexico for 46 days in 2003 in a quorum-busting effort aimed at preventing the passage of controversial re- redistricting legislation, spearheaded by then Congressional House Majority leader Tom DeLay, that would have benefited Texas Republicans. Eventually the Texas Eleven was vindicated by the United States Supreme Court through its rulings that the re-districting could be considered gerrymandering and did bear unconstitutional elements. =ASARCO= Shapleigh led the opposition to the reopening of an ASARCO-operated copper smelter located near downtown El Paso since 1887. The smelter, which had been shut down in 1999 due to low copper prices, filed to renew their air permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2002. Joined by leaders from across the three-state, two-nation region, Shapleigh and hundreds of activists from El Paso, Juarez, and New Mexico placed enormous pressure on the corporation to justify putting over 7,000 tons of new pollutants into El Paso's air. After eight years, the TCEQ Commissioners granted the permit on a 3-0 vote. The Environmental Protection Agency soon intervened, however, citing deficiencies with the permitting process and ASARCO's air control equipment. As a result, ASARCO announced that the El Paso smelter would not reopen. As of July 2009, it appears the smelter property will be placed in an environmental remediation trust so that it may be cleaned up using funding obtained via ASARCO's bankruptcy. =Border Legislative Conference= From 2007 to 2008, Shapleigh served as the chair of the Border Legislative Conference (BLC), a program administered by the Council of State Governments (CSG)-WEST and its regional partner in the South, the Southern Legislative Conference (SLC). The BLC serves as a mechanism for ongoing dialogue and collaboration between state legislators of the United States and Mexico. The BLC fosters the development of shared solutions along the border region through joint consideration of common problems and exchange of information. BLC members are legislators from the ten states along the U.S.-Mexico border: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the U.S., and Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas in Mexico. Political future He announced on October 16, 2009 that he will not run for re-election in 2010. When asked if he will run for another office he indicated that he is undecided, though suggested he will not run for Congress.http://www.kfoxtv.com/news/21320614/detail.html State Senator Juan Hinojosa suggested that Shapleigh might run for governor.

It is considered to be the rarest of all storks,Hancock JA, Kuschlan JA, Kahl, MP. 1992. Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills of the World.

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2012: e.T22697685A37859303. The population has long been in decline and the primary cause is widely considered to be deforestation of its native habitat. Taxonomy and systematics Sukau Rainforest Lodge, Kinabatangen River - Sabah, Borneo - Malaysia Sukau Rainforest Lodge, Kinabatangen River - Sabah, Borneo - Malaysia This stork was first described by Blasius in 1896, and named after the German sea captain Hugo Storm, a collector of zoological specimens in the West Indies.Boelens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. 2014. The Eponym Dictionary of Birds. Bloomsbury, UK. In Thailand, it is known as \\"nok kra su um\\", which refers to the birds‚Äô fishing procedure by stalking along the bank of a stream in dense forest. This species is very similar and closely related to the woolly-necked stork whose range partially overlaps with that of the Storm's Stork. Although the Storm's stork has long been considered a separate species,Chasen FN. 1935. Hand List of Malaysian Birds. Bulletin of Raffles Museum 11. it has also been previously treated as a subspecies of the woolly-necked stork in the more recent past. However, Storm's stork is characterised by a yellowish-orange facial skin patch around the eye that is absent in the woolly-necked stork; and the neck is black and white, whereas it is completely white in the woolly-necked stork. However, the specific distinguishing features of Storm's stork have been poorly known in the past, which in the field has frequently led to confusion with the woolly-necked stork. These two species are also ecologically segregated, with the Storm's stork keeping to dense forests and the woolly- necked stork mainly inhabiting open swamp, rice paddy, grassland and dry cultivated areas. There is evidence of sympatry of these two species in Sumatra, where both of these habitats are present. Further, phylogenetic analyses of the Ciconiidae based on a portion of cytochrome oxidase b gene have suggested with strong support that the Storm's stork and the woolly- necked stork are sister species. Description This medium-sized stork stands at 75‚Äì91 cm tall and most of the plumage is black. The undertail coverts and the back of neck are white with a black cap. It has orange facial skin with a yellow ring surrounding the eye, a red iris, and a pinkish-red bill. On some but not all male individuals, the culmen of the bill is slightly concave with a basal knob.oiseauxbirds.com. http://www.oiseaux-birds.com/card- storm-s-stork.html.Accessed 03/06/16 The legs and feet of adults are dull red, but usually appear paler because they are often covered with the birds‚Äô excreta. The bill and other soft body parts darken in the breeding season. The sexes are similar in appearance, but as in all storks, the male appears slightly larger. It is also speculated from field observations that the male's black cap, chest and throat are slightly glossier. The plumage of the chicks at 1‚Äì3 days old is completely white, accompanied by a black crown and a black bill with a yellow-orange tip. The legs, facial skin and gular pouch are initially light yellow; as the chicks age, the legs become pink, and the facial skin becomes dark grey. The iris is initially brown. The chicks grow very fast, doubling in new-born size in just less than a month. By this time, they have also begun to develop black feathers on their wings, throats and bodies. After 30 days, the areas of black feathering have increased, and the black chest and wing coverts are streaked with glossy green and bronze-red. After 45 days, the young resemble adults, but they are still smaller with shorter, dark-tipped bills and paler skin colourations, and the blackness of their plumage is slightly duller. The chicks become fully feathered after 52‚Äì57 days. Wild young have been reported to leave the nest after about 60 days, and individuals in captivity can usually fly after 90 days. The adult birds are generally silent outside the breeding season; but during the breeding season they make vocalisations that may be described as \\"Kurau\\".Smythies BE. 1981. The Birds of Borneo, 3rd Edition. Malayan Nature Society, Kuala Lampur. In captivity, one adult individual has been heard to make a quiet sibilant whistling. Chicks have been heard to make a relatively loud froglike begging call when parents return to the nest with food. Distribution and habitat The majority of the world population lives throughout the island of Borneo; occurring in Kalimantan (Indonesia), Swarak, Sabah (Malaysia) and Brunei. It is also found throughout Sumatra, although its range there was previously considered to be restricted to the south east. Despite being widespread on both of these islands, the population occurs at low densities and only one or a few individuals have ever been sighted together, with the largest number being 12 during an observation in Brunei. Smaller numbers live in some parts of peninsular Malaysia, where it appears to be particularly rare. An even smaller minority lives in the extreme south of Thailand, but this stork very unlikely occurs elsewhere in Thailand due to the near absence of remaining suitable habitat. In 1986, the first nest of this species ever known to science was discovered in Southern Thailand. However, the construction of the Chiew Larn Dam in the same year led to destruction of much of this stork's lowland forest habitat through extensive flooding. Following the flooding, Storm's stork was therefore believed to no longer breed thereRound P. 1988. Threatened forest birds of Thailand. ICBP Technical Publication Number 8. Cambridge: International Council for Bird Preservation. and since then was previously considered extinct in Thailand.BirdLife International. 2001. Threatened birds of Asia: The Birdlife International Red Data Book. Cambridge, U.K.: BirdLife International. However, this stork was re-sighted in Southern Thailand in 2004 with infrared camera traps; but continues to be exceptionally uncommon given that usually only one individual has been sighted at a time despite the high intensity of camera trapping. Nevertheless, its persistence in Southern Thailand does suggest the presence of a small breeding population. This stork's habitat is primarily dense lowland riverine forest and peat swamp forest, at altitudes not exceeding 240 metres above sea level. The density of large trees in this habitat exceeding 10 cm at breast height is estimated to range from 500 to 800 trees per hectare, and typical tree genera include Dipterocarpus and Ficus. The forest undergrowth predominantly comprises rattans, bamboos, shrubs and climbers. Because these habitats are largely inaccessible to humans, collecting data on this species is logistically difficult, which may partly explain why little is known about this stork's natural history. Although Storm's stork accepts both lowland riverine forest and peat swamp forest, it is currently unknown which of these habitats provide optimal living conditions for the species. However, peat-swamp forest does appear to be an underestimated, ecologically important habitat for this stork across much of its range. In the wake of continued anthropogenic loss of lowland riverine forest, peat-swamp forest possibly provides an important refuge for the species and an extensive area of peat swamp forest occurs in West Kalimantan. However, this forest habitat is also under threat through conversion to palm oil plantations, logging and forest fires, so that increased conservation efforts should be directed on protecting peat-swamp forest. This species has been shown to be somewhat tolerant of logged forests; however, these areas‚Äô actual value as a breeding habitat for this species is disputed. Danielsen and Heegaard Danielsen F, Heegaard M. 1995. Impact of logging and plantation development on species diversity: a case study from Sumatra. In: Sandbukt √ò. 1995. Management of tropical forests: towards an integrated perspective. Oslo: Centre for Development and the Environment, University of Oslo. have considered Storm's stork incapable of breeding in logged forests despite apparent short term survival. In any case, current records have been too short to demonstrate long-term value of logged forests to this stork species.Berdie IJ, 2008. Assessing canopy cover requirements of Storm's Stork Ciconia stormi at multiple scales. Open access thesis. Paper 132. The acceptance of logged forests by Storm's stork may also entail some caveats; for example, that there must invariably be easy access within logged forest to freshwater margins, and that at least 20 years of forest regeneration should be allowed to elapse before real habitat value is re-established. A local mosaic of primary and logged forest may also explain this species‚Äô apparent persistence in logged forest, because it may rely on the undisturbed forest patches as a refuge to sustain itself in the logged forest patches. This stork is often seen soaring at great heights over rivers and forest clearings, and like many other storks utilises thermals to assist it in gliding. This behaviour is said to be \\"contagious\\" because when one individual begins to soar, conspecifics join it in flight; with flocks consisting of up to six individuals. On Borneo, it has also been reported on open, grassy freshwater swamps and paddy fields. It appears to never frequent saline habitats,Meijaard E, Dennis R, Schroor P, Nardiyono, Berdie I, Douglas O, Fuller. 2015. Habitat characteristics of Storm's stork Ciconiia stormi in Indonesian Borneo. Available at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272182067_Habitat_characteristics_of_Storm's_Stork_Ciconia_stormii_in_Indonesian_Borneo. Accessed 30/05/16. but occasionally uses forested inland areas adjacent to bodies of water subject to tidal movements and near mangrove swamps. Behaviour and ecology =Breeding= Two major breeding records of this species have been made; in Southern Thailand in 1986, and in swamp forest in South Samatra in 1989. However, chicks in the Thailand breeding record were first observed in October and those in Sumatra were first observed in early June. The differing recorded times of egg laying in this species therefore does not suggest a strict breeding season. Collective breeding records of this species are currently scant possibly because nests are difficult to accurately locate in the dense forest habitat. The nest is usually located 19-30m above ground above riverbanks, often in the forks of trees of Dipterocarpus species. At south Sumatra, a Storm's stork nest was studied that lay 8.3m above ground in an 18m-tall Rhizosphora mucronata tree. In captivity, both the male and female have been observed to carry out nest-building activities. The nest has an external outer diameter measuring between 30 and 50 cm; with a depth of 10‚Äì15 cm, and is typically composed of twigs and sticks mainly belonging to tree species in the genus Rhizosphora, but also from species in the families Loranthaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, and Rubinaceae. These sticks measure 15‚Äì 60 cm in length and 0.5-1.5 cm in diameter. The nest interior is lined with soft material such as grass and down. 2‚Äì4 cm long leaflets from Xylocarpus species have also been identified as nest material, and these plants have been found growing in the area surrounding the nest. The same nest is often used by a pair over consecutive years; whereby both mates add more material to the nest each year. Male-female pairs of this species are typically monogamous. Both parents attend to the young at the nest, but only one parent at a time is usually present; with the female estimated to spend three times as long alone at the nest as the male. In the early stages of the chicks‚Äô life, both parents have been observed to roost at or near the nest during the evening; but within a month only the female continues to roost at or near the nest. Contrary to previous assertions,MacKinnon J. Phillips K. 1993. A Field Guide to the Birds of Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and Bali. Oxford: Oxford University Press. this species actually appears to breed solitarily and does not nest in colonies. However, it is sometimes found to roost communally, and several individuals have been observed roosting in tops of tall swamp trees a few kilometres from the nests. Two eggs are usually laid per year, and the incubation period has been estimated at 29 days, with both parents alternately incubating the eggs. In captivity, the clutch size may range between two and four. The young are fully fledged 90 days after hatching. The only egg of this species to have been measured was an infertile one extracted from a nest containing two hatched chicks in south Sumatra in 1989. This egg measured 60.1mm in length and 41.9mm in breadth, and was completely white after cleaning. This egg is preserved at the Zoological Museum of Bogor, Indonesia, and is currently the only egg specimen available for this species. Pairs of this stork species perform impressive aerial courtship displays in which both partners do flips in flight, with the lower birds presenting its feet to the upper. Both birds also occasionally glide at high altitudes with level wings and dangling legs. At the nest, they perform bill clattering activities that are typical of many species in the Ciconiidae. In captivity, another courtship display has been observed in which both partners face each other on the ground or on the nest, extend their wings outward from the body, and bow to each other repeatedly. This display continues until the male approaches the female and attempts to copulate with her, although copulation does not actually follow from most such displays. This display also sometimes continues when breeding is finished and chicks are at the nest. However, the importance of this display in wild populations is unknown, since both parents have been sighted together at the nest for only 2% of the time from observations. =Food and feeding= The Storm's stork feeds primarily on small fish, frogs, aquatic insect larvae, and sometimes earthworms. These are also the food items brought by both parents back for their young at the nest; with the fish measuring 5‚Äì7 cm long and weighing 10-30g, and the worms measuring 10‚Äì15 cm long. The parents regurgitate the food into the bottom of the nest, whereupon it is picked up and swallowed by the chicks. During a series of nest observations in south Sumatra in 1989, adults were found to return to the nest with food for the chicks every 2‚Äì4 hours in June,; but in July, food was brought to the nest less often and significantly more frequently in the late afternoons. In Sabah, they have also been reported to feed on grasshoppers and possibly crabs. Hence, other food taxa may be similar to those of the woollynecked stork, but more data are required to fully confirm this, . This stork typically forages stealthily with slow, deliberate movements and a retracted neck along muddy banks of rivers and creeks within dense primary forest; keeping primarily to the shaded areas. Individuals with chicks usually forage 2‚Äì3 km from the nest. It will also use other freshwater bodies as foraging localities with high densities of fish and freshwater invertebrates. These include small pools, trackside puddles, swamps and oxbow lakes; and the Storm's stork may be able to use these features optimally where they occur in a patchwork arrangement on riparian floodplains. It can also use boggy clearings created by ungulates such as gaur that trample vegetation to access mineral licks. In contrast, deep, fast-flowing rivers and waterways are avoided by this species due to reduced prey availability and its inability to stand in these waters. In Sabah, they have been found feeding on open ground that has recently been burnt. They probably catch invertebrates that have been disturbed or killed by the fire. =Threats and survival= The primary threat to this species is degradation of its lowland forest habitat through deforestation for logging and conversion to oil palm plantations. For example, approximately two thirds of the swamp forests in South Sumatra were logged from 1982 to 1997. Kalimantan lost almost 25% of its evergreen forest during 1985-1997 and all of Sumatra almost 30% of its 1985 cover. The relative extent of destruction of this species‚Äô habitat may be particularly high because clearance of lowland forests typically occurs first in deforestation schemes due to the relative ease of approach and the presence of high quality timber. Extensive habitat destruction has also occurred through flooding of lowland forest following the construction of reservoirs, as epitomised by the Chiew Larn Dam project in Southern Thailand. Because this stork is a lowland specialist, high-elevation forest remaining intact after destruction and fragmentation of lowland habitat is unsuitable, so that transmigration to higher altitude forests is unlikely to be a viable escape solution. The Storm's stork is possibly not strongly directly affected by habitat fragmentation through deforestation. It may actually be somewhat tolerant of fragmentation because it could fly great distances in search of new habitat and be relatively unaffected by the open land matrix which it overflies. However, this is probably not a favourable situation for the species, and the exact maximum distances it will travel to reach new habitat are currently unknown. A larger impact of deforestation on the Storm's stork is more likely to be the decrease in freshwater faunal prey abundance and diversity resulting from increased sedimentation, nutrient loads and water temperatures after logging. This loss of freshwater taxa would in turn decrease food availability for this stork at its foraging sites. Road building through the forests to access logging areas creates similar problems by contributing to soil erosion, thereby also decreasing freshwater prey diversity. The large canopy gaps created through logging also lead to drier abiotic conditions in the cleared areas than under dense canopy, which would render these areas unsuitable for food taxa of the Storm's stork such as amphibians and invertebrates that require wet substrates to live on. This is another likely contributor to the decrease in food taxa abundance after forest clearing. A secondary threat to this species is hunting by humans. Hunting of this species by local people for food may have been happening before large- scale human encroachment onto its habitat to exploit the land. However, extensive land exploitation increases human activities that attract non-native hunters to these areas, so that hunting of this species through direct persecution has also appeared to increase as a side-effect of the direct impacts of habitat destruction. This was probably the case during extensive flooding of lowland forest in Southern Thailand during the Chiew Larn Dam project. This species is also extremely sensitive to human intrusions. If humans come within sight of the nest, the adult abandons the nest and does not return until 2‚Äì3 hours after the intruder departs. Anthropogenic noise sources such as from motorboats and chainsaws may also affect this stork; in response to such noises that penetrate the forest matrix, adult birds have been observed to press their head and body into the nest with only the eyes showing. Natural enemies of chicks and nesting adults are believed to include raptors such as crested serpent eagles Spilornis cheela, monkeys and corvids. If these organisms approach the nest, the parent spreads its wings over the nestlings to protect them. This nest covering display is similar to that observed in the maguari stork. Another minor threat is the capture of individuals for the international zoo trade, which increased markedly in the late 1980s. Although captivity of Storm's storks may be a solution to support the global population, these birds may be unsuitable to reintroduce to their natural habitat because they have become too tame. In Singapore, the price of this species on bird markets doubled ($300 to $600) in the early 1990s. However, there is no evidence that they have international trade value. Relationship to humans This stork is sometimes hunted for food, either by native forest dwellers or non-natives who have been attracted to the area by large-scale land exploitation projects. Although there is a relatively low human population density in areas of undisturbed forest habitat of this species, these people concentrate on gleaning forest products and poaching wildlife. During these activities, Storm's storks are occasionally caught for food either directly by people who extract latex from the jelutong tree, or in baited traps for the monitor lizard Varanus serator. Individuals of this species have appeared in many zoological institutions such as in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Walsrode in Germany. However, the only two zoos where this species has successfully bred are Zoo Negara, Malaysia; and San Diego Wild Animal Park, California. Status The population of this notably rare species has been thought to be in recent rapid decline, primarily due to clearance of its natural habitat to make way for oil palm plantations and logging activities. It has probably never been common, even before extensive habitat destruction from increased anthropogenic land exploitation. It has been classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1994. The total population has been estimated to number 400-500 wild individuals. Of these individuals, 150 are estimated to live in Malaysia; and an estimated 250 in Indonesia. This species is legally protected in Indonesia, Sarawak and Thailand. Although such protection has previously not been rigorously enforced, this stork has been recorded in numerous protected areas throughout its range, especially in Kalimantan, on Sumatra and in Malaysia. This species requires extensive areas of dense lowland forest over which to forage, so that the best solution to protect this species from extinction would be the large- scale establishment of protected areas holding undisturbed lowland forest and riparian features. However, because this stork is very secretive, it has proved difficult to investigate its biology and ecology. Although it is almost certainly negatively affected by deforestation, little continues to be known about the exact extent of its responses to anthropogenic changes in its native habitat.

Sailing south to Espiritu Santo, she embarked over 1,000 troops of the Army 27th Division to reinforce the Okinawa invasion forces. Landing troops and cargo each day and retiring to open sea each night, she suffered no damage from kamikaze attacks during the stay in the area 9 to 14 April. As part of Commodore J. B. McGovern's Transport Squadron 16, she transported troops from the Philippines to Japan and was present in Tokyo Bay with 1,135 troops of the 1st Cavalry when the Japanese surrendered 2 September. Returning to her home port, San Francisco, 31 October, Lenawee made two \\"Magic Carpet\\" voyages to the western Pacific before decommissioning at Stockton, California, 3 August 1946, and entering the Reserve Fleet.  Korean War  The outbreak of the Korean War caused her to recommission 30 September 1950, Capt. E. M. Brown in command. With San Diego as her home port, she operated part of each year, except 1952 and 1956, in the Far East. Her first voyage began 22 March 1951 when she departed for Yokosuka, Japan. Operating mainly among the Japanese Islands, she twice transported men and supplies to the Korean theater before returning home 27 November. Again in May 1953 Lenawee returned to transport duties in Korean waters and was at Inchon in July when the final truce was signed. The Chinese offshore islands and Vietnam proved to be the new crisis areas in the Far East. Following a period of amphibious training early in December 1954 with Korean marines, Lenawee joined in the evacuation of Chinese Nationalist civilians and troops from the Tachen Islands to Formosa, on her last trip carrying U.S. Ambassador to China Karl L. Ranking for a first hand observation. Even without such crises, the Navy never loses its alertness, continually training for any eventuality. Each year amphibious operations were held with marines either off the California coast, in the Hawaiians, or elsewhere in the Pacific. Joint exercises were also held with Philippine troops in 1957, with British forces off Borneo in 1959, with Korean marines in a cold weather operation in 1962, and in 1965 with units of the Royal Thai Navy.  Collision with USS Wantuck In mid-August 1957, USS Wantuck (APD-125) got underway from San Diego for Hawaii on the first leg of a voyage to Japan. She was about 180 nautical miles (333 kilometers) from San Diego on a moonless and starless night when at 0318 hours on 15 August 1957 Lenawee rammed her on the port side between the No.1 boiler room and No. 1 engine room, almost tearing Wantuck in half, the impact being powerful enough to bring her forward momentum to an immediate stop and shove her laterally to starboard. Wantuck suffered two men killed‚Äîone who drowned in the flooding engine room and another scalded by high-pressure steam‚Äîand five injured, all burned. The submarine rescue ship USS Florikan (ASR-9) and fleet ocean tug USS Cree (ATF-84) came to Wantuck‚Äç 's aid, while Lenawee took some of Wantuck‚Äçs injured men aboard and proceeded to Pearl Harbor. Wantuck arrived in San Diego under tow on the evening of 16 August 1957. Deemed not worth repairing, Wantuck was decommissioned at San Diego on 15 November 1957 and berthed there with the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 4 March 1958.  Vietnam War  Beginning in 1963 the South China Sea became a regular scene of operations for Lenawee. Following the North Vietnamese PT boat attacks on and in August 1964, she prepared for her 10th Far Eastern tour since recommissioning. The people-to-people project was not neglected as a result of this new crisis, for the ship carried 10,000 pounds of textbooks and medical supplies to the Philippines and Vietnam after she departed San Diego 7 November 1964. With TF 76, she stood-by laden with marines in the South China Sea from 12 December until 10 April 1965, when 3rd Division Marines were landed at Da Nang. Five days later, her boats landed men of the 4th Marines at Hue. Reloading at Okinawa, Lenawee returned to debark additional troops of the 4th Marines in an assault landing at Chu Lai 7 May. On the 24th she brought 2,001 tons of ammunition to these same men. One month later she was en route for a short stay in her home port. On 9 August 1965 she departed California with Battalion Landing Team 1/1 on the first nonstop voyage made by an attack transport direct to Da Nang, arriving the 28th. Returning to San Diego 28 October, Lenawee spent the remainder of the year and the first 8 months of 1966 off the West Coast. She conducted type training and participated in various amphibious exercises until departing on her last deployment 4 September 1966. Lenawee carried marines to Okinawa, successfully weathering typhoon \\"Ida\\" on the way; then, after a stop in Japan, transported Republic of Korea troops from Pusan to Da Nang. She ferried U.S. servicemen from Okinawa to Vietnam and back in December, before returning to the West Coast, arriving at San Diego 8 January 1967 to begin preparations for inactivation.  Fate  Lenawee decommissioned 20 June 1967. She was berthed in the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California, on 29 June 1967. Title was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 23 April 1968, and she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 30 June 1968. Ex- Lenawee was sold for $129,089.78 to Nicolai Joffe Corp. for scrapping on 17 August 1975. At 1337 PDT, on 28 July 1975 she was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet and sent to the breaker's yard.  Awards  Lenawee received two battle stars for World War II service and three for Korean service.

He often refers to himself as \\"Riley Escobar,\\" and in season two of the TV series, he also refers to himself as \\"Young Reezy.\\" He is Huey's younger brother who aspires to be like the rap artists and the gangsters that he admires. Riley, who grew up on the South side of Chicago, was moved along with his brother to the peaceful, white suburb of Woodcrest in Baltimore, Maryland by their granddad. Riley is eight. In some episodes, Riley and Huey would have a single storyline and in others, the two would each have their own in a single episode. Riley, like Huey, is voiced by Regina King. It is strongly suggested that Huey and Riley's birth parents are deceased.  Personality  Riley Freeman is an impressionable third grader who embraces the stereotypical \\"gangsta\\" lifestyle and lives his life like his idol rappers. Influenced by rap music and television, he frequently uses poor grammar, and tends to defend his idols even when his imitations go against common sense and righteousness. One example is his support of R. Kelly in \\"The Trial of R. Kelly\\": despite overwhelming evidence proving R Kelly's guilt, Riley believes he should not have to miss out on his next album. This is further shown in \\"The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2\\" where he dresses in effeminate clothing because Gangstalicious created the style. In order to be like his idols, he collects airsoft weapons and tags houses, as demonstrated in \\"The Garden Party\\" and \\"Riley Wuz Here\\". He is a fan of the movie Scarface in that he occasionally quotes lines from or alludes to the movie, and he has a white suit similar to the one worn by Tony Montana. Riley seems to have a fair amount of criminal aptitude, as is demonstrated when he helped coordinate the kidnapping of Oprah Winfrey, and further demonstrated by his criticisms of Ed Wuncler III and Gin Rummy for their lack of criminal know-how (\\"Let's Nab Oprah\\"). Despite his pretensions to the contrary, Riley is not simpleminded: he can in fact be very resourceful and pragmatic, and \\"beats\\" Tom, a district attorney, in an argument over R. Kelly's confinement and trial. Perhaps due to idolizing the gangsta rap lifestyle he seems to have a level of street smarts possibly as great as his brother, often able to manipulate situations through lying and reverse psychology, which he refers to as getting into someone's \\"mental mind\\". Despite his crude thuggish lifestyle on rare occasions he has displayed acts of compassion (giving $100 to a panhandler he previously ignored and spat at). Riley is quite brash and abrasive and often gets into undesirable situations without considering the consequences. He is rebellious and does not listen to anyone, especially Huey and Robert. He is brutally honest to the point of being very rude. Despite the fact that Huey is forced to act as the voice of reason towards Riley's antics, usually without any success, Riley himself does become the voice of reason for his own friends, such as Thugnificent or Ed and Rummy. When forced to fight, he resorts to a crude and thuggish form of attack, in contrast to his brother's carefully calculated attacks which seem rooted in martial arts. His method is simply to continue attacking, usually with concealed BB guns, and random objects, such as vases, or lamps. Riley sometimes overestimates his own crude combat abilities, such as when he tried to fight his brother in \\"Let's Nab Oprah\\". His thuggish fighting style, both with weapons and hand-to-hand, failed several times against the precision of Huey's martial arts ability. His street-fighting style has improved to a certain degree in season 3, best seen when he defeated Lamilton Taeshawn in the episode ‚ÄúSmokin‚Äô With Cigawettes‚Äù. He does seem to have some talent with airsoft guns, as he fought Huey to a tie in season two. He has a strong amount of endurance and determination and given his previous beatings by his grandfather seems to have a high threshold for pain. Riley has, in spite of himself, shown a great degree of intelligence from time to time. It has been shown he has a great understanding of the Media world and music industry. This was shown when he tried to advise Thugnificent against starting a rap war with a much younger aspiring rap star Sgt. Gudder, knowing it would only cause unnecessary problems.  Relationships  ; Huey Freeman Huey and Riley tend to have a regular brotherly relationship despite their contradictory personalities. Due to the blunders Riley makes, Huey inevitably tries to teach him the error of his ways, but often to no avail. When their granddad is not around, Huey usually will not hesitate to set Riley straight himself. In \\"...Or Die Trying\\", Riley does not have any problem at abandoning his brother to his fate, but in other episodes he seems to trust him. Despite all this, Riley often insults his brother with the repeated phrase \\"Nigga, you gay,\\" usually after receiving a hug (although he just distanced himself from Huey while speaking those words in the episode \\"...Or Die Trying\\"). In the Season 3 finale however, Riley offers Huey a hug near the end without insulting him but admiring Huey when they saw him on the television instead. ; Robert Freeman Robert Freeman is Riley's paternal grandfather. Riley constantly disrespects Robert and Robert mainly resorts to physical punishment to keep Riley in line, but Riley seems accustomed to this kind of disciplinary action to the point where it does not influence or change his actions in any significant way. He seems to not understand his grandpa's rules and gets whipped with his belt when he makes a bad choice. They are shown to be close at times and agree on things in season two. In season three, the two are seen to have \\"father and son\\" moments, such as when they go out to try the new fried chicken in \\"The Fried Chicken Flu\\". They also attempt to go to the inauguration of Barack Obama in \\"It's a Black President Huey Freeman\\" ; Ed Wuncler III and Gin Rummy Riley hangs out with them and refers to them as his friends. They're the closest thing to a gang that exists in Woodcrest. They have a great variety of real firearms and are free to commit any crime they wish since Ed's grandfather essentially owns the suburb. Riley sometimes accompanies them on their various misdeeds, and is not afraid to point out when their crimes are poorly-planned, or are only successful because of Ed's grandfather's status. However, Rummy dismisses Riley's reasoning and says they get away with crimes because he (Rummy) is a criminal mastermind. However, they tend to use him for their own personal gain, such as stealing his Granddad's car with knowledge that Riley will not reveal they did it, then when it was eventually returned, they stole his new bike, fitted with rims riding as they shouted: \\"Thank you for not snitching!...You stupid motherfucker!\\" Riley also contacts Ed when he needs additional muscle, such as when he tries to get his Lethal Interjection chain back from Butch Magnus or when he and Huey need to seek out the Xbox Killer. ; Dubois Family Riley likes to make fun of the Dubois family ‚Äì especially Tom. He mocks Tom's unmanliness, breaks Jazmine's beliefs, and makes fun of Sarah's cooking. He outwits Tom, an attorney, in an argument about R. Kelly's trial and makes fun of Tom's fear of being anally raped in prison. He also mocks Sarah's cooking by comparing her peach cobbler to vomit with peas in it. ; Cindy McPhearson Cindy could be considered the white female counterpart of Riley and is initially an antagonist to Riley as seen in the season two episode Ballin'. Cindy and Riley were initially rivals on different basketball teams in the local league, but in The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2, Granddad invites her over to play with him, signifying a small amount of friendship. In the Season 3 episode The Fundraiser, Cindy became a business partner of Riley's and helped him, Jazmine, and Phil, a seldom used stereotypical ignorant kid, sell large amounts of chocolate bars in order to make money. She becomes the last remaining partner of Riley, being the only one not to bail out of the organization. Her appearance in the TV series is similar to that of Cammy from the Street Fighter series. ; Lamilton Taeshawn Due to their gangsta-like behavior depicted in the episode, Smokin' with Cigarettes, Riley is initially shown to be friends with Lamilton Taeshawn, as they enjoy hanging out with each other and doing bad things, such as causing a car-pile up, going on a joyride on Lamilton's grandmother's car that he stole, and smoking with cigarettes. However, Lamiltion shows more of his sociopathic behavior when he enjoys movie scenes of people being murdered, as well as murdering a dog while trespassing into his owner's property, and even assaulted his grandmother when she refused to buy him chicken. These events start to disturb Riley greatly, and ever since then, Riley finds Lamilton to be so disturbing and sick in nature and refuses to hang out with him again, and Lamilton would often try to kill Riley in return, resulting the two kids to have a brawl in the school rooftop. Despite his enmity with Lamilton, Riley cannot bear to kill him as he tried his best to prevent Lamilton from falling off the school rooftop, though Lamilton did fall (thanks to his former psychologist Dr. Doomis forcing RIley to let him go), but survived. ; Thugnificent Thugnificent(Otis Jenkins) is Riley's favorite rap artist and neighbor. What can best be described as a \\"Professional Buffoon\\", Thugnificent was leader of the group Lethal interjection Crew. He had taken a liking to Riley and allowed to join. (After irresponsibly having Riley perform several reckless and dangerous stunts.) Riley and Thugnificent remained friends even after the downfall of Thugnificent's career.

The conditional operator replaces both primitive recursion and the mu-operator.  Introduction  = McCarthy's notion of conditional expression = McCarthy (1960) described his formalism this way: :\\"In this article, we first describe a formalism for defining functions recursively. We believe this formalism has advantages both as a programming language and as a vehicle for developing a theory of computation.... :We shall need a number of mathematical ideas and notations concerning functions in general. Most of the ideas are well known, but the notion of conditional expression is believed to be new, and the use of conditional expressions permits functions to be defined recursively in a new and convenient way.\\" = Minsky's explanation of the \\"formalism\\" = In his 1967 Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines, Marvin Minsky in his ¬ß 10.6 Conditional Expressions: The McCarthy Formalism describes the \\"formalism\\" as follows: : \\"Practical computer languages do not lend themselves to formal mathematical treatment--they are not designed to make it easy to prove theorems about the procedures they describe. In a paper by McCarthy [1963] we find a formalism that enhances the practical aspect of the recursive-function concept, while preserving and improving its mathematical clarity. ¬∂ McCarthy introduces \\"conditional expressions\\" of the form :: f = (if p1 then e1 else e2) : where the ei are expressions and p1 is a statement (or equation) that may be true or false. ¬∂ This expression means :: See if p1 is true; if so the value of f is given by e1. :: IF p1 is false, the value of f is given by e2. :This conditional expression . . . has also the power of the minimization operator. . .. :The McCarthy formalism is like the general recursive (Kleene) system, in being based on some basic functions, composition, and equality, but with the conditional expression alone replacing both the primitive-recursive scheme and the minimization operator.\\" (Minsky 1967:192-193) Minsky uses the following operators in his demonstrations:Minsky (1967) does not include the identity operator in his description of primitive recursive functions. Why this is the case is not known. * Zero * Successor * Equality of numbers * Composition (substitution, replacement, assignment)Various authors use various names for this operation. Kleene calls it: \\"the schema of definition by substitution. The expression for the ambiguous value of œÜ is obtained by substitution of expressions for the ambiguous values of œá1, . . ., œám for the variables of œà . . .. the function œÜ defined by an application of this schema we sometimes write ast Smn(œà, 1, . . ., œám.\\" (Kleene 1952:220). Knuth names it the \\"all-important replacement operation (sometimes called assignment or substitution)\\", and he symbolizes it with the \\" ‚Üê \\" arrow, e.g. \\"m ‚Üê n\\" means the value of variable m is to be replaced by the current value of variable n\\" (cf Knuth 1973:3). * Conditional expression From these he shows how to derive the predecessor function (i.e. DECREMENT); with this tool he derives the minimization operator necessary for \\"general\\" recursion, as well as primitive- recursive definitions. = Expansion of IF-THEN-ELSE to the CASE operator = In his 1952 Introduction of Meta-Mathematics Stephen Kleene provides a definition of what it means to be a primitive recursive function: :\\"A function is primitive recursive in (briefly Œ®), if there is a finite sequence of (occurrences of) functions ... such that each function of the sequence is either one of the functions Œ® (the assumed functions), or an initial function, or an immediate dependent of preceding functions, and the last function is .\\" (Kleene 1952:224) In other words, given a \\"basis\\" function (it can be a constant such as 0), primitive recursion uses either the base or the previous value of the function to produce the value of the function; primitive recursion is sometimes called mathematical induction Minsky (above) is describing a two-CASE operator. A demonstration that the nested IF-THEN- ELSE‚Äîthe \\"case statement\\" (or \\"switch statement\\")--is primitive recursive can be found in Kleene 1952:229Kleene's 5 primitive recursion \\"schema\\" include the following: at \\"#F ('mutually-exclusive predicates')\\". The CASE operator behaves like a logical multiplexer and is simply an extension of the simpler two-case logical operator sometimes called AND-OR-SELECT (see more at Propositional formula). The CASE operator for three cases would be verbally described as: \\"If X is CASE 1 then DO \\"p\\" else if X is CASE 2 then do \\"q\\" else if X is CASE \\"3\\" then do \\"r\\" else do \\"default\\". Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002 observe that in a particular instance the CASE operator, or a sequence of nested IF-THEN-ELSE statements, must be both mutually exclusive, meaning that only one \\"case\\" holds (is true), and collectively exhaustive, meaning every possible situation or \\"case\\" is \\"covered\\". These requirements are a consequence of the determinacy of Propositional logic; the correct implementation requires the use of truth tables and Karnaugh maps to specify and simplify the cases; see more at Propositional formula. The authors point out the power of \\"definition by cases\\": :\\"...in more complicated examples, definition by cases makes it far easier to establish the (primitive) recursiveness of important functions. This is mainly because there are a variety of processes for defining new relations from old that can be shown to produce new (primitive) recursive relations when applied to (primitive) recursive relations.\\" (Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002:74) They prove, in particular, that the processes of substitution, graph relation (similar to the identity relation that plucks out (the value of) a particular variable from a list of variables), negation (logical NOT), conjunction (logical AND), disjunction (logical OR), bounded universal quantification, or bounded existential quantification can be used together with definition by cases to create new primitive recursive functions (cf Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002:74-77).

Behavior is believed to be influenced by external, situational factors rather than internal traits or motivations. Situationism therefore challenges the positions of trait theorists, such as Hans Eysenck or Raymond B. Cattell. This is an ongoing debate that has truth to both sides, psychologists are able to prove each of the view points through human experimentation. History and conceptions Situationists believe that thoughts, feelings, dispositions, and past experiences and behaviors do not determine what someone will do in a given situation, rather, the situation itself does. Situationists tend to assume that character traits are distinctive, meaning that they do not completely disregard the idea of traits, but suggest that situations have a greater impact on behavior than those traits. Situationism is also influenced by culture, in that the extent to which people believe that situations impact behaviors varies between cultures. Situationism has been perceived as arising in response to trait theories, and correcting the notion that everything we do is because of our traits. However, situationism has also been criticized for ignoring individuals' inherent influences on behavior. There are many experiments and evidence supporting this topic, and shown in the sources below but also in the article itself. But these experiments do not test what people would do in situations that are forced or rushed, most mistakes are made from rushing and or forgetting something due to lack of concentration. Situationism can be looked at in many different ways, this means that situationism needs to be tested and experimented in many different ways. # Experimental evidence =Evidence for= Many studies have found evidence supporting situationism. One notable situationist study is Zimbardo's Stanford prison experiment. This study was considered one of the most unethical because the participants were deceived and were physically and psychologically abused. The goal of the study was that Zimbardo wanted to discover two things. If prison guards abused prisoners because of their nature, or because of the power they were given in the situation. They also wanted to figure out if prisoners acted violent because of their nature or because of being in a secluded and violent environment. To carry out this experiment, Zimbardo gathered 24 college men and paid them 15 dollars an hour to live two weeks in a mock prison. The participants were told that they were chosen to be guard or prisoner because of their personality traits, but they were randomly selected. The prisoners were booked and given prison clothes and no possessions. They were also assigned a number to be referred to with the intent of farther dehumanizing them. Within the first night, the prisoner and guard dynamics began to take place. The guards started waking up the prisoners in the middle of the night for count, and they would yell and ridicule them. The prisoners also started developing hostile traits against the guards and having prison related conversations. By the second day, the guards started abusing the prisoners by forcing them to do push ups, and the prisoners started rebelling by removing their caps and numbers, and hiding in their cells with their mattresses blocking the door. As the days passed the relationship between the guards and prisoners became extremely hostile- the prisoners fought for their independence, and the guards fought to strip them of it. There were many cases where the prisoners began breaking down psychologically, and it all started with prisoner 8612. After one day after the experiment started, prisoner number 8612 has anxiety attacks and asked to leave. He was then told \\"You can't leave. You can't quit.‚Äù He then went back to the prison and ‚Äúbegan to act ‚Äòcrazy,‚Äô to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control.‚Äù After this, he was sent home. The other prisoner that broke down was 819. 819 Had broken down and was told to rest in a room. When Dr.Zimbardo when to check on him he said \\" what I found was a boy crying hysterically while in the background his fellow prisoners were yelling and chanting that he was a bad prisoner, that they were being punished because of him.\\" Zimbardo then allowed him to leave but he said he couldn't because he was labeled as a bad prisoner, to which Zimbardo Responded \\"Listen, you are not 819. My name is Dr. Zimbardo, I am a psychologist, and this is not a prison. This is just an experiment and those are students, just like you. Let's go. \\" He stopped crying suddenly and looked up at me just like a small child awakened from a nightmare and said, \\"OK, let's go.\\" The guards also began to have extremely abusive relations with the prisoners. Zimbardo claimed there were three types of guards. The first were the guards that followed all the rules but got the job done, the second felt bad for the prisoners, and the third were extremely hostile and treated them like animals. This last type showed behaviors of actual guards and seemed to have forgotten they were college students, they got into their roles faster, and seemed to enjoy tormenting the prisoners. On Thursday night, 6 days into the experiment, Zimbardo described the guards as having \\"sadistic\\" behavior, and then decided to close down the study early. This study showed how regular people can completely disassociate with who they are when their environment changes. Regular college boys turned into broken down prisoners and sadistic guards. Studies investigating bystander effects also support situationism. For example, in 1973, Darley and Batson conducted a study where they asked students at a seminary school to give a presentation in a separate building. They gave each individual participant a topic, and would then tell a participant that they were supposed to be there immediately, or in a few minutes, and sent them on their way to the building. On the way, each participant encountered a confederate who was on the ground, clearly in need of medical attention. Darley and Batson observed that more participants who had extra time stopped to help the confederate than those who were in a hurry. Helping was not predicted by religious personality measures, and the results therefore indicate that the situation influenced their behavior. A third well- known study supporting situationism is an obedience study, the Milgram experiment. Stanley Milgram made his obedience study to explain the obedience phenomenon, specifically the holocaust. He wanted to explain how people follow orders, and how people are likely to do unmoral things when ordered to by people of authority. The way the experiment was devised was that Milgram picked 40 men from a newspaper add to take part in a study at Yale University. The men were between 20 and 50 years old, and were paid $4.50 for showing up. In this study, a participant was assigned to be a \\"teacher\\" and a confederate was assigned to be a \\"learner\\". The teachers were told the learners had to memorize word pairs, and every time they got it wrong they were shocked with increasing voltages. The voltages ranged from 15 to 450, and in order for the participants to believe the shock was real, the experimenters administered to them a real 45v shock, The participant was unaware that the learner was a confederate. The participant would test the learner, and for each incorrect answer the learner gave, the participant would have to shock the learner with increasing voltages. The shocks were not actually administered, but the participant believed they were. When the shocks reached 300v, the learner began to protest and show discomfort. Milgram expected participants to stop the procedure, but 65% of them continued to completion, administering shocks that could have been fatal, even if they were uncomfortable or upset. Even though most of the participants continued administering the shocks, they had distressed reactions when administering the shocks, such as laughing hysterically. Participants felt compelled to listen to the experimenter, who was the authority figure present in the room and continued to encourage the participant throughout the study. Out of 40 participants, 26 went all the way to the end. =Evidence against= Personality traits have a very weak relationship to behavior in contrast, situational factors usually have a stronger impact on behavior; Which is the core evidence of situationism. In addition, people are also able to describe character traits of close to such as friends and family, which goes to show that there are opposing reasons showing why people can recall these traits. In addition, there are other studies that show these same trends, for example, twin studies have shown that identical twins share more traits than fraternal twins. This also implies that there is a genetic basis for behavior, which directly contradicts situationist views that behavior is determined by the situation. When observing one instance of extroverted or honest behavior, it shows how in different situations a person would behave in a similarly honest or extroverted way. It shows that when many people are observed in a range of situations the trait- related reactions to behavior is about .20 or less. People think the correlation is around .80. This shows that the situation itself is more dependent of characteristics and the circumstances in contrast to what is taking place at that point in time. Current views: interactionism In addition to the debate between trait influences and situational influences on behavior, a psychological model of \\"interactionism\\" exists, which is a view that both internal dispositions and external situational factors impact a person's behavior in a given situation. This model emphasizes both sides of the person-situation debate, and says that internal and external factors interact with each other to produce a behavior. Interactionism is currently an accepted personality theory, and there has been sufficient empirical evidence to support interactionism. However, it is also important to note that both situationists and trait theorists contributed to explaining facets of human behavior.

It was released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows; a mobile phone game was also developed by Amplified Games and released in 2004. The game stars the Marvel Comics antihero, The Punisher. After his family was murdered by the Mafia, Frank Castle devoted his life to the punishment of criminals. Players take control of the titular ruthless vigilante to track down and kill criminals. The game's story is a loose mixture of the 2004 film of the same name, as well as the Vol. 5 (2000) and Vol. 6 (2001) series of the comic books. Actor Thomas Jane reprises his role as Frank Castle/The Punisher. The game features many cameo appearances from Marvel Comics characters, such as Iron Man, Nick Fury, Black Widow, Matt Murdock (the alter ego of Daredevil), Bushwacker, Kingpin and Bullseye. Also present are several characters from the Welcome Back, Frank storyline such as detectives Martin Soap and Molly von Richthofen, the Punisher's neighbors Joan and Spacker Dave, Ma Gnucci, The Russian and General Kreigkopf. Gameplay Gameplay in The Punisher offers a combination of exploration, stealth, and combat. When encountering an enemy, the Punisher can attack, or perform a one- button \\"quick kill\\". Depending on the villain, the current location, and a player-determined level of aggression, one of numerous fatal assaults will be performed. The game's environments also feature interrogation \\"hot spots\\", where the Punisher can interrogate his enemies using death threats and torture, coercing them to share information that may help him in his quest. Plot The game begins with a cinematic of the Punisher (Thomas Jane) killing several footmen of the Yakuza. After he leaves the building, he is apprehended by law enforcement in front of an unknown building. He is then transferred to Ryker's Island and interrogated by police detectives Molly von Richthofen (Julie Nathanson) and Martin Soap (Michael Gough). The majority of the game occurs in flashbacks during this interrogation. First, the Punisher raids a crack house and eventually kills its owner Damage (Steven Blum) by dropping him from several stories above the ground. After almost getting hit by a car upon his exit, the Punisher traces the vehicle to a chop shop. After slaughtering the criminals there, he learns that it is owned by the Gnucci crime family, led by Ma Gnucci (Saffron Henderson), because Carlo Duka (John Cygan), the shop's owner, is a Gnucci lieutenant; the Punisher drops him in a car compactor where Duka is subsequently crushed. In a subsequent mission, the Punisher kills one of Ma Gnucci's sons, Bobby, at Lucky's Bar. Ma Gnucci hires Bushwacker (Phil Hayes) to capture Joan (Julie Nathanson), a neighbor of the Punisher. The Punisher traces her to the Central Park Zoo, where he rescues her. The next mission occurs in Grey's Funeral Home, at the mob funeral of Bobby Gnucci. The Punisher massacres the funeral party and kills Eddie Gnucci (John Cygan) by throwing Eddie out a window and impaling him onto a spike. The Punisher then travels to the Gnucci estate to kill Bushwacker and Ma Gnucci herself. After fighting his way through Ma's remaining men, Punisher then fights Bushwacker who he defeats in a gunfight. To finish off Bushwacker, Punisher rips his weapon arm off and shoots him in the chest followed by Punisher dropping Bushwacker several stories above the ground. Castle hunts down Ma and kills her. During the Punisher's assault at the Gnucci residence, he learns that the Gnuccis are getting drug money from Russian mercenaries at New York City's waterfront. At the docks, he hears that General Kreigkopf (Bob Joles) plans to smuggle nuclear weapons into New York City. He clears a suspected cargo ship of white slavers but fails to find the device. After being assaulted in his apartment by a large man called the Russian (Darryl Kurylo), the Punisher attacks Grand Nixon Island, his next lead on the weapon's location. On the island, the Punisher meets Nick Fury, who helps him defeat Kreigkopf and the Russian as well as prevent the launch of the nuclear device. Both escape before the missile detonates, destroying Grand Nixon Island. Returning home, the Punisher discovers that Kingpin (David Sobolov) has been taking over former Gnucci rackets. He raids the headquarters of the Kingpin's Fisk Industries, where he fights and defeats Bullseye (Steven Blum) by throwing him out a window from the top floor of the skyscraper. Kingpin tells the Punisher that his real enemy is the Japanese Yakuza. The Punisher learns that this group of Yakuza are called the Eternal Sun, and they are trying to control remaining Gnucci and Russian crime operations. The Punisher then visits Stark Towers, a facility owned by Tony Stark/Iron Man, after learning that the Eternal Sun are attempting to steal some high tech weapons and armor. The Punisher decides to assault the Takagi building, the home of the Eternal Sun leader, Takagi. He discovers that Jigsaw (Darryl Kurylo) has infiltrated the gang, and is gaining followers. While Jigsaw is being imprisoned in Ryker's Island, the Eternal Sun is already planning to bust him out. After escaping the Takagi building, the Punisher allows himself to be captured by Det. Martin Soap, who has been providing information to the Punisher. He is taken to Ryker's Island, as per his plan. At this time, the flashbacks catch up to the story, and the remainder of the game takes place in the present. During the interrogation, a riot erupts in the prison. The Punisher escapes from his cell, and starts fighting his way through the inmates and remaining Eternal Sun members the Punisher left alive. He reaches the rooftop and meets Jigsaw face to face, ultimately defeating him despite the stolen Iron Man armor Jigsaw was wearing. As the Punisher leaves in a helicopter, he throws Jigsaw out, killing him. In the post-credits scene, Bullseye is loaded onto the stretcher as Kingpin is seen plotting his revenge against the Punisher.  Reception  The game received mixed reviews, criticizing the game's sound effects and the linear and repetitive gameplay, but praising its system of torture, the storyline, the inordinate amount of violence and Punisher himself. Maxim contributor Gene Newman opined in his review that this game \\"[made] the Grand Theft Auto series look like Super Mario Kart\\". Detroit Free Press gave the Xbox version a score of three stars out of four and stated: \\"This isn't a game that requires a lot of skill. But if you can get past the gore, it's a rarity in the comic book world: a game that stays true to the original work and doesn't stink\\". The Sydney Morning Herald, however, gave the game a score of three stars out of five and called it \\"dark, violent and derivative, but nowhere near as flawed as the movie\\". The game sold around one million copies and was profitable for Volition. =Controversy= The Punisher features extremely gruesome scenes of torture and gore; the ESRB stated that an initial cut of the game would meet its \\"Adults Only\\" rating (which severely hampers commercial availability because neither Microsoft, nor Sony allow Adults Only titles on their systems). Much like Manhunt 2, the developers made slight censors to the deaths found within special \\"interrogation\\" scenes by rendering them in black and white in order to reduce their visual impact. The revised version was able to meet the \\"Mature\\" rating. In the UK, the BBFC worked with THQ to further extend the solarization effect on the scenes, distancing the camera before the killings and adding a zoom effect during them, in order to pass it with an 18 certificate, making The Punisher one of the only games to require BBFC cuts in order to be rated 18. In Australia, the ACB demanded similar cuts, including the removal of two scenes altogether. In Germany, the game was placed on the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons BPjS/BPjM list.

Kay was established in 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, by Henry \\"Kay\\" Kuhrmeyer, from the assets of the former Stromberg- Voisinet (founded as \\"Groeschel Mandolin Company\\" in 1890). The company produced instruments in its plant until 1968, when it ceased operations after a brief merging with Valco. In 1969, rights to name \\"Kay\\" was acquired by Weiss Musical Instruments (WMI) . The brand has been used by several manufacturers since then, mainly attached to Japanese import guitars.The Story of Kay Guitars, Told in 10 Reverb Listings by Frank Meyers, Jul 18, 2017 por Frank Meyers Kay offered their first electric guitar in 1936 ‚Äî five years after the Rickenbacker Frying pan, and the same year as the Gibson ES-150. However, the Kuhrmeyer-owned Stromberg-Voisinet brand had produced the \\"Stromberg Electro\\" even earlier, in 1928, making the short-lived model arguably the first commercial electric guitar. Overview = Early history (1890‚Äì1931) = Kay's archtop electric guitars in 1961: (L to R) Swing Master K673, K672, Truetone Jazz King The Kay Musical Instrument Company grew from the Groeschel Mandolin Company (or Groeshl Instrument Company) in Chicago, established in 1890. In 1921, the company was renamed to Stromberg-Voisinet. In 1923, later president Henry Kay \\"Hank\\" Kuhrmeyer joined the company, and in 1928, with the help of an investor, he bought the company and started producing electric guitars and amplifiers. The new company, \\"Kay Musical Instruments\\" was formally established in 1931 from the assets of the former Stromberg-Voisinet company by Kuhrmeyer. As its predecessor had primarily commercialised its products under its own brand as well as a large number of other brands, Kay Musical Instruments would continue that practice. = Activity on Kuhrmeyer-era (1931‚Äì1955) = The company initially manufactured only traditional folk instruments such as mandolins, tenor guitars and banjos, but eventually grew to make a wide variety of stringed instruments, including violins, cellos, double basses and a variety of different types of guitars, including electric, classical, lap steel and semi-acoustic models. Some of Kay's lower-grade instruments were marketed under the Knox and Kent brand names. In addition to manufacturing instruments for sale under its own brands, Kay was also a prolific manufacturer of \\"house branded\\" guitars and folk instruments for other Chicago-based instrument makers and, at times, for major department stores including Sears and Montgomery Ward. Kay also made guitar amplifiers, beginning with designs carried over from the old Stromberg company. Kay eventually subcontracted its amplifier production to Chicago music industry rival Valco in the 1950s. = Decline on Katz-era (1955‚Äì1968) = After the retirement of Kuhrmeyer in 1955, the company was taken over by Sidney M. Katz. The product line of Kay was shifted toward electric musical instruments on demands, and in 1964, the company moved to a new factory in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. In 1965 Katz sold Kay to Seeburg Corporation, and he became the head of Seeburg's musical instrument division. In 1967, Kay was resold and merged with Valco, but dissolved in 1968 due to financial problems. = Revive (1969‚Äìpresent)= The assets of Kay/Valco were auctioned off in 1969. The upright bass and cello lines were sold to Engelhardt-Link, a new company formed by a previous Valco member, which has continued production (see #Kay basses for details). The Kay name (and some of its trademarks, such as Knox were acquired by Teisco importer, Weiss Musical Instruments (WMI, by Sol Weindling and Barry Hornstein), who put the Kay name on the Teisco products beginning in 1973, and continued on through the 1970s. In 1980, A.R. Enterprises (Tony Blair) purchased the Kay trademark. In 2008-2009, The \\"Kay Guitar Company\\" of California reissued 12 models of vintage Kay guitars and basses manufactured by Fritz Brothers Guitars. As of 2013, production and sales of these guitars have continued.  Kay guitars  Kay was best known for its mid-priced guitars, (i.e., quality guitars priced below top-of-the- line instruments like Gibson and Gretsch models) as well as its budget instruments. Kay made guitar models for its own brand name and guitars branded as Silvertone for Sears, Sherwood and Airline for Montgomery Ward, Old Kraftsman for Spiegel, Rex for Gretsch, Custom Kraft for St. Louis Music, Truetone for Western Auto, - \\"Truetone\\" was a registered trademark for musical instruments owned by Western Auto since 1964/1966 until 1989 (or since 1945/1947 until 1992 for radio receiver on trademark 71485315). 'Penncrest' for JC Penney, etc. Also, Kay produced a line of archtop acoustics called Kamico. Kay's current line includes low-priced acoustic, electric and bass guitars, and moderately priced banjos, ukuleles, mandolins and resonators. They also sell the Chicago Blues line of inexpensive harmonicas. = K-161 Thin Twin guitar and K-162 Electronic Bass = K-162 electronic bass (1952‚Äì59/1966) One of the best known Kay electric guitars during the 1950s was the K-161 \\"Thin Twin\\", most visibly used by blues artist Jimmy Reed. This instrument debuted in 1952, and featured a single cutaway body, a distinctive \\"fire stripe\\" tortoiseshell pickguard, and a pair of thin blade-style pickups that gave the guitar its name. Kay used this type of pickups on various Kay electrics dating back to the 1940s. Also in 1952, Kay introduced the matching K-162 \\"Electronic\\" Bass, which was the first commercially available thinline- hollowbody electric bass guitar, and the second production electric bass guitar after the Fender Precision Bass debuted in 1951. Due to the use of K-162 by a bassist of Howlin' Wolf, Andrew \\"Blueblood\\" McMahon, it is commonly known as the \\"Howlin Wolf\\" bass. These instruments are believed to be the first semi-hollow electrics (i.e., thinline-hollowbody electric with solid center-block), predating the Gibson ES-335 by six years. Their unique design featured a flat top with no f-holes, a free-floating arched back, and two braces running along the top. The result was a semi-acoustic instrument that was feedback-resistant while retaining natural acoustic resonances. In 1954, Kay added the K-160 bass to its catalog with baritone tuning, according to the catalog, \\"tuned like the first four guitar strings but one octave lower.\\" Structurally this bass was basically same as K-162 bass, except for the higher pitched tuning and the addition of a white pickguard. In the late 1950s, various guitars in the Kay line were assigned new model numbers; according to the 1959 catalog, the Thin Twin became K5910 and the Electronic Bass became K5965. Both instruments remained in Kay's catalog offerings with only minor cosmetic variations until 1966, when Kay revamped its entire guitar line to only feature budget instruments. Kay also manufactured versions of the Thin Twin guitar under the Silvertone (Sears) and Old Kraftsman (Spiegel) brands. = Gold \\"K\\" Line = In 1957, president Sydney Katz introduced the Gold ‚ÄúK‚Äù line of archtop and solid body electric guitars to compete with major manufacturers like Fender, Gibson, and Gretsch. The gold ‚ÄúK‚Äù Line featured the Jazz Special, Artist, Pro, Upbeat, Jazz II, and Jazz Special Bass. Gold ‚ÄúK‚Äù guitars used the same hardware as top manufacturers. However, there were truss rod and neck issues. Kay's \\"Thin Lite\\" truss rods introduced on mid-tier instruments in the 1960s often become dislodged and inoperable. They may be repaired by a luthier. Gold models had single coil pickups with clear silver plastic covers and phillips head bolt adjustable pole pieces. The Upbeat model came with an optional transparent black plastic cover. The Jazz Special Bass has a single blade pickup as used on the K-161 and K-162 (tilted slightly towards the neck at the treble side), as well as a distinctive, oversized headstock. Valued among collectors, the headstocks from 1957-1960 featured a reverse painted plastic overlay similar to the Kelvinator logo. The guitars featured art deco patterns. It was difficult to get players to take Kay's high end entry seriously, and Kay discontinued the Gold line in 1962. \\"Kamico\\" guitars were lower-priced versions of Kay's original guitars. They were among the first guitars to use a humbucker type pickup, predating Gibson by some few years. Produced along with Kay brand name guitars from 1931‚Äì51, according to most sources.1940s Kay Kamico archtop guitar on Reverb.com The most recognizable model is the Jumbo Jazz. Kay also made banjo's under the kamico name.  Kay basses  Gretsch Tone King (1939) by Kay In 1937, Kay began to produce a 3/4 size upright bass, which is widely believed to be their Concert or C-1 bass. Like their guitar manufacturing, the basses were hand crafted by skilled craftsmen using special ordered machinery. They even had a hot stamping machine that could emboss the trademark KAY cursive script. After the dissolve of Kay/Valco in 1968, the Engelhardt-Link Company bought the upright bass and cello lines at the asset auction in 1969, and continue to produce the same instrument lines till today. Manufactured in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, Engelhardt basses and cellos are sturdy instruments, widely used by students and touring professionals. The ES9 Swingmaster bass (formerly the Kay S9 Swingmaster), is highly thought-of by jazz, swing, and bluegrass musicians.

Mount Ray last erupted during the Pleistocene. It is part of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The lava flows were restricted by larger masses of ice in the valleys on either side of Mount Ray, so the lava did not extend any great distance from its origin.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. .Hickson, Cathie with Hollinger, Jason (2014). Wells Gray Rocks. Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops, BC. Mount Ray was named for John Bunyan Ray, the first settler in the Clearwater Valley. He was born in 1878 in North Carolina and came to the Valley in 1909. He cleared land and established a farm in the wilderness south of Clearwater Lake. He married Alice Ludtke in 1932 and they raised three children, Nancy, Doug and Bob. The Ray family decided to move to the North Thompson Valley in 1946, mainly so the children could receive a school education instead of by correspondence. In December 1947, John Ray trekked into his old homestead and died there from a heart attack. Ray Lake, east of Mount Ray, and Ray Mineral Spring are also named for John Ray. Mount Ray is best viewed from a plane and its bright red color contrasts with the forest below. The west slopes can be seen from boats on Clearwater Lake. No trails go anywhere near the mountain.

It consisted of Adam Drucker (Doseone), Jeffrey Logan (Jel), Dax Pierson, Jordan Dalrymple, Alexander Kort, and Marty Dowers. The band was formed in 2001. While considered by the artists to be \\"genreless\\", Subtle had close ties to the hip hop and indie music scene. Although both Doseone and Jel are members of Anticon collective, Subtle was not on the Anticon label roster. Subtle was signed to Lex Records. Personnel The six member band consisted of: * Adam \\"Doseone\\" Drucker - vocals and samples * Jeffrey \\"Jel\\" Logan - sampling, drum machine * Jordan Dalrymple - drums, guitar, synth and vocals * Dax Pierson - vocals, keyboards/synths, harmonica, autoharp * Marton Dowers - winds, synth * Alexander Kort - electric cello  History  =The Season EPs and Earthsick= Subtle began in 2001 when Dax Pierson, an employee at the Amoeba Music record store in Berkeley, CA., met Adam Drucker at the record store. Drucker is a founding member of the Anticon collective/record label. They decided to try to make some music together. The first time they got together, Pierson also invited Alexander Kort to the session, whom Pierson had collaborated on performing, composing and improvising a score for some classic silent films (Marty Dowers was also a part of these collaborations). Later that year, Pierson was invited to an open mic show and invited other musicians to form a one-time group for a predominately improvised twenty-minute performance. Members of that performance's group were, woodwind/synth player Marty Dowers, drummer/guitarist Jordan Dalrymple, and cellist Alexander Kort‚Äîall of whom Pierson had previously played with. Dowers and Darlrymple were also fellow employees at Amoeba Music. Everyone enjoyed playing together so much, they decided to continue on as a group and added sixth member mpc/drum machinist Jeff Logan, another founding member of Anticon and along with partner in crime, Adam Drucker, member of the duo, Themselves. Over the course of 2002 and 2003 Subtle released their four 'season' EPs (Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring). A selection of tracks from these recordings (stated by the band to be the best songs of the EPs) were eventually collated on the compilation album Earthsick. Both of these projects were composed mostly of homemade recordings and were all released on Doseone's own label, A Purple 100. 'Winter' consisted solely of one 37-minute track which was entirely improvised, at midnight on winter solstice. Similar to this, Earthsick included four untitled, previously unreleased tracks, all of which were completely improvised with no overdubs. Chronologically, the improvised Earthsick recordings took place the year following the recording of the music that makes up 'Winter'. =A New White and Wishingbone= In 2003 the band signed to Lex Records and, in 2004, released their first proper full-length, A New White. This album spawned the single \\"F.K.O.\\", which stands for \\"Fuck Kelly Osbourne\\". Introduced on the record, and a recurring character in much of Subtle's work, is 'Hour Hero Yes', an aspiring middle-class poet and rapper. He is mentioned throughout the two Subtle LPs and both remix compilations, as well as in the 13 & God song \\"Ghostwork\\". Album and video artwork, as well as art on Subtle's official website, suggest Hour Hero Yes to be a bald man with a black and white striped face‚Äîan image which is embodied by a bust that serves as a centerpiece prop during live Subtle shows. Their live shows are particularly noted for their theatricality, incorporating hand- painted backdrops, set props, \\"costumes\\", and theatrical monologues that go alongside the musical performances. In 2006 the band released Wishingbone, a sister album to A New White containing remixes of tracks from that album as well as new material and remixes by Subtle themselves. Three music videos were released on the DVD included with the album, all of which were produced by animation company SSSR. SSSR also created the video for 'The Mercury Craze'. =Tour Van Accident= While on tour to promote A New White in 2005, the band's van went off the road after hitting a patch of black ice on a highway in Iowa. The driver, live sound engineer Patrick Scott and five members of the band sustained minor injuries, while a member, Dax Pierson, was seriously injured. Dax's upper spine was severely damaged in the accident, leaving him a quadriplegic. Dax continues to contribute to the band, but as of now, does not tour. =For Hero: For Fool= Subtle signed a distribution deal with Astralwerks/EMI as of July 2006. For Hero: For Fool was released in October 2006 on Lex/Astralwerks/EMI. Dax Pierson, rendered quadriplegic by their tour accident in 2005, contributed beatboxing, vocals and harmonica to the album and his contribution is prominently displayed on the final track, 'The Ends'. The album was received very well by critics, with Cokemachineglow declaring it their 2006 album of the year. 'The Mercury Craze' was released as a 7\\" Vinyl and CD single and is used as an opening for the German TV show Spam Deluxe (Giga). It is intended that Subtle's first three studio albums (A New White, For Hero: For Fool and ExitingARM) will serve as a trilogy about the rise and fall of the character Hour Hero Yes, and the character may indeed live on throughout the course of all their studio output, with the lyrics derived from his perspective. On the cover of 'For Hero: For Fool' he appears in old military garb, with fire for hair. =Tour Robbery= In November 2006, while on tour in Europe, their tour van was robbed in Barcelona. Bags containing $15,000 worth of gear and personal belongings were stolen, including a laptop containing demos, draft lyrics and unreleased work. To try to recover some of the funds, Doseone drew personalised portraits of fans from photos they would send in. =Yell&Ice;= Released in October 2007, Yell&Ice; is a collection of remakes and remixes, featuring collaborations with Why?, Dan Boeckner of Wolf Parade, Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio, Markus Acher of the Notwist, and Chris Adams of Hood (band). Just as 'Wishingbone' revisited Subtle's first LP 'A New White', Yell&Ice; explores and reinterprets their preceding full- length, 'for hero: for fool'. Both Wishingbone and Yell&Ice; were fashioned to further explore Subtle's conceptual protagonist, Hour Hero yes, while creating a medium for the band's love of collaborative music making. Doseone has likened the albums to early rap maxi-singles which would contain tracks with the same backing music but different vocals. Unlike a typical collection of remixes, Yell&Ice; utterly reapproaches the lyrics and music of for hero: for fool. In order to better suit the pallette and prowess of each respective collaborator, lyrics were rewritten, sounds resampled, and time signatures unlocked. These songbones were then sent to various collaborators who then rewrote, sang, and sequenced to the tune of their talents. = ExitingARM = ExitingARM is the third album \\"in the ever-widening epic of Hour Hero Yes\\" and is accompanied by its own website with further poems on Yes's journey. The album was an attempt to create a more accessible sound and was released on May 13, 2008. = OughtAlmanac of AmassedFact Vol.I = During the ExitingARM tour, the OughtAlmanac of AmassedFact Vol.I was available for purchase at Subtle's merchandise booth. Limited to 100 pieces, all hand painted by Doseone, the Almanac is a 70-page book that acts as a guide for the world in which Subtle's protagonist, HourHeroYES, resides. All copies of the Almanac have the first and last pages torn out except for a small bit, where it is numbered and signed. The OughtAlmanac of AmassedFact Vol.I is accompanied by a 65 track mp3 CD of Dose reading the Almanac in its entirety. The improvisational sessions that later became ExitingARM as well as the crackle of a blank record make up the background noise for the reading on the CD. There is an online version of the book/CD.ExitingARM on Lex Records =WASHERE= The first live subtle album contains a collection of 'hand- picked' live songs, alternate versions, and \\"original session\\" improvisations from their past five years of touring. \\"WASHERE\\" includes tracks from the rehearsals for the \\"a new white\\" tour. These \\"live at the mansion\\" sessions are some of the only live performances that were recorded before the tour accident that left Dax Pierson quadriplegic. =SmallFear Souvenir= Similar to what 'Wishingbone' was to 'A New White' and 'Yell&Ice;' to 'For Hero:For Fool', SmallFear Souvenir will be a remix/ re-interpretation album of ExitingARM. Artists confirmed to be working on it are Alias (Sick Soft Perfection), Thee More Shallows (Day Dangerous), Black Moth Super Rainbow (GoneBones), Genghis Tron (Take To Take) and Trans Am (The No).

Tom Clay (born Thomas Clague; August 20, 1929 - November 22, 1995) was an American radio personality and disc jockey. Clay was born in New York, and in the 1950s he was popular in the Detroit area on WJBK-AM both as a DJ, and for his on-air comic characterizations; he became a local celebrity. In the early 1950s Clay, using the pseudonym \\"Guy King\\", worked for WWOL-AM/FM in Buffalo, New York; on July 3, 1955, he conducted a stunt in which he played \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" by Bill Haley & His Comets repeatedly from atop a billboard in Buffalo's Shelton Square, an incident that led to his firing and arrest (Danny Neaverth later repeated Clay's stunt but did not suffer the same consequences). In the mid-1950s he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and was equally popular. He was caught up in the payola scandal of the late 1950s, and admitted to having accepted thousands of dollars for playing certain records. After being fired from WJBK, Clay worked at the short-lived Detroit Top 40 station WQTE (now WRDT) only to be fired again when the station changed format to easy listening music in 1961. After moving to Los Angeles to work at KDAY, Clay returned to the Detroit area and found work at CKLW in neighboring Windsor, Ontario, at the time one of the foremost Top 40 AM stations in North America. According to the book Rockin' Down the Dial, a history of Detroit Top 40 radio of the 1950s and 1960s by David Carson, Clay became friendly with Marilyn Monroe during his time in Los Angeles in the early 1960s. Clay's daughter, Kimberly, told Carson that her father never revealed much about his friendship with Monroe, but would only say that she seemed very lonely. Riding the wave of early Beatlemania he again rose in popularity, met and interviewed The Beatles. He was fired over a scheme in which he invited listeners to send in one dollar for membership in a \\"Beatles Booster Club\\", an essentially non-existent organization which had no benefits beyond a promised membership card or decal. According to fellow CKLW DJ Dave Shafer (also now deceased), Clay also promised each listener who sent in a dollar a personal item used by one of the Beatles; these \\"personal items\\" turned out to be items such as cigarette butts and used tissues, and other listeners claimed to have received nothing. However, since over 80,000 fans responded, Clay was able to live comfortably for a time on the cash that appeared in his personal post office box. Dave Shafer told David Carson in Rockin' Down the Dial that Clay skipped town in the wake of the Beatles Booster fiasco, leading to Shafer's being briefly jailed on charges of international fraud. Clay eventually returned to work at other Detroit area radio stations, including WWWW-FM, and also worked at WCBS- FM in New York. In 1984, he played pop standards at KPRZ, Los Angeles. Clay is best remembered for his single on Motown's MoWest label \\"What the World Needs Now Is Love\\"/\\"Abraham, Martin and John\\" (MoWest MW5002F), a compilation of clips from the two popular records, interviews, and speeches of Jack and Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King emphasizing tolerance and civil rights. It went to #8 on the Billboard Hot 100. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The single peaked at number 3 in Australia in August 1971. A follow-up album had respectable sales, but another single, \\"Whatever Happened To Love\\" (MoWest MW5007F), flopped, and Clay found himself unemployed. Both songs were featured on the MoWest album What The World Needs Now (MS 103-L, released August 1971). Clay finished his career doing voiceover work. Clay died of stomach and lung cancer at the age of 66, in Valley Village, Los Angeles, California in 1995.

The species was first described by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr., of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001. The pygmy three-toed sloth is significantly smaller than the other three members of its genus, but otherwise resembles the brown- throated three-toed sloth. According to Anderson and Handley Jr., the head- and-body length is between , and the body mass ranges from . This sloth, like other sloths, is arboreal (tree-living) and feeds on leaves. It has a body adapted to hang by its limbs; the large curved claws help the sloth to keep a strong grip on tree branches. It lives high in the canopy but descends once a week to defecate on the forest floor. It is symbiotically associated with green algae, that can provide it with a camouflage. Details of mating behavior and reproduction have not been documented. The pygmy three-toed sloth is found exclusively in the red mangroves of Isla Escudos de Veraguas, restricted to an area of . A 2012 census of pygmy three-toed sloths estimated the total population at 79. The IUCN lists the pygmy three-toed sloth as critically endangered and they are listed on the world's 100 most threatened species. Discovery and taxonomy The pygmy three-toed sloth was first described by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr., of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001. The researchers noted that the three-toed sloths endemic to Isla Escudo de Veraguas, a small island off the coast of Panama, are significantly smaller than those that occur on the nearby outer islands of Bocas del Toro Province. Moreover, they differ from other populations in terms of pelage and cranial characteristics. Hence, they considered the three-toed sloths in Isla Escudo de Veraguas to be an independent species and formally described it from the skin and skull of an adult female. The researchers further pointed out that Isla Escudos de Veraguas is the oldest island and located farthest from the mainland, that began breaking up into small islands due to rises in sea levels 10,000 years ago. They proposed that this species evolved from an isolated population that had originated from the mainland population of brown-throated three-toed sloths; it gradually differentiated enough to become an independent species through insular dwarfism. In another study the following year, the researchers observed that the mean body size of three-toed sloths on an island decreases linearly as the age of the island increases; the area of the island and the distance from the mainland, however, do not appear to significantly affect dwarfing. The pygmy three-toed sloth is one of the four extant members of the genus Bradypus, and is classified under the family Bradypodidae. According to molecular phylogenetic analysis, Bradypodidae nests with Megalonychidae, Megatheriidae and Nothrotheriidae in the sloth superfamily Megatherioidea. The generic name Bradypus is the combination of two Greek words: brady (\\"slow\\") and pous (\\"foot\\"). The specific name pygmaeus comes from the Greek pugmaios (\\"as small as a fist\\"). 'Monk sloth' and 'dwarf sloth' are two other names for this sloth.  Characteristics  Pygmy three-toed sloth on Isla Escudo de Veraguas The pygmy three-toed sloth is significantly smaller than the other members of its genus, but otherwise resembles the brown-throated sloth. According to Anderson and Handley Jr., the head-and-body length is between , and the body mass ranges from . The brown-throated sloth is nearly 40% heavier and 15% smaller in head-and-body length than the pygmy three-toed sloth. Moreover, the brown-throated sloth is lighter on the crown. The face is buff to tan; a dark band runs across the brow, surrounded by an orange patch. The throat is gray to brown, lighter than the underbelly; the dark brown back is spotted and has a dark stripe along the midline. Facial hair is short, while the long, rough hair on the crown and shoulders forms a hood. The grayish limbs have three claws each. The tail is long. They have a relatively small and slender skull, with a large external auditory meatus, narrow squamosal and mandibular processes, a minuscule stylomastoid foramen, and usually lack foramina for the external carotid artery and anterodorsal (meaning in front and toward the back) nasopharynx. The dental formula of three-toed sloths is: Two of the teeth in each jaw are incisor-like, although those in the upper jaw are small or may be absent. Many of the features found in pygmy sloths are thought to be indicative of a relatively rapid evolution of a new species in an isolated, island habitat. Distribution and status Pygmy three-toed sloths live on red mangroves. The pygmy three-toed sloth is unique in that it is found exclusively in the red mangroves of Isla Escudo de Veraguas; the island has a small area of approximately . A 2012 census of pygmy three-toed sloths estimated the total population at 79 ‚Äì of which 70 occurred on mangroves and 9 in the surroundings. The population density was calculated as . The total area occupied by mangroves on the island was estimated to be around . While their population has presumably always been low due to their restricted range, the 2012 census found far lower numbers than had been estimated (less than 500) by the IUCN in 2010. The IUCN lists the pygmy three- toed sloth as critically endangered; it is also listed in CITES Appendix II. According to the IUCN, conservation efforts are being hampered by conflict between local peoples and the government. Threats to the sloth's survival include timber harvesting and human settlement, that might lead to habitat degradation. After several observations, the corpses of the pygmy three-toed sloth were found to be unharmed physically, suggesting that predation is not a major threat. Instead, disease, habitat loss, or natural causes were larger factors in the species‚Äô death. A study in 2011 showed that there were 79 pygmy sloths in the wild. Studies in 2010 and 2013 suggested a recent population bottleneck and decline in genetic variability.  Ecology and behavior  The pygmy three-toed sloth, like others in its genus, is an arboreal (tree-living) animal. This sloth can spend as many as 15 to 20 hours per day on trees. It moves at an extremely slow speed of , making it one of the slowest animals. The pygmy three-toed sloth is symbiotically related to green algae; a 2010 study investigated this in detail. Different sloths harbour different types of algae ‚Äì only Tricophilus species were found on the brown-throated and pygmy three-toed sloths. These algae discolor the fur of the sloth, giving it a greenish hue ‚Äì this serves as an efficient camouflage.} Some of these algae might be transferred to offspring through the mother, others may be picked up from the surroundings over time. The smaller size of pygmy sloths reduces their energy requirements for survival and reproduction, making them an apparent example of insular dwarfism. A BBC documentary, in which English naturalist Chris Packham recognizes the pygmy three-toed sloth as the first in his list of the top ten discoveries in the 2000s, shows a rare clip of a swimming pygmy three-toed sloth. Like other sloths, the pygmy three-toed sloth feeds on leaves. It feeds on red mangrove leaves, which are relatively poor in nutrients and coarser than the tender leaves of Cecropia species eaten by brown-throated sloths on the mainland. Details of mating behavior and reproduction have not been documented.

Triangle-free graphs may be equivalently defined as graphs with clique number ‚â§ 2, graphs with girth ‚â• 4, graphs with no induced 3-cycle, or locally independent graphs. The triangle-free graphs with the most edges for their vertices are balanced complete bipartite graphs. Many triangle-free graphs are not bipartite, for example any cycle graph Cn for odd n > 3\\\\. By Tur√°n's theorem, the n-vertex triangle-free graph with the maximum number of edges is a complete bipartite graph in which the numbers of vertices on each side of the bipartition are as equal as possible. Triangle finding problem The triangle finding problem is the problem of determining whether a graph is triangle-free or not. When the graph does contain a triangle, algorithms are often required to output three vertices which form a triangle in the graph. It is possible to test whether a graph with m edges is triangle-free in time O(m1.41). Another approach is to find the trace of A3, where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph. The trace is zero if and only if the graph is triangle-free. For dense graphs, it is more efficient to use this simple algorithm which relies on matrix multiplication, since it gets the time complexity down to O(n2.373), where n is the number of vertices. As showed, triangle-free graph recognition is equivalent in complexity to median graph recognition; however, the current best algorithms for median graph recognition use triangle detection as a subroutine rather than vice versa. The decision tree complexity or query complexity of the problem, where the queries are to an oracle which stores the adjacency matrix of a graph, is Œò(n2). However, for quantum algorithms, the best known lower bound is Œ©(n), but the best known algorithm is O(n5/4)., improving previous algorithms by and . Independence number and Ramsey theory An independent set of ‚àön vertices in an n-vertex triangle-free graph is easy to find: either there is a vertex with more than ‚àön neighbors (in which case those neighbors are an independent set) or all vertices have less than ‚àön neighbors (in which case any maximal independent set must have at least ‚àön vertices). p. 184, based on an idea from an earlier coloring approximation algorithm of Avi Wigderson. This bound can be tightened slightly: in every triangle-free graph there exists an independent set of \\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{n\\\\log n}) vertices, and in some triangle-free graphs every independent set has O(\\\\sqrt{n\\\\log n}) vertices. One way to generate triangle- free graphs in which all independent sets are small is the triangle-free process; . in which one generates a maximal triangle-free graph by repeatedly adding randomly chosen edges that do not complete a triangle. With high probability, this process produces a graph with independence number O(\\\\sqrt{n\\\\log n}). It is also possible to find regular graphs with the same properties. These results may also be interpreted as giving asymptotic bounds on the Ramsey numbers R(3,t) of the form \\\\Theta(\\\\tfrac{t^2}{\\\\log t}): if the edges of a complete graph on \\\\Omega(\\\\tfrac{t^2}{\\\\log t}) vertices are colored red and blue, then either the red graph contains a triangle or, if it is triangle-free, then it must have an independent set of size t corresponding to a clique of the same size in the blue graph. Coloring triangle-free graphs The Gr√∂tzsch graph is a triangle-free graph that cannot be colored with fewer than four colors Much research about triangle-free graphs has focused on graph coloring. Every bipartite graph (that is, every 2-colorable graph) is triangle-free, and Gr√∂tzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph may be 3-colored.; ). However, nonplanar triangle-free graphs may require many more than three colors. defined a construction, now called the Mycielskian, for forming a new triangle-free graph from another triangle-free graph. If a graph has chromatic number k, its Mycielskian has chromatic number k + 1, so this construction may be used to show that arbitrarily large numbers of colors may be needed to color nonplanar triangle-free graphs. In particular the Gr√∂tzsch graph, an 11-vertex graph formed by repeated application of Mycielski's construction, is a triangle-free graph that cannot be colored with fewer than four colors, and is the smallest graph with this property. and showed that the number of colors needed to color any m-edge triangle-free graph is :O \\\\left(\\\\frac{m^{1/3}}{(\\\\log m)^{2/3}} \\\\right) and that there exist triangle-free graphs that have chromatic numbers proportional to this bound. There have also been several results relating coloring to minimum degree in triangle-free graphs. proved that any n-vertex triangle-free graph in which each vertex has more than 2n/5 neighbors must be bipartite. This is the best possible result of this type, as the 5-cycle requires three colors but has exactly 2n/5 neighbors per vertex. Motivated by this result, conjectured that any n-vertex triangle-free graph in which each vertex has at least n/3 neighbors can be colored with only three colors; however, disproved this conjecture by finding a counterexample in which each vertex of the Gr√∂tzsch graph is replaced by an independent set of a carefully chosen size. showed that any n-vertex triangle-free graph in which each vertex has more than 10n/29 neighbors must be 3-colorable; this is the best possible result of this type, because H√§ggkvist's graph requires four colors and has exactly 10n/29 neighbors per vertex. Finally, proved that any n-vertex triangle-free graph in which each vertex has more than n/3 neighbors must be 4-colorable. Additional results of this type are not possible, as Hajnalsee . found examples of triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number and minimum degree (1/3 ‚àí Œµ)n for any Œµ > 0\\\\. Sensitivity and block sensitivity For a Boolean function, the sensitivity of f at x, denoted s(f,x), is the number of single-bit changes in x that change the value of f(x). The sensitivity is then defined to be the maximum value of the sensitivity at x across all values of x. The block sensitivity, bs(f), is likewise defined by looking at flipping multiple bits simultaneously. Although most commonly examined Boolean functions satisfy bs(f)=O(s(f)), the Sensitivity Conjecture that bs(f)=O(s(f)^2) has proven to be difficult to prove, causing mathematicians to consider the question of constructing examples of functions that exhibit large gaps between the two quantities. In July 2019, however, Hao Huang from Emory University has provided an elegant proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture. found the largest known gap between the two quantities by considering a function that is the indicator function for the property of being an isolated triangle- free graph. A triangle in a graph G is said to be isolated if the vertices comprising the triangle are adjacent to no other vertices besides those that comprise the triangle. showed further that this result holds when \\"triangle\\" is replaced with any cycle or any clique.

The club history started in the early 1990s when the club joined KPZPN and started playing in 'B Klasa' (level 7 - the lowest level in Poland at that time). On June 2006 LZS Tarant W√≥jcin won the promotion to the A klasa but was disbanded in 2009 before being re-founded in 2011. The team kit consists of a white shirt with blue arms, blue shorts and blue socks.  History  The history of Tarant W√≥jcin began in the 1993 . In that time the group of people from local arena decided to reactivate the old club B≈Çƒôkitni W√≥jcin (Blue W√≥jcin). This club was quite popular in the arena in 70th and 80th. However they called themselves Tarant, which means a kind of horse, but use old colour of t-shirts. The main person who was main inspirator of reactivation was Karol ≈Åaszkiewicz - player, chairman and manager in one person. Thanks his attitiude the club could exist many years until now. The first year of existence was quite difficult. The team had to play their home matches far from home, because there wasn't any pitch where they could play. In the late 90th Tarant finally got a pitch and could play at home. The rivalization in league was always dramatic. Tarant in almost every season was close to achieve promotion to higher class, but always something happened and it failed. Fortunately in the season 2005/2006 [Karol ≈Åaszkiewicz built a team who achieve big success winning promotion to A-klasa. In the first season in A Klasa the Karol ≈Åaszkiewicz's team reached fifth place. Next season (2007/2008) was the last one of legendary chairman and manager Karol ≈Åaszkiewicz. He resigned after humiliating defeat against Burza Nowa Wie≈õ Wielka 0:8 . Former player Gerard Zi√≥≈Çkowski became a new chairman of club. The team ended season 2007/2008 on 9th place. Season 2008/09 was paradoxically the best and the worst in Tarant's history. The team won promotion to Liga Okrƒôgowa, but due to financial problems the team was incorporated and renamed on Kujawskie-Pogranicze Jeziora Wielkie. The last game of Tarant W√≥jcin took place on August 2, 2009 - the game in Polish Cup - Regional Round against Or≈Çowianka Or≈Çowo . The result was 3:3 (Tarant won Penalty Shoutout 3:2) . The last goal for Tarant was scored by Waldemar Humaj. After folding in 2009 the team restarted from the B-klasa in 2011. The most notable people of team are the captain from many year Dariusz Budkiewicz, Mariusz Mocha≈Ñski (who played many season at Tarant's t-shirt) and the manager Karol ≈Åaszkiewicz.

It is threatened by overfishing for the aquarium trade, and by habitat loss. The maximum documented size is , making it one of the smallest pufferfish in the world. Although closely related to marine pufferfish, they are not found in salt water, and reports to the contrary are based on misidentification.Sch√§fer F. Brackish Water Fishes, p 34. Aqualog 2005, Range and status The dwarf pufferfish is endemic to Kerala and southern Karnataka in the Western Ghats of Peninsular India. In Kerala it is known from 13 rivers (as well as estuaries), including Chalakudy, Pamba, Periyar, Kabani, Bharathappuzha, Muvattupuzha, Achenkovil and Vamanapuram. It is also known from other freshwater habitats in the region such as Lake Vembanad and the Thrissur Kole Wetlands. The dwarf pufferfish is classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss and overharvesting for the aquarium trade. It remains common in some rivers, but it is rare in others and overall it has been estimated that the species declined by 30‚Äì40% from 2005 to 2015. Dwarf pufferfish are found in some reserves such as the Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary. Description A juvenile dwarf pufferfish in an aquarium Sexing of juveniles is impossible because these fish \\"choose\\" their sex as they mature. Once one pufferfish begins becoming a male he excretes hormones to prevent the other puffers from becoming male. However, if two fish start to mature into males at the same time one will become the dominant male. There is also a dorsal crest, but it lacks special colouration when not erect. Both crests are displayed during courtship while the male circles the female. They also will have more yellow colouration. Both sexes are primarily yellow with dark green to black iridescent patches on the flanks and dorsal surface, but as with other members of the genus, sexual dimorphism is apparent in mature fish, with males being more brightly coloured than females. Males can also have a dark stripe down the center of their pale belly and iridescent \\"eye wrinkle\\" patterns that females do not have. Females are more rounded, tend to be a bit larger than males, and may or may not show more smallish spots between their larger dark markings. Diet and behavior The diet of dwarf pufferfish in the wild mainly consists of small animals such as cladocera, rotifers, copepods and insects. Sand and detritus, presumably ingested by mistake when feeding on small bottom dwelling animals, has also been found in the gut of dwarf pufferfish. In captivity the dwarf puffer will eat small snails such as ramshorn snails, bladder snails, and Malaysian trumpet snails (MTS) as well as some frozen foods like bloodworms, and brine shrimp, which can also be fed live. Puffers like to have a varied diet and it's important to feed different foods when keeping dwarf puffer fish in captivity. Other members of the genus feed on zooplankton and various benthic crustaceans and molluscs. Food items of specimens maintained in aquaria appears to be similar. Dwarf pufferfish are commonly associated with plants in the genus Cabomba, and the presence of these plants has been show to reduce mortality among captive specimens.Mahadevan, Harikrishnan. (2015). Improved survival of Malabar puffer fish, Carinotetraodon travancoricus (Hora and Nair, 1941) in planted aquaria. 6. Unlike many pufferfish species that are solitary and fiercely territorial, the dwarf pufferfish is very social and occurs in shoals in the wild. They should never be kept alone or in group sizes consisting of less than 6 individuals . with females outnumbering males 2:1 When kept in groups consisting of at least six in the correct male to female ratio, they are much more confident, have a better feeding response, are more social and less aggressive to each other. Solitary C.travancoricus are likely to become shy, nervous and emaciated owing to a decreased appetite. They should never be kept in captivity in groups of less than six individuals. Aggression between conspecifics is common in groups consisting of less than six individuals. A group of six should be housed in a 60-litre tank as a minimum, giving each fish 10 litres of water each.Dwarf Pufferfish Caresheet Pufferfish Enthusiasts Worldwide =Reproduction= Captive breeding of pufferfish is somewhat difficult,Breeding ‚Äì Dwarf Puffer (Nov.-Dec. 2005), Frank Stopper and capture for the pet trade threatens the species in the wild. Dwarf pufferfish eggs are fertilized externally. In the aquarium, dwarf pufferfish are often plant- spawners, laying eggs in plants (including java moss in aquariums) or on the substrate hidden within plants. Eggs have been seen to hatch after five days at , with fry initially being fed on infusoria, then brine shrimp when they are a week old, and finally regular-sized food.Ralph, Chris (2003). Practical Fishkeeping: Pufferfish, p. 61. Dwarf pufferfish do not guard their eggs or fry, and breeders do not keep the adults and the fry together.Wenzel, R. (2004). Carinotetraodon travancoricus. Die Aquarien- und Terrarienzeitschrift 1/2004:36-37 Captivity Ramshorn snails are commonly used to feed dwarf pufferfish. Dwarf pufferfish have become quite popular as aquarium fish thanks to their attractive colours, small size, and relative ease of maintenance. The dwarf puffer is also one of the few aquarium fish to regularly eat small live snails, so it is used in controlling snail populations. This popularity is a major threat to the species, as it is often wild-caught.

Fastelavn is also traditionally celebrated in the North American island nation of Greenland. The related word is used for Carnival in Germany in K√∂ln and Bonn with the same meaning. Fastelavn is related to the Roman Catholic tradition of Carnival in the days before Lent, although after Denmark became a Protestant nation the festival adopted certain distinctive characteristics. The holiday occurs the week before the Christian penitential season of Lent, culminating on Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent. The Swedish counterpart is Fettisdagen, the Icelandic is √ñskudagur, and in Finland they celebrate Laskiainen. In Iceland, √çsafj√∂r√∞ur is the only town that celebrates Fastelavn on the same day as the other Nordic countries. The day is known as Maskadagur (mask-day). The traditions of Fastelavn vary somewhat between the countries, and local regions, and some traditions have changed over time. A common theme of Fastelavn in all the countries currently involves children dressing up in costumes, walking door to door while they sing and gathering treats for the Fastelavn feast, a form of trick-or-treat. Today, the festivities of Fastelavn are generally considered to be a time for children's fun and family games.  Etymology  The term Fastelavn comes from Old Danish fastelaghen, which was a borrowing of the Middle Low German vastel- avent, meaning \\"fast-evening\\", or the day before Lent.\\"Fastelavn\\", Ordbog over det danske sprog, 1922. The word has cognates in other mostly Germanic languages and languages with contact with it, including K√∂lsch Fastelovend, Limburgish Vastelaovend, Dutch Vastenavond, Scots Fastens-een, Latvian VastlƒÅvji, and Estonian Vastlap√§ev.  Festivities  Costumed children walking door to door. Denmark 1930s. As in Carnival traditions elsewhere, dressing up in costumes forms an important part of Fastelavn in all the Nordic Lutheran countries where this festivity is celebrated. In some places this involves smaller processions, but in contrast to former times, dressing up in costumes are now mainly a children's activity only. In Norway, students having seen celebrations in Paris introduced Carnival processions, masked balls and Carnival balls to Christiana in the 1840s and 1850s. From 1863, the artist federation kunstnerforeningen held annual Carnival balls in the old freemasons lodge, which inspired Johan Svendsen's compositions \\"Norsk Kunstnerkarneval\\" and \\"Karneval in Paris\\". The following year, Svendsens Festpolonaise was written for the opening procession of the Carnival ball. Edvard Grieg also attended the Carnival, and wrote \\"aus dem Karneval\\" (folkelivsbilleder Op. 19). After the Rococo Hall at Grand Hotel opened in 1894, annual balls in the Carnival season were arranged until the hall was destroyed in a fire in 1957. Since 1988, the student organization T√•rnseilerne have produced annual masquerade balls in Oslo in the historical renovated freemasons lodge in the Carnival tradition, with masks, costumes and processions after attending an opera performance. The Carnival season also includes Fastelavens s√∏ndag (with cream buns) and fastelavensris with decorated branches. = Cat in a barrel = Dressed up children engaged in \\"sl√• katten af t√∏nden\\" (Denmark 1937). Traditional events include sl√• katten af t√∏nden (\\"hit the cat out of the barrel\\"), which is somewhat similar to using a pi√±ata. The Danes use a wooden barrel, which is full of candy and sometimes oranges and has the image of a cat on it. After the candy pours out, the game continues until the entire barrel is broken. The one who knocks down the bottom of the barrel (making all the candy spill out) becomes kattedronning (\\"queen of cats\\"); the one who knocks down the last piece of the barrel becomes kattekonge (\\"king of cats\\"). In Denmark, the barrel tradition has been practised for centuries, possibly introduced by Dutch immigrants to Copenhagen during the reign of Christian II of Denmark in the early 1500s. Historically, there was a real cat in the barrel, and beating the barrel was superstitiously considered a safeguard against evil. It was practised up until the 1800s, with the last known event occurring in the 1880s. The cat was not killed, but allowed to escape when the barrel was broken. The practise also used to be popular in Holland and similar events were known from Germany, called \\"Katzenschlagen\\". = Songs = A popular children's song in Denmark is: > :Original Danish Fastelavn er mit navn, boller vil jeg have.'' Hvis jeg > ingen boller f√•r, s√• laver jeg ballade. Boller op, boller ned boller i min > mave. Hvis jeg ingen boller f√•r, s√• laver jeg ballade. > :English translation: Shrovetide is my name, buns I want. If I get no buns, > then I make trouble. Buns up, buns down buns in my tummy. If I get no buns, > then I make trouble. Fastelavn song The song is sung on various occasions related to Fastelavn, but mostly by costumed children, walking door to door, as a form of trick-or- treat. Even though the song relates to Fastelavnsboller, candy or money is usually offered to the kids when they sing. = Cakes = Danish fastelavnsboller In Denmark and Norway a popular baked good associated with Fastelavn is the fastelavnsbolle (lit. \\"Fastelavn bun\\", also known in English as \\"shrovetide bun\\" or \\"lenten bun\\"), a round sweet roll of various sorts usually covered with icing and sometimes filled with a whipped cream mix or pastry cream. In most bakeries they are up for sale throughout the whole month of February. Similar buns are eaten in other Northern European countries, for example the Swedish Semla. There seem to be some small local traditions which are closer to the carnival traditions of other countries, including Ash Wednesday, Carnival parades, Pancake Tuesday and eating special food after Ash Wednesday, but they are not particular to Danish culture. = Fastelavnsris = Fastelavnsris Another popular custom (especially among the children) is the \\"fastelavnsris\\", with which children ritually flog their parents to wake them up on the morning of Fastelavns Sunday (Quinquagesima). Fastelavnsris have many shapes and forms and differ from area to area. In some areas they are bunches of twigs, usually from fruit trees and preferably with buds. Those are often decorated with feathers, egg-shells, storks and little figures of babies. In other areas, they are a bent willow-branch, shaped like an ankh and wound with crepe paper that has frizzles cut with scissors. Both varieties may be decorated with candy as well. The custom was known in 18th century in Germany and it has several roots. It may originate from an old pagan fertility ritual, which has been absorbed into Christianity. The more serious one is that after the reformation, particularly pious people used to flog their children on Good Friday to remind them of the sufferings of Christ on the cross. A similar custom is mentioned in the book \\"Frauenzimmerlexicon\\", published in 1715 in Leipzig (Germany), which describes how bachelors and virgins \\"bid each other goodmorning\\" by flogging each other and spreading ashes on each other. This custom is also known in both Denmark and Norway. Earlier, it was mainly the young women and the infertile who were flogged. It was also common that a young man would carry his \\"fastelavnsris\\" and gently strike at young women he met on the street. Later it became the children's special right to flog their parents on this day. In any case, the reward given for the flogging would be a fastelavnsbolle. = Processions = A Fastelavn procession (Denmark, mid 1800s). Fastelavn processions are not practised on any notable scale anymore, but used to form an important part of the festivities for centuries in Denmark. Unmarried adults dressed up in costumes and visited houses of their choice across town. Here they teased, danced and gathered food and money for the Fastelavn celebration. If married people and the elderly wanted to take part in the festivities, they could put on costumes and visit friends to tease and have fun. These costume games were not liked by the Church and the authorities, and were outlawed in 1683; Brorson even wrote a psalm about abolishing the sinful Fastelavn. However, the costume games were popular among the common people and they continued to be practised nonetheless. Today, groups of costumed children walk from door to door to sing and collect candy and small-change money. In Denmark, special boat processions were practised in coastal communities from at least the early 1700s and consisted of a regular wooden boat with wheels pushed through the streets accompanied by shouts and music. The boat was decorated, sometimes with mythological figures, and when it stopped on its route through town, onlookers were expected to feed a collection box for charity. The last boat processions died out in the 1970s.

Berry was reassigned to the command of the 3rd Brigade of Hamilton's Division (later Kearny's), 3rd Corps. The 3rd Brigade consisted of four regiments: the 2nd Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment; 3rd Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 5th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 37th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Berry's decisive action at the Battle of Williamsburg benefited General Hooker. His brigade fought in the Battle of Seven Pines. Berry was then promoted to Major-General on November 29, 1862. Berry was placed in command of the 2nd Division of the III Corps, succeeding Major General Daniel Sickles, who had ascended to corps command. Berry was killed by a sharpshooter's round at 7:26AM on May 3, 1863 at the Battle of Chancellorsville.

In 2002, a profile of Downtown Winnipeg published by the City of Winnipeg described the Walkway as a system of 14 skyways and 7 tunnels connecting 38 buildings and allowing for a maximum protected walk of 2 km. It went on to state that the system provides year- round climate-controlled access to over 170,000 m2 of space, including over 200 shops and businesses, 10 office complexes, 60 restaurants and snack bars, 700 apartment units, 2 hotels, 11 financial centres, and the Winnipeg Millennium Library, bringing together 21,000 employees.City of Winnipeg et al.: Downtown Winnipeg Profile (page 7) The walkway system has since expanded. Network segments Starting in 2004, in anticipation of the openings of the MTS Centre and Millennium Library, a new unified system of signage was developed for the entire network to assist wayfinding therein. This process brought with it the branding of the system as the Winnipeg Walkway and the subdivision of the network into four interconnected segments. =Main underground= Concrete relief by Bruce Head, taken from under Portage, facing north. Shops in Winnipeg Square underground mall Scotiabank Concourse This portion of the network is centred underneath the historic intersection of Portage and Main, said to be the windiest in Canada. At street level this intersection is closed to pedestrians; it is not possible to cross it without going underground. On a much smaller scale, this segment is somewhat reminiscent of Montreal's Underground City. Via a network of tunnels, the Main Underground connects the following: *Portage and Main Pedestrian Loop *Trizec Complex **Shops of Winnipeg Square **360 Main (formerly Commodity Exchange Tower) **Scotiabank Building *Royal Bank Building *201 Portage (formerly Canwest Place, CanWest Global Place, TD Centre) **TDS Law **TD Canada Trust (now at 360 main street) **Concourse Sports/Ergonomic Physiotherapy *Lombard Place **Richardson Building ***CIBC **Fairmont Winnipeg Hotel **Lombard Concourse **161 Portage Avenue East **Historic Grain Exchange Building *Historic Bank of Montreal Building *MTS Place (formerly Bank of Montreal Tower) At the southwestern corner of Winnipeg Square, near the intersection of Graham Avenue and Fort Street, there are escalator, lift and stairway connections to the second floor of 200 Graham Avenue, thereby connecting the Main Underground to the Graham Skywalk. Possible expansion The 360 Main Street tower sits upon one of several structural pads atop Winnipeg Square. The complex is said to be able to accommodate the construction of an additional high-rise office tower on Graham Avenue as well as a low-rise building for use as a hotel on Main Street, following this same model. Construction of a 40 story residential tower at 300 Main St. began in Fall 2018.City of Winnipeg et al.: Downtown Winnipeg Profile (page 3) =Graham Skywalk= Post Office connection of the Winnipeg Walkway system in Winnipeg, Manitoba The Graham Skywalk consists of a series of skyways connecting the buildings on the south side of Graham Avenue, between Main Street and Hargrave Street, as well as the Bell MTS Place (the former site of the historic Eaton's store) and the former Eaton's power station on the north side. This portion of the network provides access to the following: *200 Graham Avenue **Hewlett Packard Enterprise **Allstream *Cargill Building **HSBC *Canada Post Centre *Millennium Library *CityPlace **CityPlace Shopping Centre **CityPlace Office Tower *Bell MTS Place *Powerhouse Building **CTV Winnipeg The Bell MTS Place can be said to be a major hub in the Winnipeg Walkway network as it connects the Graham Skywalk to the Portage Skywalk. Expansion As part of the construction of True North Square, the walkway will be expanded on to the property to connect the development to Bell MTS Place. =Portage Skywalk= A section of the skywalk over Portage Avenue, with the LEED-platinum-certified Manitoba Hydro Place in the background. Shops in Winnipeg Walkway connecting Portage Place to the Hydro building This segment of the Winnipeg Walkway boasts many of the shopping and entertainment attractions most often associated with Downtown Winnipeg. An extensive network of skyways and second-floor pedestrian rights-of-way connects the Radisson Hotel, the Bell MTS Place, the Newport Center (sic) and other adjacent buildings on the south side of Portage Avenue, with the three-block Portage Place shopping and entertainment complex between Carlton Street and Vaughan Street on the north side. Several neighbouring residential, recreational and commercial buildings, including the One Canada Centre tower between Vaughan Street and Colony Street, are directly connected to Portage Place. At the western edge of Portage Place there is a skyway link to the historic Bay department store and the Power Building on the south side of Portage Avenue. Via an open-air connection through the covered parkade of The Bay, the network reaches further south, providing access to the Saint Mary Skywalk. More specifically, the Portage Skywalk links the following: *Bell MTS Place *Somerset Place *Newport Centre **Rogers **Portage Place Southside Shops *Carlton Building **Portage Place Southside Shops *Manitoba Hydro Place *Portage Place **Prairie Theatre Exchange *One Canada Place **Investors Group *YMCA Downtown Winnipeg *Place Promenade *IBM Building *Kiwanis Chateau *Fred Douglas Place *The Bay *Power Building Planned expansion As was the case with the construction of Winnipeg Square, structural pads were built atop Portage Place to allow for future upward expansion. There is one atop each end, and there is currently a plan for an office and hotel tower to be built on the western pad.Santin, Aldo: '$20-M tower to crown Portage Place', Winnipeg Free Press, 22 March 2004O'Brien, David: '$20-M tower planned for Portage Place mall', Winnipeg Free Press, 7 February 2005 =Saint Mary Skywalk= The top of The Bay parkade This is both the smallest, and the most tenuously linked segment of the Winnipeg Walkway System. Its only connection to the network is via the covered, although not exactly indoor, parkade of The Bay department store. The Saint Mary Skywalk connects three buildings on the south side of Saint Mary Avenue, between Vaughan Street and Edmonton Street, namely: *Centra Gas *420 Saint Mary Avenue *400 Saint Mary Avenue =Convention Centre= Winnipeg Convention Centre to Lakeview Square Skywalk section spanning St Mary Ave The Delta Hotel The Convention Centre walkway system is connected to the Graham Skywalk section by way of a covered walkway spanning St Mary Ave and Hargrave St, connecting cityplace mall to the Delta Hotel and the Convention Centre. The connection between the pre-existing Convention Centre walkway system and the Winnipeg Walkway system was completed in 2010. On the two blocks bordered by Edmonton Street, Saint Mary Avenue, York Avenue and Hargrave Street is a residential and commercial complex consisting of the Winnipeg Convention Centre and the various buildings of Lakeview Square. A network of pedestrian tunnels and skyways connects the following buildings: *Winnipeg Convention Centre *Lakeview Square **Lakeview I ***155 Carlton Street ****Business Development Bank of Canada ****Province of Manitoba ‚Äì various departments and agencies ***349 York Avenue ****East India Company Pub & Eatery **Lakeview II (175 Carlton Street) ***Shannon's Irish Pub **Lakeview III ***185 Carlton Street ***189 Carlton Street ****Ichiban Japanese Restaurant **Holiday Tower South **Holiday Tower North **Delta Winnipeg Hotel (formerly Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza) ***Elephant and Castle Pub and Restaurant The two Holiday Towers are linked to each other by a basement tunnel, and by two different skyways, one closer to ground level and one near the top floor. The North Tower is also connected by tunnel to the Delta Winnipeg, which is itself connected to the adjacent 185 Carlton Street. The Convention Centre is connected by skyways to both 185 Carlton Street and 155 Carlton Street. The latter is connected to the adjacent 349 York Avenue. The Lakeview Square development forms a 'U' around an open central courtyard which faces the Convention Centre across Carlton Street. Other Downtown pedestrian networks In addition to the Winnipeg Walkway, is another smaller enclosed pedestrian network in Downtown Winnipeg that is not currently connected to the principal Walkway network. =Civic Centre= Another series of interconnected buildings straddle Main Street, approximately 1 km north of Portage and Main. On the west side of Main Street is the Winnipeg Civic Centre and on the east side is the Manitoba Centennial Centre. This pedestrian network's tunnels link the following public buildings: *Winnipeg Civic Centre **City Hall **Administration Building **Public Safety Building *Manitoba Centennial Centre **Centennial Concert Hall **Manitoba Museum **Manitoba Museum Science Gallery **Planetarium Unlike the Convention Centre pedestrian network, creating a pedestrian link between the Civic Centre and the principal Winnipeg Walkway System is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Not only is the distance great between the Main Underground and the Civic Centre, but any connection between the two would require sensitive tunneling underneath turn of the century heritage buildings over several blocks.

The religious belief system was held by several tribes in Central California and Northern California, from the Sacramento Valley west to the Pacific Ocean. The practice of Kuksu religion included elaborate narrative ceremonial dances and specific regalia. The men of the tribe practiced rituals to ensure good health, bountiful harvests, hunts, fertility, and good weather. Ceremonies included an annual mourning ceremony, rites of passage, and intervention with the spirit world. A male secret society met in underground dance rooms and danced in disguises at the public dances.Kroeber, Alfred L. The Religion of the Indians of California, 1907.The Kuksu Cult paraphrased from Kroeber. Among the Patwin and Maidu, Hesi developed as a subdivision of Kuksu distinguished by its female participation. Kuksu has been identified archaeologically by the discovery of underground dance rooms and wooden dance drums. Northern Kuksu religion =Patwin= The Patwin culture of Northern California had comparatively strong and noticeable Kuksu systems and rituals. Maidu Kuksu dancer =Maidu= The Maidu culture of Northern California had comparatively strong and noticeable Kuksu systems and rituals. Pomo headdress used in Kuksu ceremonies =Pomo= Kuksu was personified as a spirit being by the Pomo people. Their mythology and dance ceremonies were witnessed, including the spirit of Kuksu or Guksu, between 1892 and 1904. The Pomo used the name Kuksu or Guksu, depending on the dialect, as the name for a red- beaked supernatural being, that lived in a sweathouse at the southern end of the world. Healing was his province and specialty. The person who played the Kuksu/Guksu in Pomo dance ceremonies was often considered the medicine man, and dressed as him when attending the sick.Barret (1917): 423, 430-431 A ceremony dance was named after him. He also appeared in costume at most ceremonies briefly in order to take away the villager's illnesses. All males were expected to join a ceremonial society; some of their dances were private or secret from women and children. Scholars differ in their opinions of the societies' power in the tribe: \\"There was no secret society of importance as there was among the Maidu and presumedly among the neighboring Wintun, and no organized priesthood vested with control over ceremonies.\\"Barret 398 In contrast, in 1925 a witness of the Clear Lake Pomo said: \\"The heart of religious activities lay in a secret society called kuhma, akin to that of the Patwin and Maidu and composed chiefly of men, which managed the ritual of the ancient hindil or kuksu religion.Gifford 353 Southern Kuksu religion The ethnohistorian Alfred L. Kroeber observed that Kuksu existed, but had less \\"specialized cosmogony,\\" in the \\"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\\" of the Ohlone/Costanoan, Salinan, Miwok and Esselen and northernmost Yokuts, in comparison to the groups in the Northern California and northern Sacramento Valley.Kroeber (1925) 445: \\"It is true the Costanoan and Salinan stocks, who participate in the Kuksu cult and live in the same transverse belt of California as the Miwok, seem also to lean in their mythology toward the Yokuts more than to the Sacramento Valley tribes. A less specialized type of cosmogony is therefore indicated for the southern Kuksu-dancing groups. [1. If, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies, the distinctness of their mythology appears less surprising.]\\" Notes References * Barret, Samuel A. \\"Ceremonies of the Pomo Indians\\", Published by University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnicity, July 6, 1917, Vol. 12, No 10., pages 397-441.

Early life Janifer was born on March 13, 1886, in Virginia. After his mother died, his father, George Sr. moved the family to Newark, New Jersey. George Sr. worked as a school janitor to support his two sons, George and Clarence. The small family were joined by the boys' uncle Joe and housekeeper and all lived in an upper unit of 190 Ridge Street, Newark. In 1906, Clarence graduated with honors from Newark High School. Afterwards, he attended Syracuse University in New York. He graduated from the Homeopathic Medical College of the State of New York in 1915. Janifer passed the New Jersey board on his first attempt. Janifer returned to Newark and passed the city's clinic physician examination with a 99.09%. Military service In 1917, Janifer volunteered for service in the army's Medical Reserve Corps. During World War I he was a medical officer, and was assigned to the Third Battalion, 372nd Infantry Regiment Medical Corps of the 93rd Division. It was one of the first American units to arrive in France following the declaration of war. General Pershing did not want to handle the African American troops and turned the unit over to the French, who'd been asking for American reinforcements. Janifer became an expert in leg amputations as many of the soldiers faced trench related injuries, such as trench foot. On December 13, 1918, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre for providing first hand relief to wounded and courage under fire. Career Before the war, Dr. Janifer practiced in Newark as a pediatrician. In 1916, he joined the National Medical Association, and he was the first African American member of the Medical Society of New Jersey. Following the war, he worked for the Newark Health Department in various part-time positions. For much of his career, Janifer worked in an extremely poor, segregated slum known as, the \\"old Third Ward in the Hill District.\\" After some time, he was put in charge of Newark's \\"Well Baby Clinic for African Americans.\\" In the mid 1920s, Janifer became a part of the surgical team at Philadelphia's Mercy Hospital. Dr. Janifer published many articles in the National Medical Association Journal. The information he shared corresponded to his experiences in the Well Baby's Clinic. His intention was to educate African American mothers and care givers on the importance of child hygiene and nutrition. He hoped this would combat high mortality of African American children. In 1946, he was asked to join the Newark City Hospital as a member of the pediatrics department. He was the second African American to be invited, the first being Dr. E. Mae McCarrol. In 1948, Dr. Janifer was one of the 42 distinguished citizens honored in the Hall of Fame of the New Jersey Herald Times. He went on to obtain two master's degrees in public health and practiced medicine in Newark for 35 years until his death. Personal life Janifer was married to Una Marie, a former teacher at Tuskegee Institute. They had one son named Clarence Jr., born in the early 1920s. Clarence Sr. died of carcinoma of the prostate on November 14, 1950 in Newark, New Jersey. His wife, Una, survived him by 13 years and continued her life as an activist. Before her death in 1963, Una had been credited with the Brotherhood Award from the Newark Human Rights Commission and given a citation from the Council Against Intolerance in America.

It is considered the easternmost volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt. The small tree-covered cone rises 120 m above the Chilcotin-Nechako Plateau and rests on glacial till. It was formed in three episodes of activity, the first of which took place during the Pleistocene interglacial stage about 340,000 years ago. The second stage produced a large hyaloclastite scoria mound erupted beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Pleistocene. Its last eruption produced two small lava flows that traveled 1 km to the west, along with a blanket of volcanic ash that extends several km to the north and east of the cone. Geology and history =Origins= Location of Anahim hotspot in millions of years ago, including the Anahim Volcanic Belt Nazko Cone probably began erupting about 340,000 years ago and has grown steadily since then. Like all of the Anahim volcanoes, Nazko Cone has its origins in the Anahim hotspot--a plume of magma rising from deep in the Earth's mantle. The hotspot remains in a fixed position, while the North American Plate drifts over it at a rate of 2 to 3.3 centimetres per year. The upwelling of the hot magma creates volcanoes, and each individual volcano erupts for a few million years before the movement of the plate carries it away from the rising magma. The hotspot has existed for at least 13 million years, and the Anahim Volcanic Belt stretches almost 600 kilometres (400 mi) away from the hotspot. Currently, the hotspot lies under Nazko Cone, which is the youngest volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt. =7200 BP Eruption of Nazko Cone= The eruptive cycle of Nazko Cone 7200 years ago started with the eruption of two different progressions of fluid lava flows, an older grey basalt overlain by a younger, darker black basalt. The passive eruptions were followed by a period of explosive eruptions.Natural Resources Canada: Nazko Cone This explosive activity built three overlapping cinder cones near the end of the explosive phase of activity. The last phase of explosive activity spread tephra to the north and east of the cones. The deepest deposits near the cones are over 3 m deep and thin to less than a few centimetres only a few kilometres away, which suggests that the explosive eruptions at Nazko Cone were fairly small. However, the last eruption from Nazko Cone could have started forest fires, since there is charcoal inside the tephra layer. =Recent activity= The volcano has been dormant since the 7200 BP eruption. On October 10, 2007, a small swarm of earthquakes appeared 20 kilometres west of Nazko Cone.Chronology of Events in 2007 at Nazko Cone Most of these earthquakes were magnitude 1.0 or less; some as strong as M 3.1 or 3.2 were centered 25 kilometres below the surface. The cause of this seismic activity is believed to be the upwelling of magma because the area is not close to any faults or tectonic plate boundaries. Hazards Future eruptions from Nazko Cone are unlikely to cause many fatalities, due to the region's remoteness. There is active logging and ranching in the region, and people engaged in these activities are at some risk. Lava flows are likely to flow only a few kilometres from the volcano which could possibly start forest fires in the dry region. Any future eruption is likely to affect low flying air traffic only, since eruptions would likely be in the form of Hawaiian eruption- lava fountains that create small cinder cones and lava flows rather than voluminous ash clouds. Monitoring Nazko Cone has been an intensively monitored volcano by the Geological Survey of Canada since October 10, 2007. One of the most important tools is seismometry. About 5 seismometers were set up around Nazko Cone to enable scientists to measure the intensities and locations of hundreds of small earthquakes every day. Since then, there have been more than 1000 small earthquakes recorded. Earthquakes can begin to increase years before an eruption actually starts. Another type of seismic activity occurs in the hours preceding an eruption. So-called harmonic tremor is a continuous \\"rumble\\" which contrasts with the normal seismic activity of sudden shocks and is believed to be caused by the rapid movement of magma underground. Volcanic tremor normally indicates an imminent eruption, although it may also be caused by shallow intrusions of magma which do not reach the surface. Another important indicator of what is happening underground is the shape of the volcano. Tiltmeters measure very small changes in the profile of the volcano, and sensitive equipment measures distances between points on the volcano. As magma fills the shallow reservoirs below the summit, the mountain inflates. Recent history Nazko Cone was staked for mining its cinder and scoria in the early 1990s by the Canadian Pumice Corporation, and has since been steadily reduced to produce red industrial aggregate for landscaping. Before mining, the Nazko Cone was also a unique ecosystem. The vegetation included a complex of species. Very large old Douglas fir trees were common, growing in some of the more soil-like ash and lava. White spruce was surprisingly common, although severely stunted, whereas lodgepole pine was not. There were some shallow caves and hollows below the volcano. To the west, following the lava flow mentioned above, is a unique wetland which appears to be saturated ash. What makes it unique is the fact that normally wetlands are saturated organic material such as peat moss.

Ten matches were cancelled at the end of the 1939 English cricket season due to the German invasion of Poland on 1 September and the British government‚Äôs declaration of war against Germany on Sunday 3 September. Although eleven first-class matches were arranged during the 1945 season following the final defeat of Germany in early May, it was not until the 1946 season that normal fixtures, including the County Championship and Minor Counties Championship, could resume. In contrast with much of the First World War, it was realised in the 1940s that cricket had its part to play in terms of raising both public morale and funds for charity. Efforts were made to stage matches whenever opportunity arose, especially if a suitable number of top players could be assembled. From the summer of 1941 onwards, teams such as the British Empire Eleven toured the country raising money for war charities. At league cricket level, playing one-day matches, many competitions continued throughout the war: e.g., the Birmingham League, the Bradford League and the Lancashire League.Birley, Derek; A Social History of English Cricket, pp. 267‚Äì268 Successful wartime players included Laurie Fishlock, Eric Hollies and Eddie Paynter.Andrews, Gordon; The Datasport Book of Wartime Cricket 1940‚Äì45, pp. 57, 157, 160. 1940 In the 1940 Wisden, the cricket author H S Altham, now an Army Major, described his ‚Äúsobering experience‚Äù when he visited Lord‚Äôs the previous December. He said: :...there were sandbags everywhere, and the Long Room was stripped and bare, with its treasures safely stored beneath ground, but ... one felt that somehow it would take more than totalitarian war to put an end to cricket. Altham reflected the popular (and official) view that the game can and should be kept going whenever possible. One venue where it would not be possible was The Oval, which was commandeered in 1939 and quickly turned into a prisoner of war camp, except that no prisoners were ever interned there. The playing area became a maze of concrete posts and wire fences. Lord‚Äôs was also due for requisition but it was spared and MCC was able to stage many public schools and representative games throughout the war. A highlight in 1940 was the one-day game in which Sir PF Warner‚Äôs XI, including Len Hutton and Denis Compton (who top-scored with 73), beat a West Indies XI which included Learie Constantine and Leslie Compton (an honorary West Indian for the day). Of the more regular wartime teams, the most famous were the British Empire XI and the London Counties XI which were established in 1940. Both played one-day charity matches, mostly in the south-east and often at Lord‚Äôs. The British Empire XI was founded by Pelham Warner but featured mainly English county players. The politician Desmond Donnelly, then in the Royal Air Force, began the London Counties XI. In one match between the two, Frank Woolley came out of retirement and played against the new star batsman Denis Compton.Birley; A Social History of English Cricket p. 263. The British Empire XI played between 34 and 45 matches per season from 1940 to 1944; the London Counties XI was credited with 191 matches from 1940 to 1945.Andrews; The Datasport Book of Wartime Cricket, pp. 145‚Äì146 Although the teams were successful in raising money for charity, their main purpose was to help sustain morale. Many of the services and civil defence organisations had their own teams, some of them national and featuring first-class players.Birley; A Social History of English Cricket p. 264. County clubs encouraged their players to join the services but at the same time pleaded with their members to continue subscriptions ‚Äúas an investment for the future‚Äù. While some counties (notably Somerset and Hampshire) closed for the duration, others did arrange matches. Nottinghamshire played six matches at Trent Bridge in 1940 and Lancashire mooted a scheme for a regionalised county competition to include the minor counties, but it was not taken further. 1941 From 1941 to 1945 the University Match was played annually at Lord's as a one-day, and hence not first-class, game. Because Fenner's had not been commandeered, Cambridge had played nine matches during the 1941 season against Sussex and strong military and hospital teams and won four against a single defeat,Whitaker, Haddon (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Seventy-Eighth Edition (1942), pp. 227-228 whereas Oxford had played no cricket whatsoever due to The Parks being commandeered.Whitaker (editor); Wisden (1942), p. 235 Consequently, Cambridge were expected to and did win the match and were to win easily all but one of the subsequent one-day University Matches. Cambridge‚Äôs most famous player was John Bridger, who played after the war for Hampshire with considerable success. In public school cricket, a future champion in Trevor Bailey demonstrated his latterly-famous defensive skill for Dulwich College by scoring 851 runs in fifteen innings ‚Äì in only seven of which was he dismissed.Whitaker (editor), Wisden (1942), p. 299 Dulwich also had the best school bowler in Horace Kiddle, who took fifty wickets for 7.86 runs each but was killed in action in 1944 before World War II ended,CricketArchive; Horace Kiddle whilst future Worcestershire bowler George Chesterton of Malvern took 45 wickets for 12.88 runs each, but could not make the Wisden editors best school eleven.Whitaker (editor); Wisden (1942), p. 239 Edward Spooner, a son of famous Marlborough and Lancashire batsman Reggie, averaged 49.50 for EtonWhitaker (editor); Wisden (1942), p. 301 and was tipped for a big future, but was never to play first-class cricket at all. The British Empire XI was dominated by West Indian leg-spinner Bertie Clarke ‚Äì exempt from military service because of his profession as a doctor ‚Äì whose leg-breaks and googlies took 98 wickets for 11.40 runs apiece and was to better this record in 1942.Whitaker(editor); Wisden (1942), p. 142 In contrast, the main players for the London Counties XI were veterans, with Alf Gover their most successful bowler with 83 wickets for 9.50.Whitaker(editor); Wisden (1942), p. 155 1942 As the war grew more intense, Lord‚Äôs was still able to expand its profits, with 1942 described as ‚Äúthe best wartime season Lord‚Äôs has had‚Äù.Whitaker, Haddon (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Seventy-Ninth Edition (1943), pp. 48-51 Jack Robertson came to prominence with an innings of 102 for the Army against the Royal Navy Eddie Paynter scored 970 runs at an average of 138.50 for Keighley in the Bradford League,Andrews; The Datasport Book of Wartime Cricket, p. 159 whist Bailey took 52 wickets for Dulwich at 6.16 runs apieceNotes on 1942 season to follow up his high-class batting from the previous season. Essex veteran Jack O‚ÄôConnor scored 208 ‚Äì the only double- century in wartime cricket ‚Äì in a two-day match on 4 and 5 July against Peterborough.Whitaker (editor); Wisden (1943), p. 178 whilst Clarke surpassed his 1942 record for the Empire XI. In public school cricket, the most significant discovery was Nigel Howard of Rossall School,Whitaker (editor); Wisden (1943), pp. 265-267 who scored 456 runs at an average of 45 and took twenty-four cheap wickets,Whitaker (editor); Wisden (1943), p. 335 whilst future Derbyshire captain Donald Carr made his debut for Repton as a spin bowler. 1943 A drawn one-day match at Lord‚Äôs between an England XI and a West Indies XI featured the young Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. Bedser made his mark by taking 6/27 in the West Indies first innings. In the drawn Sir PF Warner‚Äôs XI v Royal Australian Air Force match at Lord‚Äôs, Keith Miller top- scored in the RAAF‚Äôs first innings, with 45 out of 100, as well as taking 2/20. The RAAF won a two-day match against The South at Hove by ten wickets. A strong England XI beat The Dominions by 8 runs in a two-day match at Lord‚Äôs. Les Ames made 133 in the England first innings, and Denis Compton then took 6/15 in eight overs. In their second innings, The Dominions came close to snatching an unlikely victory, with Stewie Dempster making 113. 1944 At Lord's, two one-day matches were played by an England XI against ‚ÄúWest Indies‚Äù and ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äù, England winning both matches. (These were not limited overs matches.) Jack Young, unknown before the warPreston, Hubert (editor); Wisden Cricketers‚Äô Almanack, 84th edition (1947), p. 348 but later to win two County Championships for Middlesex, took 88 wickets for London Counties XI at 7.63 runs apiece.

It was named for a Civil War colonel in the Union Army. History =Founding of Cropsey= Cropsey was laid out 8 October 1880 by Henry L. Terpening (13 April 1836 ‚Äì 11 August 1911). and Ira C. Pratt (12 January 1832 ‚Äì 14 April 1917).Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of McLean County (Chicago: Munsell, 1908) p. 902. Pratt was a native of Vermont who had been trained as a blacksmith and Wagon-maker. He came to Illinois in 1855, settling first at Morton in Tazewell County. In 1867 he purchased land in Belle Prairie Township, Livingston County, just north of Cropsey. In 1882 he began buying tile to drain his farmland and then decided to manufacture his own tile in Cropsey. In 1883 he built a large house on the west side of the town of Cropsey.Portrait and Biographical Album of McLean County, Illinois (Chapman:Brothers,1887) pp. 204-205. Terpening, whose name was sometimes spelled, Henry L. Terpenning, was a native of New York who had been a farmer in Cropsey Township. He was a justice of the peace and represented McLean County in the Illinois State Legislature in the 36th and 37th general assemblies during the early 1890s. About 1892 he moved to Vermilion County. Before the town of Cropsey was established, there had been several efforts to attract a railroad to Cropsey Township. In October 1869 the township had voted $60,000 in bonds, with an additional $15,000 to be added if a station was established in the township. The money was to have helped finance the Decatur and East St. Louis Railroad. This effort failed. This railroad passed north of the township. A second chance came in 1880 with the Clinton, Bloomington and Northeastern Railroad. A number of local people donated money and land to attract the railroad to Cropsey Township. The town of Cropsey was laid out at the same time as other new towns on this railroad including Anchor, Colfax, and Cooksville. The first trains from Kankakee came on 4 July 1880, but it was another two years before tracks were completed to Bloomington.Historical Encyclopedia, 1908, p.673. This railroad soon became part of the Illinois Central system. Cropsey Township, from which the new town took its name, was named in honor of Andrew J. Cropsey who was a Civil War officer member of the Illinois Legislature in the 1860s.Edward Callary, The Place Names of Illinois (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 2008) p. 83. =Design and Development of Cropsey= The original town of Cropsey had only about fifty lots. Southeast of the diagonal railroad was an enlarged railroad ground where its normal one hundred foot right-of-way was extended an additional seventy- five feet in width. On this side, Main Street ran parallel to the tracks with eleven lots facing the street. The depot and one grain elevator were northwest of the tracks and the early stockyard and another elevator southeast. Other lots were scattered along Yates Street, Locust Street, East Street, and Belle Prairie Street.Combined Indexed Atlas 1856‚Äì1914, McLean County, Illinois (Bloomington: McLean County Historical Society and McLean County Genealogical Society, 2006) p. 194. By 1895 only a few businesses had settled in the town. Seth R. Alford operated the Alford House Hotel and also dealt in livery and feed. H. L. Barns ran a bank, served as notary public, and also dealt in livestock and grain. E. W. Crum had a blacksmith and wheelwright shop and sold drain tile. There were two other stores. Meeker brothers handled groceries, dry goods and hardware. L. W. Alford and Brother sold dry goods, notions, hats, caps, boots, shoes and queensware; they also repaired harnesses. Most of these businesses faced Main Street Combined Atlas, 2006, p. 94. Since that time Cropsey has remained a very small place.

Its sub-title was A Play for Imaginative Theatre. It is a long theo-philosophical meditation with more than a hundred actors making up a masked chorus. In theatrical format, Lazarus Laughed appears to be a Greek tragedy. But the underlying message is similar to the mystery plays from the Middle Ages. O'Neill's play, The Great God Brown, can be considered as an introduction to this play.Winther, Sophus Keith, \\"Eugene O'Neill: A Critical Study\\", cf. chapter IV, \\"The Pagan Way of Life\\", pp. 95-113.  Story  The story features characters and events following the raising of Lazarus of Bethany from the dead by Jesus. As Lazarus is the first man to return from the realm of the dead, the crowd reacts intently to his words. Over and over again he declares to them that there is no death ‚Äì only God‚Äôs eternal laughter. The more Lazarus laughs, the younger and stronger he becomes. The more he laughs, the older and weaker his wife Miriam (who trusts him but does not understand his laughter) becomes. The subsequent scenes portray a series of tests (perhaps similar to those trials of Job) by the Jews, Romans and Greeks to try the faith of Lazarus. Consequently, members of his family are taken from him, but Lazarus continues always to laugh, even as Miriam is poisoned by the Roman Emperor Tiberius and continuing on to the very end, when Tiberius burns him at the stake.  Acts and Scenes  *Act One, Scenes One and Two take place in Bethany. *Act Two, Scene One takes place in Athens. Scene Two is in Rome. *Act Three, Scenes One and Two are in Tiberius' palace. *Act Four, Scene One is still in Tiberius' palace. Scene Two is in the interior of a Roman theatre.  Production history  Since the play was first published, it has hardly ever been produced in major theatre venues. The Pasadena Community Playhouse (Pasadena Community Players) staged the only major production of it, and its world premiere, in 1928, with 151 actors and 420 roles, including Irving Pichel as the title character.Review of \\"Lazarus Laughed\\" , Pasadena Community Playhouse, April 9, 1928 in Billboard, April 21, 1928, by H.O.

Geographic range This subspecies, S. m. barbouri, is found in the United States from extreme southern South Carolina through southern Georgia, all of Florida, west through southern Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. The type locality listed is \\"Royal Palm Hammock, 12 miles west of Homestead, Dade County, Florida\\" (USA). Reproduction Adult females of S. m. barbouri give birth to between 5 and 7 young at a time. In a brood of 8 from Silver Springs, Marion County, Florida, each neonate measured between in total length. Venom Wright and Wright (1957) include excerpts from Allen (1938) that describe how an assistant was bitten by S. m. barbouri in the Everglades and suffered severe pain and swelling for about 24 hours despite treatment. Allen also quotes some statistics: according to the Florida Reptile Institute, 28 people were bitten by this subspecies in Florida between 1935 and 1937 with no deaths. Brown (1973) gives an average venom yield of 18 mg (dried venom) (Klauber, 1956) and values of 2.8,12.6 mg/kg IV, 6.0,6.8 mg/kg IP and 24.2 mg/kg SC for toxicity.Brown JH (1973). Toxicology and Pharmacology of Venoms from Poisonous Snakes. Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas. 184 pp. LCCCN 73-229. . The venom contain disintegrins, notably barbourin which has a KGD (Lys-Gly-Asp) amino acid motif rather than the more common RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif. This single amino acid alteration gives barbourin higher binding affinity for the fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.Markland FS (1998). \\"Snake Venoms and the Hemostatic System\\". Toxicon 36: 1749-1800. This receptor plays an important role in the aggregation of platelets, which then leads to the formation of a blood clot - competitive inhibition of this receptor by barbourin will decrease platelet aggregation, and thus reduce clotting.Cahill M, Mistry R, Barnett DB (1992). \\"The human platelet fibrinogen receptor: clinical and therapeutic significance\\".

Hjert√©n is considered a major figure in Swedish modernism. Periodically she was highly productive and participated in 106 exhibitions. She worked as an artist for 30 years before dying of complications from a botched lobotomy for schizophrenia. Biography  Sigrid Hjert√©n, by Isaac Gr√ºnewald. Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, Sweden Sigrid Hjert√©n was born in Sundsvall in 1885. She studied at the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm and graduated as a drawing teacher. At a studio party in 1909, Hjert√©n met her future husband, twenty-year-old Isaac Gr√ºnewald, who had already studied one year with Henri Matisse in Paris. Gr√ºnewald convinced her that she would do herself more justice as a painter. Later that year she went to Matisse's art school as well. She was \\"said to have been Matisse's favorite pupil because of her fine sense of color.\\" =1910s = As she studied under Henri Matisse in Paris, she was impressed by the way he and Paul C√©zanne dealt with colour. This shows in her painting in contrasting colour fields and simplified contours, her way of achieving the greatest possible expressiveness. Her aesthetic intentions had primarily to do with colour, and in her later works from the 1930s she spoke of colours in terms such as cold yellow. Hjert√©n strove to find forms and colours that could convey her emotions. In that respect her work is more closely related to the German Expressionists, such as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, than to the French painters, with their graceful play of lines. After a year and a half she returned to Sweden. In 1912 Sigrid Hjert√©n participated in a group show in Stockholm. It was her debut exhibition as a painter. In the following ten years she took part in many exhibitions both in Sweden and abroad, among other places in Berlin in 1915, where she was well received. Sigrid Hjert√©n was also represented at the Expressionist Exhibition at the Liljevalch's konsthall in Stockholm in 1918, together with two other artists. However, the contemporary critics were not enthusiastic about her art. In Hjert√©n's art, where she greatly exposes herself, one notices different stages of development. The influence of Matisse is perhaps mostly discernible in the 1910s. During this decade, Hjert√©n created many paintings with indoor pictures and views from her home, first at Kornhamnstorg Square and later at Katarinav√§gen Street, in Stockholm. Her husband Isaac Gr√ºnewald and her son Iv√†n, as well as Sigrid herself, are often depicted in scenes that embrace various sorts of conflicts. At this time Sigrid Hjert√©n got acquainted with and inspired by the art made by Ernst Josephson during his illness. =Atelj√©interior= Atelj√©interi√∂r 1916 - One of Sigrid Hjert√©ns most iconic works. Atelj√©interi√∂r (Studio interior) from 1916 shows how radical Hjert√©n was for her time. The painting describes the roles she played as artist, woman, and mother: different identities in different worlds. Hjert√©n sits on the sofa between two artists ‚Äì her husband, Isaac Gr√ºnewald, and, perhaps, Einar Jolin ‚Äì who talk to each other over her head. Her large blue eyes stare into the distance. In the foreground a woman dressed in black ‚Äì a sophisticated alter ego ‚Äì leans against a male figure who might be the artist Nils Dardel. Her son Iv√†n crawls out of the right-hand corner. In the background we glimpse one of Hjert√©n's paintings of the period, Zigenarkvinna (Gypsy woman). Atelj√©interior and Den r√∂da rullgardinen (The Red Blind), from 1916, are daring paintings that have given rise in recent years to new interpretations based on contemporary gender studies and reveal information about the artist's private life. =1920s = Between 1920 and 1932, Sigrid Hjert√©n and her family lived in Paris, and made many excursions to the French countryside and the Italian Riviera for painting. This was a relatively harmonious era in Hjert√©n's art, but her exhibits were very limited in this period. Her husband often visited Stockholm where he had a brilliant career. In the late 1920s Hjert√©n increasingly suffered from various psychosomatic ailments, and she complained of loneliness. As time passed, an increasing tension can be seen in her art that successively rises and reaches its height immediately before the disease forces Sigrid Hjert√©n to cease as an artist. In the late 1920s, while she was very isolated in France, colder and darker colours began to appear in her paintings. Recurring diagonal strokes helped to give the paintings a tense impression. During the 1930s Hjert√©n painted innovative paintings which are characterized by menacing tones, growing storm clouds, and feelings of abandonment. =1930s= In 1932, Sigrid Hjert√©n decided to return to Stockholm. But during packing she collapsed. She got to Sweden and was temporarily taken to the psychiatric hospital of Beckomberga with symptoms of schizophrenia. She recovered periodically, and in the following two years (1932‚Äì34) Hjert√©n's artistry culminated in a crescendo, where, like one possessed, she made pictures that expressed strongly loaded feelings. She devoted herself to intensive painting, creating one picture a day, the picture-book of her life, according to an interview in the Swedish art magazine Paletten. Some paintings radiate horror while others give a warm and harmonious impression. During 1934, she traveled with her family in the south of Europe, where she painted. Hjert√©n eventually made her name as an artist among the critics in 1935, when she exhibited with Isaac in Gothenburg. Yet, most contemporary critics had a negative and even scornful attitude towards Hjert√©n's works of art, and many of them wrote deeply offensive reviews. Among other things, her paintings were called idiocy, humbug, horrors and products of handicap. She won public recognition only in 1936, when she had a well- received solo exhibition at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. \\"After viewing the nearly 500 works in her 1936 retrospective, the critics were unanimous: the exhibition was hailed as one of the most remarkable of the season and Sigrid Hjerten was honored as one of Sweden's greatest and most original modern artists. Thus, she gained recognition‚Äîbut too late.\\" Isaac, who had many mistresses over the years, divorced Sigrid and remarried. Both Isaac and his new wife later died in a flying accident in 1946. In the late 30s, Sigrid suffered from escalating mental illness, diagnosed with schizophrenia, and was permanently hospitalised at Beckomberga Psychiatric Hospital in Stockholm, where she remained for the rest of her life. After 1938 her artistic output dwindled. Following a botched lobotomy, she died in Stockholm in 1948. =Legacy= Sigrid Hjert√©n's total production amounted to slightly more than 500 paintings, together with sketches, water-colours and drawings. Hjert√©n had to fight the prejudices of her time throughout her career. Her paintings seem extremely personal for the era in which they were made, when issues of colour and form were uppermost in artists' minds. Her interest in humankind was often manifested in dramatic, even theatrical compositions, while her approach to colour was emotional as well as theoretical.

The U.S. government pacifies the populace by broadcasting game shows where convicted criminals fight for their lives, including the gladiator-style The Running Man, hosted by the ruthless Damon Killian, where \\"runners\\" attempt to evade \\"stalkers,\\" armed mercenaries, around a large arena, and near-certain death for a chance to be pardoned by the state. In 2019, Ben Richards, a police helicopter pilot framed for a massacre during a food riot in Bakersfield, California, escapes from a labor camp with two resistance fighters, Harold Weiss and William Laughlin, and finds refuge at a resistance camp headed by their leader, Mic. Instead of joining the resistance (who detest Richards at first due to his previous ties with the police), Richards seeks shelter at his brother's apartment. He finds it is now occupied by Amber Mendez, a struggling and frustrated composer for ICS, the network that broadcasts The Running Man. Richards, after discovering she has been secretly making music (which is illegal by government law) asks Mendez about the whereabouts of his brother, and she says that he was taken for \\"re-education.\\" Blackmailing and taking Amber hostage, Richards attempts to flee to Hawaii, but she alerts airport security and Richards is captured and taken to ICS before the police can arrest him. There, Killian coerces him into participating in The Running Man in exchange for Laughlin and Weiss's safety. Ben learns that Killian had enrolled them as runners anyway and swears revenge, which Killian brushes off. As the game begins, Richards and his friends are sent into the game zone, an abandoned part of Los Angeles devastated by a prior earthquake, where they are attacked by the first stalker, Subzero. They fight back and Richards garrotes Subzero to death with barbed wire ‚Äì the first time a stalker has ever died on the show. Laughlin and Weiss search for the network's uplink facilities, which they realize are in the game zone. Amber sees a falsified news report on Richards' capture and, suspicious of the media's veracity, does some investigating. After learning that footage of the massacre was doctored to incriminate Richards, she is captured by her ICS colleagues and sent into the game zone where she meets up with Richards and his comrades. The runners split up into groups of two, then each pair is pursued by a different stalker, Buzzsaw, and Dynamo. Buzzsaw mortally wounds Laughlin, but Richards slays Buzzsaw by bisecting him with his own chainsaw. Weiss and Amber locate the uplink and learn the access codes, but Dynamo finds them and kills Weiss by electrocution. Amber's screams lead Richards to her, and as the two evade Dynamo, the stalker's buggy flips, trapping him inside. Refusing to kill a helpless opponent, Richards leaves Dynamo alive to jeers from the audience. He and Amber then return to Laughlin, who before dying, reveals that the resistance has a hideout within the game zone and begs Richards to complete their mission for them. Back at ICS, Killian sees Richards' popularity growing, with many viewers rooting for him to win instead of the stalkers. Off-camera, Killian offers Richards a job as a stalker; but when Richards refuses, Killian sends in the next stalker, Fireball. Fireball chases them into an abandoned factory, where Amber discovers the charred and decomposing corpses of the previous seasons' \\"winners,\\" realizing that their victory was faked and they were killed and dumped inside the game zone. Fireball goes after Amber, but Richards rescues her and kills him by sabotaging his flamethrower and lighting the resulting puddle of fuel. Frustrated and running out of options, Killian calls upon Captain Freedom, a retired stalker, to kill them. However, when Freedom refuses, the network creates digital body doubles of Freedom, Richards, and Amber, which are then used to fake Richards' and Amber's deaths on screen. In the game zone, Richards and Amber are found by Mic and taken to the resistance's hideout, where they learn of their supposed deaths. Using the access codes, the rebels get into ICS' control room, broadcasting footage that exonerates Richards and reveals the truth about the game's previous contestants. As Richards heads to the main studio floor, shocking the audience who had watched him supposedly die, Amber is ambushed by Dynamo. She is able to set off a sprinkler above his head, causing his weapons to short circuit and electrocute him to death. Richards confronts Killian, who begs for his life, saying he created the show to appease the people's love of television and televised violence. In response, Richards decides to give the audience what they want, sending Killian into the game zone in a rocket sled. Without the protective netting which was removed by the resistance when they made their assault, the sled hits a Cadre Cola billboard bearing Killian's likeness and explodes, killing him to the delight of the audience. Richards and Amber kiss and then walk out of the studio hand in hand. TV viewers cheer their victory, then screens across America go black, displaying the message PLEASE STAND BY. Cast Production Christopher Reeve was once attached to play Ben Richards. In a 2015 interview about the film, Paul Michael Glaser says that he was originally approached to direct the film but declined because he felt that the pre-production period was insufficient. Director Andrew Davis was hired instead but fired after two weeks because the production was by that time behind schedule by one week. Schwarzenegger has stated this was a \\"terrible decision\\", as Glaser \\"shot the movie like it was a television show, losing all the deeper themes\\", and believes this hurt the film. Pop star Paula Abdul choreographed the pre-show dance sequences. This was her second film credit, though she had already choreographed four Janet Jackson videos, as well as videos by ZZ Top, Duran Duran, and Debbie Gibson. The music used for the pre-show entertainment was composed by Jackie Jackson and was dubbed \\"Paula's Theme\\" in her honor. Music =Soundtrack= The film's soundtrack was composed by Harold Faltermeyer and includes music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Richard Wagner, Jackie Jackson, Glen Barbee and John Parr, who performed the main theme of the film called \\"Restless Heart (Running Away With You)\\", written and produced by Faltermeyer and played during the final scene and end-credits.  Release  =Home media= Artisan Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2002, and again in 2004. The 2004 release includes new special features, audio commentaries and sound mix. In 2010, Lionsgate released the film on Blu-ray. Olive Films (under licence from Paramount, who owns the film due to having the Taft Pictures library) made a second Blu-Ray release on February 19, 2013. Paramount also owns the TV and streaming rights. Reception =Box office= In The Running Mans opening weekend, it was released in 1,692 theaters and grossed $8,117,465. The film's total domestic gross was $38,122,105. =Critical response= Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, complaining that \\"all the action scenes are versions of the same scenario\\", but praised Dawson's performance, stating that he \\"has at last found the role he was born to play.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"has the manners and gadgetry of a sci-fi adventure film, but is, at heart, an engagingly mean, cruel, nasty, funny send-up of television. It's not quite Network, but then it also doesn't take itself too seriously.\\"Canby, Vincent (November 13, 1987). \\"Film: Schwarzenegger In 'The Running Man'\\". The New York Times. C10. Variety wrote that the film \\"coarsens the star's hitherto winning formula\\" and \\"works only on a pure action level,\\" calling the satire \\"paperthin and constantly contradicted by the film wallowing in the sort of mindless violence for the roller derby-addicted masses it is supposedly criticizing.\\"\\"Film Review: The Running Man\\". Variety. November 11, 1987. 12. Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four and wrote, \\"It's a format all right, but it may be too much of a format for a feature-length film. With Arnold Schwarzenegger, a former state security officer framed as the perpetrator of a notorious public massacre, sitting in as victim-of-the-week, The Running Man has little to do but run through the game's four stages.\\"Kehr, Dave (November 13, 1987). \\"'Running Man' retreads a worn-out story\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 7, Page B, D. Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times declared, \\"The Running Man is, by far, Schwarzenegger's best vehicle since The Terminator‚Äînot such high praise if you recall what came in between‚Äîand it suggests that his Frank Frazetta frame shows best in these fantasy sci-fi settings ... For the right audience, it'll be fun. It's for action fans with a taste for something off the beaten track‚Äîbut not too far.\\"Wilmington, Michael (November 13, 1987). \\"'Running Man': A Show of Satire and Savagery\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 10-11. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \\"a fast-paced, futuristic pur√©e of Beat the Clock, Max Headroom, professional wrestling and The Most Dangerous Game. Pumped and primed for self-parody, the burly star proves as funny as he is ferocious in this tough guy's commentary on America's preoccupation with violence and game shows.\\"Kempley, Rita (November 13, 1987). \\"'Running': Arnold Pumps Irony\\". The Washington Post. D1. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 64% based on reviews from 42 critics, with an average rating of 5.57/10. The site's critical consensus states, \\"The Running Man is winking sci-fi satire with ridiculous clothes and workmanlike direction\\". On Metacritic the film holds a score of 45 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. On the film's 30th anniversary in 2017, The Running Man was cited by a BBC journalist as having made accurate predictions about life in 2017, including an economic collapse, and offering an enduring critique of \\"American television culture\\". The film's writer Steven de Souza himself reinforced these predictions in a podcast interview with Vice Magazines Motherboard section. Reed Tucker of the New York Post said in 2019 that the film \\"correctly predicted ... the widening gap between the rich and poor\\", depicting homeless shantytowns and skyscrapers for the wealthy resembling the real New York City and Los Angeles, and societal obsession with reality TV. De Souza said one of the producers of American Gladiators sold his show with clips from The Running Man, telling the network \\"We‚Äôre doing exactly this ‚Äî except the murdering part\\". Stephen King isn't a fan of The Running Man film because how little it retains from the novel it's based on. Another factor in King's dislike of The Running Man is the casting of Schwarzenegger in the lead.Kennedy, Michael: Why Stephen King Disliked Arnold Schwarzenegger's Running Man Movie. Screenrant, July 26, 2020. Other media =Video game= In 1989, a video game based on the film was released for the MSX, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, and Atari ST. The game was developed by Emerald Software and published by Grandslam Entertainments. The 1990 video game Smash TV was inspired by The Running Man. =Remake= A modern remake of the film has been mooted.

The ski area extends from in elevation, and due to its reliable snow elevation, the typical ski season starts in November and goes to late April. Baqueira is the largest and most visited winter resort in Spain. Popular amongst the Royal family and the Spanish aristocracy, and affluent Spaniards and French, The Telegraph asks if Baqueira could be \\"the world's finest ski resort?\\".  Resort  Baqueira- Beret is the largest and most visited winter resort in Spain, with of marked pistes, of marked off-piste, and of cross-country ski and of ski area. It is located in the highest part of the Aran Valley (Naut Aran), and Pallars Sobir√† (Valls d'√Äneu). It has long and wide ski runs, some through trees. It is divided into three different zones, Baqueira, Beret and Bonaigua. Due to its westerly aspect and position on the northern side of the Pyrenees, and consequent Atlantic climate, the resort of Baqueira-Beret has a good snow record throughout the winter. In addition, there is more than of vertical drop and an extensive skiable zone. Much of the region of the Aran Valley and √Äneu Valley is made up of over 50 small rural populations, each one with stone and wood houses and ancient Romanesque churches. The resort was founded 60 years ago on the initiative of the local authorities in the Aran Valley. A group of people commanded by Jorge Jordana Pozas, Jes√∫s Serra Santamans and Luis Arias (after whom a piste was named after he died in a dramatic accident) founded the ski resort in the municipality of Naut Aran due to the good snow conditions found there.

The game was first developed by Pipe Dream and released for the Game Boy Color in 2000, while versions for different platforms were released in subsequent years. Most versions were developed by Software Creations with the exception of the Game Boy Advance version, which was developed by Crawfish Interactive, and the arcade version, which was developed by Chicago Gaming. The GBC version received negative reviews and the PlayStation version received mixed to positive reviews while the GBA port received positive reviews. Plot Various Nickelodeon characters each receive a letter invitation to compete in a Grand Prix for the top prize, the Krusty Krab Big Bun Award. The host of the competition, also the individual who sent the invitations, is an unknown, unseen driver of a sleek, black car with a tinted dome window simply dubbed as the Mystery Rider, which the participating racers are challenged to beat, as well as each other. Upon arriving and being announced by the Race Announcer, the Mystery Rider and other Nicktoons speed off to begin their first race. Once the player ultimately completes the game and wins the final Cup to obtain the Krusty Krab Big Bun Award, their playable Nicktoon receives a year supply of Krabby Patties as it is hitched to their go-kart. The Mystery Rider arrives in his cart and is revealed to be Sheldon J. Plankton. It stated by the Announcer that Plankton created the entire series of races as a plan to obtain the Krabby Patty secret formula. The winning racer then rides off into the sunset with their Krabby Patties and the credits begin to play. Gameplay Nicktoons Racing focuses on engaging players in go-kart racing through various Nicktoons-themed circuit tracks in a variety of different modes, similar to the Mario Kart series. The game features a wide selection of playable characters from various 1990's Nicktoons. The game offers an Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty for the gameplay (with the game allowing you to unlock subsequently harder modes by accomplishing the last difficulty fully in Cups). The game also has a multiplayer option and can be played with a second player via split-screen utilization (multiplayer is available to all versions of the game except the Game Boy Color). Each track features power-up presents that allow the player to gain advantages against their fellow racers in the form of various weapons and obstructions, as well as small orbs that a racer can collect and utilize to get a short-term speed boost. Each track also contains a variety of alternate routes and shortcuts that allow the various racers to shorten their laps (the harder the difficulty selected by the player, the more likely the NPCs are to utilize the shortcuts). ;Cups The primary mode for the racing gameplay. This mode allows the player(s) to take control of one of the Nicktoon racers and compete in a series of 4 races in the form of a Cup. There are 3 Cups and the second and third have to be unlocked by beating the previous Cup series. This is the mode required to beat the game's main story, unlock all the tracks for other modes of play, unlock The Mystery Rider as a playable kart, and the bonus minigames. ;Time Trial (Single Player only) A mode that can be used by the player to test their speed ability on each unlocked track. After finishing your first lap, a ghost racer will appear and perform the lap as the player did it on previous lap. ;Race for Fun (Single Player only) A mode that allows the player(s) to race a single track without competing in a Cup. The player progressively earns random collectible rewards for a trophy shelf the more races they participate at in a row and win. ;Verses (Multiplayer only) A mode that is generally the same as Race for Fun, but for two players instead. This mode does not feature collectibles. ;Relay A mode that allows the player(s) to pick three characters and race them in a 3-lap relay where each character performs one lap before tagging in the next racer.

It was especially visible in conjunction with the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. The mission of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command was to achieve the fullest possible accounting of all Americans missing as a result of the nation's past conflicts. The motto of JPAC was \\"Until they are home\\". On 30 January 2015, JPAC was officially deactivated by the Department of Defense. The Defense Department's efforts at reform followed a series of embarrassing scandals and damning revelations in reports and testimony before Congress starting in 2013 concerning failures in the effort to identify missing war dead. JPAC, the Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO), and certain functions of the U.S. Air Force's Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory, were all merged into the new Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Structure JPAC was a standing direct reporting unit within the United States Pacific Command. Its headquarters were located at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. JPAC maintained three permanent overseas detachments, two local detachments, the Annex, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, and the European Liaison Office located on Miesau Army Depot, Germany; all devoted to the ongoing tasks of POW/MIA accounting. Each detachment was under the command of a field grade officer of the United States armed forces. * Detachment 1 ‚Äì Bangkok, Thailand (American Embassy in Thailand) * Detachment 2 ‚Äì Hanoi, Vietnam * Detachment 3 ‚Äì Vientiane, Laos * Investigation and Recovery Group ‚Äì Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Oahu, Hawaii; this group was the home base of the recovery teams when they were not deployed * HQ ‚Äì Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia. * JPAC Annex - Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska; the JCA performed routine anthropological and odontological analysis in order to identify unaccounted-for service members. * European Liaison Office - Miesau Army Depot, Germany; helped facilitate the planning, execution, logistical and administrative support for all JPAC operations in the European Command area of responsibility. * The laboratory portion of JPAC referred to as the Central Identification Laboratory (CIL). History *1973: The DOD established the Central Identification Laboratory‚ÄìThailand to coordinate POW/MIA recovery efforts in Southeast Asia. *1976: The DOD established the Central Identification Laboratory‚ÄìHawaii to search for, recover, and identify missing Americans from all previous conflicts. *1992: The Joint Task Force‚ÄìFull Accounting (JTF-FA) was established to focus on achieving the fullest possible accounting of American missing from the Vietnam War. *2002: DOD determined that POW/MIA recovery efforts would be best served by combining the two Central Identification Laboratories and the Joint Task Force. *1 October 2003: The Joint POW/MIA Accounting command was established under the auspices of the Commander, Pacific Command (CDRUSPACOM). Operations JPAC's operations were divided into four areas: Analysis and Investigation, Recovery, Identification, and Closure. =Analysis and investigation= JPAC investigated leads concerning Americans who were killed in action but were never brought home. This process involved close coordination with other U.S. agencies involved in the POW/MIA issue. JPAC carried out technical negotiations and talks with representatives of foreign governments around the world in order to ensure positive in-country conditions were maintained or created for JPAC investigative and recovery operations wherever JPAC teams deployed in the world. If enough evidence was found, a site was recommended for recovery. =Recovery= United Nations Command (UNC) honor guard members receive remains from Korean People's Army soldiers at the Joint Security Area Nov 6,1998 Laotians hired to assist U.S. troops sift then move tons of dirt on a mountain near Xepon, Laos (July 2004). This particular mission involved searching for the human remains of two F-4 Phantom crewmen who crashed after a bombing run over Vietnam. JPAC had 18 Recovery Teams whose members traveled throughout the world to recover missing from past wars. A typical recovery team was made up of 10 to 14 people, led by a team leader and a forensic anthropologist. Other members of the team typically included a team sergeant, linguist, medic, life support technician, forensic photographer, RF systems communications technician/operator and an explosive ordnance disposal technician. Additional experts were added to the mission as needed, such as mountaineering specialists or divers. The team carefully excavates the site and screens the soil to locate all possible remains and artifacts. In the case of an airplane crash, a recovery site may be quite large. Once the recovery effort was completed, the team returned to Hawaii. All remains and artifacts found during the recovery operation were then transported from a U.S. military plane or private airline to JPAC's Central Identification Laboratory where identification took an average of 18 months; often cited statistics of 11 years include materials that were severely commingled (intentionally) from turnovers from the Korean People's Army in the mid-1990s. These materials only recently began to be identified used several different DNA techniques. =Identification= Upon arrival at the laboratory, all remains and artifacts recovered from a site were signed over to the custody of the CIL and stored in a secure area. Forensic anthropologists carefully analyze all remains and artifacts to determine the sex, race, age at death, and stature of the individual. Anthropologists also analyzed trauma caused at or near the time of death and pathological conditions of bone such as arthritis or previous healed breaks. Lab scientists used a variety of techniques to establish the identification of missing Americans, including analysis of skeletal and dental remains, sampling mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and analyzing material evidence, personal effects, aviation life-support equipment (gear used by aircrew: helmets, oxygen masks, harnesses, etc.), or other military equipment. Often, recovered military and personal equipment artifacts were forwarded to the USAF Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory (LSEL, located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, OH), for advanced scientific and historical analysis. The LSEL (a highly unique scientific facility within the US and the world) was singularly qualified to scientifically study recovered military equipment artifacts and determine critical forensic aspects, to include, but not limited to: number of unaccounted for personnel represented at the loss site (i.e. 2 aviators), branch of military service represented (i.e. Navy), vehicle type represented (i.e. F-4 aircraft type), time frame represented (i.e. c. 1967), and represented levels of non-survivability or survivability (i.e. any evidence of fatal/non-fatal status). Frequently, the LSEL was able to provide crucial case determinations (through analysis of recovered equipment artifacts) when other critical evidence (such as human remains: bone or teeth) was not recovered or available, and/or does not yield any substantial conclusions through testing (i.e. DNA testing). =Closure= The recovery and identification process may take years to complete. The average identification time by the JPAC CIL was 18 months, excluding a vast amount of commingled remains turned over by North Korea, after remains arrived in the laboratory. In addition to the factors previously mentioned, each separate line of evidence was examined at the CIL (bones, teeth, and material evidence) and correlated with all historical evidence. All reports underwent a thorough peer review process that included an external review by independent experts. Additionally, if mtDNA was part of the process, the search for family reference samples for mtDNA comparison added a significant amount of time to the identification process because building a DNA database was not the purview of JPAC. Completed cases were forwarded to the appropriate service Mortuary Affairs office, whose members personally notified next-of-kin family members. Ongoing efforts Navy Rear Adm. Donna Crisp, commander, Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, talks with Vanuatu President Kalkot Mataskelekele at a repatriation ceremony in 2009. JPAC conducted a number of missions each year in its ongoing efforts. The missions per year for individuals missing for each war: *Korean War: 5 missions *Vietnam War (including Southeast Asia): 10 missions *World War II and the Cold War: 10 missions In 2007 a JPAC team led by Maj. Sean Stinchon visited I≈ç-t≈ç (formerly Iwo Jima) to hunt for the remains of Marine Sergeant Bill Genaust. He was the Marine combat photographer (motion picture cameraman) who was standing next to Joe Rosenthal, who filmed the Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima during the World War II invasion of the island. The team identified two possible cave entrances that may contain Genaust's remains. The JPAC team hopes to return and properly search the tunnels to possibly locate the remains of Sergeant Genaust, and those of other unaccounted for Marines. 2013 evaluation, reports, and investigations into JPAC An internal JPAC report, obtained by the Associated Press in July 2013, cited JPAC's management as being inept, mismanaged, and wasteful, to the extent that it could worsen from \\"dysfunction to total failure\\". In the Associated Press story's words, the report says \\"the decades-old pursuit of bones and other MIA evidence is sluggish, often duplicative and subjected to too little scientific rigor\\". The report notes that the JPAC Command is \\"woefully inept and even corrupt\\". The report notes that in recent years the process by which the JPAC Laboratory field recovery teams gathers bones and other material useful for identifications has \\"collapsed\\" and is now \\"acutely dysfunctional.\\" The report concludes that absent prompt and significant change, \\"the descent from dysfunction to total failure ‚Ä¶ is inevitable.\\" It accused the Command of maintaining inadequate databases of missing personnel, relying on unreliable maps, wasting money on unnecessary and useless travel and drastically failing to achieve targets set by the U.S. Congress. It said the organization paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to North Korea to \\"recover\\" the remains of fallen U.S. servicemen whose bodies had been planted on former battlefields, and even used as laboratory skeletons. In the report it was stated that the average length of time for the JPAC laboratory to identify casualties increased from slightly over 4 years in 2005 to 11 years in 2011 for each set of remains that are recovered. A contrary viewpoint, expressed by author Wil S. Hylton, holds that while the command has suffered from bureaucratic tendencies, \\"it is flat-out wrong to dismiss the work of JPAC as a failure. For every instance in which the unit moves more slowly than it could, there are many cases where JPAC field teams have delivered answers to a family that would otherwise be lost forever.\\" NBC News also revealed during 2013 that, for years, the U.S. government has been fabricating phony \\"arrival ceremonies\\" during which the honored dead soldiers from the former battlefields were seemingly transported to their homeland by a cargo plane, but were actually not in existence at all. In addition, being towed into adequate positions, the planes used in the ceremonies often could not fly. This was confirmed by both the Department of Defense and the JPAC team with the explanations that \\"part of the ceremony involves symbolically transferring the recovered remains from an aircraft\\" and \\"static aircraft are used for the ceremonies\\". Multiple government investigations into JPAC were initiated in 2013, including ongoing Congressional hearings in both the House and Senate. The POW/MIA effort by JPAC and a handful of agencies around the country, was fragmented, overlapped and hampered by inter-agency disputes, a July 2013 Government Accountability Office report said. In February 2014, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed the merging of JPAC and the Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO), as well as certain functions of the U.S. Air Force's Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory, into a single, more accountable agency. In October 2014, a report by the DoD inspector general said poor leadership and a hostile work environment at JPAC could continue to plague the mission. The last commander of JPAC, Major General Kelly McKeague, was demoted to deputy commander and replaced by Rear Admiral Mike Franken. The JPAC Scientific Director, Thomas Holland, was replaced by Captain Edward Reedy. On 30 January 2015, the merger into the new Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency became official, and JPAC ceased to be.

Types Simple example of stone alignment, a stone row =Large scale alignments= The alignment of features on a site within or across several archaeological phases many times is an indication of a larger topology to the formation of features relating to activity in the archaeological record. Structures buildings and liner features such as ditches can all have common alignments that relate to a feature that is not exposed during excavation or is off-site. An example would be that a road has biased the alignment of features some way back from the actual road side. Another example will be contours or water courses which may be buried or obscure. =Vertical alignments= Vertical alignments may demonstrate evolution of long term land use throughout time. Examples: roads and structures built upon earlier roads or other structures. Uses Grave alignment is used to infer religious beliefs (e.g. Christianity). The change in astronomical alignments over time may be used to infer dates of construction of structures with supposed astronomical significance, or vice versa. =Potential errors= Chance alignments may mislead; the number of potential astronomical alignment targets over time is large; statistical significance can be used when examining groups of alignments. Ley lines The landscape features known as Ley lines were discovered by Alfred Watkins in the 1920s, based on apparent co-linearity of features, who inferred an ancient system of surveying landmarks. The idea was rejected by archaeologists, and the line associations have been shown to be not generally statistically significant.

It tells the story of a lonely and secretive Italian businessman living in a Swiss hotel. The film competed at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It won five David di Donatello awards including Best Film, Best Director and Best Actor. It was also the first film to achieve widespread critical acclaim for Sorrentino.  Plot  Titta Di Girolamo is a middle-aged loner who has spent the last eight years living in an upmarket hotel in Lugano, Switzerland. Every day he puts on his suit and wanders around, avoiding contact with people. In the morning, he solves the chess puzzles in the paper and in the evening he plays Grabber with a bankrupt aristocratic couple who are marooned in the hotel they used to own. Occasionally, he rings his family in Italy but his wife is always reluctant to talk, and his grown-up children despise him. He develops feelings for Sofia, the beautiful and stylish waitress at the bar of the hotel but he refuses to speak to her because, in his shyness, he fears that love would complicate his monotone but quiet life. The reasons behind Titta's strange existence gradually become apparent. Eight years ago, it is revealed, Titta was a broker who invested large sums of money. One day, he invested 250 billion Italian liras on behalf of Cosa Nostra, losing 220 billions in a few hours. By way of punishment, Titta was forced to live for the rest of his life as a mafia pawn, making regular deliveries of suitcases full of money to a Swiss bank. Titta's other secret is that he is a heroin user. Every Wednesday at ten a.m., he goes up to his hotel room and injects himself with the drug. One day, things start to happen: Titta's gregarious younger stepbrother turns up. He encourages Titta to engage with Sofia more. Later, two Mafia men suddenly arrive in his hotel room, which they intend to use as a base in order to carry out an assassination. As the two gangsters leave, they notice the suitcase containing the money that Titta must deliver that week. Sofia and Titta begin an awkward relationship which is romantic but not sexual. They go shopping together, and Titta buys her some shoes. Meanwhile, during Titta's trip to the bank that week, the bank staff counting the money by hand discover that there is $100,000 missing. Titta is already aware of this, but calmly pretends to be disgusted at their \\"mistake\\" and asks to close his account. His bluff achieves the intended result: in order to avoid offending him, and partly out of fear of the Mafia, the bank staff pretend that they miscounted, and so his theft goes unreported. It eventually turns out that Titta has stolen the money in order to buy an expensive car for Sofia. She is initially appalled by this gift, as she feels she does not know him well enough, but later comes up to his room to apologise and to try to discover more about him. Titta reveals all his secrets to her, and Sofia is so touched that she offers to celebrate his 50th birthday with him on the following evening. He accepts. The next day, the two Mafia assassins return and steal that week's suitcase. Titta panics and immediately telephones his Mafia contact, Pippo, who tells him to fly to Southern Italy that day to explain, but Titta says he will arrive in two days because he has an appointment to keep. However, when Sofia fails to turn up to celebrate his birthday, a despondent Titta, thinking that no-one loves him, leaves for the airport early. In reality, Sofia does not turn up because she has been in a car crash, and her ambulance passes Titta's car on the way out of town. Arriving at his destination, Titta is taken to a nearby hotel and, after waiting in a guestroom, is interrogated by the boss. Titta explains that he has recovered the money [in a flashback we see that when the money was initially stolen by the two men, Titta regained his composure, grabbed his gun and switched off the power for the elevator, forcing them to use the stairs as a getaway. This slowed them down, and Titta was able to use the lift himself to get to the carpark ahead of them. He hid in his car, and killed the duo when they arrived]. The boss asks Titta why he did not just deposit the money and save himself a trip, but Titta tells him that he does not want to give it back, because they stole his life. At this point, the Mafia boss ominously tells a subordinate to transfer Titta's account to someone else before asking Titta to tell him where the money is. Titta again refuses. He is led away by guards and the next morning is taken to a building site. Here he is suspended from a crane above a container of fresh concrete, and told that unless he reveals the money's whereabouts, he will be drowned in the concrete. As he has already given the money to the elderly aristocrats in the hotel, he refuses. The film ends with Titta being lowered into the concrete and thinking of his long-lost best friend Dino, who works as an electrician in the Alps.

The film is noted for its extremely stylish cinematography. The most memorable scene features Titta injecting himself with heroin and sees the camera flip 180 degrees as it follows Titta's falling head. Brian Gibson at Vue Weekly affirms that \\"style becomes substance; cuts and angles create narrative, the screen's surface opens up depths\\" pointing out this scene as well as \\"gliding cameras, illusions of angle, and depth of field [which make] glimpses of human behaviour emerge\\". According to him, the soundtrack emphasises \\"the coolness and strangeness of a coldly financial Switzerland‚Äîa Dante-like purgatory for Titta\\". On the other hand, Richard M. Porton at Chicago Reader argues that \\"Sorrentino's often playful assault on genre conventions is sabotaged by an ostentatious visual style that [...] is little more than a bag of empty tricks.\\" Critics have also praised the film's tracking shots and the opening sequence, which depicts a bright white corridor: Anton Bitel on Eye for Film writes that \\"with simple economy, this scene [...] establishes several key features of the film, for it encapsulates Titta's status as an aloof observer, cocooned from the 'street level' of everyday human affairs, as well as affording an early glimpse of the catastrophic disorder that desire can bring.\\"  Soundtrack  The film's soundtrack uses atmospheric electronica and post-rock music, with songs from bands including Mogwai, Lali Puna, Boards of Canada and Terranova and music by Pasquale Catalano specifically written for the film. =Track listing= # Intro ‚Äì Pasquale Catalano (1:17) # Scary World Theory ‚Äì Lali Puna (4:45) # Moses?

B. Blackstone Memorial Library is a building that is part of the Chicago Public Library System and is named after Timothy Blackstone. The building was designed by Chicago architect Solon S. Beman. It is now known as the Chicago Public Library ‚Äì Blackstone Branch and commonly referred to as Blackstone Library, or Blackstone Branch and sometimes Blackstone for short. The Concord Granite building's two-year construction started in 1902, and it was dedicated on January 8, 1904. Blackstone Library marks the beginning of the Chicago Branch Library System as the first dedicated branch in the system. Blackstone is also the only branch of the 79-branch Chicago Public Library branch system that was constructed using private funding. The Blackstone Library was designated as a Chicago Landmark. The building is located in Chicago's Kenwood community area in Cook County, Illinois, United States and serves the Hyde Park, Kenwood, and Oakland community areas. The branch celebrated its 100th anniversary of service in 2004. Today, the library has bronze and mahogony furnishings and has themed paintings on the rotunda ceiling. The library is equipped with custom-designed furniture and makes public Wi-Fi access available to its patrons. History Blackstone Library Rotunda and Checkout Area, murals by Oliver Dennett Grover The library was dedicated to the memory of Timothy Beach Blackstone, President of the Chicago and Alton Railroad from 1864 to 1899, a period longer than any of his contemporaries. Blackstone, who had died on May 26, 1900, was also the founding president of the Union Stock Yards. He had owned the property on which the Blackstone Library now stands, and he donated this tract for the construction of the library after his death. The library was built on the tract through a codicil in his will, carried out by his wife, Isabella Norton Blackstone (1838‚Äì1928), after his death. Blackstone Library was his contribution to the city where he had made his fortune and stands as a monument to his generosity. Blackstone is and its original cost was $250,000 ($ today). Timothy B.

Prior to the donation of the Blackstone Library, the Chicago Public Library System had been renting reading room spaces around the city and had been seeking stand alone branches. On January 8, 1904, Isabella Blackstone handed the keys and deed to the Timothy B. Blackstone Library to the city's Library Board members. Blackstone Library became the first branch library in the Chicago Public Library System. The building retains a Lake Park Avenue address although the neighboring section of Lake Park was moved about a half a block east several decades ago. At least three renovations have occurred, which have expanded, renovated and updated the library. From 1938 to 1939 the new children's room annex, a Works Progress Administration project, was added at a cost of $68,400 ($). During this annexation one of a set of Howard Van Doren Shaw townhouses was razed. From 1977 to 1980 a major restorative renovation occurred. Blackstone was rededicated on November 18, 1980, in recognition of completion of the three years of work. There was also a 2004 renovation for the centennial. Blackstone donated a larger James Blackstone Memorial Library (1891, opened 1893), in his father's memory to Branford, Connecticut, Blackstone's birthplace. In addition to the James Blackstone Library in Branford, there is a library named \\"Blackstone Library\\" in Blackstone, MA. The architect for both the Branford and Chicago libraries was Solon S. Beman. The Blackstone Library was designated as a Chicago Landmark by the City of Chicago on December 8, 2010. Service Interior of the library, 1904 As one of the 79 Chicago Public Library branch libraries, Blackstone Library serves the Hyde Park, Kenwood, and Oakland community areas. These communities include 17 elementary schools and 4 high schools. The 2000 census service area population was 50,084. In 2003, the \\"Friends of Blackstone Branch Library\\" was formed, making the Blackstone Branch one of approximately 34 branches to have such a support group. The volunteer support group attempts to \\"serve as an advisory council for Chicago's first branch library, promote use and improvement of the library, and provide volunteer and fundraising services for Blackstone\\". The Blackstone Library participates in most Chicago Public Library programs and partnerships, including Great Kids Museum Passport Program, the Monthly Adult Book Club Discussion as well as many annual events and activities. The branch also partners with neighborhood institutions such as the Hyde Park Art Center and the Smart Museum for programs and workshops. Like all branches, the library provides both free wi-fi access and free terminals with both internet access and printing facilities. Blackstone has 5 internet terminals requiring reservations for each session of up to one hour and 1 express terminal that does not require reservations for sessions of up to 15 minutes. Currently, patrons can use the terminals for up to two free internet sessions per day and print for a small charge per page anywhere in the Chicago Public Library system. Design Bronze Doors Rotunda Mural The building was designed by the architect Solon S. Beman and modeled after Beman's Merchant Tailors Building, the domed temple facing the lagoon in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition,AIA Guide to Chicago, 2nd edition, Alice Sinkevitch, ed., 2004, Harcourt Books Inc., pg. 426. and the Erechtheum at the Athenian Acropolis. Greek Mythology teaches that Demeter, the goddess, bestowed agriculture and civilization upon the world during Erechtheus's reign. The library's rotunda murals have thematic titles: \\"Labor\\", \\"Literature\\", \\"Art\\" and \\"Science\\". The following is a summary of the building's features: Tiffany style dome; Marble column and walls in the rotunda and foyer; 4 overhead rotunda murals painted by Oliver Dennett Grover, mural painter for the World Columbian Exposition; square Italian marble mosaic flooring; glass-floored mezzanine; bronze plate, solid copper core outer front doors; 2 lbs. bronze and glass inner doors; thick granite walls; and ionic columns. The building's adult reading room is equipped with mahogany furniture specifically designed for the space. It also contains matching built-in shelving and custom-made bronze lamps. The circulation desk area has two- tiered bronze-trimmed book stacks. The mezzanine floor is composed of glass blocks.

The justification for the extension was to help facilitate truck traffic and serve the Northampton Commerce Park and Enviva Industrial Facility, on what was SR 1200 (Lebanon Church Road and James Jones Road); it can also be used as an alternate route for I-95 in the event traffic has to be rerouted. =North Carolina Highway 195= North Carolina Highway 195 (NC 195) was established around 1938 as a renumbering of NC 305 between Garysburg to Seaboard, then continuing east on new primary routing into Virginia becoming SR 195\\\\. Around 1970, SR 195 was renumbered to SR 186; North Carolina reciprocated in 1975.

It breeds in streamside pine-oak forests and canyons in the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico south to western Michoac√°n. It is sometimes seen as a vagrant to southeasternmost Arizona in the United States and has bred there. This range includes part of the Madrean Sky Islands region of southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and northern Sonora. Taxonomy The eared quetzal was described and illustrated in 1838 by the English ornithologist and bird artist John Gould in his book A Monograph of the Trogonidae, or Family of Trogons based on a specimen collected in Mexico. He coined the binomial name Trogon neoxenus. In 1858, in the second edition of his book, Gould placed the species in its own genus Euptilotis to give the current binomial name Euptilotis neoxenus. The eared quetzal is the only species placed in the genus. The specific epithet combines the Ancient Greek neos meaning \\"new\\" with xenos meaning \\"stranger\\", \\"guest\\" or \\"visitor\\". The genus name Euptilotis combines the Ancient Greek eu meaning \\"good\\" with ptilon meaning \\"feather\\" and -≈çtis meaning \\"-eared\\". The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2005 found that the eared quetzal was sister to a clade containing the members of the genus Pharomachrus. Description Body length is . Both sexes have iridescent green backs, iridescent dark blue central tail feathers, and outer tail feathers that are predominantly white terminally with a band of black at the base (sometimes partially barred black and white in females). The bill is dull gray with a slightly darker band at the tip. The adult male has a blackish head, iridescent green breast, and geranium red belly and undertail coverts. The adult female has a gray head, breast, and upper belly and less extensive (though equally bright) red on the lower belly. Both sexes bear the wispy hair-like auricular plumes that give the species its name, though these are rarely apparent in the field. Both head and bill appear rather small and narrow in comparison to those of typical trogons. The male's song (tremolo call) is a series of whistled notes increasing in volume. Calls include low-intensity squeals rising in pitch, a loud squeal ending with a sharp \\"chuck,\\" and a strident cackle given mostly in flight. Quetzals differ from typical New World trogons in having iridescent wing coverts, less extensive fusion between the two forward-facing toes of their heterodactyl foot, broad tails with distinctly convex (rather than straight or concave) sides, and eggs with pale blue shells. They also average larger in body size than typical trogons, and the eggs and young develop more slowly. The eared quetzal is a seemingly primitive form, lacking the impressively long iridescent upper tail and wing coverts of members of the genus Pharomachrus (including the resplendent quetzal). Distribution and habitat It is a resident of the middle to upper levels of pine-oak woodlands and oak-conifer forests, frequently along streams. Behaviour and ecology =Breeding= It nests high in an unlined shallow tree cavity, usually selecting an old woodpecker hole. Nests have been observed in pine, fir, maple, and aspen trees. Limited excavation of the cavity is accomplished using the bill to dig into the rotten wood of the walls and opening. =Food and feeding= Eared quetzals feed on insects, small vertebrates, and fruit, including the warty red fruits of madrone trees. Caterpillars, moths, katydids, cicadas, small lizards, and other prey are fed to the young. Like other trogons, eared quetzals often pluck prey and fruit while hovering. Members of this species have been observed to exhibit aversion to large areas of conspicuous color on and near human observers (negative chromotropic responses), including white, red, orange, and blue. This suggests that the species-confidence hypothesis, which states that birds tend to be attracted to colors that match those found in their species and repelled by colors not found in their species, does not apply to eared quetzals.

The facility consists of a gravity dam and a powerhouse, and the impoundment created is called Lake Zumbro. This dam spans and is high, creating a reservoir with about of hydraulic head. The facility was designed by pioneering hydroelectric engineer Hugh Lincoln Cooper (1865‚Äì1937) and was built from 1917 to 1919. It is still operated by its original owner, Rochester Public Utilities (RPU), to supply power to Rochester, Minnesota, to the south. The Lake Zumbro Hydroelectric Generating Plant was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 for having state-level significance in the theme of engineering. It was nominated as a representative work of Cooper‚Äîone of the nation's leading hydroelectric engineers in the early 20th century‚Äîand his only project in his home state of Minnesota. On the night of August 24, 2019, a pontoon boat with three people on board went over the dam. They were casting off from the lakeshore after patronizing a business below the dam but got caught on the lip of the spillway. A fourth person jumped off and swam to a buoy, where she yelled for help, while the other three went over the edge in the boat. It lodged right-side-up near the base of the dam, causing the people on board only minor injuries. Firefighters, sheriff's deputies, and civilian boaters rescued all four individuals. The Wabasha County Sheriff's Office ascribed the incident to alcohol and darkness, charging the driver with boating while intoxicated.

Stubbs, a progressive Republican, was known for his prohibitionist beliefs, as well as for having signed the nation's first blue sky law into effect. Biography =Early life= Stubbs was born in Wayne County, Indiana, near the city of Richmond, to a family of Quaker heritage. He moved to the small town of Hesper (located about two and a half miles southeast of Eudora) with his family in 1869 and was educated in the Douglas County public school system. For a time, he briefly attended the University of Kansas, but he did not graduate with a degree. He married Stella Hosteller in 1886, and they had five children, one of whom died on the same day that he was born. In his early life, Stubbs held a few odd jobs, such driving mules and being a clerk, before becoming a railroad contractor. After submitting a bid to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Company to build a railroad connecting St. Louis to Kansas City, Stubbs profited around $250,000. His prowess as a contractor continued, and eventually his business was securing contracts totaling around $35 million a year. =Career= During his middle-age, Stubbs decided to enter into politics, and in 1902, he secured a spot in the Kansas House of Representatives, serving the district in which Douglas County was situated. He quickly emerged as the dominant leader of the progressive wing of the Republican Party, and after his re-election in 1904, he became the Speaker of the House, serving from 1905 to 1906. He won a third term in 1906, and served from 1907 until 1909, until he was elected Kansas governor. Stubbs served two terms as governor, from January 11, 1909 to January 13, 1913. Upon ascending to the gubernatorial position, he made a name for himself by calling for the \\"recall of unworthy or incompetent public officials.\\" As a prohibitionist, he also made it a priority to stamp out illegal bootlegging. Specifically, he focused his attention on Crawford County, Kansas (then nicknamed the \\"Little Balkans\\"), where at the time a number of immigrants were making bootleg whiskey to supplement their meager incomes as strip miners. According to the criminal justice scholar Ken Peak, \\"The [Little] Balkans drove him absolutely nuts. He had his hands full and sent people down to the Balkans to clean it up\\". Despite this immense crack down, however, the governor was unable to eradicate the crime completely from the state. During the Stubbs administration, Kansas also enacted the nation's first state blue sky law, which was promoted by Joseph Norman Dolley, the Kansas state banking commissioner, who had been appointed by the governor on March 3, 1909. Near the end of his second term as governor, Stubbs won his party's nomination for the U.S. Senate. However, in the general election in November 1912, Democrat William H. Thompson, defeated Stubbs in his bid for the office. Stubbs was again a candidate for the Senate in 1918, but was narrowly defeated in the Republican primary by Arthur Capper. W. R. Stubbs's mansion, which is now the Sigma Nu fraternity house at the University of Kansas (2018). Upon leaving the governor's office, Stubbs returned to his mansion on Windmill Hill in Lawrence, Kansas, situated just west of the University of Kansas campus. The building, which had been constructed in 1907, was sold by Stubbs in 1922 to KU's Sigma Nu chapter, and to this day, it is still used as their fraternity house. =Death= After suffering with heart trouble for some time, Stubbs died on March 25, 1929 in Topeka, Kansas at the age of 70. He is interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Lawrence.

In the spring of 2006 Samuli Edelmann and his family moved to Malta, and in the late of 2015 Edelmann and his family moved back to Finland.http://www.iltasanomat.fi/viihde/art-2000000932564.html = Actor = Edelmann graduated from the Theatre Academy of Finland in 1991. Before he graduated, he had already acted in the three movies: Talvisota and two V√§√§peli K√∂rmy movies. His role of V√§hy in the movie Veturimiehet heiluttaa in 1992, however, was what shot him to fame. Some of his other well-known roles include Patrick in Romanovin kivet (1993), Jussi Murikka in H√§jyt (1999), Roope in Levottomat (2000), Aki in Min√§ ja Morrison (2001) and Tomppa in R√∂√∂peri.

It is located between the Tharsis volcanic province and Arabia Terra to the north of Valles Marineris, centered at . Most of this region is found in the Mare Acidalium quadrangle, but a small part is in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle. The plain contains the famous Cydonia region at the contact with the heavily cratered highland terrain. The plain is named after a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which was in turn named after the mythological fountain of Acidalia. Some places in Acidalia Planitia show cones; some researchers have suggested that these are mud volcanoes. The scientific community is still debating the possible existence of an ancient ocean over Acidalia Planitia and other parts of the northern lowlands.  Geological history  Topographical map generated from MOLA data including feature boundaries. Acidalia Planitia is the central, northernmost feature characterized by dark blue, low elevation land.There are several hypotheses regarding the geological history of Acidalia Planitia based on evidence from satellite data. = Springs and steam vents = Acidalia Planitia was once covered by ancient crust. Its surface eroded into knobs of iron/magnesium phyllosilicates during the Amazonian. Sediments filled the empty plain, leaving the phyllosilicate knobs as protrusions through the surface. The spatial density of these knobs is consistent with the ancient crust that was once above Acidalia Planitia. Hydrated silica materials surround the phyllosilicate knobs and the sides of rocky slopes. Rather than covering the entire surface, these features are localized. This indicates that the plain was once home to springs and steam vents not extensive bodies of water such as oceans or glaciers. = Oceans = Utopia Planitia is a similar plain at the same latitude as Acidalia Planitia. Etched flows in its terrain suggest that mud flowed into Utopia Planitia creating a large reservoir of water and mud in the deepest part of the basin, about 1000 km across. This may have been the remnants of a more extensive ocean that covered all of the northern lowlands including Acidalia Planitia. The Vastitas Borealis Formation (VBF) stretched across both Utopia and Acidalia Planitiae and delineated the threshold for an ancient ocean. The two segments of the VBF at Utopia and Acidalia have congruent ages, reliefs, crater frequencies, albedos, thermal properties, and superpositions of geological features. This suggests that the Acidalia Planitia may have once been covered by a large Martian ocean. = Glaciers = Craters on Acidalia Planitia are asymmetrical. Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data revealed that the slopes of the pole-facing crater walls are shallower than the equator-facing slopes. Other studies show the opposite asymmetry to be true. The two theories indicate either biased glacial deposition during the Amazonian era or long-term creep of hundreds of meters of ice-rich regolith beneath the surface, respectively.  Geological features  A gully found in the Bamberg Crater, which resides in Acidalia Planitia =Gullies= Martian gullies are small, incised networks of narrow channels and their associated downslope sediment deposits, found on the planet of Mars. They are named for their resemblance to terrestrial gullies. First discovered on images from Mars Global Surveyor, they occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Usually, each gully has a dendritic alcove at its head, a fan-shaped apron at its base, and a single thread of incised channel linking the two, giving the whole gully an hourglass shape.Malin, M., Edgett, K. 2000. Evidence for recent groundwater seepage and surface runoff on Mars. Science 288, 2330‚Äì2335. They are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. A subclass of gullies is also found cut into the faces of sand dunes which are themselves considered to be quite young. On the basis of their form, aspects, positions, and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice, many researchers believed that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water. However, this remains a topic of active research. = Mud volcanoes = Possible mud volcano in Acidalia Planitia Cone-shaped features with higher albedo than surrounding rocks litter the surface of Acidalia Planitia. The most similar terrestrial feature to these formations are mud volcanoes. On Mars, mud volcanoes have an average diameter of ~1 km and a relief of 10 to 180 meters. Their higher albedo is a result of more crystalline iron oxides than the rest of Acidalia Planitia. Mud volcanoes erupt sediments from deep beneath the surface and change the rising rocks very minimally. These rocks are used to analyze organic matter as mud volcanoes also create subterranean conduits for ancient ground water that may have hosted microbiota.  In popular culture  In the 2011 novel The Martian by Andy Weir, and its 2015 film adaptation, Acidalia Planitia is the landing site of the Ares III mission, where the protagonist is stranded following a dust storm.

Bonnet Carr√© was approximately 50 kilometers from New Orleans, Louisiana. The breach occurred when excess water from the Mississippi River flowed over the east bank levee of Bonnet Carr√©. The original levee was over 12 feet high, and the Crevasse itself spanned about 1200 feet. Local drainage systems were unable to contain the floodwater. The water rushed at 8 miles per hour, causing the width of the breach to increase by the day. Strong northern winds caused the excess water to enter Lake Pontchartrain and surrounding urban areas, including neighborhoods Metairie and Gentilly. The increasing force of the flood also caused another nearby levee to break. Although the devastation to the Bonnet Carr√© area was great, its ecological impacts were somewhat beneficial. By diverting river water and sediment, the crevasse saved a greater portion of land surrounding the area from succumbing to total flooding and land erosion. Therefore, the crevasse served as a buffer for wetland erosion. Recognizing the benefits, the local government commissioned the construction of an artificial crevasse that could be periodically opened to drain excess water from the Mississippi. Flooding on Canal Street, New Orleans near Claiborne Avenue The river levee was not restored at Bonnet Carr√© until 1883. The area is now the site of the Bonnet Carr√© Spillway.

It is a part of the Jackson Public School District. History Prior to desegregation in the 1960s, the school was majority white. Donna Ladd, in an article in the Jackson Free Press, described it as one of several \\"jewels in the crown of white Jackson back before forced integration‚Äîin a time when white conservatives abundantly funded public schools and extracurricular activities with tax money for their own.\\" Jackson schools integrated by law as per Derek Jerome Singleton vs. the Jackson Public School District, decided in 1969. Demographics There are 1,600 students enrolled at Murrah High School. The racial makeup of the school is 93.52% African American, 0.59% Asian, 0.44% Hispanic, 0.15% Native American, and 5.30% White. Name Murrah High School and Murrah Hall at Millsaps College were named after William Belton Murrah. William Belton Murrah (1852-1925) was an American bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church South elected in 1910. Born in Pickensville, Alabama, he was educated at Southern University (now Birmingham-Southern College) in Greensboro, Alabama, and at Centenary College in Jackson, Louisiana. In 1897 Murrah received his LLD from Wofford College in South Carolina. Before his election to the Episcopacy, he served from 1890 to 1910 as the first president of Millsaps College in Jackson. Murrah High School and Murrah Hall at Millsaps College were named after him. Special programs =Base Pair program= JPS is a partner with the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMC) in the Base Pair research mentorship program funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The primary focus for Base Pair is to use the physical resources and intellectual capital of UMC to enable the pursuit of excellence in science education in a local public school environment. The program matches high school students with UMC faculty members for in-depth experiences in the sciences. Base Pair has consistently emphasized three objectives: *To cultivate career awareness among high school students in areas related to biomedical research *To train such students as effective \\"communicators of science\\" to the general public *To advance teacher professional and science curriculum development within the JPSD That program, funded since 1992 and continuing through 2015, has brought approximately $1.3 million for science education enhancement into the district. Base Pair-trained high school students are authors on more than five dozen published scientific papers or abstracts. Twenty-five Base Pair graduates are in post-baccalaureate academic programs, including 12 in M.D., M.D./Ph.D., Ph.D. (science), or master's degree in science training. Six of these are currently enrolled in a program at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Visit the UMC Base Pair website at www.umc.edu/basepair =SOAR= The Student Oriented Academic Research (SOAR) program is a companion to the Base Pair program at Murrah High School. SOAR was developed to implement advanced science research activities for JPS students outside of the UMC zone. In this program, students are enrolled in Biology II during their junior year and other advanced life science courses during their senior year. The SOAR program supports advanced biomedical and forensic science laboratory research by students at each high school site. =Forensics= Murrah's Speech and Debate Team, currently coached by Micah Everson, Erin Mauffray, and Javier Peraza, has produced many successful competitors. Murrah students have competed at the National Speech and Debate Tournament each of the last six years. =Academic and Performing Arts Complex (APAC)= The Academic and Performing Arts Complex (APAC) is open to students in grades 4-12 who are academic achievers and/or who show aptitude for one or more of the visual or performing arts. There is an application process held each year for entrance into the programs for the following school year.Academic and Performing Arts Complex (APAC) Secondary Curriculum Guide APAC Secondary Curriculum *Academics: Eligibility for the academics division is based on past grades, standardized tests, entrance tests, and teacher recommendations. Cooperative learning and higher order thinking skills are emphasized. Courses in math, science, language arts, and social studies prepare students to take further APAC and Advanced Placement/APAC classes in high school. APAC academic courses are offered for grades 4-5 at Power APAC Elementary; for grades 68 at Bailey APAC Middle School, and for grades 912 at Murrah High School. In October 2002, Jackson Public Schools received a federal grant totaling almost $1 million to increase the number of middle and high school students who complete college-level courses in high school. This Advanced Placement (AP) Incentive Grant money has been used to increase the number of middle and high school students enrolling in and successfully completing Advanced Placement or college level courses in high school and in pre-AP courses through the district's accelerated academic program (APAC). In APAC, students use skills, textbooks and items above their grade level. *Performing Arts: The performing arts division offers classes in dance, music, theatre arts, and visual arts. Students must apply and audition for entry into the program. These courses are offered for grades 4 through 12 at the Power APAC site. This division of APAC is based on a rigorous written, sequential curriculum taught by artist teachers. Artistically, the objective is to prepare students for the next level in the arts whether university, apprenticeship, or professional experience. =Health Related Professions (HRP)= Murrah High School offers the only health-related professions program in the state of Mississippi for grades 912. The HRP program is an innovative cooperative setting opportunity designed to prepare students in the 21st century and beyond. Its mission is to provide historically under-represented and under-served students with a quality education that will allow them to become articulate in spoken word, masterful in writing, analytical in thought and prepared to enter and complete post-secondary studies in a chosen health career.

Traveling north-south, it connects the cities of Selma, Louisburg and Henderson, in the Research Triangle area. Route description Bickett at Nash, in Louisburg NC 39 is a predominantly two-lane rural highway that travels from US 70/US 70A, in Selma, to the Virginia state line, north of Townsville. NC 39 begins as a hidden concurrency along US 70, between US 70A and US 301/NC 96\\\\. This small segment, which also connects to I-95, only appears on NCDOT maps and is not signed. First signs of NC 39 appear alongside US 301/NC 96 through downtown Selma. Within the next , NC 39 splits from both highways as it continues north, through the communities of Hares Crossroads and Emit, before crossing the Johnston-Wake county line. In Wake County, NC 39 travels through its easterly tip; overlapping briefly with US 264 Alternate and connecting with mainline US 264, in Zebulon. This entire section is mostly forest, crossing NC 97 halfway through and enters Franklin County at Bunn Lake. Northeast of Bunn Lake, NC 39 crosses over US 64\\\\. Continuing north, it goes through the communities of Pilot and Sutton, before reaching NC 98, in Bunn. Traveling northwesterly for , it enters Louisburg city limits and soon connects with US 401/NC 56 at Bickett Boulevard. Through Louisburg, NC 56/NC 581 splits at Nash Street towards Rocky Mount and NC 561 splits at Justice Street towards Centerville. North of Louisburg, in the Ingleside community, US 401 splits towards Warrenton. NC 39 enters Vance County at Epsom. Going northwesterly, through Gillburg, it enters Henderson city limits near the US 1 interchange. Traveling along Andrews Avenue, it crosses US 1 Business/US 158 Business at Garnett Street, in the downtown area. After crossing over I-85/US 158, it leaves Henderson city limits traveling north. At Harris Crossroads, it meets up with the southwestern edge of Kerr Lake. Continuing north, to the west of Kerr Lake, it travels through the Williamsboro and Townsville communities before ending at the Virginia state line. Before 1952, when John H. Kerr Dam was completed, the road in Virginia would have continued towards Boydton, Virginia; however since then, the road makes a turn southwest, at Richardson, Virginia, and re-enters North Carolina as Townsville Road, eventually ending at US 15. History NC 39 was established in 1934 as a partial replacement of NC 23, between Selma and Louisburg, and a complete replacement of NC 501, from Louisburg to the Virginia state line towards Boydton. In 1941, NC 39 was placed on direct routing between Zebulon and Pilot, ending a western overlap along US 264 then northeastern overlap along US 64 to Pilot. Between 1947-1949, NC 39/NC 59 was placed on new bypass east of Louisburg; the old alignment along Main Street was downgraded to secondary road. In 1971, NC 39 was rerouted through downtown Henderson, via Andrews Avenue between Chestnut Street and Witherspoon Avenue; the old alignment, downgraded to secondary roads, was a zig-zag alignment via Cooper Avenue, Chestnut Street, Young Street and Beck Avenue. Around 1992, NC 39 was extended south, along US 301 and then east along US 70 to its current southern terminus at US 70A; it was originally to replace what remained of US 70A, which was approved for elimination by AASHTO, but was scuttled by local opposition. =North Carolina Highway 501= North Carolina Highway 501 (NC 501) was established in 1929 as primary routing from Henderson to the Virginia Border. Virginia did not have any primary routing that continues into their state from the terminus of NC 501\\\\. In 1930 NC 501 was extended further south to Louisburg. In late 1934, NC 501 was renumbered into NC 39, so it would not conflict with US 501.

The hospital has had different facilities in the city. It is currently located on a 15-acre campus at Grand Street and Jersey Avenue overlooking New York Harbor and Liberty State Park. The campus includes three facilities: the Wilzig Hospital, the Provident Bank Ambulatory Center, and the Christie Kerr Women's Health Center. The hospital serves as a regional referral, teaching hospital. Jersey City Medical Center is a teaching affiliate and a member of Americas Essential Hospitals. History The hospital began as the \\"Charity Hospital\\" but the Board of Aldermen of Jersey City bought land at Baldwin Avenue and Montgomery Street in 1882 for a new hospital. The locale was chosen to remove the hospital from the industrial development at Paulus Hook. This building is now the Medical Center building. It was renamed the Jersey City Hospital in 1885 and had expanded to 200 beds. In 1909, the original hospital building was reserved for men and a second wing was added for women. When Frank Hague became mayor of Jersey City in 1917, he planned to expand the hospital. He had the original building renovated and constructed a new 23-story structure for surgery, known as The Orpheum. The new facility opened in 1931, and George O'Hanlon was the first director. With money from the Works Progress Administration new buildings were added during The Great Depression. The formal dedication of the Medical Center Complex, the B. S. Pollack Hospital, was on October 2, 1936, with Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicating the building. In addition to the surgery building and the maternity hospital, the campus included the nurses' residence (Murdoch Hall), hospital for chest diseases (Pollock), a psychiatric hospital, and an outpatient clinic. The Medical Center's services were free. The formal dedication of the Jersey City Medical Center Complex was on October 2, 1936, with Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicating the building. During the 1950s, JCMC was the home of the medical school of Seton Hall University the predecessor to the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry now located in Newark, NJ. The Art Deco buildings of the former JCMC complex were renovated and became The Beacon Jersey City. Jersey City Medical Center was one of the first medical centers in the United States and the first in New Jersey. Many people in Northern New Jersey still call it ‚ÄúThe Medical Center‚Äù because of its reputation to handle all kinds of medical issues. In 1988, the Medical Center became a private, non-profit organization. In 1994, the State of New Jersey designated the Medical Center as a regional trauma center, and in the late 1990s it was approved as a core teaching affiliate of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The hospital also has a teaching affiliation with the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine, and St. George's University School of Medicine. In 2004, JCMC moved to new quarters at Grand Street and Jersey Avenue designed by Philadelphia A/E firm Ballinger and RBSD of New York. The site is near the light rail, ferries to NYC, PATH trains and the Liberty Science Center. The facility is currently operated by Barnabas Health and is the regions ‚Äústate designated trauma center‚Äù and the only hospital (medical center) in Hudson County to do open heart surgery. Several additional buildings are currently being planned for the site. Current operations In 1988, the center declared bankruptcy and became a private, non-profit organization. In 1994, the State of New Jersey designated the Medical Center as a regional trauma center, and in the late 1990s it was approved as a core teaching affiliate of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The hospital also has a teaching affiliation with the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine. JCMC received among the highest scores in Hudson County in the New Jersey Department of Health's 2009 Hospital Performance Report. The Center scored in the top 10 percent of hospitals in the state for their care of heart attacks, surgical improvements, and heart failure, receiving the second-highest score behind North Bergen's Palisades Medical Center.

While not directly connected to the JCMC, a 2.5-acre parcel owned by the city is planned to become a proton therapy treatment center, though the deal is contingent on tax-abatements the city is reluctant to give. In October 2012 the JCMC announced that it would implement an on-line appointment service for non-threatening emergency room treatment, becoming the first hospital in the New York metro area to do so.

Jenkinson remains in-character as Jefferson throughout the first half of the program, delivering monologues and answering listener questions regarding Jefferson's personal and political life and the history of early America. The character of Jefferson generally confines his discussion to matters of history, politics, and philosophy as indirect context for modern times, but at times provides a limited analysis of current events (carefully attempting to limit his analysis to matters on which the actual Jefferson's view might be meaningfully determined). In the second portion of the program, Jenkinson steps out of character to discuss his in- character answers during the first half of the show and also to talk generally about the topic of the episode.  History  The Jefferson Hour began production in Reno, Nevada in the 1990s. For 12 years, Jenkinson collaborated with co-host Bill Chrystal (not to be confused with commentator Bill Kristol), a Congregational pastor and fellow historical interpreter.

Dickson, the Scottish inventor credited with the invention of the motion picture camera under the employ of Thomas Edison. The film is titled after the dancer who features in it. This video is one of a series of Edison short films featuring circus and vaudeville acts. It features a dancer going through a routine she had been performing at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City since February 1890. According to film historian Charles Musser, Carmencita was the first woman to appear in front of an Edison motion picture camera and may have been the first woman to appear in a motion picture within the United States. In the film she is recorded going through a routine she had been performing at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City since February 1890.  Production  The film was produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company which had begun making films in 1890 under the direction of one of the earliest pioneers to film, William K.L. Dickson. It was filmed entirely within the Black Maria studio at West Orange, New Jersey, in the United States, which is widely referred to as \\"America's First Movie Studio.\\" Filming on this work took place between March 10, 1894 and March 16, 1894. According to the Internet Movie Database the film is 15.24 m in length. It was made in a 35 mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.33 : 1.

It has been cultivated in Bulgaria since the times of the ancient Thracians. In the past, it was the most widely spread Bulgarian variety, but today its plantations are highly limited. Pamid is also cultivated in Yugoslavia, Albania, Turkey, Greece, Hungary and Romania. The bunch is medium-sized (10‚Äì16 cm), and the grape is small (14‚Äì15 mm) and juicy. The skin is thin, red or sometimes dark red. It has excellent fertility, and its vintage is around the middle of September. Its yield is about 4‚Äì5 kg.

Maddalena was a leading advocate for the poor in her region after she witnessed first hand the plight of the poor following the spillover effects of the French Revolution into the Italian peninsula through the Napoleonic invasion of the northern territories. Canossa collaborated with luminaries such as Leopoldina Naudet and Antonio Rosmini in her mission of promoting the needs of the poor and setting a new method of religious life for both men and women. Her beatification was celebrated in Rome on 7 December 1941 and she was later canonized as a saint in Saint Peter's Square on 2 October 1988. Life =Childhood and obligations= Magdalene of Canossa was born on 1 March 1774 in Verona to the Marquis Ottavio di Canossa (1740 - 1 October 1779) and Teresa Szluha (3 January 1753 - 19 May 1807; a Hungarian countess). Her parents married in August 1770 in Odenburg. Their first two children Carlo Vincenzo (1771) died soon after his birth and therefore she was the third-born after Laura Maria (1772; an arrival poorly appreciated). Her mother later gave birth to another son who died right after the birth. But in 1776 the male heir that her parents desired was born - Boniface - and after him two other girls (Rosa in 1777 and Leonora in 1779). In 1779 her father died in an accident while at a villa on vacation in Grezzano. In 1781 her mother left their palace and married the widower Marquis Odoardo Zanetti from Mantua on 25 August with the permission of her father-in-law. The children were placed under the guardianship of their uncle Girolamo. An ancestor was the Countess Matilda Canossa who helped facilitate the meeting between Pope Gregory VII and Emperor Henry IV. From 2 May 1791 she spent ten months in a Carmelite convent but discerned that this was not her vocation so returned home and undertook the running of her large estate; her time in the convent caused her to miss her sister's wedding on 3 October 1791. In 1797 Napoleon was a guest at their palace where she received him; he returned as a guest twice more in 1805 and 1807. Canossa saw her town as one in which the poor suffered and grew worse due to all the social upheavals caused as a result of the invasions of the French forces and the opposing forces of the Austrian Empire which would gain control of Verona. This situation provoked her desire to serve the needs of the unfortunate. Canossa studied under the Carmelites in Trent and then at Conegliano. =Foundation and recognition= Using her inheritance she began charitable work among the poor and sick, in hospitals and in their homes, and also among delinquent and abandoned girls.\\"Saint Magdalen of Canossa\\", Franciscan Media On 1 April 1808 she was given an abandoned convent where she took in two poor girls from the slum of the San Zeno neighborhood to care for them and to also provide them with an adequate education. One month later on 8 May she moved out of her ancestral palace and moved into what is now the Saint Joseph Convent where other women soon joined her and with whom she formed the Canossian Daughters. In May 1810 the priest brothers and Servants of God Antonio Angelo and Marco Antonio Cavanis invited her to Venice for collaboration. In the meantime, her uncle Girolamo died in July 1814, entrusting his motherless son Carlino (born c. 1797) to her care. Canossa wanted the pope to legitimize her work by granting formal recognition to the order. She decided to meet with Pope Pius VII in Genoa in 1815 and arrived in Milan on 14 May to learn that the pope had left for Rome. She reached the pope on 23 May at Piacenza where she was received in an audience but she recounted later that she lost her courage before him. The pope noticed and did not wish to prolong the audience further so instructed Canossa to follow the usual protocol and send the Rule and other documents to Roman authorities for assessment. She tried again some hours later and was again brought before Pius VII who gave her the same vague response; this hurt her because she thought the audience was too formal with a lack of concrete results. In 1824 she travelled to Rovato where she briefly collaborated with Annunciata Astoria Cocchetti. The new congregation started to care for poor children and to serve in the hospitals. Once word of their work spread, the order was requested to start new communities in other cities of the region. Soon there were convents of the religious established in Venice (1812) and Milan (1816) as well as in Bergamo (1820) and Trent (1824). Magdalene drew up a Rule for the congregation, and it received pontifical approval from Pope Leo XII on 23 December 1828 in the papal brief \\"Si Nobis\\". Magdalene desired to provide boys with the same care her religious sisters were providing to girls. To this end she invited the priest Francesco Luzzi to open a small chapel adjacent to the sisters' convent of Santa Lucia in Venice. He opened this house on 23 May 1831. In 1833 the priest saw two laymen join him (Giuseppe Carsana and Benedetto Belloni) and who later took over the work of the place when Luzzi left to become a Carmelite friar. The men's order were given a religious habit in 1860 from the Patriarch of Venice, Angelo Francesco Ramazzotti, and were given a Rule in 1897 from Domenico Agostini who was a later patriarch. In 1833 she became profoundly affected by the death of Margherita Rosmini who was a close friend. Canossa maintained a partnership with Leopoldina Naudet though their mutual esteem for each other did not prevent disagreements between their individual methods, which led to the dissolution of their partnership sometime around 1816. Canossa also tried to establish a male religious order alongside Antonio Provolo sometime in the 1820s but was unsuccessful in this venture. It was in February 1820 that she first met Antonio Rosmini and Rosmini's sister Margherita became a close friend of Canossa and joined her order on 2 October 1824. The death of Pius VII in 1823 halted work in the recognition of her order and she was upset that approval had not been granted since her meeting with the pope less than a decade before. Canossa believed she would have better luck with his successor Pope Leo XII and in September 1828 left to go to Rome to request of him the formal approval needed. She stopped over at Coriano to visit Maria Elisabetta Renzi and stopped at Loreto before reaching Rome in November. In the audience with the pope he asked her to present a shorter version of the Rule so that his approval could come quicker; he also appointed a commission that the Cardinal Carlo Odescalchi led to assess the rule and the request. This led to Leo XII granting approval for the order just before Christmas. =Declining health and death= In 1834 she organized the Spiritual Exercises for her order in Verona before setting off for Venice before returning to Verona in May. That autumn she went to Bergamo and then to Milan. Canossa died on 10 April 1835 after a period of deteriorating health; she had known in January that her time was coming to an end, and returned to Verona from Milan in March. Canonization Monument in Verona. The cause for her canonization opened under Pope Pius IX on 15 February 1877 and she became titled as a Servant of God while the later confirmation of her model life of heroic virtue enabled Pope Pius XI to name her as Venerable on 6 January 1927. Pope Pius XII presided over her beatification in Saint Peter's Basilica on 7 December 1941. Her beatification depended upon a miracle attributed to her intercession with one being investigated from 13 January to 6 March 1955 before the Congregation for Rites validated the informative process of investigation in Rome on 25 November. Yet the cause remained inactive, since a reform of the canonization process in 1983 meant that miracles were assessed in a different manner. But it resumed on 1 July 1987 when a medical panel approved it, as did the theologians on 16 October 1987 and the members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 17 November 1987. Pope John Paul II approved this miracle on 11 December 1987 and presided over Canossa's canonization in Saint Peter's Square on 2 October 1988. Her orders have communities in each continent; her male order works in places such as India and Brazil.

Sanders 2013 and was professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis (1957‚Äì1967), at the University at Buffalo (1947-1952), president of the Society for the Study of Social Problems (1962), professor of sociology at the University of Amsterdam (1972‚Äì1976) and Max Weber Professor of Sociology at Washington University (from 1967). He was born in New York City. His early works such as Patterns in Industrial Bureaucracy can be seen as important as they worked within the existing fields of sociology but adopted the principles of a critical intellectual. This can be seen more clearly in his 1964 work Anti- Minotaur: The Myth of Value Free Sociology, where he claimed that sociology could not be objective and that Max Weber had never intended to make such a claim. He is probably most remembered in the academy for his 1970 work The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology. This work argued that sociology must turn away from producing objective truths and understand the subjective nature of sociology and knowledge in general and how it is bound up with the context of the times. This book was used by many schools of sociology as analysis of their own theory and methods. However, Gouldner was not the first sociologist to be critical of objective knowledge of society, see for example Theodor W. Adorno's Negative Dialectics. Subsequently, much of Gouldner's work was concerned with critiquing modern sociology and the nature of the intellectual. He argued that ideology often produced false premises and was used as a tool by a ruling elite and that therefore critical subjective thought is much more important than objective thought. Gouldner achieved public prominence when he was accused of beating and kicking Laud Humphreys, then a graduate student at Washington University, who Gouldner suspected of hanging a satirical cartoon poster criticizing Gouldner on the sociology department bulletin board.New York Times, June 10, 1968, p.25  Major works  * 1950: Studies in Leadership * 1954: Patterns of Industrial Bureaucracy * 1954: Wildcat Strike: A Study in Worker-Management Relationships * 1959: Organizational Analysis * 1959: Reciprocity and Autonomy in Functional Theory * 1960: The Norm of Reciprocity : a Preliminary Statement * 1964: Anti-Minotaur: The Myth of Value-Free Sociology * 1967: Enter Plato * 1970: The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology * 1973: For Sociology: Renewal and Critique in Sociology Today * 1976: The Dialectic of Ideology and Technology * 1979: The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the New Class * 1980: The Two Marxisms * 1984: Against Fragmentation  Patterns of Industrial Bureaucracy (1954)  Gouldner led an ethnographic study in a mine and identified there various patterns of bureaucracy and bureaucratization. He analyzed how after the appointment of a new manager the bureaucratization process emerged.Patterns of industrial bureaucracy, p.216-217 (1954) Gouldner identified three types of bureaucracy in his studies with very specific patterns: * Mock bureaucracy: this type comes from outside agency and is implemented officially, but not in daily behaviors. Both management and workers agree in this case to act the same way. The rules are not enforced in this case, neither by management, nor by the workers. No conflict seem to emerge in this case. \\"Smoking\\" is in this case seen as inevitable. The no-smoking rule is an example of mock-bureaucracy. * Representative bureaucracy: both management and workers enforced this rule and it generated very few tensions. In this context, the focus was on the education of workers as management considered them as ignorant and careless regarding security rules. The safety program is an example of representative. Meetings happened regularly to implement this program and it was as well the occasion to voice some concerns for workers. For the management, this program was a way to tighten the control over workers. * Punishment-centered bureaucracy: this type of program was initiated by management and generated many tensions. Management viewed workers as deliberately willing to be absent. Therefore, punishment was installed in order to force the workers not to be absent. For example, the \\"no-absenteeism\\" rule is an example of the punishment-centered bureaucracy.

Biography  John Blund (1927), on display at the Stockholm Public Library. Dardel was born in Bettna, S√∂dermanland, Sweden in 1888. He studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm between 1908‚Äì1910. Some of his most famous paintings are Den d√∂ende dandyn, Crime Passionnel, Svarta Diana and John blund. =Family life= Nils Dardel was born into the Swedish noble family von Dardel, son of the landowner Fritz August von Dardel and Sofia Matilda Norlin. His grandfather was the Swedish painter Fritz von Dardel, adjutant to the later king Charles XV of Sweden and member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm,Bl√•tt blod och liljevita h√§nder: en etnologisk studie av aristokratiska kvinnor 1850-1900, Angela Rundquist, Carlsson, 1989, pp. 318-319, 321-322, 382 where Nils later studied between 1908‚Äì1920, and of which he eventually became a member in 1934. In 1919, he proposed to Nita Wallenberg, but her father, a Swedish diplomat, disapproved of Dardel and the marriage was not to be. This was linked closely to the creation of his work Exekution (Execution), which is said to be symbolic of the rejection. Nils Dardel married the author Thora Dardel (1899‚Äì1995 ‚Äì n√©e Klinckowstr√∂m), which lasted between 1921‚Äì1934. Together they had a daughter Ingrid von Dardel (1922‚Äì1962) who like her father became an artist. Both her sons Henry Unger (born 1945 ‚Äì father Gustav Unger) and Nils Ekwall (born 1954 ‚Äì father Lage Ekwall) in turn were also active Swedish artists.Henry Ungers biografi Henry Unger webbplats. √Ötkomst 6 januari 2013.EKWALL, LAGE E O, direkt√∂r, Alstad i Vem √§r Vem? / Sk√•ne, Halland, Blekinge 1966 / s 205.Nils Ekwall Officiell webbplats. √Ötkomst 6 januari 2013. After the marriage to Thora, sometime in the 1930s Nils met Edita Morris (1902‚Äì1988, n√©e Toll), a Swedish writer with whom he shared his remaining life. \\\\- though she remained married to Ira Victor Morris. =Paris= Dardels 1913 work Begravning i Senlis (Funeral in Senlis) After studying in Sweden he did as many of his contemporaries and traveled to Paris around 1910 (such as Leander Engstr√∂m, Isaac Gr√ºnewald, Einar Jolin, and Sigrid Hjerten who all became students of Henri Matisse). Dardel primarily took inspiration from the Fauvists with their pure palette, the Post-Impressionists, as well as Japanese woodcuts. Dardel also made a brief foray into Cubism, and painted a few cityscapes in the style. Post- Impressionism Dardel explored Pointillism, using strong colors together with very clear motifs. Begravning i Senlis (Funeral in Senlis) from 1913 typifies this style and was painted while Dardel was visiting a staying in the medieval town of Senlis. Another early painting was the portrayal German art dealer Alfred Flechtheim. Over the course of Dardel's life, he primarily painted humans, concentrating on portraiture or paintings of groups of people. Ballets Su√©dois Crime passionel ‚Äì One of Dardel's paintings from the Ballets Su√©dois era, depicting a violent scene said to be indicative of Dardel's hectic personal life of the era. After living in Paris for three years, Dardel and Rolf de Mar√© became friends. Mar√© would later create the Ballets Su√©dois, which performed in Paris between 1920 and 1925. The friendship benefited Dardel as Mar√© was able to act as a benefactor for Dardel's art, and the duo is also claimed to have been fruitful for Mar√©'s dance company. In the early 1920s, Dardel created a number of works based upon stage sets, and these have been likened to sketches of drama or film. Dardel also created the stage sets for Midsummer Wake (music by Hugo Alfv√©n), and Maison de Fous (a dance drama with compositions by Viking Dahl). Crime passionnel (Crime of Passion) from 1921 is typical of Dardel's paintings from this era. =Travels= Japanska (med rygg mot betraktaren) ‚Äì Japanese woman (with back towards the viewer), shows influences of Dardels 1917 visit to Japan, including the medium, silk. Nils was a prolific traveler, picking up influences and motives from different countries. =Later years= Dardel lived a nomadic life, traveling far and wide without ever really settling down. Many of his portraits are of people and places whom he met along his travels. He was known to be self-destructive. Not exceptionally appreciated in his lifetime, his breakthrough in Sweden came simultaneously to the breaking out of World War II in Europe, at the time when Liljevalchs konsthall displayed a retrospective of Dardel's life and works. Legacy Eker√∂ Church outside Stockholm, where Nils lies buried. Nils died in New York City in 1943, and was buried in Eker√∂ cemetery outside of Stockholm.G√∂ran √Östrand: K√§nt och ok√§nt p√• Stockholms kyrkog√•rdar (Ordalaget Bokf√∂rlag 1998) sid.40 His works are on display in a number of museums and galleries including Nationalmuseum, G√∂teborgs konstmuseum, Malm√∂ konstmuseum, Nasjonalgalleriet and Waldermarsudde. His works Sj√§lvportr√§tt (Self-portrait) and Visit hos en excentrisk dam (Visit at an eccentric lady) were featured by the Swedish Postal-works 1988 stamp series Svenska konstn√§rer i Paris (Swedish artists in Paris). His 1918 work Den d√∂ende dandyn (The dying dandy) was sold twice at record prices at Bukowskis in Stockholm; first in 1984 at 3,4 million kronor and again in 1988 for the then termed sensational 13 million kronor. Simultaneously the image took on an iconic role within the 1980s Swedish gay movement. His works came to be analyzed under the budding field of gender- studies, and the ambivalence of the sex of his characters were topic of study. \\"Vattenfallet\\", 1921 ‚Äì sold in 2012 for a record-breaking 25 million kronor. Dardel's work Vattenfallet (or the Waterfall) sold for 25 million kronor in 2012 and was to date the most expensive modernist Swedish painting ever sold. The buyer was an undisclosed individual.

To the left is London Bridge; to the right, the Tower of London. Old St Paul's Cathedral is in the distance, surrounded by the tallest flames. The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of London from Sunday, 2 September to Thursday, 6 September 1666.All dates are given according to the Julian calendar. Note that, when recording British history, it is usual to use the dates recorded at the time of the event. Any dates between 1 January and 25 March have their year adjusted to start on 1 January according to the New Style. The fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall. It threatened but did not reach the City of Westminster (today's West End), Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, or most of the suburban slums.Porter, 69‚Äì80. It destroyed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.Tinniswood, 4, 101. The fire started in a bakery shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September, and spread rapidly. The use of the major firefighting technique of the time, the creation of firebreaks by means of demolition, was critically delayed due to the indecisiveness of the Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm which defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday into the heart of the City. Order in the streets broke down as rumours arose of suspicious foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. Tuesday, the fire spread over nearly the whole City, destroying St. Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall. Coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously getting underway. The battle to put out the fire is considered to have been won by two key factors: the strong east wind dropped, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks, halting further spread eastward. The death toll is unknown but generally thought to have been relatively small; only six verified deaths were recorded. Some historians have challenged this belief claiming the deaths of poorer citizens were not recorded and that the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims, leaving no recognisable remains.Hanson, 326-33. A melted piece of pottery on display at the Museum of London found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where the fire started, shows that the temperature reached . The social and economic problems created by the disaster were overwhelming. Flight from London and settlement elsewhere were strongly encouraged by Charles II, who feared a London rebellion amongst the dispossessed refugees. Various schemes for rebuilding the City were proposed, some of them very radical. After the fire, London was reconstructed on essentially the same medieval street plan which still exists today.Reddaway, 27.  London in the 1660s  center By the 1660s, London was by far the largest city in Britain, estimated at half a million inhabitants.Morgan, 293-4. John Evelyn, contrasting London to the Baroque magnificence of Paris in 1659, called it a \\"wooden, northern, and inartificial congestion of Houses\\", and expressed alarm about the fire hazards posed by the wood and the congestion.John Evelyn, quoted in Tinniswood, 3. The section \\"London in the 1660s\\" is based on Tinniswood, 1‚Äì11, unless otherwise indicated. By \\"inartificial\\", Evelyn meant unplanned and makeshift, the result of organic growth and unregulated urban sprawl.Porter, 80. London had been a Roman settlement for four centuries and had become progressively more crowded inside its defensive city wall. It had also pushed outwards beyond the wall into squalid extramural slums such as Shoreditch, Holborn, and Southwark, and had reached far enough to include the independent City of Westminster. By the late 17th century, the City proper‚Äîthe area bounded by the City wall and the River Thames‚Äîwas only a part of London, covering some ,330 acres is the size of the area within the Roman wall, according to standard reference works (see, for instance, Sheppard, 37), although Tinniswood gives that area as a square mile (667 acres). and home to about 80,000 people, or one sixth of London's inhabitants. The City was surrounded by a ring of inner suburbs where most Londoners lived. The City was then, as now, the commercial heart of the capital, and was the largest market and busiest port in England, dominated by the trading and manufacturing classes.Hanson (2001), 80. The aristocracy shunned the City and lived either in the countryside beyond the slum suburbs, or in the exclusive Westminster district (the modern West End), the site of King Charles II's court at Whitehall. Wealthy people preferred to live at a convenient distance from the traffic-clogged, polluted, unhealthy City, especially after it was hit by a devastating outbreak of bubonic plague in the Plague Year of 1665.Tinniswood, 1‚Äì11 The relationship between the City and the Crown was often tense. The City of London had been a stronghold of republicanism during the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still had the potential to be a threat to Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the early 1660s. The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and could remember how Charles I's grab for absolute power had led to that national trauma.See Hanson (2001), 85‚Äì88, for the Republican temper of London. They were determined to thwart any similar tendencies in his son, and when the Great Fire threatened the City, they refused the offers that Charles made of soldiers and other resources. Even in such an emergency, the idea of having the unpopular Royal troops ordered into the City was political dynamite. By the time that Charles took over command from the ineffectual Lord Mayor, the fire was already out of control. = Fire hazards in the city = Charles II The City was essentially medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren of narrow, winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, the most recent in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used.Hanson (2001), 77‚Äì80. The section \\"Fire hazards in the City\\" is based on Hanson (2001), 77‚Äì101 unless otherwise indicated. The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose every inch of building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, many of which were fire hazards‚Äîfoundries, smithies, glaziers‚Äîwhich were technically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice. The human habitations were crowded, and their design increased the fire risk. The typical six- or seven-storey timbered London tenement houses had \\"jetties\\" (projecting upper floors). They had a narrow footprint at ground level, but maximised their use of land by \\"encroaching\\" on the street, as a contemporary observer put it, with the gradually increasing size of their upper storeys. The fire hazard was well perceived when the top jetties all but met across the narrow alleys‚Äî\\"as it does facilitate a conflagration, so does it also hinder the remedy\\", wrote one observer.Rege Sincera (pseudonym), Observations both Historical and Moral upon the Burning of London, September 1666, quoted by Hanson (2001), 80. In 1661, Charles II issued a proclamation forbidding overhanging windows and jetties, but this was largely ignored by the local government. Charles's next, sharper message in 1665 warned of the risk of fire from the narrowness of the streets and authorised both imprisonment of recalcitrant builders and demolition of dangerous buildings. It too had little impact. The riverfront was important in the development of the Great Fire. The Thames offered water for firefighting and the chance of escape by boat, but the poorer districts along the riverfront had stores and cellars of combustibles which increased the fire risk. All along the wharves, the rickety wooden tenements and tar paper shacks of the poor were shoehorned amongst \\"old paper buildings and the most combustible matter of tarr, pitch, hemp, rosen, and flax which was all layd up thereabouts.\\"Letter from an unknown correspondent to Lord Conway, September 1666, quoted by Tinniswood, 45‚Äì46. London was also full of black powder, especially along the river front. Much of it was left in the homes of private citizens from the days of the English Civil War. Five to six hundred tons of powder was stored in the Tower of London. The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels. London Bridge was the only physical connection between the City and the south side of the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge.All quotes from and details involving Samuel Pepys come from his diary entry for the day referred to. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak. The 18-foot (5.5 m) high Roman wall enclosing the City put the fleeing homeless at risk of being shut into the inferno. Once the riverfront was on fire and the escape route cut off by boat, the only exits were the eight gates in the wall. During the first couple of days, few people had any notion of fleeing the burning City altogether. They would remove what they could carry of their belongings to the nearest \\"safe house\\", in many cases the parish church or the precincts of St Paul's Cathedral, only to have to move again hours later. Some moved their belongings and themselves \\"four and five times\\" in a single day.Gough MSS London14, the Bodleian Library, quoted by Hanson (2001), 123. The perception of a need to get beyond the walls took root only late on the Monday, and then there were near-panic scenes at the narrow gates as distraught refugees tried to get out with their bundles, carts, horses, and wagons. The crucial factor which frustrated firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets. Even under normal circumstances, the mix of carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and gridlock. During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it. = 17th-century firefighting = Tiverton in Devon, England, 1612 Fires were common in the crowded wood-built city with its open fireplaces, candles, ovens, and stores of combustibles. There was no police or fire brigade to call, but London's local militia, known as the Trained Bands, was available for general emergencies, at least in principle, and watching for fire was one of the jobs of the watch, a thousand watchmen or \\"bellmen\\" who patrolled the streets at night.Hanson (2001), 82. The section \\"17th-century firefighting\\" is based on Tinniswood, 46‚Äì52, and Hanson (2001), 75‚Äì78, unless otherwise indicated. Self-reliant community procedures were in place for dealing with fires, and they were usually effective. Public-spirited citizens would be alerted to a dangerous house fire by muffled peals on the church bells, and would congregate hastily to fight the fire.Tinniswood, 48 The methods available for this relied on demolition and water. By law, the tower of every parish church had to hold equipment for these efforts: long ladders, leather buckets, axes, and \\"firehooks\\" for pulling down buildings (illustration right; see also pike pole). Sometimes taller buildings were levelled quickly and effectively by means of controlled gunpowder explosions. This drastic method of creating firebreaks was increasingly used towards the end of the Great Fire, and modern historians believe that it was what finally won the struggle.Reddaway, 25. Demolishing the houses downwind of a dangerous fire was often an effective way of containing the destruction by means of firehooks or explosives. This time, however, demolition was fatally delayed for hours by the Lord Mayor's lack of leadership and failure to give the necessary orders.\\"Bludworth's failure of nerve was crucial\\" (Tinniswood, 52). The use of water to extinguish the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington.Tinniswood, 48‚Äì49. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to spray on a fire or fill buckets. Further, the site where the fire started was close to the river: theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing buckets of water up to the fire and then back down to the river to be refilled.Tinniswood, 48-49 This did not happen, or at least was no longer happening by the time that Pepys viewed the fire from the river at mid- morning on the Sunday. Pepys comments in his diary that nobody was trying to put it out, but instead they fled from it in fear, hurrying \\"to remove their goods, and leave all to the fire.\\" The flames crept towards the riverfront and soon torched the flammable warehouses along the wharves and set alight the water wheels under London Bridge, eliminating the supply of piped water.Tinniswood, 52 London possessed advanced fire-fighting technology in the form of fire engines, which had been used in earlier large-scale fires. However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds.Compare Hanson (2001), who claims that they had wheels (76), and Tinniswood, who states that they did not (50). They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but no delivery hoses. On this occasion, an unknown number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets. Firefighters worked desperately to manoeuvre the engines to the river to fill their tanks, and several of the engines fell into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance.  Development of the fire  = Sunday = The information in the day-by-day maps comes from Tinniswood, 58, 77, 97. \\"It made me weep to see it.\\" Samuel Pepys (1633‚Äì1703) painted by John Hayls in 1666, the year of the Great Fire. A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September. The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim.Tinniswood, 42‚Äì43. The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread. The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned to give his permission.Tinniswood, 44 When Bloodworth arrived, the flames were consuming the adjoining houses and creeping towards the warehouses and flammable stores on the riverfront. The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, \\"A woman could piss it out\\", and left.Tinniswood, 44: \\"He didn't have the experience, the leadership skills or the natural authority to take charge of the situation.\\" After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \\"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\\" Pepys ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the riverfront. The houses on London Bridge were burning. He took a boat to inspect the destruction around Pudding Lane at close range and describes a \\"lamentable\\" fire, \\"everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another.\\" Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, \\"where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and the word was carried into the King. So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded me to go to my Lord Mayor from him and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way.\\" Charles' brother James, Duke of York, offered the use of the Royal Life Guards to help fight the fire.Pepys' diary, 2 September 1666. The fire spread quickly in the high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people abandoned attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for firemen and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but reached only St Paul's Cathedral before he had to get out and walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods were still on the move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. They filled parish churches not directly threatened with furniture and valuables. Pepys found Bloodworth trying to coordinate the fire-fighting efforts and near to collapse, \\"like a fainting woman\\", crying out plaintively in response to the King's message that he was pulling down houses: \\"But the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.\\" Holding on to his civic dignity, he refused James's offer of soldiers and then went home to bed.Tinniswood, 53. King Charles II sailed down from Whitehall in the Royal barge to inspect the scene. He found that houses were still not being pulled down, in spite of Bloodworth's assurances to Pepys, and daringly overrode the authority of Bloodworth to order wholesale demolitions west of the fire zone.London Gazette, 3 September 1666.Tinniswood, 53-54. By Sunday afternoon, 18 hours after the alarm was raised in Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging firestorm that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds fueled the flames.See firestorm and Hanson (2001), 102‚Äì05. The fire pushed towards the City's centre \\"in a broad, bow-shaped arc\\".Tinniswood, 55. = Monday = The London Gazette for 3‚Äì10 September, facsimile front page with an account of the Great Fire. Click on the image to enlarge and read. The fire was principally expanding north and west by dawn on Monday, 3 September, the turbulence of the firestorm pushing the flames both farther south and farther north than the day before.The section \\"Monday\\" is based on Tinniswood, 58‚Äì74, unless otherwise indicated. The spread to the south was mostly halted by the river, but it had torched the houses on London Bridge and was threatening to cross the bridge and endanger the borough of Southwark on the south bank of the river. Southwark was preserved by a pre-existent firebreak on the bridge, a long gap between the buildings which had saved the south side of the Thames in the fire of 1632 and now did so again. The fire's spread to the north reached the financial heart of the City. The houses of the bankers in Lombard Street began to burn on Monday afternoon, prompting a rush to rescue their stacks of gold coins before they melted. Several observers emphasise the despair and helplessness which seemed to seize Londoners on this second day, and the lack of efforts to save the wealthy, fashionable districts which were now menaced by the flames, such as the Royal Exchange‚Äîcombined bourse and shopping centre ‚Äì and the opulent consumer goods shops in Cheapside. The Royal Exchange caught fire in the late afternoon, and was a smoking shell within a few hours. John Evelyn, courtier and diarist, wrote: Evelyn lived in Deptford, four miles (6 km) outside the City, and so he did not see the early stages of the disaster. He went by coach to Southwark on Monday, joining many other upper-class people, to see the view which Pepys had seen the day before of the burning City across the river. The conflagration was much larger now: \\"the whole City in dreadful flames near the water-side; all the houses from the Bridge, all Thames-street, and upwards towards Cheapside, down to the Three Cranes, were now consumed\\".Evelyn, 10. In the evening, Evelyn reported that the river was covered with barges and boats making their escape piled with goods. He observed a great exodus of carts and pedestrians through the bottleneck City gates, making for the open fields to the north and east, \\"which for many miles were strewed with moveables of all sorts, and tents erecting to shelter both people and what goods they could get away. Oh, the miserable and calamitous spectacle!\\" John Evelyn (1620‚Äì1706) in 1651 Suspicion soon arose in the threatened city that the fire was no accident. The swirling winds carried sparks and burning flakes long distances to lodge on thatched roofs and in wooden gutters, causing seemingly unrelated house fires to break out far from their source and giving rise to rumours that fresh fires were being set on purpose. Foreigners were immediately suspects because of the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War. Fear and suspicion hardened into certainty on Monday, as reports circulated of imminent invasion and of foreign undercover agents seen casting \\"fireballs\\" into houses, or caught with hand grenades or matches.Hanson (2001), 139. There was a wave of street violence.Reddaway, 22, 25. There were also religious alarms of renewed Gunpowder Plots. The fears of terrorism received an extra boost from the disruption of communications and news. The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street, through which post passed for the entire country, burned down early on Monday morning. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames. Suspicions rose to panic and collective paranoia on Monday, and both the Trained Bands and the Coldstream Guards focused less on fire fighting and more on rounding up foreigners, Catholics, and anyone else appearing suspicious, arresting them, rescuing them from mobs, or both. The inhabitants, especially the upper class, were growing desperate to remove their belongings from the City. This provided a source of income for the able- bodied poor, who hired out as porters (sometimes simply making off with the goods), and it was especially profitable for the owners of carts and boats. Hiring a cart had cost a couple of shillings on the Saturday before the fire; on Monday, it rose to as much as ¬£40, a fortune equivalent to more than ¬£4,000 in 2005.Hanson (2001), 156‚Äì57. Seemingly every cart and boat owner within reach of London made their way towards the City to share in these opportunities, the carts jostling at the narrow gates with the panicked inhabitants trying to get out. The chaos at the gates was such that the magistrates briefly ordered the gates shut, in the hope of turning the inhabitants' attention from safeguarding their own possessions to fighting the fire: \\"that, no hopes of saving any things left, they might have more desperately endeavoured the quenching of the fire.\\"Quoted by Hanson (2001), 158. Monday marked the beginning of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the firefighting, but he had apparently left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events.Tinnisworth, 71. In this state of emergency, the King put his brother James, Duke of York, in charge of operations. James set up command posts round the perimeter of the fire, press- ganging any men of the lower classes found in the streets into teams of firemen. Three courtiers were put in charge of each post, with authority from Charles himself to order demolitions. James and his life guards rode up and down the streets all Monday, rescuing foreigners from the mob and attempting to keep order. \\"The Duke of York hath won the hearts of the people with his continual and indefatigable pains day and night in helping to quench the Fire,\\" wrote a witness in a letter on 8 September.Spelling modernised for clarity; quoted by Tinniswood, 80. On Monday evening, hopes were dashed that the massive stone walls of Baynard's Castle, Blackfriars would stay the course of the flames, the western counterpart of the Tower of London. This historic royal palace was completely consumed, burning all night.Bell, 109‚Äì111. = Tuesday = Tuesday, 4 September was the day of greatest destruction.The section \\"Tuesday\\" is based on Tinniswood, 77‚Äì96. The Duke of York's command post at Temple Bar, where Strand meets Fleet Street, was supposed to stop the fire's westward advance towards the Palace of Whitehall. He hoped that the River Fleet would form a natural firebreak, making a stand with his firemen from the Fleet Bridge and down to the Thames. However, early on Tuesday morning, the flames jumped over the Fleet and outflanked them, driven by the unabated easterly gale, forcing them to run for it. Ludgate in flames, with St Paul's Cathedral in the distance (square tower without the spire) now catching flames. Oil painting by anonymous artist, ca. 1670. Working to a plan at last, James's firefighters had also created a large firebreak to the north of the conflagration. It contained the fire until late afternoon, when the flames leapt across and began to destroy the wide affluent luxury shopping street of Cheapside. Everybody had thought St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural firebreak in the form of a wide empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night. Within half an hour, the lead roof was melting, and the books and papers in the crypt were burning. The cathedral was quickly a ruin. During the day, the flames began to move eastward from the neighbourhood of Pudding Lane, straight against the prevailing east wind and towards Pepys's home on Seething Lane and the Tower of London with its gunpowder stores. The garrison at the Tower took matters into their own hands after waiting all day for requested help from James's official firemen, who were busy in the west. They created firebreaks by blowing up houses on a large scale in the vicinity, halting the advance of the fire. = Wednesday = James II. The wind dropped on Tuesday evening, and the firebreaks created by the garrison finally began to take effect on Wednesday, 5 September.The section \\"Wednesday\\" is based on Tinniswood, 101‚Äì10, unless otherwise indicated. Pepys climbed the steeple of Barking Church, from which he viewed the destroyed City, \\"the saddest sight of desolation that I ever saw.\\" There were many separate fires still burning themselves out, but the Great Fire was over. The following Sunday, rain fell over the city, extinguishing the fire. However, it took some time until the last traces were put out: coal was still burning in cellars two months later. Pepys visited Moorfields, a large public park immediately north of the City, and saw a great encampment of homeless refugees, \\"poor wretches carrying their good there, and every body keeping his goods together by themselves\\". He noted that the price of bread had doubled in the environs of the park. Evelyn also went out to Moorfields, which was turning into the main point of assembly for the homeless, and was horrified at the numbers of distressed people filling it, some under tents, others in makeshift shacks: \\"Many [were] without a rag or any necessary utensils, bed or board ... reduced to extremest misery and poverty.\\"Quoted Tinniswood, 104. Fears of foreign terrorists and of a French and Dutch invasion were as high as ever among the traumatised fire victims. There was panic on Wednesday night in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington: a light in the sky over Fleet Street started a story that 50,000 French and Dutch immigrants had risen, and were marching towards Moorfields to murder and pillage. Surging into the streets, the frightened mob fell on any foreigners whom they happened to encounter, and were pushed back into the fields by the Trained Bands, troops of Life Guards, and members of the court. The mood was now so volatile that Charles feared a full-scale London rebellion against the monarchy. Food production and distribution had been disrupted to the point of non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread would be brought into the City every day, and markets set up round the perimeter.  Deaths and destruction  broadside ballad published in 1666 giving an account of the fire, and of the limits of its destruction. Click on the image to enlarge and read. Only a few deaths from the fire are officially recorded, and deaths are traditionally believed to have been few. Porter gives the figure as eightPorter, 87. and Tinniswood as \\"in single figures\\", although he adds that some deaths must have gone unrecorded and that, besides direct deaths from burning and smoke inhalation, refugees also perished in the impromptu camps.Tinniswood, 131‚Äì35. Hanson takes issue with the idea that there were only a few deaths, enumerating known deaths from hunger and exposure among survivors of the fire, \\"huddled in shacks or living among the ruins that had once been their homes\\" in the cold winter that followed, including, for instance, dramatist James Shirley and his wife. Hanson also maintains that \\"it stretches credulity to believe that the only papists or foreigners being beaten to death or lynched were the ones rescued by the Duke of York\\", that official figures say very little about the fate of the undocumented poor, and that the heat at the heart of the firestorms was far greater than an ordinary house fire, and was enough to consume bodies fully or leave only a few skeletal fragments. The fire was fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, but also by the oil, pitch, tar, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and gunpowder stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates. Hanson appeals to common sense and \\"the experience of every other major urban fire down the centuries\\", emphasising that the speed of the fire through the tenements surely trapped \\"the old, the very young, the halt and the lame\\", producing a death toll not of four or eight, but of \\"several hundred and quite possibly several thousand.\\"Hanson (2001), 326‚Äì333. The material destruction has been computed at 13,500 houses, 87 parish churches, 44 Company Halls, the Royal Exchange, the Custom House, St Paul's Cathedral, the Bridewell Palace and other City prisons, the General Letter Office, and the three western city gates‚ÄîLudgate, Newgate, and Aldersgate.Porter, 87‚Äì88. The monetary value of the loss, first estimated at ¬£100,000,000 in the currency of the time, was later reduced to an uncertain ¬£10,000,000Reddaway, 26. (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Evelyn believed that he saw as many as \\"200,000 people of all ranks and stations dispersed, and lying along their heaps of what they could save\\" in the fields towards Islington and Highgate.  Aftermath  John Evelyn's plan, never carried out, for rebuilding a radically different City of London. An example of the urge to identify scapegoats for the fire is the acceptance of the confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster.The section \\"Aftermath\\" is based on Reddaway, 27 ff. and Tinniswood, 213‚Äì37, unless otherwise indicated. He later changed his story to say that he had started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started.Tinniswood, 163‚Äì168. Allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign. Abroad in the Netherlands, the Great Fire of London was seen as a divine retribution for Holmes's Bonfire, the burning by the English of a Dutch town during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. On 5 October, Marc Antonio Giustinian, Venetian Ambassador in France, reported to the Doge of Venice and the Senate, that Louis XIV announced that he would not \\"have any rejoicings about it, being such a deplorable accident involving injury to so many unhappy people\\". Louis had made an offer to his aunt, the British Queen Henrietta Maria, to send food and whatever goods might be of aid in alleviating the plight of Londoners, yet he made no secret that he regarded \\"the fire of London as a stroke of good fortune for him \\" as it reduced the risk of French ships crossing the Channel and the North Sea being taken or sunk by the English fleet. Louis tried to take advantage but an attempt by a Franco-Dutch fleet to combine with a larger Dutch fleet ended in failure on 17 September when they encountered a larger English fleet led by Thomas Allin off Dungeness.Jones, 173. Christopher Wren's rejected plan for the rebuilding of London. Charles II encouraged the homeless to move away from London and settle elsewhere, immediately issuing a proclamation that \\"all Cities and Towns whatsoever shall without any contradiction receive the said distressed persons and permit them the free exercise of their manual trades.\\"Quoted in Evelyn, 16. A special Fire Court was set up from February 1667 to September 1672 to deal with disputes between tenants and landlords and decide who should rebuild, based on ability to pay. Cases were heard and a verdict usually given within a day; without the Fire Court, lengthy legal wrangles would have seriously delayed the rebuilding which was so necessary if London was to recover. Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan pictured). Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. The Crown and the City authorities attempted to negotiate compensation for the large- scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing tall. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which read, in part, \\"Popish frenzy which wrought such horrors, is not yet quenched\\". The inscription remained until after the passage of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 when it was removed in 1830 following a successful campaign by City Solicitor Charles Pearson.Martin, 11. Another monument marks the spot where the fire stopped: the Golden Boy of Pye Corner in Smithfield. The Great Plague epidemic of 1665 is believed to have killed a sixth of London's inhabitants, or 80,000 people,Porter, 84. and it is sometimes suggested that the fire saved lives in the long run by burning down so much unsanitary housing with their rats and their fleas which transmitted the plague, as plague epidemics did not recur in London after the fire.Hanson (2001), 249‚Äì50. Historians disagree as to whether the fire played a part in preventing subsequent major outbreaks. The Museum of London website claims that there was a connection, while historian Roy Porter points out that the fire left the slum suburbs untouched.

He was named after his adopted grandfather, Sir John Salusbury. Early life John Salusbury Piozzi Salusbury was born to Giovanni Battista Piozzi in Milan, Italy. His father was a member of the Italian nobility who held significant tracts of land outside Milan. During the Napoleonic Wars, the family had been driven from their home by Napoleon's invasion of Milanese territory, which deprived them of an income. Giovanni named his eldest son \\"John Salusbury Piozzi\\" after the father of the wealthy and influential Hester Piozzi, the wife of Giovanni Battista Piozzi's brother Gabriel Mario Piozzi, in the hope that Hester would provide the family with assistance. After she failed to do so, Giovanni Battista Piozzi gave John up for adoption. The boy became known, informally at this stage, as John Salusbury Piozzi Salusbury. By all accounts, Salusbury was not happy to leave home, and upon seeing sheep heads at market, the child retold how he saw a basket of human heads in Brescia, then a part of Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. His adopted mother eventually wrote a pamphlet regarding the alleged barbarity of Napoleon's army after her son's story. Education and career He was educated at Trinity College, Oxford. On 29 November 1813, Hester legally applied for him to bear the surname Salusbury. On 7 November 1814, he married Harriet Maria Pemberton of Ryton Grove, Shropshire, receiving Brynbella, along with the rest of Mrs Piozzi's estates in Flint, Denbigh and Caernarvonshire and becoming one of the foremost landowners in Wales. However, he had no concept of estate management and soon ran the properties into the ground. During the Battle of Waterloo, Salusbury expected to be directly under the command of his uncle, Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere, but was instead an attach√© to Henry William Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey whom he disliked for having \\"stolen\\" his uncle's command. Later life In later life, Hester's pocket books indicate that he continually demanded money from her and was not very affectionate. He and his wife Harriet are known to have had eleven children including Rev. George Augustus Salusbury.http://records.ancestry.com/harriet_maria_pemberton_records.ashx?pid=55560677 Salusbury went on to later become the High Sheriff of Flintshire in 1816. One year later, he was made a Knight Bachelor by William IV. His mother attempted to secure a baronetcy for him during that same year from the Viscount Sidmouth, but he spent the money on his extensive gambling debts. He died on 18 December 1858 in Cheltenham. As Hester Piozzi was the last living member of the Salusbury family, she secured the rights and privileges of her father for her son. He is the progenitor of the modern Salusbury family, and all people who possess the right to bear the Salusbury arms are descended from him. Salusbury had several cousins, many of whom passed on their name without the rights and privileges restored to him via the crown. References * Balderston: Thraliana.

Koltsov participated in the Russian Revolution of 1917, became a member of the Bolshevik party in 1918, and took part in the civil war. A convinced communist, he soon became a key figure of the Soviet intellectual elite and arguably the most famous journalist in the USSR, chiefly due to his well- written satirical essays and articles, where he criticised bureaucracy and other negative phenomena in the Soviet Union. Koltsov founded popular journals such as Krokodil, Chudak, Sovetskoe Foto and Ogonyok and was a member of the editorial board of Pravda. As a Pravda correspondent, he travelled to Spain to cover the Spanish Civil War, while at the same time he was working for the NKVD. He also acted as military advisor to Loyalist forces on occasion. Koltsov is widely regarded as having been Joseph Stalin's chief reporter in the Spanish war, with speculation suggesting he had a direct line from his hotel to the Kremlin. The British communist journalist, Claud Cockburn, who met Koltsov in Spain, described him as \\"a stocky little Jew with a huge head and one of the most expressive faces of any man I ever met.... He unquestionably and positively enjoyed the sense of danger and sometime ‚Äì by his political indiscretions, for instance, or still more wildly indiscreet love affairs ‚Äì deliberately created dangers which need not have existed.\\" George Orwell in Homage to Catalonia (1938) accused Cockburn of cooperating with Koltsov to produce false stories that favored Soviet objectives in Spain. Ernest Hemingway, in his novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, based on the war in Spain, represented Koltsov as the character Karkov. Koltsov described his experiences in The Spanish Diary, which was published in 1938. Koltsov returned to the USSR in November 1937, and became a close friend of Yevgenia Yezhova, wife of the head of the NKVD, Nikolai Yezhov. On 19 December 1937, Mikhail Koltsov published an article criticizing some aspects of the purges. Koltsov claimed that to protect themselves, some people had smeared the innocent and called on the party, the government, the courts and public opinion to put a stop to such \\"heartless liars who violated the rights of Soviet citizens\\". He was arrested on 14 December 1938, four weeks after Yevgenia Yezhova had committed suicide, and nine days after Yezhov was removed from the chairmanship of the NKVD and replaced by Lavrentiy Beria. After Yezhov's arrest in 1939, he told his interrogators in May that Koltsov and Yezhova had been lovers and that \\"Yezhova was connected with Koltsov with respect to espionage work on behalf of England.\\". He was included on a list of 346 \\"enemies of the people\\" marked for execution, submitted by Beria to the Politburo, on 16 January 1940. The list included Yezhov, at least 60 other former NKVD officers, and at least two more of Yezhova's former lovers, one of whom was the writer Isaac Babel. Koltsov was shot on 2 February 1940. His third wife Maria Osten was also sentenced and shot.

Brown and Jensen were the principal songwriters and vocalists for the group. History =Early years= After relocating to Atlanta, the band recorded a single, \\"Holes\\" b/w \\"Heaven\\", in 1986, and two independent records, Get It Together and 15 Dryden, for New Vision Records in 1987 and 1988. Creative differences led Giordano to leave Atlanta for New York after the first LP, where he formed the band Humbolts. Uncle Green soon met an ascendant Brendan O'Brien, near the beginning of his producing career, with whom they recorded the albums You and What An Experiment His Head Was for DB Records. After establishing themselves as a well-known regional college-rock band, they signed a contract with Atlantic Records in 1992 and recorded Book of Bad Thoughts. Like all of their efforts, the album was lauded by critics, but establishing commercial viability proved more difficult. Subsequent tours supporting The Reivers, Semisonic, The Black Crowes, Matthew Sweet, They Might Be Giants, Robyn Hitchcock and Ben Folds Five helped increased their visibility. In 1994, the band took part in the Indigo Girls project Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection and appear on the studio cast album. In 1995 part of a solo Matt Brown set recorded at Eddie's Attic in Decatur, Georgia, was included on the album Solo, Volume I, released by the independent label Sister Ruby. The album included original songs that do not appear on any of the group's albums, as well as a cover of Big Star's \\"Nighttime\\". The same year, Uncle Green contributed a version of \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" to A Tribute to Bob Dylan, Vol. 2, also on the Sister Ruby label. =Renaming= Looking to catch more attention, the band renamed themselves 3 lb. Thrill (the weight of the human brain) and recorded the harder-edged Vulture for O'Brien's new label, 57 Records, a subsidiary of Sony 550 and Epic. This spawned a minor radio hit, \\"Diana\\", which examined the uncomfortable subject of child molestation and suffered commercially as a result. A video was recorded for the single \\"Something Will Come\\", directed by Peter Christopherson. 3 lb. Thrill's second album, Rycopa, was recorded in 1997 with engineer Caram Costanzo but remained unavailable until December 2011, when fans supported a Kickstarter fundraising campaign for its release after the missing master tapes were found and acquired from Sony. They also used the opportunity to release a collection of outtakes called Scrapple. A very prolific band, numerous other compilations of unreleased recordings circulate among fans. =Solo projects= Matt Brown's solo album Morning After Medicine Show, recorded with producer Rick Neigher, drummers Pete Thomas and Dan McCarroll, and keyboardist Rami Jaffee, was recorded in 1999 and also saw limited release in 2011. Several other unreleased solo projects circulate. Brown toured as a musician for Brad in 1997, and produced the album Eleven Emergency Lessons for indie-rock band Amphibian Skin, headed by songwriter Michael Wescott, in 2003. Jensen and McDade also perform on the record. McDade's drums can also be heard on Atlanta musician Paul Melan√ßon's album, Camera Obscura, released by Daemon Records in 2002. In 2014 Brown produced a record by Nancy Gardos called The Grand View. =Reunions= In 2005 and in 2006, as 3 lb. Thrill and Uncle Green respectively, the band reunited for special performances at Smith's Olde Bar in Atlanta and Eddie's Attic in Decatur, Georgia. In 2009, Brown played a rare solo set, opening for Jon Auer at Eddie's Attic. McDade played percussion and Jensen provided occasional backing vocals. In February 2012, performing simultaneously as both Uncle Green and 3 lb. Thrill, the band came together for a show at Smith's Olde Bar to celebrate the release of Rycopa. In April 2012, Matt Brown created the Facebook Theme Music Group, which quickly grew from a handful of musicians to over 800 members by its one-year anniversary in April 2013. Members include Jeff Jensen and Pete McDade of Uncle Green as well as professional and amateur musicians from the United States, Europe, and Australia.

The group comprised Alan Nelson, a seminal member of many local Vancouver rock and punk groups, on vocals, with cEvin Key and D.R. Goettel on instruments. Description Originally named The Flu, the group was assembled whenever cEvin and Dwayne lived temporarily in Toronto while away from touring/recording with Skinny Puppy. They released a few cassettes in Europe, composed of material that was very much a precursor to Hilt. In 1989, Key and Goettel's label Nettwerk made a bet with the group that they could not produce and record an album for a low budget, reputedly $15,000. They accepted, and the result is the lo-fi debut Call the Ambulance (Before I Hurt Myself). An EP followed in 1991, entitled Orange Pony, with the follow-up LP Journey to the Center Of the Bowl. During the years of 1992-1995, Key and Goettel focused on Skinny Puppy, putting Hilt on the side. After the untimely ends of both Skinny Puppy and Goettel, Key continued recording his many side projects, which included Hilt. Sessions with Al Nelson continued in 1996, with three songs recorded as a result. Al Nelson died from complications due to diabetes on January 23, 2000. Key lamented (verbatim): \\"Al was the nicest and most real person I have ever known. He had a sense of humour that could make anyone smile. He was incredibly talented. He was very dedicated to his friends, and his heart was beautiful. He will be greatly missed.\\" In 2003, Key released The Worst Of the Flu, an odds-and-ends collection of unreleased and alternate tracks by Hilt and the Flu recorded from 1985-1990. Another recording, Minoot Bowl Dropped the Ball, featuring material of a similar ilk to Worst of the Flu, was released in 2007. According to Key, approximately seven LPs worth of material were recorded in the above time period, and may see the light of day in the future.

It is located to the northeast of Haiti's capital city, Port-au-Prince. Originally located on the shore, it was relocated inland after the 1770 Port- au-Prince earthquake. Due to this fact, it was not as badly affected in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The city will be home to refugee tent villages of about 10,000 refugees each when the first wave of refugees begins to be resettled there. Culture Croix-des-Bouquets is a northern suburb in the Port-au- Prince metropolitan area. Haiti is world-famous for its exuberant art, richly influenced by nature, history and religion, both Christian and Vodou. The entire village of Croix des Bouquets is a good example of Haitian creativity - it resonates with the sounds of clanging and banging of the mallets and chisels in the process of transforming raw metal into stunning, and often haunting, iron sculptures. The city of Croix-des-Bouquets is on the Plaine du Cul-de-Sac, where many people grow organic foods such as beans, sweet potato, and corn. People *Wyclef Jean, a Haitian rapper, musician and member of the trio the Fugees, was born in Croix-des-Bouquets, where he lived until he was nine years old. * Junior Galette, a Haitian-American professional football player, was born in Croix-Des-Bouquets, where he lived until he was 8 years old. History On March 22, 1792, the city was the scene of one of the first battles of the Haitian Revolution. Prior to the 12 January 2010 earthquake, the once crowded city had been restored. The streets had been cleaned up, wholesale merchants and other commerce had been relocated to Port-au-Prince. Retail commerce which once crowded sidewalks downtown now had a dedicated building. In the wake of the 12 January 2010 quake, the Cuban medical mission set up a field hospital in the region.Caribbean Net News, \\"Cuba to open fifth field hospital in Haiti\\", 5 February 2010 (accessed 5 February 2010) Education One school close by is An√≠s Zun√∫z√≠ Bah√°'√≠ School to the north east which opened its doors in 1980 which survived the 2010 Haiti earthquake and its staff were cooperating in relief efforts and sharing space and support with neighbors. A clinic was run at the school by a medical team from the United States and Canada. Currently it is a K-10 school and offers classes to transition from Haitian Creole to the French language but also a secondary language in English. The founders of Institution Chr√©tienne D'Ha√Øti are seeking to build the Universit√© Chr√©tienne D'Ha√Øti here. Another organization is the Haitian-American Caucus (HAC), which runs the √âcole Shalom des Fr√®res (Peace Be With You School of Brothers) in Michaud, a small community in Croix- des-Bouquets. The school is also known as the Alpha Academy and is funded in part by Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. This school was established in 2003 and as of school year 2010-2011, 75 students were enrolled. HAC is only able to accept additional students through child education sponsorships and partnerships with other organizations. Students can be sponsored for $125 a year. M.A.D.E has joined HAC in providing 3 vegetarian meals a week for students. The school also offers community English courses taught by Haitians who went through previous versions of the course, and supplemented with the help of English-speaking volunteers.

The , right-hander was signed by the Boston Braves as an amateur free agent before the 1942 season. He played for the Boston Braves (1950, 1952), Milwaukee Braves (1953‚Äì1958), and Baltimore Orioles (1959). Biography =Playing career= After serving three years in the U.S. Marine Corps, Johnson made his major league debut in relief on April 28, 1950, against the Philadelphia Phillies at Shibe Park. His first big league win was also in relief, coming against the New York Giants on June 30, 1950, at the Polo Grounds. Johnson led Western League pitchers with a .750 winning percentage while playing for the Denver Bears in 1949. He spent part of 1950 in the Eastern League and all of 1951 in the American Association before returning to the major leagues for good in 1952. He started 10 games for Boston in 1952 and then appeared almost exclusively in relief thereafter. He led American Association pitchers with a .789 winning percentage and an ERA of 2.62 while playing for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1951. From 1953 to 1957, the first five years that the Braves were in Milwaukee, Johnson led the pitching staff with 175 relief appearances, an average of 35 per season. He was followed closely behind by Dave Jolly, who relieved in 158 games during that five-year span. During those seasons the closer's job was held at different times by Lew Burdette, Johnson, Jolly, and Don McMahon. Johnson had an important role on the 1957 World Series Champion Braves with a 7‚Äì3 record and four saves in 30 games. In three World Series appearances against the New York Yankees that October he gave up only one run in seven innings, but it happened to be a game-winning home run by Hank Bauer in the seventh inning of Game 6. In nine seasons, Johnson had a losing record only once (1955) and had an overall winning percentage of .635. Career totals include a record of 40‚Äì23 in 273 games, 19 games started, three complete games, one shutout, 119 games finished, 19 saves, and an ERA of 3.77. =Broadcasting career= Following his playing days Johnson was a longtime color commentator and play-by-play broadcaster on Braves radio and television, working from 1962 to 1999. He became an icon in Atlanta after the team moved there in 1966, and in the 1980s gained national exposure through his work with Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren on \\"Superstation\\" TBS. He was elected to the Braves' Hall of Fame on August 24, 2001. His son, Ernie Johnson Jr., worked with him on SportSouth telecasts from 1993 to 1996. The broadcast booth at Atlanta's Turner Field bears his name. In 2014, Johnson was inducted into the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame. =Death= Johnson died on August 12, 2011, after a long illness.

Biography He was born at Huntingdon, Pennsylvania on 10 September 1867. He graduated from Phillips Academy in 1886 and from Princeton in 1889, and studied at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1890‚Äì91. He became active as an itinerant recruiter for the Student Volunteer Movement (SVM) from 1889 to 1890. In 1891, he was appointed secretary of the American Presbyterian Mission. He visited missions in Persia, India, China, Korea, and Japan in 1896‚Äì97, and in South America in 1909 and later made similar tours. In Princeton he was greatly influenced by Arthur Tappan Pierson. Under his leadership, the foreign missions of the Presbyterian church became remarkably successful. Speer retired in 1937. He married Emma Doll Bailey in 1893 and, together, they had five children, one of whom, Elliot Speer (1898 - 1934), became headmaster of Northfield Mount Hermon School, where he was murdered in his home on campus, on 14 September 1934.Madera Tribune, Volume LXX, Number 22, 26 May 1937; California Digital Newspaper Collection. He died on 3 November 1947, in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania.  Theology  Although he published two articles in The Fundamentals,Chapter 28 \\"God in Christ the Only Revelation of the Fatherhood of God\\" (originally, Chapter III Volume III, pp.61-75) and Chapter 54 \\"Foreign Missions, or World-Wide Evangelism\\" (originally, Chapter IV Volume ?, pp.64-84) some have called him liberal because he sided with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and opposed John Gresham Machen during the anti-liberal/modernist controversies of the 1930s.1933 Book reviewMachen-Speer Debate‚ÄìHistoric Event in Presbyterian Church Christianity Today 3.12 (Mid-April 1933): 19-2 Speer affirmed traditional Christian doctrines such as the historical accuracy of the Bible, the Virgin Birth, and the Resurrection of Christ, yet also embraced a social vision of Christianity placed him closer to theological liberals than some conservatives would tolerate.Bradley J. Longfield, \\"The Presbyterian Controversy: Fundamentalists, Modernists, and Moderates\\" (New York ; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 7 He is quoted to have said that Karl Barth offered \\"an essential recovery of aspects of truth which will not so easily be lost again.\\"  Influence  Speer wrote numerous sermons, articles, pamphlets, and books among which biographies, biblical commentaries and Christian living. Most deal with missionary principles and practices but some tackle controversial social problems. He coined the famous four principes of Jesus which became embedded in Moral Rearmament and in the Alcoholic Anonymous as the \\"Four Absolutes\\" or the \\"Four Standards\\". Basing his views on his own biblical research, Speer regarded these four principles as one of Jesus' key teachings: Purity, Honesty, Unselfishness and Love. While the initiator of those movements, Dr Frank Buchman, held Robert E. Speer in high regard, he used a version of the four principles which had been reworked by Pr Henry Burt Wright from Yale.

It is notable for marking the beginnings of Millais's move away from the highly medievalist Pre-Raphaelitism of his early years. Effie Gray, who later left her husband for the artist, modelled for the principal figure. The painting depicts the wife of a rebel Scottish soldier, who has been imprisoned after the Jacobite rising of 1745, arriving with an order securing his release. She holds her child, showing the order to a guard, while her husband embraces her. The Illustrated London News reviewed the painting as follows: :It is time now that we speak of Millais ‚Äì Millais the Pre-Raffaelite; the \\"pretender\\" Millais that was; the \\"usurper\\" Millais that is; the \\"legitimate\\" Millais that perhaps (much virtue in that little word) may be; and who has certainly a larger crowd of admirers in his little corner in the Middle Room than all the Academicians put together command; ‚Ä¶ :Truth to say, Mr. Millais, in this \\"Order of Release\\" (265), has achieved for himself an \\"order of merit\\" worth more than any academic honour, and has earned a fame which a whole corporate academy might be proud to portion amongst its constituent members. Whilst we admit ‚Äì nay assert this ‚Äì we would by no means wish to be understood as enrolling ourselves incontinently of this young artist's \\"party\\" (for there is partisanship in everything, even in art); but simply as asserting that Pre- Raffaelitism (or rather the artists who have been foolishly styled Pre- Raffaelites) is a \\"great fact\\", and perhaps may lead to the regeneration of art in this country; ‚Ä¶ :The subject is simply that of a wife, with child in her arms, coming with an order of release for her husband, who has been taken in the Civil Wars. The husband, overcome with emotions, and weak from a recent wound (his arm is in a sling), can but fall upon her neck and weep; moan, \\"firm of purpose\\", sheds no tear; she has none to shed; but her eye is red and heavy with weeping and waking; and she looks at the stern and unconcerned gaoler with a proud look, expressing that she has won the reward for all her trouble past. The colouring, the textural execution, are marvellous (for these degenerate days).Illustrated London News, 7 May, 1853 The dark, generalised background is a departure from the highly detailed backgrounds of earlier works such as Ophelia, as is the emphatic chiaroscuro. However, the portrayal of tense relationships disrupted by historical dramas was a continuation of the theme of A Huguenot and The Proscribed Royalist, 1651. While working on the painting, Millais began to develop a friendship with Effie, the wife of his principal supporter, the critic John Ruskin. A study for the painting has a drawing of her head on one side and an image of a man kneeling in supplication to a woman on the other, labelled \\"accepted.\\" In popular culture The title of the painting was adopted for the book The Order of Release by William Milbourne James about the love triangle, and also of a radio play about it broadcast in 1998.Radio play The painting of the picture is dramatised onstage in the play Mrs Ruskin (2003) by Kim Morrissey,Text of Mrs Ruskin and in the TV series Desperate Romantics (2009).

It broadcasts classic country music. KKOW broadcasts on the frequency of 860 kHz. 860 AM is a Canadian clear-channel frequency, on which CJBC in Toronto is the dominant Class A station. It began on October 11, 1937 as KOAM, owned by E. Victor Baxter and Lester L. Cox on 790 kc. It later moved to 810 kc.. It traded off 810 kHz with KCMO (AM) in Kansas City, Missouri (now on 710 kHz) for its current location on 860 kHz. KOAM originally was an NBC affiliate, carrying programming from both the Red and Blue networks. Cox and Baxter also founded KOAM-TV in 1953, an NBC affiliate carrying secondary affiliations with CBS, ABC, and DuMont. By the end of the 1970s, KOAM adopted a country music format. It was sold to American Media Investments on May 11, 1981 . Due to the ownership split of KOAM AM-FM from KOAM-TV, its callsign changed from KOAM to KKOW on May 18, 1981. Bridging KOAM with KKOW, Dan Willis http://www.kkowradio.com/page.php?page_id=86 hosted the morning slot 6 days a week from 1964-2004, administering the Community Calendar (reading obituaries and local events), the morning polka (7:30 daily with birthday dedications, sponsored by Grimaldi's Cash Grain feedstore in Pittsburg), farm commodity reports, and \\"Trading Post\\", a live call-in show for individual buyers and sellers at 9:00). Willis also oversaw many of the live remote broadcasts and emceed events, and he promoted an annual drive to buy Christmas gifts for developmentally-disabled children that were patients in a local care facility. At its peak in the mid-1980s, KKOW was known in the Pittsburg, Kansas/Joplin, Missouri-area for gimmicks such as 30/30 news and 20/20 weather, the daily Grand Lake fishing report with elderly Oklahoma fisherman/storyteller Lee Jeffries, the giant fiberglass cow on a trailer for remote broadcasts (Burford the Hereford), and the K-Cowboy of the Day. KKOW also covered the annual Little Balkan Days Celebration. During the mid-1980s, the staff (in addition to Dan Willis) included disc jockeys Steve \\"Pazz\\" Passeri, Tim \\"Bones\\" Wallace, Vance Lewis, Jeff Freeman (Program Director), Gwen Freeman, Mike Gilmore, Randy Davis, Jeff Trout, and Carla Castle. The farm director was Hugh Robinson, and Rob Strand was the sports reporter.Freeman, Gwen. \\"KKOW 86 AM Four State Regional Recipes\\", 1984; w/ staff photo The station was run by the Freeman family through the 1980s, with Bob Freeman (a prominent outdoor sports promoter) as the General Manager. Being a CBS affiliate, KKOW aired hourly live updates from CBS' New York bureau (typically done by Douglas Edwards during weekdays), \\"Reporter's Notebook\\" with Dan Rather weekday evenings, \\"The Osgood Files\\" with humorist Charles Osgood on weekday mornings, and other network programming. KKOW was among the first stations in the area to broadcast 24 hours a day in the early 1980s, a rarity in the market. Typical 1980s sponsors included area businesses such as Cash Grain, Heidrich TV & Appliance, Castagno's, Chicken Annie's, Jim's Steak House, Colaw RV, Bowlus Sporting Goods, Lindberg Pharmacy, and Pittsburg Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, and various funeral homes. KKOW exercised a Top 40 country format in the 1980s, and heavily promoted popular acts such as the Judds that would come to Pittsburg's Memorial Auditorium to perform. AM radio stations of that era were expected to provide full-service programming as a community service, and programming unrelated to the country format aired in blocks on weekends. Prominent weekend programming included the third-party-produced \\"The Waxworks Show with Gary Hannes\\", a multi-hour big-band show on Sunday afternoons that appealed to KKOW's older audience; this aired through the 1980s.http://www.thebillmillershow.com/pages/history.php A bluegrass show followed \\"The Waxworks Show\\", and various syndicated shows aired on Sunday nights. When KKOW-FM was founded in 1986, most of the younger deejays on the AM station shifted to the FM station (notably Tim \\"Bones\\" Wallace and Rob Strand \\"the Singing Newsman\\", who co-hosted the weekday morning shift) for handling its album-oriented rock format; from there, the staff dispersed by the late 1980s/early 1990s, with the Freemans' management eventually ending. KKOW continued on with turnover of employees through the 1990s, but retained a similar contemporary country music format. Dan Willis remained on the morning show. Notable on-air talent included Tom Van Hoy (sports), Bob Capps (news), and Southeast Kansas agricultural extension agent Jake Weber (\\"Gardening with Jake\\", a Saturday morning call-in show co-hosted with Dan Willis). KKOW had over the years been modestly successful in Joplin, Missouri, but never dominated the market and remained (to an extent), a station more known for rural listership geared more for the Pittsburg-Frontenac area of southeast Kansas. In the 1990s, KKOW was being eclipsed by other competing FM stations such as KIXQ in Joplin (KIX 94). By the early 2000s, Pizza Hut entrepreneur Gene Bicknell owned American Media Investments along with KOAM-TV (reversing the 1981 split between KOAM TV and radio), and AMI acquired a number of radio stations in the Joplin-Pittsburg market with the newly relaxed ownership rules. Dan Willis retired due to a terminal illness in 2004, and he was succeeded by Dalton Windsor. The station's country music format ebbed in general, and conservative-leaning agribusiness programming was more prominent. An experiment at abandoning music altogether was attempted for approximately a year in favor of an all-talk format; this was abandoned, and a classic country (1950s-early 1990s) format was introduced in addition to the agribusiness programming and mainstays such as \\"Trading Post\\". In 2009, KKOW's newly hired general manager fired for stealing a reported sum of over $87,000 from the station to cover complusive gambling, and was convicted of embezzlement.http://www.joplinglobe.com/local/x546214081/Convicted-embezzler- to-forfeit-state-lottery-prize KKOW is the flagship station for Pittsburg State University football and basketball games. Those broadcasts also air on sister station KBZI. Programming heard on KKOW includes Coast to Coast AM, America in the Morning with Jim Bohannon, Orion Samuelson's National Farm Report, Mornings with Dalton, Trading Post, Agritalk with Mike Adams and The Sports Drive with Eddie Lomshek. Farm reports and classic country music are broadcast throughout the day.

The highway travels from its western terminus at US 78 and SR 4 at the Alabama state line west of Tallapoosa to its eastern terminus at US 29 at the South Carolina state line at the south end of Lake Hartwell. The highway is concurrent with either US 29 or US 78 for its entire length. Route description SR 8 starts at the Alabama state line west of Tallapoosa in Haralson County, and closely parallels I-20 from there into Atlanta. SR 8 heads through Bremen and crosses through Carroll County and Villa Rica and on through Douglasville in Douglas County. The highway continues through Austell in Cobb County before it reaches the City of Atlanta and Fulton County, crossing the Downtown Connector on its way into Decatur in DeKalb County. In Decatur, SR 8 turns northeast, crossing I-285 in Tucker, and paralleling I-85 through Lilburn and Lawrenceville in Gwinnett County to Auburn in Barrow County, where the highway turns southeast and heads into Winder. Continuing southeast, SR 8 makes a southern half-circle around Athens in Clarke County, just briefly touching Oconee County, before turning sharply northeast and heading through Danielsville in Madison County to Franklin Springs in Franklin County. There, the highway turns east, travels through Royston, and heads to its eastern terminus after heading through Hartwell. The following portions of SR 8 are included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility: * A small portion in Douglasville * From the US 278/SR 6 intersection in Lithia Springs, through Atlanta, to an intersection with the southern terminus of Jimmy Carter Boulevard and the northern terminus of Mountain Industrial Boulevard in Tucker * From the west end of the SR 11/SR 53 concurrency in Lawrenceville to the SR 72 intersection in the northeast part of Athens History =1920s= SR 8 was established at least as early as 1919 on its current path, except for the Lawrenceville‚ÄìAthens segment going through Winder, and the segment from Hartwell to the South Carolina state line traveling to the east-northeast. At this time, SR 34 was established from Carrollton to Villa Rica. By the end of September 1921, SR 16 was established from the Alabama state line to Carrollton. By October 1926, US 78 was designated on the path of SR 8 from the Alabama state line to Decatur and a segment west-southwest of Athens. US 29 was designated on SR 8 from Atlanta to the South Carolina state line. SR 16 from Alabama and Carrollton and SR 34 from Carrollton to Villa Rica were redesignated as a southern branch of SR 8\\\\. An unnumbered road was established from US 29/SR 8 in Hartwell east-southeast to the South Carolina state line, at a point just south-southeast of the current eastern terminus of SR 8\\\\.

In February 1932, US 19 was shifted off of SR 8 to the north; US 23 was designated on the Atlanta‚ÄìLawrenceville segment instead. The eastern part of the Carrollton‚ÄìVilla Rica segment of US 78S and the southern branch of SR 8 had a completed hard surface. Between May and August, the Villa Rica‚ÄìDouglasville segment was completed. In August, two segments were completed: the Athens‚ÄìDanielsville segment and a segment just south of the Madison‚ÄìFranklin county line. Between November 1932 and May 1933, two segments were completed: the Bremen‚ÄìVilla Rica and Danielsville‚ÄìRoyston segments. In May, the entire Alabama‚ÄìBremen segment (except for the western end) was also completed. The next month, the western terminus was also completed. The next year, another southern branch of SR 8 was established from Hartwell to the South Carolina state line on the previously unnumbered road in the area. The western terminus of the original southern branch had a completed hard surface. About two years later, the segment of the southern branch from the Alabama state line to Carrollton was completed. In 1938, US 78S was redesignated as US 78 Alt., and US 78N was redesignated as the mainline US 78. By the middle of 1939, US 23 was shifted off of SR 8, to the north. =1940s and 1950s= In 1942, the southern branch of SR 8 from Hartwell to the South Carolina state line was decommissioned. Between November 1946 and February 1948, the southern branch of SR 8 from Alabama to Villa Rica was redesignated as SR 8 Alt. US 29 in the Decatur area was split into two paths: the original was a direct path from Atlanta to Lawrenceville; the northern branch bypassed the city with SR 8 Spur; both branches were designated US 29. In 1952, US 78 Alt., as well as the northern branch of US 29, was decommissioned. The next year, the northern branch of US 29 was reinstated. Between September 1953 and June 1954, the original branch of US 29 in the Decatur area was redesignated as US 29 Bus. By June 1955, US 278 was designated on SR 8 from Austell to southeast of Avondale Estates. =1960s= Between the beginning of 1956 and the beginning of 1961, US 29's path between Hartwell to the South Carolina state line was shifted southeast, off of SR 8 and onto SR 181; the formation of Lake Hartwell truncated SR 8. Between June 1960 and June 1963, a bypass of the northern part of Athens, designated as SR 350, was established and paved as a divided highway from US 129/SR 15 in the north-central part of the city to US 29/SR 8 in the northeastern part. By the beginning of 1966, SR 8 was routed on US 29 Bus. in the Decatur area. SR 350 was upgraded to a freeway. It was under construction on a path southwest to US 29/US 78/SR 8/SR 10 in the western part of the city. US 29 was shifted northward, onto SR 350, from the US 29 Temp./US 129/US 441 Temp./SR 15 interchange to the Madison Avenue interchange. US 441 Temp. was designated on SR 350 from the US 29 Temp./US 129/US 441 Temp./SR 15 interchange to the US 441/SR 15 Alt. interchange. US 29/US 78/SR 8/SR 10 entered downtown Athens on Broad Street. At Milledge Avenue, US 29 temporarily ended, and US 29 Temp./US 129/US 441 Temp./SR 15 traveled to the north-northwest. At Pulaski Street, SR 8 split off US 78/SR 10 to the north-northwest. At Dougherty Street, it intersected the southern terminus of SR 15 Conn. and traveled east-northeast to SR 15 Alt. (Thomas Street). SR 8/SR 15 Alt. traveled concurrently to the north-northwest and curved to the north-northeast on Madison Avenue. SR 15 Alt. split off at Hobson Avenue, and SR 8 continued to its interchange with US 29/SR 350. In 1966, SR 350 was decommissioned. US 29/SR 8 was shifted northwest, onto the western part of the freeway. The former path through downtown, on US 78/SR 10, was redesignated as SR 8 Bus. US 29 Temp. was decommissioned. The freeway was extended eastward one exit. SR 8 was extended on this freeway to the new exit and resumed its northeastern path. SR 106 was extended on US 29 to the Athens freeway, at the US 29/SR 8/SR 8 Bus. interchange. The next year, US 29 and SR 72 were both shifted onto the new path of SR 8 in the northeastern part of Athens to the freeway. =1970s and 1980s= In 1976, SR 72 was proposed to be extended south-southeast and then south-southwest to US 78/SR 10 in the southeast part of Athens and then southwest and west-southwest to US 129/US 441/SR 15 in the southern part of the city. The next year, SR 8 east-northeast of Hartwell was shifted southeast, onto US 29/SR 181\\\\. Its former path was redesignated as SR 8 Spur. In 1980, the freeway in Athens was completed on the eastern, southeastern, and southern parts of the city, with US 129/US 441/SR 15 designated on these segments. The next year, the eastern part of the freeway, north of US 78/SR 10, was downgraded to a divided highway. In 1983, the southwestern part of the freeway, designated as SR 732, was proposed to connect both ends of it. In 1985, US 29 Bus. in the Decatur area was decommissioned, with SR 8 shifted northwest, onto the US 29 mainline. US 441 Temp. in Athens was decommissioned. SR 72's western terminus was truncated to its current location in the far northeastern part of Athens. In 1987, the Athens freeway was completed, with SR 10 on the southern part; its former path through downtown was redesignated as SR 10 Bus. SR 72 was re-extended to the freeway's northeastern interchange. The next year, SR 10 was shifted off of the Athens freeway through downtown, replacing SR 10 Bus. The entire freeway was designated as SR 10 Loop. US 78 was shifted from downtown to the southern part of the freeway; its former path became US 78 Bus. In 1989, a southern bypass of the Dacula‚ÄìAthens area, designated as SR 817, was proposed from US 29/SR 8/SR 316 west-southwest of Dacula to the southwest corner of the Athens freeway. =1990s and 2000s= In 1990, SR 181's western terminus was truncated to its current location, an intersection with US 29/SR 8 east- southeast of Hartwell, and off of US 29/SR 8. The next year, SR 817's path from west-southwest of Dacula to SR 11 north of Bethlehem was completed as an eastern extension of SR 316\\\\. In the Athens area, the paths of SR 15 and SR 15 Alt. were swapped. In 1993, SR 817's path from north of Bethlehem to US 78/SR 10 southeast of Bogart was also completed as an eastern extension of SR 316, with US 29 shifted onto the entire length. SR 8 was shifted onto US 29/SR 316 from southeast of Russell to southeast of Bogart. In 1995, US 29/SR 8 was shifted to southern part of the Athens freeway. SR 72 was again truncated to its current western terminus. The next year, SR 817's path in the southwestern part of Athens was completed as an eastern extension of SR 316, with US 29/US 78/SR 8 concurrent with it. In 2001, US 129/US 441/SR 15 was shifted onto the freeway, in the south-central part of its path, for a concurrency with the freeway for less than . They split off onto Macon Highway. The next year, US 129/US 441/SR 15 was shifted off of Macon Highway and onto the Athens freeway. In 2004, the unsigned state highway designation SR 422 was applied to the freeway. Major intersections Special routes =Carroll County alternate route= State Route 8 Alternate (SR 8 Alt.) was an alternate route of SR 8 that existed completely within Carroll County. The roadway that would eventually become SR 8 Alt. was established at least as early as 1919 as SR 34 from Carrollton to Villa Rica. By the end of September 1921, SR 16 was established from the Alabama state line to Carrollton. By October 1926, SR 16 from Alabama to Carrollton and SR 34 from Carrollton to Villa Rica were redesignated as a southern branch of SR 8. By the middle of 1930, US 78 was split into two Divided U.S. Routes: US 78S was designated on the southern branch of SR 8. By the beginning of 1932, the entire Carrollton‚ÄìVilla Rica segment (except for its eastern end) had a \\"completed hard surface\\". In February 1932, the eastern part of the Carrollton‚ÄìVilla Rica segment of US 78S and the southern branch of SR 8 also had a completed hard surface. In 1934, the western terminus was completed. About two years later, from the Alabama state line to Carrollton was completed. In 1938, US 78S was redesignated as US 78 Alt. Between November 1946 and February 1948, the southern branch of SR 8 from Alabama to Villa Rica was redesignated as SR 8 Alt. In 1952, US 78 Alt. was decommissioned. Between September 1953 and June 1954, SR 8 Alt. was decommissioned =Villa Rica connector route= State Route 8 Connector (SR 8 Conn.) is a connector route for SR 8 that exists entirely within the city limits of Villa Rica. It is known as Liberty Road for its entire length. It begins at an interchange with Interstate 20 (I-20) in the eastern part of the city. Here, Liberty Road continues to the south-southeast. It travels to the north-northeast and curves to a nearly due-north direction. Almost immediately, it intersects the southern terminus of Mirror Lake Boulevard. Here, the connector turns right. It travels to the east-northeast and curves to the north-northwest. It then meets its northern terminus, an intersection with US 78/SR 8 (Bankhead Highway). Between the beginning of 1995 and the beginning of 2009, SR 8 Conn. was established from I-20 to US 78/SR 8, at the location of the current Colonel R. H. Burson Bridge. By 2013, the northern terminus of the connector route was shifted eastward on a curve. =Decatur spur route= State Route 8 Spur (SR 8 Spur) was a short-lived spur route of SR 8 that existed almost entirely within the city limits of Decatur. Between the beginning of 1945 and November 1946, it was established on a northern branch of US 29 (Scott Boulevard) between two intersections with US 29/SR 8 west-southwest of the city and north-northeast of it. In 1952, the northern branch of US 29 was decommissioned. The next year, this branch route was reinstated. Between September 1953 and June 1954, SR 8 Spur was decommissioned. =Athens business loop= State Route 8 Business (SR 8 Bus.) was a business route of SR 8 that existed entirely within the city limits of Athens. It traveled along the route of what is now US 78 Bus./SR 10\\\\. Between 1963 and 1966, a freeway around the northern side of Athens (present-day SR 10 Loop) was partially designated as SR 350\\\\. At this time, US 29, US 78, SR 8, and SR 10 traveled on what is now US 78 Bus. At Milledge Avenue, US 29 temporarily ended. at this intersection, US 29 Temp. turned off onto US 129/US 441 Temp./SR 15\\\\. US 78, SR 8, and SR 10 continued to the northeast. At Lumpkin Street, SR 15 Alt. joined the concurrency. At Thomas Street, SR 8 and SR 15 Alt. turned left and curved to the northeast onto Madison Avenue. At Hobson Avenue, SR 15 Alt. turned off, and SR 8 continued to the northeast to the interchange with US 29 and SR 350\\\\. There, SR 8 rejoined US 29. In 1966, SR 350 was completed. It was redesignated as part of US 29 and SR 8 and was extended to the east for one exit. At this time, SR 8's former path through downtown Athens was redesignated as SR 8 Bus. In 1978, SR 8 Bus. was decommissioned. =Danielsville connector route= State Route 8 Connector (SR 8 Conn.) was a short-lived connector route of SR 8 that partially existed in Danielsville. The highway that would eventually become SR 8 Conn. was established at least as early as 1919 as part of SR 36 between Ila and an intersection with SR 8 in Danielsville. In 1940, this segment had a \\"completed hard surface\\". By the end of 1946, SR 98 through Danielsville had been moved to a western bypass of the city. Its former path through the city was redesignated as SR 8 Conn. northwest of the city. Between February 1948 and April 1949, SR 98 Conn. was extended through the city of Danielsville, absorbing the entire length of SR 8 Conn. =Royston spur route= State Route 8 Spur (SR 8 Spur) was a spur route of SR 8 that existed entirely within the city limits of Royston. Between 1939 and 1950, it was established from US 29/SR 8 to SR 17. In 1985, it was decommissioned. =Hartwell spur route= State Route 8 Spur (SR 8 Spur) was a short-lived spur route of SR 8 that partially existed in Hartwell. In 1977, SR 8's path east of Hartwell was shifted southeast onto the path of US 29/SR 181, between Hartwell and the South Carolina state line. Its former path became SR 8 Spur. In 1983, the spur route was decommissioned.

Primarily in the Piedmont Triad, it runs from NC 109 in Thomasville northeast to the Virginia state line in Milton. Route description NC 62's southern terminus NC 62 begins in Thomasville at the intersection of Randolph Street (NC 109) and Julian Avenue; it is from I-85 and shadows the Interstate from Thomasville to Archdale. East of Archdale, it overlaps with NC Bike Route 2 through the communities of Climax and Julian. Before the town of Alamance, the highway goes right through the middle of the Alamance Battleground (the area will be marked with several colored flags and monuments). After crossing I-40/I-85, NC 62 does a zig-zag through downtown Burlington. Continuing north of town, it goes through the communities and towns of Pleasant Grove, Jericho, and Yanceyville, before reaching the town of Milton. After crossing the Dan River, it enters the Commonwealth of Virginia; where it continues for before ending on US 58/US 360, east of Danville, Virginia. History NC 62 was an original state highway; starting from Asheboro (then NC 70, currently US 221 Business), going northeast through Liberty and Graham, and ending in Yanceyville (then NC 14, currently Main Street). In 1928, the route was extended from Asheboro to New London, and again in 1930 from Yanceyville to Milton. In 1933, the route was moved north of New London and extended to Mount Pleasant. In 1940, NC 62 was realigned to a new routing south of Pleasant Grove to its now current routing through Burlington and Archdale, ending in Thomasville at NC 109. The former route to Mount Pleasant is now part of NC 49. In 1947, NC 62 was extended into Virginia, which also created VA 62. The last change to the route was between 1954‚Äì57, between the community of Fitch to Yanceyville, moving to a new road east; leaving behind Oak View Loop Road and Badgett Sisters Parkway. Major intersections Special routes Historically there was one alternate route in New London, from 1935-1940; it was labeled as NC 62A. It was soon renumbered as NC 49A when NC 49 replaced NC 62 in the area. Later, in 1947, it would renumber again to NC 6, then finally in 1953 as an extension and terminus of NC 8.

Sabrett hot dog cart in New York City, run by a street vendor A food cart is a mobile kitchen set up on the street to prepare and sell street food to passers-by. Food carts are often found in cities worldwide selling food of every kind. Food carts come in two basic styles. One allows the vendor to sit or stand inside and serve food through a window. In the other, the vendor stands next to the cart, while all the room in the cart is used for storage and to house the cooking machinery, usually a grilling surface. The cart style is determined principally by the type of food. Food carts are different from food trucks because they do not travel under their own power. Some food carts are towed by another vehicle, while some are pushed by a human or animal. History Vietnam Railways employee sells corn from a cart The first food carts probably came into being at the time of the early Greek and Roman civilizations with traders converting old hand-carts and smaller animal-drawn carts into mobile trading units. Carts have the distinct advantage of mobility, should a location not be productive in sales, as well as for transporting goods to/from storage to the marketplace. However, the use of carts exploded with the coming of railways. Firstly, highly mobile customers required food and drink to keep them warm within the early open carriages. Secondly, locomotives needed to stop regularly to take on coal and water, and hence allow their passengers use the toilets, eat and drink. Thirdly, few early trains had any form of buffet or dining car. Finally, when passengers did arrive at their destination, or at a point when they needed to switch trains or modes of transport, some refreshment was required, particularly for poorer passengers who could not afford to stay in the railway-owned hotels. This expansion lead to a mutually successful relationship with some of the first concession stands and laws developing from mobile traders operating from restricted railway property. This form of concession based operation can be seen still in many countries, but at its most original in the under developed stations and infrastructure of Africa and Southeast Asia. The railways also brought another benefit: a plentiful supply of new suitably sized carts. Often traders requiring new carts would simply buy old railway station luggage carts and adapt them to serving food, knowing that these were sized/scaled to fit in between the necessary doors and lifts. Today the size and scale of carts has generally increased, and most are towed behind 4x4 vehicles. But hand towed food carts are still a common site where access is restricted and hungry people can be found. Modern food carts In the 21st century, innovations have included modular designed carts made with stainless steel, fiber reinforced plastic and aluminum. Some have been developed with the ability to be driven by themselves. Some food carts are associated with restaurants. Most of the food served from the cart is the same as the food in the restaurant.

Logo Dillon, Read & Co. was an investment bank based in New York City. In 1991, it was acquired by Barings Bank and, in 1997, it was acquired by Swiss Bank Corporation, which was in turn acquired by UBS in 1998. History =Carpenter & Vermilye= Dillon Read traces its roots to 1832 with the founding of the Wall Street brokerage firm Carpenter & Vermilye by Col. Washington Romeyn Vermilye, George Carpenter, and William Montgomery Vermilye. The firm was notable for selling war bonds during the U.S. Civil War. =Dillon, Read & Co.= In 1905, it was renamed after its principal partner, William A. Read. In 1921, it was renamed as Dillon, Read & Co. to include partner Clarence Dillon. The firm underwrote bonds issued by New York City and underwrote stocks and bonds of railroads and other companies. In 1921, the firm managed the rescue of faltering Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. In 1925, it engineered the buyout of Dodge Brothers and the sale of the company to Chrysler in 1928. In the 1930, it underwrote foreign bonds and arranged financing for the petroleum industry. In 1937, it underwrote the bonds used to finance the Triborough Bridge. C. Douglas Dillon, the son of Dillon Read co-founder Clarence Dillon, served as chairman of the company before serving as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under John F. Kennedy and as U.S. Undersecretary of State and U.S. Ambassador to France under Dwight Eisenhower. Nicholas F. Brady served as Chairman from 1970 to 1982, before serving as a United States Senator from New Jersey and as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. In July 1986, the company was sold by its 35 partners to The Travelers Companies for $157.5 million, which was initiated when the Bechtel family cashed out its 30% holding in February, forcing the partnership to sell to Travelers to increase their pool of capital which had been depleted by $25 million. =Barings and Swiss Bank= In 1991, the company was sold to Barings for $122 million. Barings went bankrupt and in 1995, management bought back the firm. In 1997, the company was sold to Swiss Bank Corporation in 1997 and merged with S. G. Warburg & Co., to become Warburg Dillon Read. In 1998, it became part of UBS when UBS bought SBC. =Dillon Read Capital Management= The Dillon Read name was dropped by 2000. In June 2005, UBS established Dillon Read Capital Management (DRCM), led by former UBS Investment Bank head John P. Costas. On May 3, 2007, UBS announced the closure of Dillon Read Capital Management. After profits of $1.2 billion in 2006, the division lost 150 million Swiss Francs in the first quarter of 2007, primarily due to bets on the sub-prime mortgage industry in the United States. The assets under management were transferred into UBS's main asset management business. The division had raised $1.2 billion in assets under management. In her 2008 book, UBS: les dessous d'un scandale, Myret Zaki asserted that had UBS listened to Dillon Read Management, UBS could have limited its losses from the subprime mortgage crisis to $500 million instead of $40 billion.

It deals first with the structure of historical writing about battles, the strengths and weaknesses of the \\"battle piece,\\" and then with the structure of warfare in three time periods‚Äîmedieval Europe, the Napoleonic Era, and World War I‚Äîby analyzing three battles: Agincourt, Waterloo, and the Somme, all of which involved English soldiers and occurred in approximately the same geographical area. When published, the work was groundbreaking. It does not examine the battles only from the point of view of the generals nor does it simply accumulate quotes from ordinary soldiers. Instead, it focuses on the practical mechanics of battle and critically examines popular myths about warfare. For instance, Keegan disputes the effectiveness of cavalry charges in the Middle Ages. At Agincourt, the lightly-armored archers dug stakes into the ground to impede horses, while heavy infantry who stood their ground had little to fear from cavalry. Focusing on the mechanics of battle, Keegan discusses troop spacing, the effectiveness of weapons and formations, and other measures of tactical importance. He also examines the experience of the individual soldier of the time. The book was originally published in United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by the Viking Press.

The role was originated by actress Gina Tognoni, who debuted on February 17, 1995, and played the character in her last appearance on August 24, 2011. Background and casting Heather Tom was cast in the role of Kelly in October 2003; she remained in the role until the character's exit in 2006. The role of Kelly Cramer was originally offered to Alexandra Wilson in late 1994. When she turned the role down, the role was offered to actress Gina Tognoni, who originated in the role on the episode first run on February 17, 1995. In April 2001, it was announced that Tognoni had decided not to renew her contract after six years with the soap. Following Tognoni's announcement, it was rumored that the actress would take over the role of Carly Corinthos on the ABC Daytime soap General Hospital, a role that later went to actress Tamara Braun. Tognoni vacated the role on-screen on August 14, 2001. She briefly reprised her role from December 6 to 11, 2001 and from January 16 to 21, 2002. Tognoni later went on to join the CBS Daytime soap Guiding Light in 2004, portraying the role of Dinah Marler. In June 2003, it was announced that the role of Kelly Cramer was to be brought back to the series, this time with former CBS Daytime actress Tracy Melchior, best known for her role as Kristen Forrester on The Bold and the Beautiful. Melchoir debuted in the role in July 28, 2003. In October 2003, it was announced that former The Young and the Restless actress Heather Tom would replace Melchior as Kelly. Melchior last aired on December 10, 2003, with Tom debuting a day later on December 11, 2003. In August 2006, it was announced that Tom had decided to exit from her contract to return to Los Angeles to pursue other acting opportunities. She issued a statement about her leave, saying: Tom vacated the role on-screen on December 14, 2006. During Tom's run, the actress and her One Life alter-ego crossed over to the All My Children several times starting from March 22, 2004 until February 21, 2005 during a \\"baby switch\\" storyline involving both series. In 2005 and 2007, Tom was nominated for Supporting Actress Emmys in the role, the latter for an episode where Kelly confesses to romantically bonding with the son of impotent husband Kevin Buchanan who was portrayed by Dan Gauthier; in 2007, Tom lost her award bid to original Kelly Cramer actress, Gina Tognoni, who had been nominated for her role at the time, Dinah Marler on Guiding Light. In April 2009, CBS cancelled Guiding Light; the cancellation lead to an influx of rumors that Tognoni would reprise her beloved One Life role. In June, it was reported that Tognoni was in talks with several soaps, including The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful as her post-Guiding Light gig. It was further reported that One Life had passed on signing Tognoni back to the soap. In September 2009, it was confirmed that Tognoni would reprise her role of Kelly Cramer after eight years. She returned on-screen on February 12, 2010. Following the April 2011 cancellation of One Life to Live and All My Children, it was announced that Tognoni would exit alongside co-star Tom Degnan, who was portraying Joey Buchanan at the time, and who would exit the series before its January 2012 finale. Tognoni released a statement concerning the cancellation of the soap, saying: Tognoni last aired as Kelly Cramer on August 24, 2011. One Life to Live aired its final episode on ABC on January 13, 2012. Storylines = 1995‚Äì2002 = Kelly appears on the doorstep of her aunt, Dorian Lord, in February 1995. The daughter of Dorian's younger sister Melinda, Kelly has been expelled from her Parisian boarding school. She soon befriends Jessica Buchanan, the daughter of Dorian's nemesis Victoria Lord, and later falls in love with Jessica's brother (and Dorian's former lover) Joey. Devastated over her breakup with Joey, Kelly gets into a car accident in the rain. The passenger in the other car is Kelly's cousin Blair Cramer, who loses her unborn baby (later named Brendan Thornhart). Wracked with guilt, Kelly hides her involvement; the secret is soon revealed, and she and Blair are estranged for a long time. Kelly dates wealthy Ian Armitage and inherits his fortune when he dies in a plane crash in 1998. She then becomes romantically involved with Joey and Jessica's cousin Drew Buchanan, who is also later killed in October 1998. In early 1999, Kelly has an affair with Max Holden; she later leaves him at the altar when she realizes she is still in love with Joey. Kelly's boarding school friend Grace Monroe comes to town in 1999 and becomes engaged to Joey's brother Kevin Buchanan, but is tragically drowned the same year. Kelly and Kevin console each other as she and Joey become engaged in December 1999. That New Year's Eve, Kelly and Kevin have a few drinks and kiss. They stop themselves from making love and decide not to hurt Joey by telling him about it. Joey learns of his mother's breast cancer, and he and Kelly elope on April 14, 2000. Kelly struggles with her feelings for Kevin as she tries to make her marriage work. She ultimately confesses all to Joey, and they divorce in January 2001. Joey moves to London, and Kelly begins a relationship with Kevin. When Kevin moves to Texas to be closer to his young son Duke in March 2001, Kelly follows him in August. Kelly returns for Blair's wedding to Todd Manning in December 2001, and again briefly in January 2002. = 2003‚Äì2006 = In July 2003, Kelly returned to Llanview on the heels of Kevin, now her husband. Their marriage strained, it is soon revealed that Kevin's new political career had pushed a lonely Kelly into an affair with a man named Nick Carson in Texas. Desperate to save the marriage, Kelly tries to get pregnant even though it may put her life in danger. Kevin asks for a divorce but changes his mind when Kelly becomes pregnant. While out of town in 2004, Kelly lost the baby and was sent onto the verge of a breakdown. Meanwhile, Kelly's half-brother Paul Cramer finds himself delivering the babies of both his ex-wife Babe Carey and her friend Bianca Montgomery during a rainstorm in nearby Pine Valley on March 24, 2004. Paul stages a crash with his MEDEVAC helicopter and takes Babe's son for Kelly, who is desperate for a child to save her marriage and has not yet told Kevin about the miscarriage. Paul initially tells Babe that the child had died in the accident; threatened at the scene by the powerful family of the child's father, Paul quickly changes his plan, giving Bianca's daughter to Babe and telling Bianca that her baby had died instead. Unaware of the child's origins, Kelly brings Babe's infant back to Llanview, passing him off as her child with Kevin. Kevin and Kelly name the baby Asa \\"Ace\\" Buchanan II after Kevin's grandfather. Their marriage crumbles anyway in 2005, and Kevin secures custody. Meanwhile, a devastated Kelly discovers that Paul had stolen Ace from his mother; Paul, desperate for cash, blackmails Kelly by threatening to reveal the secret to Kevin and Llanview. Armed with the truth, Kelly realizes they must return the child to his parents; though broken-hearted, they do. Kevin and Kelly begin dating again but soon break up; she briefly dates Dr. Spencer Truman and then reconciles with Kevin. After Spencer performs a new surgical procedure on Kelly that could potentially reverse her infertility, Kevin proposes. Spencer, however, enacting his vendetta against the Buchanans, exposes Kevin to a virus that renders him sterile. Kevin falls into a depression that strains his relationship with Kelly. Kevin's son Duke, now an adult, consoles Kelly and soon falls in love with her; they sleep together once before a tornado hits Llanview. Kelly and Duke are both seriously injured; with only one surgeon available, Kevin is forced to choose whether his ex-wife or son will go into surgery first. He chooses Kelly, and is devastated as Duke dies in his arms. In the wake of Duke's death, Kelly discovers that she is pregnant with his child; Kevin swears he will never forgive her, and Kelly decides to leave Llanview. Kevin has a change of heart, and convinces her to stay; he is at her side when she gives birth prematurely to a son, and they name the baby Zane. Reconciled and resigned to start over as a family, Kevin and Kelly relocate to London with Zane. = 2010‚Äì2011 = In February 2010, Kelly returns to Llanview and receives devastating news that her mother Melinda has died of a heart attack. Dorian believes that Mitch Laurence, who has threatened the Cramer women, is behind Melinda's death. Kevin proposes to Kelly on the day of her mother's funeral, but she declines. Todd tries to convince Kelly to stay in Llanview and work for him at The Sun, in part to annoy Blair; Kelly at first refuses, but is intrigued by the challenge and is soon goaded by Todd into signing a contract. Kelly subsequently receives calls from a mysterious person informing her that her mother was indeed murdered. She first enlists Todd and Detective John McBain to assist her in the investigation, and later asks private investigator Rex Balsom to help find Bennett Thompson, a man she believes murdered Melinda. Bennett is revealed to be Blair's boyfriend Elijah Clarke, and he is later killed. A lonely Kelly kisses Rex, but realizes that she is still in love with Joey. Kelly befriends a woman named Aubrey Wentworth as Joey returns to Llanview, but Kelly is soon shocked to discover that Joey and Aubrey are romantically involved. Joey's father Clint Buchanan soon discovers that Aubrey is a con artist, but Aubrey's lover and conspirator Cutter manages to destroy the evidence while Aubrey blackmails Clint into staying silent. Despite Kelly's protests, Joey marries Aubrey suddenly. A devastated Kelly falls into bed with John McBain, who is newly separated from Joey's sister Natalie. Kelly's relationship with John gains her an enemy in Marty Saybrooke, who has become mentally imbalanced and infatuated with John. On May 11, 2011, while waiting for John, Kelly is stabbed twice in the abdomen by a deranged Marty, who leaves her for dead on the bathroom floor. She is soon found by John and rushed to the hospital where the doctors reveal that she may have suffered either a liver or kidney laceration, but Kelly later recovers from her injuries, and eventually checks herself out of the hospital. Joey later finds out that Kelly was right all along about Aubrey and tells her he wants a second chance because he loves her and will divorce Aubrey. On July 21, 2011, Joey and Aubrey are officially divorced from each other, allowing both Joey and Kelly to reignite their romantic relationship with each other again. In August 2011, Kelly announces she is leaving Llanview to go back to London to be closer to her son Zane. Joey offers to go with her back to London, and she accepts his proposal. Kelly then says good-bye to her ex- boyfriend John, and encourages him to get back together with his former fiance Natalie. Kelly then learns that her aunt Dorian is also leaving town to go run for senator in Washington D.C. after the previous senator is caught in a sex scandal. Kelly joins her family to throw a good-bye party for Dorian before she leaves town. Kelly then leaves with Joey to go back to London to be with her son Zane.

His father was psychiatrist Johann Baptist Friedreich (1796‚Äì1862), and his grandfather was pathologist Nicolaus Anton Friedreich (1761‚Äì1836), who is remembered for his early description of idiopathic facial paralysis, which would later be known as Bell's palsy.Bell's paralysis @ Who Named It  Biography  In the early part of his career he studied and practiced medicine at the University of W√ºrzburg under the tutelage of noted men such as physiologist Albert von K√∂lliker and pathologist Rudolf Virchow. He later became a professor of pathological anatomy at W√ºrzburg, then in 1858 was appointed a professor of pathology and therapy at the University of Heidelberg, where he remained for the rest of his career. Some of his better known students and assistants included Adolf Kussmaul, Wilhelm Heinrich Erb and Friedrich Schultze. Friedreich was involved in the establishment of pathological correlations, notably in research of muscular dystrophy, spinal ataxia and brain tumors. He is remembered today for \\"Friedreich's ataxia\\", which he identified in 1863. It is a degenerative disease with sclerosis of the spinal cord that affects a person's speech, balance and coordination.  Associated eponyms  * \\"Friedreich's ataxia\\": a genetic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an unusual gait pattern * \\"Friedreich's disease\\" or Friedreich's syndrome (paramyoclonus multiplex): an hereditary disease characterized by brief, sudden muscular contractions in the proximal muscles of the extremities. * \\"Friedreich's foot\\" or pes cavus: abnormally high arches in the feet. * \\"Friedreich's sign\\": collapse of cervical veins that were previously distended during diastole (heart relaxation), and is caused by an adherent pericardium. * \\"Friedreich's sound change\\": term for difference in tension (pitch of percussion note) in the cavum wall during expiration and inspiration. * \\"Friedreich-Auerbach disease\\": hypertrophy of the tongue, ears and facial features.

Hackett (born 1960) is an American economist, and Professor of Economics at Humboldt State University (HSU), known for his contributions to the fields of environmental and natural resources economics.  Biography  Born and raised in Arcata, California in 1960, Hackett obtained his BS in Agricultural Business and Economics at the Montana State University in 1983. He then moved to the Texas A&M; University, where he obtained his MS in economics 1986, and his PhD in economics in 1989. Hackett began his academic career at the rank of Assistant Professor at Indiana University in Bloomington in 1989. In 1994 he then moved to the Humboldt State University, where he started as Assistant Professor at its School of Business and Economics. There in 1997 he became Associate Professor, and in 2002 Professor at the Department of Economics. At the Humboldt State University among others Hackett was co- founder of the Humboldt Economic Index, which he directed from 1996 to 2002. In 2002 he was founding Director of its Office for Economic, Community, and Business Development. He chaired the Department of Economics first time in the years 2004-2006, secondly in 2013-2016, and again since 2017.Steven C. Hackett, \\"Abridged cv,\\" at users.humboldt.edu. Accessed 26-05-2017  Work  = Early research = Early on Hackett's research was focused on the economic performance of contractual relationships, such as the social dilemmas associated with common-pool resources like oil and gas fields, groundwater basins or marine fisheries. Self-interested or opportunistic behavior in these circumstances can result in inferior economic outcomes. This work began at Texas A&M; and was further cultivated by his affiliation with Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom's Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis while a member of the graduate faculty at Indiana University in Bloomington.Workshop publications. He was particularly interested in the challenges of structuring successful agreements capable of preventing opportunistic behavior when stakeholders are heterogeneous, or have made prior relationship-specific investments (research influenced by the work of Nobel Laureate Oliver Williamson).JLEO 10(2). Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization. His research approaches involved developing theoretical models and evaluating testable hypotheses through the use of laboratory experimental methods.Economic Inquiry 31(2). Economic Inquiry. Another line of his research involved the use of economic modeling approaches to understand the political economy of environmental regulation. In several papers Hackett and collaborators investigated how voluntary actions by firms to limit pollution can have strategic value relative to competitors, or as a way of shaping future regulatory policy. In another line of research Hackett and colleagues developed a model for the partial deregulation of critical energy markets, such as for natural gas, and identified some of the hazards associated with applying that model to electricity deregulation.Journal of Law and Economics 43(2). University of Chicago Journals -- Journal of Law and Economics. Hackett's curiosity about contracting problems also resulted in papers on diverse topics such as revenue-sharing problems in medical group practices, and factors that influence foreign direct investment decisions by multinational firms. = More recent research = More recently Hackett has worked collaboratively on a number of projects addressing marine fishery economics and policy and renewable energy.

Family Keely's family have played League of Ireland football at various levels. His late father Peter Keely played for Shelbourne., his brother Joe played on the same Home Farm FAI Cup winning side of 1975 as Dermot himself. And his son Alan Keely also played in the League of Ireland.  Career  =Player= As a player Keely started with Home Farm and then signed for St. Patrick's Athletic under Barry Bridges who appointed him club captain. He played with Terry Venables while at Richmond Park (football ground). In June 1977 he was about to depart for Adelaide on a 2-year contract when the deal fell through. He then moved to Dundalk where he made his debut against Shamrock Rovers in September 1978. In his first season the County Louth outfit won the domestic double. In 1981 Keely captained Dundalk to win the FAI Cup. The League Cup was also won this season. Keely then signed for Glentoran in the Irish League where in his two seasons there he won the Irish Cup, a Gold Cup and an Ulster Cup. Keely's time with Dundalk and Glentoran saw him play in notable European Cup ties. In 1979, Dundalk reached the second round of the 1979‚Äì80 European Cup and were drawn with Celtic. The first leg saw Dundalk produce a notable display to come away with a 3‚Äì2 defeat at Parkhead. In the return leg in front of a packed Oriel Park with Keely as captain, Dundalk missed a last-minute opportunity to win the tie on away goals and the game finished 0‚Äì0 . This is regarded as one of the best performances by a League of Ireland club in European competition. Two years later, Keely played his part in Glentoran's run to the second round of the European Cup. In the first leg against CSKA Sofia, they lost 2‚Äì0. However, the return leg saw Glentoran take a 2‚Äì0 lead, forcing the game into extra time. With only five minutes remaining, CSKA scored the goal they needed. The tie finished 3‚Äì2 on aggregate, which had been the closest Glentoran came to reaching the last eight of European competition since 1974. =Player-manager= Keely's first managerial job was as UCD player-manager. However, after just two months at Belfield Jim McLaughlin (football manager) persuaded Keely to sign for Shamrock Rovers. He made his debut against Athlone Town in November 1983. He scored his first goal for Rovers in a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Shelbourne at Harold's Cross on 11 December 1983. When McLaughlin left at the end of the 1985/86 season to manage his home club Derry City Dermot was appointed player-manager on 16 May. In the 1986/87 season, Rovers owners controversially announced the sale of Glenmalure Park near the end of season. However, Rovers won another double in this their final season at Milltown to bring Keely's Rovers haul to 4 League championships and 3 FAI Cups. The 1987/88 season started with Rovers controversially playing at Tolka Park. Rovers fans boycotted the ground en masse. Every game was picketed and with the crowds practically gone the team invariably suffered. Keely was quoted years later as saying: He resigned after the last game of the season on 8 April 1988. During his time at Rovers he won one Inter-League cap and represented the club 6 times in European competition. In May 1988 Keely signed for Bray Wanderers However, he never played for the Seasiders and by November Keely was player/assistant manager to Ray Treacy at Home Farm F.C.. =Manager= He then took over as manager of Sligo Rovers in 1989 and achieved promotion in his first season. He guided Sligo Rovers to their highest Premier Division place in a decade in the 1990/91 season by finishing 5th. After a brief spell at Longford Town he took over at Dundalk where he won the League Championship in 1995. He then guided Finn Harps to promotion to the Premier Division in 1996. After managing Athlone Town he took over the reins at Home Farm Everton where he won the League of Ireland First Division Shield in 1998. In the calendar year 1996 Keely managed four clubs: Dundalk, Finn Harps, Athlone Town and Home Farm. He took over as manager of Shelbourne in July 1998 Irish Times ‚Äì 1998 and won two championships (1999‚Äì2000 and 2001‚Äì02) and one FAI Cup (2000) in his time at Tolka Park. He also guided Shels to victory over Macedonian side Sloga Jugomagnat in the first round of the 2000‚Äì01 UEFA Champions League qualifiers. Shels 1‚Äì0 win in the first leg in Skopje was the first away win for a League of Ireland side in any UEFA competitions for eighteen years. Keely then became the first manager of new league club Kildare County in 2002. After a credible 5th-place finish he then walked out to manage Derry City lasting only 3 monthsBBC News ‚Äì Dermot Keely has resigned as Derry City manager After a spell out of the game he then took over at Dublin City.euFootball.biz ‚Äì Irish Dublin City is out of business He then took over the management position at Shelbourne FC in 2007 and in his first season back finished fifth in the first division. In his second season in charge, Shelbourne lead the division going into the final game, and needed a home win against mid-table Limerick to gain promotion, but were denied by a 92nd-minute equaliser, and so were overhauled by Dundalk, who won away to Kildare County. On 27 May 2010, Keely stepped down as manager of Shelbourne to become Shelbourne's youth team manager and community development officer. Keely has also been working as a Maths and English teacher in De La Salle College Churchtown for over 20 years until he retired at Christmas 2011 he also has a weekly column in the Irish Sun.

It is the highest peak located entirely in the canton of Berne. The Schreckhorn is the northernmost Alpine four-thousander and the northernmost summit rising above 4,000 metres in Europe.  Geography  The Schreckhorn is located 10 km south-east of Grindelwald between the Upper and Lower Grindelwald Glacier. The region is made up of uninhabited glacial valleys, the great Aar Glaciers and the Fiescher Glacier. The summit of the Lauteraarhorn is located very close and reaches almost the same altitude. The highest peak of the Bernese Alps, the Finsteraarhorn lies 6 km to the south. Geologically the Schreckhorn is part of the Aarmassif.  Climbing history View of the Schreckhorn from the Eismeer station on the Jungfraujoch railway The first ascent was on 16 August 1861 by Leslie Stephen, Ulrich Kaufmann, Christian Michel and Peter Michel. Their route of ascent, via the upper Schreck Couloir to the Schrecksattel and then by the south-east ridge, was the normal route for the following fifty years, but is now seldom used. The peak had been attempted several times before this, most notably by the Swiss naturalist Joseph Hugi in 1828 and the guided party of Pierre Jean √âdouard Desor (a Swiss geologist) in 1842. 'The ambition of hoisting the first flag on the Schreckhorn, the one big Bernese summit which was untrodden, was far too obvious for us to resist', Desor later wrote, but they climbed a secondary summit of the Lauteraarhorn by mistake. The first ascent by the south-west ridge (AD+) ‚Äì the normal route by which the Schreckhorn is climbed ‚Äì was made by John Wicks, Edward Branby and Claude Wilson on 26 July 1902. They decided to climb the very steep ridge without the help of local guides and succeeded in reaching the summit. The north-west ridge (the Andersongrat, D) was first climbed by John Stafford Anderson and George Percival Baker, with guides Ulrich Almer and Aloys Pollinger on 7 August 1883.Helmut Dumler,Willi P.

It travels the entire length of the state from south to north, connecting the Florida state line with the North Carolina state line, roughly bisecting the state into two equal parts. It travels through Warner Robins, Macon, and Gainesville It is the longest route in the state. The portion from the southeastern city limits of Monticello to the Jasper‚ÄìNewton county line is included in the Monticello Crossroads Scenic Byway. Route description The route begins at the Florida state line south of Statenville. The route travels north concurrent with US 129 through Statenville, Lakeland, Nashville, Ocilla, Fitzgerald, and Abbeville, before arriving in Hawkinsville. In Hawkinsville, SR 11 departs US 129 and runs concurrent with US 341 northwest to Perry. There, SR 11 departs and runs concurrent with US 41, and eventually, US 129 again, north to Macon. SR 11 leaves Macon concurrent with US 129 and SR 22. In Gray, SR 11 departs, and travels north, without being concurrent with a U.S. Highway. In Jefferson, the route again runs concurrent with US 129. The two routes continue north, passing through Gainesville. Further north, SR 11 and US 129 are joined by US 19. The three routes climb over and descend the mountains, and continues north to the North Carolina state line, where SR 11 meets its northern terminus. The following portions of SR 11 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: * The segment concurrent with US 341 from Hawkinsville to Perry and US 341 Byp. in Perry * From the split of US 80/SR 87 and US 129/SR 11 in Downtown Macon over the Ocmulgee River to the point where it leaves the northern city limits of the city * From the southern intersection with US 29 Bus./SR 8 and SR 53 to the intersection with SR 82 in Winder * From the southern end of its concurrency with US 129 in Jefferson to its northern terminus History =1920s= SR 11 was established at least as early as 1919. It started at an intersection with SR 7 at the Florida state line, southwest of Statenville and ended at SR 12 in Covington. It was also designated from SR 12 in Social Circle through Gainesville and north-northwest to SR 9 in Dahlonega. There was no indication if the two segments were connected via a concurrency with SR 12 or if they were separate. By the end of 1921, both segments were indicated to be connected by a concurrency with SR 12 between Covington and Social Circle. The portions of SR 11 and SR 43 north of Gainesville were swapped. That meant that SR 11 headed north-northeast from Gainesville to Cleveland, then west-northwest to SR 9 in Turners Corner. SR 9 and SR 11 traveled concurrently north-northeast and then north-northwest to Blairsville, where SR 9 ended. Then, SR 11 had a western curve before reaching the North Carolina state line. By the end of 1926, SR 11's southern terminus was then at the Florida state line, but south-southeast of Statenville. US 341 was designated on the Hawkinsville‚ÄìPerry segment. US 41 was designated on the Perry‚ÄìMacon segment. US 129 was designated on two segments: the Macon‚ÄìGray and Jefferson‚ÄìGainesville segments. US 270 was designated on the Gainesville‚ÄìNorth Carolina segment. SR 12 between Covington and Social Circle was shifted southeast and off of SR 11\\\\. Three segments had a \\"completed hard surface\\": from Ocilla to Fitzgerald, from Echeconnee to east-northeast of Macon, and in the north-northeast part of Gainesville. Three segments had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\": a segment south-southwest of Echeconnee, from just east of the White‚ÄìLumpkin county line to Turners Corner, and from just north of Turners Corner to North Carolina. Six segments had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface: from east-northeast of Macon to Gray, from south of Monticello to north- northwest of that city, a small portion southeast of Covington, from Monroe to Jefferson, nearly the entire Hall County portion of the Jefferson‚ÄìGainesville segment, from the north-northeast part of Gainesville to just east of White‚ÄìLumpkin county line. Six segments were indicated to be under construction: from Fitzgerald to the Ben Hill‚ÄìWilcox county line, a segment northwest of Hawkinsville, from Perry to south-southwest of Echeconnee, from south-southeast of the Jones‚ÄìJasper county line to south of Monticello, a small portion south-southeast of Covington, and a segment north-northwest of Jefferson. By the end of 1929, US 19 was designated on the Gainesville‚ÄìNorth Carolina segment. US 270 was decommissioned. From south-southeast of the Jones‚ÄìJasper county line to the Jasper‚ÄìNewton county line, the highway had a completed semi hard surface. The Social Circle‚ÄìMonroe segment had a sand clay or top soil surface. Two segments were indicated to be under construction: a segment south-southeast of Covington and a segment southwest of Social Circle. =1930s= By the middle of 1930, five segments of the highway had a completed hard surface: from Fitzgerald to just north of the Ben Hill‚ÄìWilcox county line, from north-northwest of Hawkinsville, from Perry to Gray, a segment in the southwest part of Jefferson, and from north-northeast of Gainesville to the North Carolina state line.

Three segments were indicated to be under construction: the Pulaski County portion of the Abbeville‚ÄìHawkinsville segment, nearly the entire Houston County portion of the Hawkinsville‚ÄìPerry segment, and from Winder to the southwestern part of Jefferson. By the end of the next year, US 19 south of Turners Corner was shifted west and off of SR 11\\\\. Four segments had a completed hard surface: from Hawkinsville to Perry, a segment north-northwest of Monticello, from Winder to Jefferson, and nearly the entire Gainesville‚ÄìNorth Carolina segment. The entire Pulaski County portion of the Abbeville‚ÄìHawkinsville segment had completed grading, but no surface course. Three segments were indicated to be under construction: the entire Berrien County portion of the Lakeland‚ÄìNashville segment, nearly the entire Wilcox County portion of the Fitzgerald‚ÄìAbbeville segment, and a segment north-northwest of Monticello. In March 1932, the Pulaski County portion of the Abbeville‚ÄìHawkinsville segment had a sand clay or top soil. Later that year, two segments had completed grading, but no surface course: nearly the entire Wilcox County portion of the Fitzgerald‚ÄìAbbeville segment and the entire Pulaski County portion of the Abbeville‚ÄìHawkinsville segment. A small portion just south-southeast of the Wilcox‚ÄìPulaski county line was under construction. In August of that year, a portion north-northwest of Abbeville was under construction. The next month, nearly the entire Jasper County portion of the Monticello‚ÄìCovington segment had a completed surface, while the Nashville‚ÄìAlapaha segment was under construction.

In August of that year, the Fitzgerald‚ÄìAbbeville segment had a completed hard surface. At the end of the year, the entire segment from Gainesville to the North Carolina state line also had a completed hard surface. A few months later, from Nashville to the Berrien‚ÄìIrwin county line, the highway had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Two segments of SR 11 were indicated to be under construction: the Jasper County portion of the Gray‚ÄìMonticello segment and the segment from Social Circle to Winder. Later that year, two segments had a completed hard surface: the Lanier County portion of the Lakeland‚ÄìRay City segment and a segment in Alapaha. Two segments had completed grading, but was not surfaced: the Ray City‚ÄìAlapaha segment and the Berrien County portion of the Alapaha‚ÄìOcilla segment. At the end of the next year, US 129 was extended on SR 11 from Turners Corner to the North Carolina state line. Two segments had a completed hard surface: a segment north-northwest of Abbeville and the segment from east of Covington to Monroe. By the middle of 1935, three segments had a completed hard surface: nearly the entire Wilcox County portion of the Abbeville‚ÄìHawkinsville segment, a segment south- southeast of Hawkinsville, and the entire Jasper County portion. Three segments were indicated to be under construction: the entire Jones County portion of the Gray‚ÄìMonticello segment, a segment north-northeast of Monroe, and the entire Hall County portion of the Jefferson‚ÄìGainesville segment. Later that year, a small portion just south of Ocilla had a completed hard surface. By the middle of 1936, two segments had a completed hard surface: the entire Wilcox County portion and the Newton County portion of the segment from Monticello to east of Covington. A few months later, two small segments had a completed hard surface: one just south of the Jones‚ÄìJasper county line and one just north-northwest of Monroe. The segment south of Statenville was under construction. By the end of the year, the entire Pulaski County portion had a completed hard surface. A few months later, the Berrien County portion of the Alapaha‚ÄìOcilla segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1937, the portion south of Statenville also had this same treatment. A few months later, SR 11's Statenville‚ÄìLakeland segment was shifted eastward. It traveled through Stockton to a point east of Lakeland and turned left on SR 65 and then SR 31 to Lakeland. There, it continued its former path. The Berrien County portion of the Alapaha‚ÄìOcilla segment had a completed hard surface. By the end of the year, the Alapaha‚ÄìOcilla segment had a completed hard surface. A segment in Lakeland had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Three segments were indicated to be under construction: nearly the entire Echols County portion of the Statenville‚ÄìStockton segment, a segment north of Stockton, and the Barrow County portion of the Monroe‚ÄìWinder segment. The next year, two segments had a completed hard surface: the Lakeland‚ÄìNashville segment and the Hall County portion of the Jefferson‚ÄìGainesville segment. Three segments had completed grading, but was not surfaced: the Lanier County portion of the Stockton‚ÄìLakeland segment, a segment from north-northwest of Monroe to Winder, and the Jackson County portion of the Jefferson‚ÄìGainesville segment. The Echols County portion of the Statnville‚ÄìStockton segment was indicated to be under construction. By the middle of 1939, two segments had a completed hard surface: the Nashville‚ÄìAlapaha segment and a small portion southeast of the Jackson‚ÄìHall county line. From north-northwest of Monroe to Winder, SR 11 had a sand clay or top soil surface. The decade ended with the entire segment from the Florida state line to Lakeland having a completed hard surface. =1940s to 1960s= By the end of 1940, US 129 was extended through the state and designated on the portion of SR 11 from the Florida state line to Hawkinsville. A segment of SR 11 northwest of Jefferson had a completed hard surface. In 1942, the entire length of SR 11 had a completed hard surface. Between July 1957 and June 1960, at a point northeast of Byron, SR 49 was shifted off of US 41/SR 11 and onto a sole path to SR 247 south of Macon, then north-northwest on SR 247 to return to US 41/SR 11 south-southwest of Macon. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, US 41 was shifted off of SR 11 in this same area, following SR 49 and SR 247, and returned to SR 11 south of Macon. =1970s to 2000s= In 1976, a portion of US 129 north of Hawkinsville was shifted west onto US 341/SR 11 from Hawkinsville to a point northwest of the city. In 1982, at a point northeast of Byron, SR 11 was shifted eastward onto US 41/SR 49 and then US 41/US 129/SR 49/SR 247 and headed north-northwest into Macon. By A decade later, a northeastern bypass of Perry, designated as SR 866, was proposed from US 341/SR 11 east of Perry to Interstate 75 (I-75) north-northwest of it. The next year, SR 11 was shifted onto the path of SR 866 and then resumed its northern routing on US 41\\\\. Its former path on US 341 and US 41 was redesignated as SR 11 Bus. In 1997, a western bypass of Arcade and Jefferson, designated as SR 837, was proposed from SR 82 in Arcade to US 129/SR 11 northwest of Jefferson. In 2001, this bypass was proposed to be extended northwest and west to end at US 129/SR 11 in Talmo. The next year, SR 837 was completed. In 2003, US 129 was shifted westward. It and SR 11 replaced the northern part of SR 837\\\\. The former path of US 129 became US 129 Bus. on SR 15 Alt. The southern part of SR 837 was redesignated as SR 11 Conn. By 2013, US 341 Byp. was designated on the northeastern bypass of Perry and its western extension. Future The intersection with SR 316 is planned to become an interchange in the future, along with SR 81 at SR 316. This project is part of a master plan to convert SR 316 into a full limited-access highway. Major intersections Special routes =Lakeland bypass= State Route 11 Bypass (SR 11 Byp.) is a bypass for SR 11 in Lakeland. It consists of West Church Avenue and East Church Street and then turns south onto North College Road (SR 135 Byp.). It also travels concurrently with SR 135 between North Center Street and North Temple Street. Between June 1960 and June 1963, SR 11 Byp. was established from US 129/SR 11/SR 37 to SR 135 in the northern part of the city. By the end of 1965, it was extended to its current eastern terminus. =Lakeland connector= State Route 11 Connector (SR 11 Conn.) is a marked segment of North Pecan Street between SR 122 and US 129/SR 11/SR 37 in Lakeland. Between the beginning of 1945 and the end of 1946, it was established on its current path. =Hawkinsville business loop= State Route 11 Business (SR 11 Bus.) is a business route of SR 11 in Hawkinsville. It also travels in a concurrency with US 129 Bus./US 341 Bus. and part of SR 26\\\\. In 1989, it was established. =Hawkinsville spur route= State Route 11 Spur (SR 11 Spur) was a spur route of SR 11 that existed west of Hawkinsville. Between June 1960 and June 1963, SR 11 Spur was established from SR 230 southwest of the city to US 341/SR 11 northwest of it. By the end of 1965, the southbound lanes of US 341/SR 11 were designated on the spur route. In 1989, it was decommissioned. =Perry business loop= State Route 11 Business (SR 11 Bus.) is a business route and former mainline of SR 11\\\\. It begins at the \\"Perry Parkway\\" (US 341 Byp./SR 11), and travels concurrently with US 341 into downtown Perry. At Houston Lake Road, the highway joins a concurrency with SR 127, until it reaches Ball Street, where US 341/SR 11 Bus. turns right towards the northwest. The concurrency with US 341 comes to an end two blocks later at the intersection with US 41 (Commerce Street), and it then turns right. US 41/SR 11 Bus. is carried by Commerce Street until that street terminates at Macon Road, and the concurrency make a left turn, following that street north until it reaches the Perry Parkway again. SR 11 Bus. ends at this segment of Perry Parkway, SR 11 travels concurrent with US 41 north of the parkway, and US 341 Byp. travels concurrent with SR 11 Conn. In 1993, a northeastern bypass of Perry, designated as SR 866, was proposed from US 341/SR 11 east of Perry to Interstate 75 (I-75) north-northwest of the city. The next year, SR 11 was shifted onto this bypass, replacing SR 866\\\\. Its former path through the city was redesignated as SR 11 Bus. =Perry bypass route= State Route 11 Bypass (SR 11 Byp.) was a short bypass route of SR 11 in downtown Perry. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, it was established from US 341/SR 11 (Main Street) to US 41/SR 11 (Carroll Street). By the end of 1982, it was redesignated as a western extension of SR 127. =Perry spur route= State Route 11 Spur (SR 11 Spur) was a short spur route of SR 11 in downtown Perry. In 1968, it was established from US 341/SR 7 (Washington Street) to US 41/SR 11. By the end of 1982, SR 11 through the city was shifted eastward, replacing all of SR 11 Spur. =Perry connector= State Route 11 Connector (SR 11 Conn.) is a connecting route of SR 11 located northwest of the main part of Perry, and is the concurrent state road for US 341 Byp. from US 41/SR 11/SR 11 Bus. to US 341/SR 7\\\\. It also has an interchange with I-75. It is known as Perry Parkway for its entire length. In 1993, part of a northeastern bypass of Perry, designated as SR 866, was proposed between US 41/SR 11 and I-75. The next year, all of SR 866 was either redesignated as part of SR 11, since it was moved onto the bypass, or just removed. In 1996, SR 11 Conn. was established on its current path. =Arcade‚ÄìJefferson connector= State Route 11 Connector (SR 11 Conn.) is a connecting route that connects US 129 Bus./SR 15 Alt. in Arcade with SR 11 and the southern terminus of SR 11 Bus. in Jefferson. The highway, which is named \\"Jefferson Bypass\\", is entirely concurrent with US 129, and the only other major intersections are SR 82 and former SR 319 (Etheridge Road). In 1997, a western bypass of Arcade and Jefferson, designated as SR 837, was proposed from SR 82 in Arcade to US 129/SR 11 northwest of Jefferson. In 2002, SR 837 was completed. In 2003, US 129 was shifted westward. It and SR 11 replaced the northern part of SR 837\\\\. The former path of US 129 became US 129 Bus. on SR 15 Alt. The southern part of SR 837 was redesignated as SR 11 Conn. =Jefferson business loop= State Route 11 Business (SR 11 Bus.) is a business route of SR 11 that is mostly within the city limits of Jefferson. It is a former section of SR 11\\\\. The highway begins at an intersection with US 129, SR 11, and the northern terminus of SR 11 Conn., where SR 11 turns north onto US 129\\\\. The street name is Winder Highway at first, until it reaches the intersection with Memorial Drive where it becomes Lee Street. Between Epps Street and Cobb Street, the route curves to the southeast as Railroad Avenue branches off to the left and it passes by a local antiques store next to a grade crossing with a CSX line. The southeast curve ends just before the intersection with Railroad Street, and the highway has a later intersection with Oak Street and Hill Street, the former of which travels along the west side of the Woodbine‚ÄìJefferson City Cemetery and then enters the Jefferson Historic DistrictCity of Jefferson Historic Districts, Jefferson, Georgia (July 28, 2008) just before encountering the western terminus of US 129 Bus./SR 15 Alt./SR 82\\\\. Two blocks later, SR 11 Bus. turns left onto Washington Avenue along with US 129 Bus., while SR 15 Alt./SR 82 continue east onto Sycamore Street towards Commerce and the Gainesville metropolitan area respectively. SR 11 Bus. continues to travel concurrently with US 129 Bus. for the rest of its length until both highways terminate at US 129/SR 11 north of Jefferson. In 2003, SR 11 Bus. was designated on its current path. =Gainesville business loop= State Route 11 Business (SR 11 Bus.) is a business route of SR 11 in Gainesville. It travels along Athens Highway from US 129 Bus./SR 11/SR 60/SR 369 in the central part of the city to US 129/SR 11 in the northeast part of the city. SR 11 Bus. begins as a continuation of Athens Highway (E.E. Butler Parkway), which also takes the concurrency with SR 60 away from SR 369\\\\. SR 11 Bus./SR 60 travels along Athens Highway until the intersections with Academy Street Northwest and Academy Street East, where the name changes to Green Street. North of the First Baptist Church of Gainesville, SR 11 Bus. branches off to the northeast onto Riverside Drive, while SR 60 continues north along Thompson Bridge Road. Immediately after SR 60 Conn. (Oak Tree Drive), Riverside Drive turns left towards the Riverside Military Academy, and SR 11 Bus. moves onto Morningside Drive, which winds through a wooded residential area until it encounters a row of billboards on the southwest corner of a local street named Park Hill Drive, then adopts that street name as its own. As Park Hill Drive, SR 11 Bus. encounters the northern terminus of SR 11 Conn. across from South Enota Drive Northeast. The road gains the name Cleveland Highway after Roper Hill Road, then curves more towards the north after the intersection with Old Clarks Bridge Road, and later encounters the western terminus of SR 284 (Clarks Bridge Road NE) across from a local dead end street named Northeast Barrett Street. One last local intersection (Lakeville Drive) branching off to the northwest and the entrance to the Chattahoochee‚ÄìOconee division of the United States Forest Service can be found before SR 11 Bus. ends at US 129/SR 11 (Limestone Parkway/Cleveland Highway). The portion of SR 11 Bus. that is concurrent with SR 60 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. In 1990, SR 11 Bus. was established from US 129/SR 11 in the central part of the city to US 129/SR 11 in the northern part. =Gainesville connector= State Route 11 Connector (SR 11 Conn.) was a connecting route of SR 11 that was established in 1969 between SR 13 to US 129/SR 11. In 1985, its southern terminus was truncated to another intersection with US 129/SR 11. In 1990, it was decommissioned, with its southern part became part of a re-routed US 129/SR 11. It was known as Downey Boulevard and South Enota Drive. =Cleveland bypass route= State Route 11 Bypass (SR 11 Byp.) is a bypass of SR 11 that bypasses the city of Cleveland just to the west. It is completely concurrent with US 129 Byp. and is known as Appalachian Parkway for its entire length. It connects US 129/SR 11 just south of the city with US 129/SR 11 and SR 75 Conn. north-northwest of it, with an intersection with SR 115 west- southwest of the city. The bypass routes were established in 2016. =Blairsville truck route= State Route 11 Truck (SR 11 Truck) was a truck route of SR 11 that traveled concurrently with U.S. Route 129 Truck (US 129 Truck) for its entire length. It also had a concurrency with US 76/SR 2/SR 515\\\\. Between the beginning of 1995 and the beginning of 2012, this highway was proposed as SR 1191. By 2015, SR 1191 was completed. In 2016, US 129 Truck and SR 11 Truck were decommissioned and redesignated as the US 19/US 129/SR 11 mainline.

As a music industry executive in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, he was one of the most influential figures in the history of punk rock. He signed and managed Iggy and the Stooges, signed the MC5 and managed the Ramones, and worked in various roles with Jim Morrison, the Velvet Underground and the Modern Lovers. In 2014 The New York Times said, \\"You could make a convincing case that without Danny Fields, punk rock would not have happened.\\"  Early life  Fields grew up in Richmond Hill, Queens, New York. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Pennsylvania in 1959, he attended Harvard Law School, but left during his first year. He moved to Manhattan's Greenwich Village in 1960, briefly enrolled at New York University, and became involved with the burgeoning downtown arts and music scene.  Career  After stints at publications such as Liquor Store and Outdoor Advertiser, Fields got a job at the teen-fan magazine Datebook. In 1966, as Managing Editor, he was responsible for shining a spotlight on John Lennon's \\"more popular than Jesus\\" quote. In the 1960s, Fields began frequenting Max's Kansas City. It was there that he developed connections to Andy Warhol's Factory social circle. Fields occasionally shared his loft with Warhol actress Edie Sedgwick, and wrote an account of the Warhol-sponsored Velvet Underground during their early years. He later penned the liner notes for the band's album Live at Max's Kansas City, recorded in 1970, but released in 1972, after the band broke up. Fields hosted a radio show on New Jersey's WFMU during its groundbreaking 1968‚Äì1969 free-form years, and he was hired by Elektra Records as a publicist. Elektra, which had primarily been a folk music label, was having huge success in the rock record market with The Doors, and hired Fields to publicize the band, despite the fact (discussed by Fields in numerous interviews) that he and lead singer Jim Morrison disliked each other. Despite this mutual antagonism, Fields got Morrison on many key teen magazine covers in 1968. In September 1968, Fields visited Detroit and Ann Arbor on the recommendation of two fellow DJs at WFMU (Bob Rudnick and Dennis Frawley). He recommended to Elektra that the label sign the MC5 and The Stooges. Both bands served as major inspirations for the US and UK punk music movements of the mid-to-late 1970s. In 1975, Fields discovered the Ramones at CBGB, and helped get them signed to Sire Records. As the band's co-manager, with Linda Stein, Fields brought the band to England, where they had an enormous impact, inspiring the nascent UK punk movement, including such bands as the Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Damned. Under Fields' management the Ramones recorded Ramones, Leave Home, and Rocket to Russia. The 1980 Ramones album End of the Century includes the track \\"Danny Says\\", about Fields. The song has been covered by the Foo Fighters and Tom Waits. In 1990, Fields discovered singer-songwriter Paleface at a performance in New York's Chameleon club and became his manager: he helped the young artist get signed to Polygram Records and Elektra Records. After leaving the music business, Fields co-authored Dream On, the biography of Warhol actress Cyrinda Foxe, the wife of Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler. He subsequently wrote Linda McCartney: A Portrait, which was turned into a television miniseries by CBS. In 2015, Fields discovered East London punk band False Heads in Camden and has been highly influential in the band's career and growing success, naming them as \\"the future of rock and roll\\".

History In 1972, Donald Bonham and O.C. Mendenhall started Fiesta; neither of the men had Hispanic ethnic backgrounds. Bonham had farmed in Belize and Guatemala and supervised the creation of a Chilean supermarket chain. When Bonham returned to Texas, he believed that Houston-area businesses did not adequately cater to Mexican Americans, a large segment of the city's population. Bonham opened the first Fiesta, which catered exclusively to Hispanic Americans,Hisey, Peter. \\"Ethnic food flavors Fiesta Mart; Houston chain poised to open hypermarket-size unit - supermarket chain.\\" Discount Store News.

History Long Fin Killie's core line-up consisted of Luke Sutherland (vocals, violin, guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, saxophone, hammer dulcimer, thumb piano, etc.), Colin Greig (electric and upright bass), David Turner (drums/percussion), and Philip Cameron (electric guitar). Sutherland had previously been in a band called Fenn, based in Glasgow, who played many support gigs, including Ride and Catherine Wheel. Their name was taken from a family of ornamental freshwater fishes known as killifishes, noted for their interesting drought survival and reproductive habits. The members were all highly trained, enabling them to create complex, atypical music which usually featured hypnotically-bowed violins/celli, jazz-influenced drumming, and meandering ambient passages. Allmusic cited them as having \\"staggering levels of musicianly talent\\".[ AllMusic] Vocalist Luke Sutherland often delivered his cryptic, highly literate lyrics in an androgynous falsetto voice. Their debut EP Buttergut was released in 1994, with debut album Houdini following the next year. The band's sound, though diverse, was influenced by the likes of dream pop mainstays A R Kane, Cocteau Twins, and Slowdive, 1970s German krautrock groups like Can, and labelmates Moonshake, Pram and Laika. Mark E. Smith of The Fall contributed \\"guest rants\\" to the song \\"The Heads of Dead Surfers,\\" which appeared in 1995 on the EP of the same name, as well as on Houdini. (Listeners to British DJ John Peel's radio show voted this the No. 10 best song of 1995 in the \\"Festive Fifty\\" list of that year.) LFK toured America in 1995 with the band Medicine; a split EP was released to promote it. The band received widespread critical acclaim, but little to no radio play, though they did tour on the 1996 edition of Lollapalooza as part of its \\"second stage,\\" in support of their 1996 second LP Valentino. While driving from Sweden to Norway in late 1996, the band's tour bus was involved in a major accident on a patch of ice, causing Sutherland to suffer a collapsed lung, broken ribs and collar bone, and other injuries. He began writing his first novel while recuperating from the crash.Eye.net In 1997, Turner was replaced by Kenny McEwan on drums. Subsequent album Amelia (1998) featured songs of shorter lengths and more conventional structures, but it proved to be their last. The group disbanded shortly afterwards, to little mainstream notice, in 1998 or 1999. Recurring themes *All of their albums had one-word titles honouring public icons who died at early ages: Escape artist Harry Houdini, actor Rudolph Valentino, and pilot Amelia Earhart, respectively. *Their releases almost all featured intricate woodcut-style graphic design; Valentino used woodcuts by 16th- century printmaker Albrecht D√ºrer. Post-breakup work Following the break- up, the former members of the band moved on to other projects. Sutherland helmed the slightly more accessible group Bows, which has released its albums on Too Pure. Sutherland now lives in London and has written the novels Jelly Roll (described by L.S. as \\"vaguely autobiographical\\"; Anchor, 1998), Sweetmeat (Anchor, 2002), and Venus As A Boy (Bloomsbury, 2004). He has also played violin with fellow Scottish band Mogwai. He is currently in the band Music A.M. Greig now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, and runs the independent record label Cocohippo. He also performs his own music under the moniker Wilma Cakebread. Turner lives in London and records his own music under the name disco haircut astronaut.

Sunrider lists thousands of franchise stores and tens of thousands of distributors internationally. Sunrider manufactures health, beauty, food, and household products at four manufacturing plants: Southern California, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. Sunrider does business in 42 countries, and operates offices in 22 countries. Company history Sunrider was founded in 1982 in Orem, Utah in the United States by the Taiwan-born herbalist, Tei-Fu Chen. In the late 1980s, the company moved its headquarters to the Los Angeles area. It has since expanded into an international corporation with about forty offices worldwide. In 2007 Sunrider purchased the Holiday Inn Asiaworld Taipei and renamed it the Sunworld Dynasty Hotel Taipei, and expressed plans to purchase more hotels in Asia. Sunrider has over 7,000 retail stores in China. In 1995 Sunrider International and its owner were charged with orchestrating a tax and customs fraud scheme to evade tens of millions of dollars in taxes. Chen and the Sunrider Corporation were indicted by a federal grand jury in a 20-count indictment charging them with conspiracy, tax evasion, filing of false corporate tax returns, and smuggling. In 1997, the Chens entered into a plea bargain with the court on the charges of tax evasion and customs fraud. Tei-Fu Chen served nearly a year in minimum security prison while his wife, Oi-Lin Chen, served six months of home detention. The couple paid over $100 million in back taxes, interest and penalties and an additional $4 million to avoid forfeiting the items they were accused of smuggling and undervaluing. Sunrider's founders were jointly named No. 6 on the Goldsea 100 list of America's top Asian entrepreneurs. And in 2017, Sunrider‚Äôs President, Dr. Oi- Lin Chen, was named one of the most influential women in the direct selling industry. Business Sunrider is a multi-level marketing company which is primarily known for selling herbal products such as diet pills, teas, and health snacks. As of 2009 the company was reported to have an annual revenue of over $700 million, and 300,000 distributors. Stephen Barrett has accused the company of making false claims regarding its products' therapeutic effects, and reports legal problems the company has faced from the FDA and state of California regarding false medical claims. However, none of them were substantiated, and the company has never been directed to pay any fines for such wrong doings. In addition, Barret has said that Sunrider distributors do not have the proper qualifications to advise their customers about the product. However, since the products are foods, there are actually no qualifications needed to make suggestions for product use. The company has instructed distributors to avoid medical claims. In 1992, Sunrider settled out of court to a woman who claimed that Sunrider products had negatively affected her health. This was settled out of court, even though the woman's estranged husband came forward with information about how poison had been added to the product after the woman received the products. =Hotel business= Sunrider owns and operates a hotel chain called Sunworld Dynasty, having acquired several hotels in Asia. In Beijing, the hotels are the Sunworld Dynasty Hotel (on Wangfujing) and the Sunworld Hotel, located next door. In Taipei, Taiwan, the Sunworld Dynasty Hotel is one of the largest hotels in the city. Sunrider acquired the 297-room SLS Beverly Hills for about $200 million in mid 2015.

Lenskii says that it was re- created in 1955 to control the Soviet troops in Hungary following the disbandment of the former Central Group of Forces which had controlled troops in Austria and Hungary from 1945 to 1955, and the Soviet withdrawal from Austria. Under its command were the 2nd Guards 'Nikolayevsk-Budapest' Mechanised Division, the 17th Guards 'Yenakievskiy-Danube' Mechanised Division, two air divisions, and other troops. Lenskii says their function was 'to cover the boundary with neutral Austria and to guarantee communications in the case of the advancement of troops from the USSR'. =Hungarian Revolution= On October 24, 1956 the 33rd Guard Kherson Mechanized Division, previously stationed in Romania near the Romanian-Hungarian border, and two divisions from the Carpathian Military District, the 11th Guards 'Rovenskaya' Mechanized and 128th Guards Rifle Division, entered Hungary under the control of a Rifle Corps. The forces already in Hungary and those entering totalled 31,500 men. The 33rd Guards Mechanised Division took the lead role in suppressing the Hungarian Revolution in Budapest, and lost, according to Soviet sources, 14 tanks and assault guns as well as 9 armoured personnel carriers. Seven months afterward, on May 28, 1957, an agreement on the status of Soviet troops, comprising the Southern Group of Forces, was made between the USSR and Hungary. The 11th Guards Mechanised and 128th Guards Rifle Divisions returned to the Carpathian Military District and were replaced by the 21st Guards 'Poltava' Tank Division and the 27th 'Cherkassy' Motor Rifle Division, both under the command of the Carpathian Military District's 38th Army. 2nd Guards Mechanised Division was re-formed into the 19th Guards Tank Division, and the 17th Guards Mechanised Division was re-formed into the 17th Guard Motor Rifle Division and withdrawn to the USSR. The 33rd Guards Mechanised Division was then replaced by the 35th Guards 'Kharkov' Mechanised Division. = 1957-1990 = Later, either in 1957 or 1965, three of the four divisions in the Group were redesignated, and toward the end of the 1980s the Group comprised: *13th Guards Tank Poltava Division (former 21st Tank, and carrying the lineage of the wartime 13th Guards Rifle Division) - in Veszpr√©m; *19th Guards Tank Nikolayevsk-Budapest Division - in Esztergom; *93rd Guards Motor Rifle Kharkov Division (former 35th Guards) - in Kecskem√©t *254th 'Cherkassy' Motor Rifle Division (former 27th) - in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. *36th Air Army Smaller units included the 327th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment (327 ZRP), headquartered at Szolnok and tasked with airfield defence.See Michael Holm, 327th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment, accessed August 2012 In 1967, the 22nd Missile Brigade became part of the Southern Group of Forces at Domb√≥v√°r. Soviet tanks leaving Hungary, 1990 The removal of Soviet troops from Hungary began during May 1989, with the withdrawal and disbandment of 13th Guards Tank Division. Later the 19th Guards Tank Division was withdrawn to the Belorussian Military District and the 254th Motor Rifle Division to the Kiev Military District. The 93rd Guards Motor Rifle Division was withdrawn in early 1991 to the Kiev Military District and the Group finally disbanded on 16 June 1991. = Commanders = * December 1956 - October 1960 - Army General Mikhail Kazakov * October 1960 - August 1961 - Colonel General Matvei Nikitin * August 1961 - September 1962 - Army General Pavel Batov * September 1962 - October 1969 - Colonel General Konstantin Provalov * October 1969 - December 1975 - Colonel General Boris Ivanov * December 1975 - March 1979 - Colonel General Fedot Krivda * March 1979 - August 1982 - Colonel General Vladimir Sivenok * August 1982 - August 1985 - Colonel General Konstantin Kochetov * August 1985 - June 1988 - Colonel General Alexey Demidov * June 1988 - December 1990 - Colonel General Matvei Burlakov * December 1990 - September 1992 - Lieutenant General Viktor Shilov Air Forces of the Southern Group of Forces :The following units were part of the Southern Group of Forces Air Forces, designated the 36th Air Army between 1967 and 1981. :* 11th Guards Fighter Aviation Division (IAD Guards 14) (Tokol) :** 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (S√°rmell√©k) :** 14th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (Kiskunlach√°za) :** 515th Fighter Aviation Regiment (Tokol) :* 1st Guards Fighter Bomber Aviation Regiment (Kunmadaras) :* 727th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment (Debrecen) :* 328th Separate Guards Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment (Kunmadaras) :* 396th Separate Guards Helicopter Regiment (Kalocsa) :* 294th Separate Electronic Warfare Helicopter Squadron (Debrecen) :* 8th Separate Target-Towing Aviation Squadron (S√°rmell√©k, Kunmadaras, Debrecen) :* 201st Separate Mixed Aviation Squadron (Tokol) :* 37th Separate Helicopter Unit (Veszpr√©m-Szentkir√°lyszabadja) :* 38th Separate Helicopter Unit (Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r) :* 72nd Separate Helicopter Unit (Kecskem√©t-Kadafalva) :* 74th Separate Helicopter Unit (Esztergom-Kertv√°ros) :* 18th Separate Communications and Automated Control Regiment (Pilishaba) :** The 11th Guards Fighter Aviation Division (11 GvIAD) moved from Parndorf in Austria to Veszpr√©m in Hungary in November 1945.Michael Holm, 11th Guards Fighter Aviation Division, accessed October 2011 It was stationed there until September 1949.

There is no cure; the aim of treatment is to manage the signs and slow progression of the disease. The cause of CPL is not known, although it is suspected that a genetic disorder of elastin metabolism prevents the lymphatic vessels from functioning properly, leading to edema of the lower limbs. CPL resembles the human disease elephantiasis verrucosa nostra. Signs CPL is a progressive disease, which begins below the fetlock and gradually moves up the leg. All legs are affected, the hindlimbs usually more seriously so. Initial signs include thickening, crusting and folding of the skin. These early signs may be hidden by the long hair (feather) on the horse's lower legs. Affected areas are itchy, causing the horse to stamp its feet and rub its legs, and painful, so that the horse may be reluctant to allow its legs to be touched. As CPL progresses, ulcers develop on the pasterns, and fibrosis leads to hardening of the skin and the development of nodules which may become baseball sized. Secondary infections with microbes or mites commonly cause complications. Infestations with the mange mite Chorioptes equi are very itchy, and lead to self-trauma and dermatitis. The quality of the hoof is often poor; hooves are prone to cracks, splits and the development of thrush and abscesses; horses may develop laminitis. Chestnuts and ergots are often misshapen and irregular. Management There is no cure for CPL; the aim of treatment is to relieve the signs of the disease, and to slow the progression. Management requires daily care to prevent infection of the affected skin. The first step is to trim the feather from the lower leg, to ensure no affected areas are missed, and to allow application of treatments directly to the affected skin. Bacterial infections can be treated by gentle washing and drying of the skin. Topical treatments are required to treat chorioptic mange (caused by the mite Chorioptes equi), as the mites are not vulnerable to oral or systemic treatments when they are within the crusts on the skin. Daily exercise assists with the flow of lymph. Combined decongestive therapy involves massage of the leg to move the lymph, followed by specialized compression bandaging which creates a pressure gradient up the leg. Horses with CPL often have poor- quality hoof, so regular trimming is required to help keep the hoof healthy. Epidemiology Affected breeds include the Shire, Clydesdale, Belgian, Gypsy cob, and Friesian. Signs are usually only seen in horses older than two years. Both sexes are affected.

She is best known for her letters and journals, namely Social Life in England and France from the French Revolution, published in 1831, and Journals and Correspondence, published after her death in 1865. Berry became notable through her association with close friend Horace Walpole, whose literary collection she, along with her sister and father, inherited. Early life Berry was born in Kirkbridge, North Yorkshire on 16 March 1763. Her younger sister Agnes, who proved to be Mary's closest confidant during her life, was born fourteen months later on 29 May 1764. Their father, Robert Berry, was the nephew of a successful Scottish merchant named Ferguson. Robert received ¬£300,000 in mid-life and bought an estate at Raith in Fifeshire. As the older son of Ferguson's sister, he began working at his uncle's counting-house in Broad Street, Austin Friars. In 1762, he married his distant cousin, a Miss Seaton. After giving birth to Mary and Agnes, she and their third child died three years later, in 1767, during childbirth. Following their mother's death, the two girls were cared for by their grandmother, Mrs. Seaton, at Askham in Yorkshire. They were moved to the College House in Chiswick in 1770. After their governess at Chiswick married in 1776, the two girls were self-educated. Their religious instruction consisted of Mary reading aloud a Psalm to her grandmother every morning, and one of the Saturday papers from the Spectator every Sunday. In 1781, the uncle, Mr Ferguson, died at age 93. He left money to both Robert and his younger brother, William. In 1783, Robert Berry and his two young daughters travelled abroad to Holland, Switzerland and Italy. Mary assumed the role of protective mother to her sister, and a guide and monitor to her father. Adulthood Mary Berry began writing Journals and Correspondence while in Florence in 1783, though she would not complete the writing until 70 years later. After a long stay in Italy, her tour was completed by a return home through France to England in June 1786. Berry and her sister Agnes had a remarkable association with Horace Walpole. They first met him in the winter of 1788, when he was then more than 70 years old. A letter he wrote in October 1788 related how: ‚Äúhe had just then willingly yielded himself up to their witcheries on meeting them at the house of his friend Lady Herries, wife of the banker in St. James's Street‚Äù. Walpole developed a deep fondness for the two girls, lavishing them with endearments and compliments. In his letters, Walpole spoke of both in terms of the strongest affection and endearment, in one instance addressing them as his \\"twin wives\\". He wrote books solely for their pleasure and dedicated other writings to them. It was solely for their amusement that he wrote his Reminiscences of the Courts of George I and II (1789). He established the sisters at Teddington in 1789, and two years later, in 1791, he prevailed upon them to move into Little Strawberry Hill, a house previously known as Cliveden, the abode of his friend Kitty Clive, the famous actress. They lived there for many years. George Walpole, died in 1791 and his titles and estate were passed to his uncle Horace. Horace became the 4th Earl of Orford. \\"There is a tradition handed down by Lord Lansdowne\\", says the Edinburgh Review, \\"that he (Walpole) was ready to go through the formal ceremony of marriage with either sister, to make sure of their society and confer rank and fortune on the family - he had the power of charging the Orford estate with a jointure of ¬£2,000 a year.‚Äù This did not occur. In 1779, Mary's hand had been sought in marriage by a Mr Bowman and she wrote long afterwards that she had \\"suffered as people do\\" at sixteen \\"from what, wisely disapproved of, I resisted and dropped.\\" General Charles O'Hara, governor of Gibraltar, had met Berry in 1784 in Italy, and was engaged to her before leaving England for Gibraltar in November 1795. Berry had been reluctant to leave England immediately as his bride. This led to their gradual estrangement and ultimately the breaking off of their engagement at the end of April 1796. Walpole died on 2 March 1797 and left both women ¬£4,000 and Little Strawberry Hill House, where they lived. He also bequeathed to Robert, Mary, and Agnes Berry his printed works and a box containing manuscripts, to be published at their discretion. In 1802 Berry went to Paris and, during her stay, she was presented to Napoleon in the palace of the Tuileries. Returning to France with her sister and father later in the year, she went on to Nice, Switzerland and Germany, returning England in September 1803. Literary work In 1798, Mary published the five volumes of the Works of Horace Walpole from the manuscripts Walpole had left the Berry's. She advertised the work as edited by her father, Robert, but in reality Mary performed most of the work, except a brief passage in the preface that refers to herself. Berry then wrote a five-act comedy titled Fashionable Friends under Walpole‚Äôs name. Berry and her father and sister performed the play at Strawberry Hill, Walpole's residence, until the performance was moved to Drury Lane Theatre in May 1802. The play failed after three nights due to its lax morality. Other works she published include Walpole‚Äôs the Mysterious Mother and another of her own plays, a farce called The Martins, set down in a manuscript list of her writings, which was never produced either in print or on the stage.[3] In 1810, Berry published four volumes of the letters of Madame du Deffand to Horace Walpole, written between 1766 and 1780, which she annotated herself, as well as those de Deffand wrote to Voltaire between 1759 and 1775. She received ¬£200 for this work. On 18 May 1817, Robert Berry died, leaving the sisters with very little income. In 1819, Mary Berry brought out Some Account of the Life of Rachel Wriothesley, Lady Russell, followed by a series of Letters from Lady Russell to her husband, Lord William Russell, from 1672 to 1682, together with some Miscellaneous Letters to and from Lady Russell. The work was published from the originals, owned by the Duke of Devonshire. Berry published the first volume of her most famous work, A Comparative View of the Social Life of England and France from the Restoration of Charles the Second to the French Revolution, in 1828; the second volume, Social Life in England and France from the French Revolution in 1789 to that of July 1830, appeared in March 1831. It was reissued as a collected whole in the complete edition of her Works in 1844, with a new title, England and France: a comparative View of the Social Condition of both Countries alongside Fashionable Friends and her other writings. A collection of Berry‚Äôs works and letters were published posthumously in 1865, titled Extracts from the Journals and Correspondence of Miss Berry from 1783 to 1852, edited by Lady Theresa Lewis. Death St Peter's Church, Petersham During her life Berry suffered from only one serious illness, a near-fatal attack of bilious fever in 1825. She died of old age around midnight on 20 November 1852 at age 89. Her sister, Agnes, had died in January of the same year. Both are buried in the churchyard of St Peter's Church, Petersham.

It is the third biggest obvious impact structure on the planet after the Hellas and Argyre basins ‚Äì it is about in diameter. Isidis was likely the last major basin to be formed on Mars, having formed approximately 3.9 billion years ago during the Noachian Period. Due to dust coverage, it typically appears bright in telescopic views, and was mapped as a classical albedo feature, Isidis Regio, visible by telescope in the pre- spacecraft era. A study reported in Icarus described the complex geologic history of parts of Isidis, especially areas near the Deuteronilus contact. This contact is the supposed edge of a vast Martian ocean. The researchers found evidence of a Late Hesperian/Early Amazonian Sea in the area. The sea would have quickly frozen over. Eskers formed under the ice. Just to the west of Isidis is Syrtis Major Planum, a low-relief shield volcano that is a prominent dark albedo feature of Mars, which formed after the basin. The westernmost extent is bounded by a subregion, Northeast Syrtis with diverse geology. Around the Isidis basin magnesium carbonate was found by MRO. This mineral indicates that water was present and that it was not acidic, pH conditions more favorable for the evolution of life. The name \\"Isidis Planitia\\" follows the earlier name Isidis Regio (\\"Isis' Region\\"). Isis is the Egyptian goddess of heaven and fertility.

It derives from the helmets with horse-hair tails, worn at the time by French firemen, which are similar to the Attic helmet often worn in such works by allegorical personifications, classical warriors, or Napoleonic cavalry.Harding, 7, quoting the definition of Pompier in the Dictionnaire Larousse It also suggests half-puns in French with pomp√©ien (\\"from Pompeii\\"), and pompeux (\\"pompous\\"). Pompier art was seen by those who used the term as the epitome of the values of the bourgeoisie, and as insincere and overblown. L'art pompier (a term supporters mostly avoid) has enjoyed something of a critical revival in the last twenty years, partly caused by the new Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, where it is displayed on more equal terms with the Impressionists and Realist painters of the period.Harding, 14‚Äì22 The Manifeste Pompier (Fireman Manifesto) by Louis-Marie Lecharny, was published in Paris in 1990.

The , right-hander was a native of Stony Point, North Carolina. He was signed by the St. Louis Browns as an amateur free agent before the 1946 season. After pitching in the Browns, Cincinnati Reds, and New York Yankees organizations, he was drafted by the Boston Braves from the Yankees in the 1952 rule V draft (December 1). He played for the Milwaukee Braves from 1953 to 1957 and was a member of the 1957 World Series championship team. Jolly made his major league debut in relief on May 9, 1953, against the Chicago Cubs at Milwaukee County Stadium. From 1953 to 1957, the first five years that the Braves were in Milwaukee, he was second on the pitching staff with 158 relief appearances, an average of almost 32 per season. During those seasons the closer's job was held at different times by Lew Burdette, Ernie Johnson, Jolly, and Don McMahon. Jolly's best season was 1954, when he was 11‚Äì6 with 10 saves and a 2.43 earned run average in 47 games. He finished in the National League Top Ten for winning percentage, games pitched, games finished, and saves. Career totals for 160 games (159 as a pitcher) include a record of 16‚Äì14, 1 game started, 0 complete games, 82 games finished, 19 saves, and an ERA of 3.77. He wielded a strong bat for a pitcher, going 14-for-48 (.292) with 1 home run, 7 runs batted in, and 8 runs scored. On October 15, 1957, Jolly was purchased from the Braves by the San Francisco Giants, but never again pitched in a big league game. Jolly died in 1963 at the age of 38 in Durham, North Carolina, one year after he underwent surgery for a brain tumor. He was buried at Stony Point Cemetery, Stony Point, North Carolina.

Playing career =Club= A central midfielder, Byrne's playing career started with Bohemians, his debut coming against St Patrick's Athletic on 25 August 1974 in a LFA President's Cup Final. He made 162 appearances in all competitions for Bohemians (98 in the league, 10 in European competition)Bohemian FC match programme, Vol. 46, no. 5 and won 2 League of Ireland titles and 1 FAI Cup before he moved to the US in 1978, for a year with the Philadelphia Fury of the North American Soccer League. At the Fury he played alongside fellow Irishmen Fran O'Brien and Eddie Byrne, appearing in eighteen matches plus one play-off game and scoring three goals. Byrne's teammates also included Alan Ball, Peter Osgood and Johnny Giles, while he played against the likes of Rodney Marsh, Carlos Alberto, Franz Beckenbauer, Giorgio Chinaglia and Bobby Moore. He returned to Europe in 1979, playing for Leicester City in England until 1981, then Heart of Midlothian in Scotland until 1983. While playing for Hearts he was based in Dublin, and would regularly commute to Scotland for weekend fixtures. When this became too much of a burden, he was granted a free transfer and joined League of Ireland side Shamrock Rovers, where he won four league titles in a row and the FAI Cup three times between 1984 and 1987. He was the club's Player of the Year in 1984‚Äì85 and also picked up the SWAI Personality of the Year award for that season. He made seven appearances for Rovers in European competition. =International= In April 1983, Byrne played for the League of Ireland XI U21s against their Italian League counterparts who included Roberto Mancini and Gianluca Vialli in their team.. During this time with Shamrock Rovers he also won eight full international caps for the Republic of Ireland, three inter-league caps, scoring once, and played in two 1988 Summer Olympics qualifiers. Management career Byrne retired from playing at the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season when he was appointed as player-manager of Shelbourne. By 1992, he had guided the club to their first League of Ireland title in thirty years and the following year, he guided them to their first FAI Cup success in thirty years, when they beat Dundalk 1‚Äì0 in the final at Lansdowne Road. In the Cup Winners' Cup that autumn, Byrne brought Shelbourne their first European victory since 1964 when they knocked out Ukrainian club Karpaty Lviv 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. He was sacked along with his assistant Jim McLaughlin shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by Eoin Hand. Byrne became player- manager of St James's Gate in February 1994 before he came back to Shamrock Rovers to manage the club for the 1996‚Äì97 season. He later managed Kilkenny City to promotion to the Premier Division. In September 2006, he became an official Shamrock Rovers Legend.

This syndrome usually occurs for no obvious reason and is uncontrollable. It is slightly more common in males than females. This syndrome can go for very long periods of time without a diagnosis, as it may resemble normal laughing or crying if it occurs infrequently. It has been associated with several conditions, such as temporal and frontal lobe lesions, tumors, atrophy, tuberous sclerosis, hemangiomas, and post-infectious foci, but mainly hypothalamic hamartomas. The term \\"gelastic\\" originates from the Greek word \\"gelos\\", which means laughter. Signs and symptoms The main sign of a gelastic seizure is a sudden outburst of laughter with no apparent cause. The laughter may sound unpleasant and sardonic rather than joyful. The outburst usually lasts for less than a minute. During or shortly after a seizure, an individual might display some twitching, strange eye movements, lip smacking, fidgeting or mumbling. If a person who suffers from the seizures is hooked up to an electroencephalogram, it will reveal interictal epileptic discharges. This syndrome usually manifests itself before the individual reaches the age of three or four. The temporal lobes, and the hypothalamus are the areas of the brain with the most involvement with these seizures. This may cause learning disabilities, and faulted cognitive function as well. It is not uncommon for children to have tonic-clonic seizures, and atonic seizures directly following the seizure. Those that are associated with hypothalamic hamartomas may occur as often as several times hourly and typically begin during infancy. Seizures that occur in infancy may include bursts of cooing, respirations, giggling, and smiling. Due to early hypothalamic-pituitary- gonadal axis activation in girls who suffer from the seizures, it is not uncommon for them to display secondary sex characteristics before the age of eight. Causes Tuber cinereum hamartomas (also known as hypothalamic hemartoma) are at the hypothalamus between the mamillary bodies A gelastic seizure is classically associated with a hypothalamic hamartoma (a type of brain tumor). A hypothalamic hamartoma is defined as a benign mass of glial tissue on or near the hypothalamus. The size of the hamartoma can vary from one centimeter to larger than three centimeters. They can cause several different types of seizures including a Gelastic Seizure. These structures can be detected with different imaging modalities such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, Single Photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT). A computed tomography scan of an individual with a hypothalamic hamartoma would reveal a suprasellar mass with the same density as brain tissue. Images of these masses are not enhanced with the use of contrast. However, although a computed tomography scan may be useful in diagnosing the cause of a seizure, in the case of a hypothalamic hamartoma, magnetic resonance imaging is the tool of choice due to the cerebrospinal fluid which defines these masses. Single Photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may also be used which involves the use of a radiotracer that is taken up by the ictal region of the brain where, typically the tumor lies. Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) show reduced metabolism at the site of seizure onset. Gelastic seizures have been observed after taking a birth control pill (Maxim (R)). Optic nerve hypoplasia is the only reported condition with gelastic seizures without hypothalamic hamartomas, suggesting that hypothalamic disorganization alone can cause gelastic seizures. Diagnosis A diagnosis is difficult, especially in children, due to the difficulty in differentiating between actual laughing or crying, versus a seizure that involves laughing and crying. In pre-verbal infants, a diagnosis may be impossible. A long history must be taken with a description of all the signs leading to and during the seizure. The episodes can also be confused with behavioral and emotional disorders. Some doctors ask parents to videotape the children's outbursts. The tapes may be difficult to obtain, but can be very helpful in speeding up the difficult diagnosis process. Diagnosis is also complicated due to the many possible causes of the seizures. Imaging is always helpful in an attempt to diagnose seizures caused by hypothalamic hamartoma. If there is evidence of this, the diagnosis takes much less time. Management Gelastic seizures are usually not responsive to pharmacotherapy. They can produce secondary seizure characteristics which may respond to medications or surgery. These options are not a guaranteed cure, and depend primarily on the individual patient's pathology. The treatment depends on the cause of the seizures. If the seizures are caused by a tumor, surgical removal can be attempted. However, surgical removal is not always an immediate cure, and there can be complications. Complications can include cerebral infarcts, and cognitive deterioration. Hormonal treatment can be attempted to help individuals with precocious puberty. Anti-epileptic drugs could be an option as well depending on the patient's criteria. These drugs could include carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine and topiramate. However, usually none of these medications are capable of stopping the seizures from occurring, and like any medication, there may be undesirable side effects. There is also a specialized form of radiotherapy that may be an option depending on the tumor type and location. Once again, there are very few areas in the world that offer this treatment. Gamma knife radiosurgery can be the treatment of choice when it comes to hypothalamic hamartomas. It is a low risk option due to its lower frequency of neurological deficits. It is recommended for patients with tumors that don't come into contact with the optic chiasm. Prognosis Like many other types of seizures, gelastic seizures are hard to control for an extended period of time. The best outlook is for children suffering the seizures due to a benign tumor in their hypothalamus. The removal of these tumors can be effective not only for the frequency of the seizures, but also the behavioral and cognitive symptoms that come along with the syndrome. Cases have also been described where that antiepileptic drugs have stopped seizures fully.

Lleweni Hall, published c.1775 The bleach works at Lleweni Remains in 2006. It is now used as a farmhouse. Lleweni Hall (Welsh: Plas Lleweni; sometimes also referred to as Llewenny Palace) was a stately home in Denbighshire, northeast Wales, around north-east of Denbigh on the banks of the River Clwyd. It was the principal seat of the Salusbury family and their descendants from 1066 until 1748, and the present territorial designation of the most senior branch of the family.  History  Lleweni was originally called Llysmarchweithian (\\"Marchweithian Court\\") and belonged to Marchweithian, Lord of Is Aled, a Welsh chieftain reputedly one of the founders of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales. It fell into the hands of the Salusbury family soon after the Norman Conquest when it was awarded to Adam de Salusbury for his service to William the Conqueror. Although there had been some sort of residence on the site since 720, Lleweni was first erected under the direction of the first Sir John Salusbury who had been granted new arms and a position at the court of Queen Elizabeth I in 1578. Lleweni evolved into a leading seat of Welsh culture during the life of Sir John Salusbury, who established a court at Lleweni in the mid to late 16th century. He was Controller of North Wales under Henry VIII, and died in 1578. The house was huge, with three wings and dozens of windows. His grandson inscribed a list of festive songs in a book of Welsh poetry in the 1590s. The Salusburys were closely associated with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Sir John Salusbury was the grandfather of the John Salusbury who was Catrin of Berain's second son. In 1586 he married Ursula, illegitimate daughter of the 4th Earl of Derby and half-sister of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby. Lleweni Hall had over 200 rooms, according to Hester Piozzi, who spent part of her childhood on the estate. After the death of her uncle, the hall was the seat of the Cotton baronets. However the upkeep of Lleweni was ruinously expensive. Initially leased out in 1776, following the death of Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton, it was sold by his son Sir Stapleton Cotton, 6th Baronet to pay taxes and the debts of his father. Cotton later regretted selling Lleweni Hall after having regained his fortune. Part of the 1810 notice of the sale of the estate runs as follows: > \\"The very extensive and valuable FREEHOLD ESTATES comprising the noble > Mansion of Lleweny Hall, which contains ample accommodation for a family of > the first distinction, together with a new erected and very commodious > bleach works, water corn-mill, and iron forge, all well supplied with water, > a public-house, and several improveable farms: the whole containing near > 4000 acres of extraordinary rich meadow, pature, arable, and wood land, in a > high state of cultivation, and lying nearly in a ring fence.\\" The new owner, William Hughes, who had made his fortune in copper mining, tore down part of Lleweni to build Kinmel Hall, which he did not live to see completed. Kinmel Hall, which was finally built in 1871 by descendants of Hughes, closely mimics the fa√ßade of Lleweni. St Mary's and St Michael's Church, Burleydam, Cheshire, formerly the Cotton family's private chapel, has gates and railings from the hall.Hartwell C, Hyde M, Hubbard E, Pevsner N.

Originally meant to be a six-issue series, response was positive enough that Malibu decided to make the series ongoing. The series was cancelled (along with the rest of the \\"Genesis\\" titles) so that, according to Malibu, they could focus more on the \\"Ultraverse\\" line.Letters page, The Protectors #20, 1994. Many of the characters included in the series were taken from heroes created by Centaur Publications, and had fallen into the Public Domain and revamped by writer R.A. Jones. Some heroes were given new names, such as: Gravestone (formerly Fantom of the Fair, Fantom or Fantoman), Nightmask (Masked Marvel), Thresher (a.k.a. Shark), and Midnight Blue (formerly Blue Lady). In the case of Gravestone, the name was changed to avoid confusion with Lee Falk's Phantom (although there were a few instances when the hero was referred to as \\"Fantom\\" within the pages of the first few issues). Nightmask was changed from Masked Marvel to avoid any potential legal problems with Marvel Comics (both explanations appeared in the letter column page of the first issue of The Protectors apparently forgetting the fact that \\"Nightmask\\" was also the name of a dream-surfing superhero in their New Universe imprint from the late 1980s). Many of Centaur's heroes received updated costumes, but retained their original names, including Zardi The Eternal Man, Amazing Man, Mighty Man, Man of War, Iron Skull, Mantoka, Arrow, Witch and Airman, along with the villains The Great Question and Conqueror. Malibu also made use of the Rocket Ranger (a character created by the video game company Cinemaware) within the pages of Man of War's series and Miss Fury, who they had licensed for a previous series. With the 13th issue of the series, Malibu started the \\"Genesis\\" cross-over, which incorporated the books \\"Dinosaurs for Hire\\" and \\"Ex-Mutants\\" as part of the six-issue story. At the end of the cross-over, characters from the Protectors would appear in the pages of Ex-Mutants (and vice versa). The Protectors was cancelled with issue 20, in 1994 (the year Malibu was purchased by Marvel Comics), with readers witnessing the destruction of the Earth, making any type of continuation of the heroes' story highly unlikely. Within the Marvel Comics multiverse, the Genesis Universe is designated as Earth-1136.  Backstory  In the world of The Protectors, heroes (known as Supranormals in this universe) had been around since the late 1930s. The Clock (Brian O'Brien) and Nightmask (Phillip Reinhart) were two of the earliest heroes to fight crime. Others included Amazing Man, Gravestone, Prince Zardi the Eternal Man, Iron Skull, The Eye and Miss Fury (as revealed in The Protectors Handbook and issue 11 of the Protectors' series). With the debut of more powerful heroes to fight crime, The Clock and Nightmask put away their costumes and joined the military. Starting in 1979, other heroes began to appear, including Man of War, Mighty Man, The Witch, Airman, The Shark (a.k.a. Thresher), The Arrow, Ferret, Aura and Arc. These heroes would gather together in the town of Brinkstone, VA to battle various villains (a group that included The Conqueror, Wisecrack and Jackdaw). The resulting conflict caused the destruction of the town, and The Conqueror, Wisecrack, Jackdaw and most of the citizens of the town were transported to a demon-dimension. While other villains may have been involved in this battle, it is not clear who they were, if they were transported away to another dimension, or what happened to them afterwards. The general public and the government became suspicious of the supranormals after these events, and under increasing pressure, all of the heroes involved eventually retired (as related in the Protectors Handbook). In 1988, Brian O'Brien had been elected President of the United States of America. He still felt that supranormals would some day be needed, so he appointed Phillip Reinhart as the head of \\"Project: Golden Age\\". Reinhart's task was to track down and locate all of the heroes so that if the need arose, they could be contacted and called into action. Once Mr Monday and his Steel Army began terrorizing innocent people years later, the Protectors were called into action. The initial team consisted of Man of War, Airman, Arc, Aura, Gravestone, Amazing Man, The Ferret, Prince Zardi, and Mighty Man. Richard Reinhart assumed the mantle of Nightmask, against his father's wishes. With no powers or enhanced abilities, Richard pushed himself hard to prove his worth to the team, but in the end he was killed by Mr Monday (issue # 5 of The Protectors). The Witch would also join the group, proving to be a calming influence on Amazing Man, who was secretly being controlled by his old foe, The Great Question. After Nightmask's death, The Eye helped create the third hero to take-on the Nightmask moniker. The story of Brinkstone was revisited during issues 7‚Äì9, as the team, along with Thresher and Arrow, travelled to a demon-dimension ruled by Wisecrack. During this mission, Gravestone and Arc were captured by Wisecrack. He had Gravestone tortured in order to learn how it was that the heroes were in this dimension, but Gravestone died before revealing anything. He would return to life, as explained in the Gravestone series, by battling his way out of the Underworld. As the heroes attacked Wisecrack's fortress, the villain escaped along with the majority of slaves (former citizens of the town) through a portal connecting to a similar dimension, but The Ferret and Arrow were able to rescue one woman after Arrow killed Jackdaw. Black Fury became the group's next opponent (issues 10‚Äì12) when she kidnapped President O'Brien's grandson Michael. Miss Fury arrived to help, but with Amazing Man in-charge of the team in Man of War's absence (busy with events in his own series), the female hero was attacked instead of welcomed. Only the intervention of O'Brien himself restored order. The Protectors were able to rescue Michael, but Black Fury escaped. Next, the team became involved in \\"Genesis\\", Malibu's big cross-over event involving The Protectors, Ex-Mutants and Dinosaurs for Hire titles, with the main villain being Extreme. Afterwards, The Protectors received a new field commander by the name of Chalice, Man of War was put on trial for events that happened during Genesis, and the team battled The Regulators. Finally, the team faced The Great Question, learned that Amazing Man was being manipulated by the villain, and were killed when one of the villain's portals caused the Earth to explode.

Biography Moody grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, with her parents, Charles and Marcelline, and three siblings, older brother Richard (The Bills), older sister Jane and younger sister Rachel. She was trained classically from the age of four but unlike her two sisters and brother she did not take to a stringed instrument, and from her mid-teens began to train vocally instead. In 1993 she began to study English and French literature at university with the intent of becoming a teacher like both her parents. She changed her course in 1996 and decided to forge a life out of folk music instead. Moody's first band was the Juno- nominated roots band Scruj MacDuhk, for whom she was lead singer from 1997 until the group's break up in 2001. After this split Ruth began to focus on her songwriting and picked up the guitar, adding it to her repertoire of piano, bodhran, accordion and banjo. It was also at this time that she started a musical collaboration with Nicky Mehta and Cara Luft. In 2002 the three took to the stage as The Wailin' Jennys. The Jennys (now Ruth Moody, Nicky Mehta and New York-based Heather Masse) have won international critical acclaim and numerous awards including Juno awards for their albums 40 Days and Bright Morning Stars. They have toured in North America, Europe and Australia. Since 2002 Moody has released four full-length albums and an EP with The Wailin' Jennys, and an album with two ex-members of Scruj MacDuhk, Jeremy Penner and Oliver Swain, called South Bound. In July 2002 she released a solo EP called Blue Muse and in April 2010 she released her first full-length solo album, The Garden, produced by David Travers-Smith. The Garden was critically acclaimed and nominated for a Juno award, a Western Canadian Music Award, and three Canadian Folk Music Awards. In 2013 Moody released a new full-length solo album entitled These Wilder Things which included guitar and vocal support from Mark Knopfler among others. She also released a split 7 inch single with Old Man Luedecke in the spring of 2014, entitled \\"Far and Wide\\". The album was once again produced by David Travers-Smith. In 2015, Moody recorded a duet with Mark Knopfler entitled \\"Wherever I Go\\", which subsequently appeared on his 2015 release, Tracker. She has toured as direct support for Mark Knopfler a number of times in Europe, and has appeared on stage with him for a handful of shows in the US. Since the release of \\"These Wilder Things\\" in 2013 Ruth Moody has been touring non-stop throughout the world, as both a solo artist with her own band, or with The Wailin' Jennys. Moody has received recognition for several of her compositions in the USA Songwriting Competition and the International Songwriting Competition. In April 2012 she won first prize in the International Songwriting Competition (Gospel Category) for her song \\"Storm Comin\\".

He was a member of the Reichstag between 1881 and 1884, between 1885 and 1898, and between 1901 and 1903. Career Barth started his political career with the National Liberal Party. He soon rejected the Manchesterism of the old liberals, though, and claimed that liberalism needed a social programme. To that end, he sought the cooperation of the Social Democrats, and at multiple times voted against his own party. In the German Freeminded Party (Freisinnige Partei), founded in 1884, Barth would soon find himself opposed to the leadership of Eugen Richter. When the Freeminded Party split in 1893, Barth became a member of the Freeminded Union (Freisinnigen Vereinigung), instead of the Freeminded People's Party of Richter. In 1903, Friedrich Naumann would join the Freeminded Union as well. Barth however would found the Democratic Union (Demokratische Vereinigung) in 1908, together with Rudolf Breitscheid and Hellmut von Gerlach, after the Freeminded Union's participation in the B√ºlow- Block coalition in the 1907 elections. Barth founded the liberal weekly Die Nation (The Nation) in 1883 and remained as editor until his death in 1909.

History Thaksin University, named from the Sanskrit word 'Thaksin' meaning 'of the South', is an autonomous university of the Royal Thai Government. An early adopted, Thaksin University achieved this independence of management while continuing to receive Government budget when parliament passed the Thaksin University Act, which became effective on September 1, 1996. It shares this special status with a select number of other institutions that have embarked on a process to become global institutions that operate with a degree of autonomy compared to those that continue as effectively part of the public service model. Beginning life as the College of Education in Songkhla on October 1, 1968, it became Srinakharinwirot University, Songkhla Campus. Its initial four-year degree programs have since expanded now include all degree levels in most academic disciplines in established faculties across the two main campuses of Songkhla and Phattalung. In 2010, the Thaksin University Council approved an International Ph.D. program based on research; the program is wholly managed through the university and based on international standards and approaches with respected senior academic staff from a range of developed nations.  Programs, Campuses and Centers  =International Ph.D. Program= :The Thaksin University International Ph.D. Program is wholly based on research following the traditional and elite international model.

Born in Seaham, County Durham, England in 1897, her family emigrated to Ontario, Canada in 1905. As a young woman, she studied at the University of Toronto. In 1921, she married Nelson Willard Haynes, a dentist, and they moved to Edmonton, where she soon established herself as a director, actor and teacher. In 1928, she helped organize the Alberta Drama League (which became a model for the Dominion Drama Festival). In 1933, she became provincial drama specialist at the Department of Extension of the University of Alberta, and it was from this post that she began to recreate much of Alberta's theatre scene. She wrote technical works and broadcast her reviews and lessons on radio. She travelled the province, to school and community groups, coaching them, demonstrating and adjudicating competitions. 1933 was also the year she co-founded the Banff Centre for the Arts. Failing health began to play a role in her life soon after, though she continued to stay as active as physically possible until her death in 1957. Said Gwen Pharis Ringwood of her: > Elizabeth was a force; a creative energy unleashed at a time when creativity > was suspect and in a place where creativity was often ignored in the hope > that it would go away. Edmonton's Sterling Awards are named in her honour.

The group began work in January 1998 and issued their unanimous final report on July 15, 1998, within the six-month mandate. The report warned of a growing threat of ballistic missiles and the inability for US intelligence to keep track of developments. This contrasted with the views of previous US intelligence estimates, which stated that the threat of ballistic missiles was still 10 to 20 years away. The commission further fueled the debate over a national missile defense system, and may have contributed to the coining of the phrase axis of evil. The use of Scud missile designs for future long-range weapons was a primary concern of the commission. Background The argument for a national missile defense system in the United States was traditionally to protect the country from a Soviet missile attack. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, proponents of a missile defense shield began instead to focus on the risk posed by rogue states developing ballistic missiles capable of eventually reaching the US.Graham, 32. This case was blunted by a 1995 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), which stated that no country besides the five major nuclear powers was capable of acquiring missiles that could reach Canada or the contiguous United States within the ensuing 15 years. Republican lawmakers intent on funding a defensive shield criticized the report and the Clinton administration for inaccurate assessments and distorted intelligence. Republican Congressman Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania walked out of a CIA briefing on the NIE, and later said that it was \\"the most outrageous politicisation of an intelligence document that I've seen in the 10 years I've been in Washington.\\" From February to May 1996, the House National Security Committee held hearings on the ballistic missile threat, and in a final report recommended that two reviews be created: one to investigate the NIE itself, and another to complete a new investigation of the ballistic missile threat. This process was also highly politicized, and the ranking Democrat on the committee, California Congressman Ronald Dellums, accused it of relying far too heavily on outside experts. Many of the witnesses called before the committee were in fact strong proponents of missile defense. The first review was conducted by former Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and future Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He concluded that while there was evidence of faulty methodology in the NIE, there was no political bias in its conclusions.Graham, 34. This conclusion again angered the missile defense supporters who had counted on this review to further their arguments. Commission history The second review was to be conducted by an outside commission, although it took lawmakers until 1997 to agree upon the commission's membership. The commission eventually began to meet in mid- January 1998 in the Old Executive Office Building and under the chairmanship of the once and future Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. Although the commission was not formed to investigate the feasibility of a national missile defense shield, the reality that their conclusions would influence that debate led many in Washington to doubt that a unanimous conclusion was possible.Graham, 35. Rumsfeld still wished to reach a consensus, and instituted a policy whereby any noted objection in the report needed to have the support of at least two commissioners.Graham, 36. The first weeks of deliberations and testimonies gleaned little new information on the threat being investigated, so in mid-February, with their mandate supposedly giving them access to all necessary information from the executive branch, the commission complained in person to then DCI George Tenet. From that point on, the commission gained much greater access to the information and personnel of the US intelligence community.Graham, 37. The commission continued briefings until mid-July 1998. During that time they were frustrated by the compartmentalization of intelligence,Because classified intelligence was not widely distributed in the intelligence community, the commission found that many of the people they interviewed were unaware of other relevant information. the refusal of analysts to speculate or hypothesize on given information, and what they considered general inexperience in the intelligence personnel.Graham, 37-39 The group did not limit their interviews to members of the government, but also spoke with employees of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, especially about how Scud missile designs could be used as the basis for a long-range ballistic missile program.Graham, 43-33 Conclusions There were two final reports of the commission: a 300-page classified report for Congress and a 27-page unclassified report. In the unclassified version, the group came to four unanimous conclusions: * The US is threatened by ballistic missiles tipped with biological or nuclear payloads from China, Russia, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Iran and North Korea could develop the capability to strike the US within five years of a decision to pursue ballistic missile technology; Iraq would require ten years.Report of the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States * The US intelligence community has underestimated these growing threats. * The processes of the intelligence community to make estimates on this threat are causing an erosion of accurate assessments. * The US has a diminishing warning time before missile systems are operationally deployed, and may conceivably have no warning in the future. Aftermath =Immediate= The findings of the commission generated mixed reactions among lawmakers, intelligence officers, and experts. The intelligence community was privately angered by the harsh language the report used to describe their own assessments of the threat, although CIA Director George Tenet did not openly criticize it in public.Graham, 48-9 Congressional proponents of a national missile shield, especially Republicans, used the findings to further push their case that such a shield was necessary.Graham, 48. However, some experts in and out of government questioned the usefulness of the report, saying that it made general speculations without reaching any definite conclusions.Graham, 49. Whereas the intelligence estimate focused on what was actually occurring, the commission focused on what might occur. This was labeled in one article \\"'hypothesis-based' threat assessment\\". Many observers took a moderate tone in their reaction, acknowledging that funding should be provided for further national missile defense tests, but also saying that the US should not rush into developing technology that might prove ineffective and too costly.\\"The Rumsfeld Commission - Where Do We Go From Here? \\", Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, August 4, 1998. Retrieved November 30, 2006. Within months of the final report several events occurred which to some supporters reinforced the commission's conclusions. In late July, Iran tested for the first time its new Shahab-3 missile, which traveled before exploding. Its basic design was modeled on the North Korean Rodong-1.Shahab-3 / Zelzal-3, Federation of American Scientists. Retrieved November 1, 2006.DECLARATION OF POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES CONCERNING NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE DEPLOYMENT, 106th Congress US House of Representatives. Retrieved November 1, 2006. North Korea launched what it described as a three-stage satellite launch on August 31 of that year, a surprise for US intelligence, which had expected a test of the two-stage Taepodong-1 (partially based on the Scud). While the third stage failed, it was nonetheless a major development in that introduced stage separation and solid fuel in North Korean rocketry. =Bush Administration= The commission reentered the public consciousness in 2000 when the former chairman of the commission, Donald Rumsfeld, was named by newly elected President George W. Bush to be Secretary of Defense, his second time in that office. On December 30, 2000, Richard Garwin, a former commissioner, praised Rumsfeld for his commission work in a New York Times op-ed piece, although he reiterated that the commission never suggested whether or not the US should build a missile defense system.Garwin, Richard L. \\"Count on Rumsfeld, Not the Missile Shield\\", The New York Times, December 30, 2000. Other staffers and members of the commission were also appointed by the new Bush administration: Paul Wolfowitz was named Deputy Secretary of Defense, William Schneider, Jr. was appointed by Rumsfeld to the Defense Science Board, and in March 2003 Stephen Cambone was selected by Rumsfeld to fill the newly created Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence position. Robert Gates, the man who conducted the first review of the ballistic missile threat, was appointed Secretary of Defense after Rumsfeld's November 2006 resignation. The commission is thought by some foreign policy analysts to be the basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members. Participants The commission was chaired by former Secretary of Defense and Republican Donald Rumsfeld, and included the following members: =Republicans= * William Graham * William Schneider, Jr. * General Larry Welch, US Air Force Ret. * Paul Wolfowitz * James Woolsey =Democrats= * Barry Blechman * George Lee Butler * Richard Garwin =Core Staff= * Stephen Cambone * Steven Maaranen * Eric Desautels * David Dunham * Jason Roback * Bernard Victory * Delonnie Henry See also * Intercontinental ballistic missile * Intermediate-range ballistic missile * Short-range ballistic missile * Tactical ballistic missile * Nuclear weapons delivery * Anti-ballistic missile Notes References * Graham, Bradley.

Average daily ridership among all public transit services provided by MTS was 282,300 in the Fourth Quarter of 2019 and saw an annual ridership of 86,554,400 in 2019. MTS is one of the oldest transit systems in Southern California, with predecessors dating back as early as the 1880s. Subsidiaries include the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway Railway Company (SD&AE;), San Diego Transit Corporation (SDTC), and San Diego Trolley, Inc. (SDTI). MTS also licenses and regulates taxicabs, jitneys, and other private for-hire passenger transportation services provided by contract for the cities of San Diego, El Cajon, Imperial Beach, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, Poway and Santee. Governance MTS is a joint powers authority agency, or JPA. Member cities include San Diego, Chula Vista, Coronado, El Cajon, Imperial Beach, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, National City, Poway, Santee, and San Diego County. Elected officials from each jurisdiction, including San Diego County, serve as the Board of Directors. The city of San Diego has the most representation with four members. A county resident is elected by the Board of Directors to serve as the Chairman. History =Origins= A system of horse- or mule-drawn streetcars was established in Downtown San Diego in 1886. In 1887 electric streetcar service was begun, serving a more widespread area including Old Town and University Heights. The direct ancestor of MTS, the San Diego Electric Railway Company, was founded in 1891 by John D. Spreckels, who purchased several existing transit companies and converted them all to electric operation. In the 1920s and 1930s the rail lines began to be replaced by motor buses. In 1949 the last rail service was discontinued, making San Diego the first major city in California to convert to an all-bus system. In 1948 Jesse Haugh purchased the system from the Spreckels family and renamed it the San Diego Transit System. The City of San Diego bought the system in 1967. The Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) was formed in 1976 and launched the San Diego Trolley in 1981. The city transferred San Diego Transit to MTDB in 1985. MTDB changed its name to Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) in 1986. Today, the agency is one of two child agencies of SANDAG, the county-level MPO that zones land and sets the transit fares. =Recent history= More recent developments at MTS are summarized below. 2005 *MTS adopts its current logo and livery, which was first applied to buses entering service that summer. 2007 *MTS assumes control over National City Transit from the City of National City, amid the City's reluctance to implement findings of the COA, retires its 600-series bus route numbers, and replaces them with the current 960-series numbers. 2009 *MTS is named the Outstanding Public Transit System for 2009 by the American Public Transportation Association. *In fiscal year 2009, MTS set a record for ridership with over 92 million rides from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009. *September 24: San Diego Trolley places an order for 57 Ultra Short Low Floor Model S70 LRVs, at a total cost of $205 million. 2010 *San Diego Trolley begins construction on the \\"Trolley Renewal Project\\". The project is expected to last five years and renovates all stations and existing infrastructure to handle the new Low Floor S70 LRVs purchased the previous year. 2011 *MTS begins work on a study to evaluate the feasibility of reconnecting Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo and Downtown San Diego through a fixed-guideway, electrified streetcar line. *MTS begins weekend and holiday service of the Silver Line, which operates around Downtown San Diego and features renovated PCC streetcars with a partnership with the San Diego historic streetcar society. 2012 *MTS receives first two shipments of 4th generation trolley vehicles and begins operating exclusively new LRVs on the Green Line *MTS realigns trolley system so all three lines terminate in downtown, eliminating the need for the special event line. The green line now serves special events. 2013 * Low floor (S70) trains operate on the Orange Line for the first time, marking the end of the first phase of the trolley renewal project. * First of the next-generation Gillig Low Floor buses arrive and are placed into service * First buses for the BRT network arrive 2014 *The first line in the Rapid BRT network goes into operation. 2015 * Low floor (S70) trains operate on the Blue Line for the first time in January, after new station platforms, advanced electronic signage, overhead catenary wires, larger shelters and track replacements are implemented. 2017 * the Transit Optimization Plan (TOP) is adopted 2018 * Additional low floor trolley cars (S700) are delivered. 2019 * January 26:The South Bay Rapid entered service between Downtown San Diego and the Otay Mesa Port of Entry. * April 20: New trolley cars (5000-series) enter service * July 13: Original car 1001 enters service on Silver Line * August: Electric buses to enter service 2020 *May 10: Paul Jablonski, chief executive officer, dies Public transportation MTS administers several public transportation services, including the San Diego Trolley's three daily Light rail lines, 93 fixed-route bus services, and paratransit service. About half of its fixed-route bus services are contracted out to Transdev, and First Transit, with First Transit also providing paratransit services. =Light rail service= San Diego Trolley Model SD100s in Downtown San Diego. March 2008 Light rail service is operated by the San Diego Trolley, Incorporated (SDTI). It is commonly referred to as \\"The Trolley\\". Three daily lines are operated, and are designated by their colors: the Blue Line, the Green Line, and the Orange Line; a fourth line, the heritage streetcar Silver Line, operates on select days during mid-day. Special Event service used to operate for large events occurring at SDCCU Stadium, Petco Park and the San Diego Convention Center via a special event Red Line, but the Red Line was eliminated with the Trolley system's realignment in September 2012. Light rail service provided by MTS is among the most utilized systems in terms of patronage in the United States. Generally, approximately 120,000 people have ridden the Trolley each weekday over the past two years. The Blue Line was the initial line to enter into service in July 1981, operating between San Ysidro and Downtown San Diego. The Orange Line began service in March 1986 linking eastern suburban areas such as El Cajon and La Mesa to Downtown San Diego as well. The Green Line began service in July 2005 and included the system's first underground station located at San Diego State University; it began operation to downtown San Diego as of the September 2012 realignment. The Green Line now operates between Santee & El Cajon, and Mission Valley, Old Town, and the 12th & Imperial Transit Center in Downtown San Diego. The heritage streetcar Silver Line began service in August 2011, operating a 'clockwise loop' route around Downtown San Diego on select days during mid-day, and featuring a renovated PCC streetcar. =Bus rapid transit service= Rapid Route 201 MTS initially operated three bus rapid transit (BRT) lines (Routes 201, 202 and 204) branded as \\"SuperLoop\\". The SuperLoop lines operated in the University City and La Jolla Village area serving the University of California, San Diego, Westfield UTC, Veteran's Administration Hospital, and residential districts, using 40-foot buses. Initial Superloop service began in June 2009, with an extension in March 2013. SuperLoop was incorporated into the Rapid network, which now has 9 routes. Route 235 is a transit service between Escondido and Santa Fe Depot operating along SR-94 and the Interstate 15 corridor. It opened for service in June 2014. This route uses 60-foot articulated buses. Route 215 operates from Downtown San Diego to San Diego State University via City Heights. Route 237 operates on a route from UCSD to Miramar College Transit Station via Mira Mesa. Both of these routes began operation in October 2014. Route 237 operates peak hours only, as local route 921a serves the entire route off-peak, late night, weekends and major holidays. The SuperLoop was incorporated into the Rapid brand in 2015. The routes are the same but are now designed as feeders to Route 237. During peak hours, two additional \\"Rapid Express\\" lines, Routes 280 and 290, operate along SR-163 and Interstate 15, between Downtown San Diego and Escondido and Rancho Bernardo, respectively. Over-the-road 45-foot coaches are used for this service. Service began on both routes in June 2014. Route 225 operates to the South Bay area, serving Otay Ranch and Eastlake, continuing to the international truck crossing at Otay Mesa. =Commuter and express bus service= Six express fixed-route bus lines (Routes 20, 50, 60, 110, 150, and 950) are operated along major roadways and highways and link intermediate distant suburban areas to the San Diego urban area. Two of the six express lines (Routes 60 and 110) only operate during the morning and evening weekday commute periods. Vehicles used for service are typically standard 40-foot buses or 60-foot articulated buses. =Urban and local bus service= MTS transdev bus Urban bus routes link the densely populated neighborhoods and adjacent cities together with direct and frequent bus service. These services constitute the bulk of fixed-route bus services operated in terms of vehicle requirements and patronage. Typically, headways are 12‚Äì15 minutes between scheduled bus arrival/departure times during commute periods and during midday times on the busiest lines. Generally, no worse than 30-minute headways occur during non-commute periods or 60-minute headways weekends. Local routes generally have stops placed every block or every other block. Limited-stop lines have stops placed every approximately quarter to half mile. Major arterial roads in the City Heights and North Park area of San Diego have both types of routes available, providing for more frequent service. Articulated buses are used during the summer on weekends on lines such as Route 30 to provide extra access to the beaches and tourist destinations. Route 7 utilizes articulated buses along University Ave due to it being the busiest bus route in San Diego.Route 7 Timetables (pdf) Local routes and shuttle services are also operated by MTS. These typically operate less frequently or have shorter routes. =Rural bus service= Rural transit services (Routes 888, 891/892 and 894) link the sparsely populated central and eastern portions of San Diego County to the San Diego urban core. Each rural service is linked to the San Diego Trolley and other fixed-route transit services at the El Cajon Transit Center. These lines offer much less frequent service ‚Äì Route 888 only operates on Mondays and Fridays, Route 891 on Fridays only, and Route 892 on Thursdays only; only Route 894 operates Mondays through Fridays. =Paratransit service= Paratransit services, operated under the name \\"MTS Access\\" provide point-to-point service upon request to passengers registered with MTS as being qualified for assistance under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Service is available throughout the MTS service area, and connections to a similar NCTD service are also available. Vehicles are sixteen-passenger van conversions equipped with wheelchair lifts and tiedowns. Twelve of the sixteen seats are collapsible, allowing space for up to 4 wheelchairs. Fares are $4.50 each way, though passengers are allowed to bring one companion (as a PCA, or Personal Care Assistant) free of charge. Additional fare-paying companions are also permitted. =Connecting transit services= Connecting public transit services include the BREEZE bus, SPRINTER light rail, and COASTER commuter rail services operated by the North County Transit District (NCTD) and bus route 217 operated by Riverside Transit. Amtrak operates several weekday and weekend train services (Pacific Surfliner) out of the downtown San Diego Santa Fe Depot. Some bus services enter the United States from Tijuana, Mexico. Fares On January 1, 2008, MTS raised fares and eliminated transfer passes for some fixed-route bus services. The regular passenger fare for each boarding increased from $1.75‚Äì$2.25 per boarding to a maximum $2‚Äì$2.25 per boarding depending on the route. The Monthly Pass increased from $60 to $64. Although the cash fare increase was modest, $0.25, the elimination of free 2-hour Transfer Passes was controversial. This impacted infrequent cash fare-paying riders using multiple bus routes to complete their trip the most because each boarding requires the full fare be paid. As a response, MTS encouraged riders to purchase a $5 Daily Pass for access on the whole system as it is approximately the same cost as the total would be for a round trip utilizing a single bus for each direction and paying the single-ride fare each time. A second option was to consider purchasing a $64 Monthly Pass. Effective January 1, 2009, MTS set fares for the San Diego Trolley at $1.25 for up to two hours within downtown San Diego, and $2.50 for all other one-way trolley service. Seniors (ages 60 and over), people with disabilities and Medicare cardholders pay 60 cents and $1.25 respectively. Further, the Monthly Pass increased from $64 to $68, with the youth pass at $34 and seniors/disabled/Medicare pass at $17. While the adult Premium Monthly Pass (including travel on $5 premium express buses) remained at $90, new $45 youth and $22.50 senior/disabled/Medicare premium monthly passes were introduced. Effective July 1, 2009, MTS eliminated the downtown zone fare category for the San Diego Trolley. As a result, the regular passenger fare for all one-way trips on the trolley became $2.50 regardless of origin or destination point; seniors, people with disabilities, and Medicare cardholders pay just $1.25 each. MTS also increased the passenger fare for shuttle bus routes to $2.25 ($1.10 senior/disabled/Medicare). All other single-ride cash fares remain unchanged. The cost of an ordinary 1-day pass also remained at $5, but the cost of a 1-day RegionPlus pass increased from $11 to $14. MTS also increased the prices of all monthly passes (e.g. from $68 to $72 for a regular 30-day adult pass) and began selling 14-day passes, which replace the half-month passes.

He lived in Moseley, a suburb of Birmingham, England, for over 50 years. ; also published as . A music academic in the universities of Hull and Birmingham for 36 years, Joubert took early retirement in 1986 to concentrate on composing and remained active into his eighties. Though perhaps best known for his choral music, particularly the carols Torches and There is No Rose of Such Virtue and the anthem O Lorde, the Maker of Al Thing, Joubert composed over 160 works including three symphonies, four concertos and seven operas.

His mother's ancestry was Dutch.Programme for Ex Cathedra's performance of John Joubert's Wings of Faith at The Oratory, Birmingham, on 22 March 2007. Joubert was educated at Diocesan College in Rondebosch, South Africa, which was founded by the Anglican Church and maintained a high standard of music-making. He originally hoped to become a painter, and did a fair amount of art at school. However, at about the age of 15 years, he gradually became interested in music, though as a composer rather than a performer. \\"It was always going to be something creative. Oddly enough, the visual arts haven't been as great a stimulus as literature. I was also interested in writing. In fact, I was bored by everything at school except writing, art and music!\\" In school, he came under the guidance of the musical director Claude Brown, whose teaching he regarded as \\"an indispensable foundation to my subsequent musical career\\". According to Joubert, \\"[t]hrough Brown, I learned all the Elgar choral works even before I heard them properly in full orchestral performance. Not only that idiom, but the idiom of Anglican church music generally. Parry and Stanford, and all the usual blokes.\\" Through his teacher's encouragement, Joubert was able to participate in choral performances with the Cape Town Municipal Orchestra under William J. Pickerill, and subsequently to hear his works featured in performance. After graduating from the South African College of Music in 1944 he began studying musical composition privately with William Henry Bell, an Englishman well known locally as a composer of distinction. Bell exerted the greatest influence on his composition. In 1946 he was awarded a Performing Right Society Scholarship in composition at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Here, his principal teachers were Theodore Holland, Howard Ferguson and Alan Bush. During his four years at the Academy he won a number of prizes for composition, notably the Frederick Corder prize and the 1949 Royal Philharmonic Society prize... Professional career In 1950 Joubert was appointed to a lectureship in music at the University of Hull,In Hull, John and Mary Joubert lived in a flat in a fine Victorian house, later to become the residence of the University of Hull's librarian, Philip Larkin (1922‚Äì1985), and immortalised in Larkin's poem High Windows. But to Joubert's chagrin, \\"there's now a blue plaque outside the place referring to Philip ‚Äì but with no mention of me.\\": . If the blue plaque referring to Philip Larkin was installed under the scheme run by English Heritage, then it is not surprising if there is no plaque referring to Joubert. Under this scheme, nominations for blue plaques are taken from the public only for people who have passed either the 20th anniversary of their death or the centenary of their birth, whichever is the earlier. having graduated in the same year with a Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.) degree from the University of Durham. His works soon began to be performed and to attract favourable attention. His carol Torches (Op. 7a, 1951) (written for his wife Mary's pupils and based on a Galician carol, it was published in 1961 in the first volume of Carols for Choirs) and the anthem O Lorde, the Maker of Al Thing (Op. 7b, 1952) (which won the 1952 Novello Anthem Competition), achieved almost instant popularity. Concerning Torches, Joubert recalled, \\"I've even had carol-singers come to the door and singing it, without knowing the composer lives inside.\\" Together with the carol There is No Rose of Such Virtue (Op. 14, 1954), the three choral works have become classics of the Anglican repertoire. Works in other genres followed, mostly as the result of commissions from institutions such as the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Society and the BBC, and from musical festivals such as the Three Choirs and Birmingham Triennial Festivals. By the end of his 12 years at Hull Joubert had composed, in addition to choral music, his Violin concerto (Op. 13, 1954), Symphony No. 1 (Op. 20, 1955), piano concerto (Op. 25, 1958), the full-length opera Silas Marner (Op. 31, 1961) (after the novel by George Eliot), and a body of chamber music including String quartet No. 1 in A-Flat (Op. 1, 1950), a string trio (Op. 30, 1958) and an Octet (Op. 33, 1961). Joubert moved to Moseley, Birmingham, in 1962 to take up a Senior Lectureship at the University of Birmingham; he was later made Reader in Music. In 1979 he was a visiting professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand.. The number and scope of his works increased, and among those composed during the following decades were two further full-length operas, Under Western Eyes (Op. 51, 1968) and Jane Eyre (Op. 134) (based on the novels by Joseph Conrad and Charlotte Bront√´ respectively), Symphony No. 2 (Op. 68, 1970), various large-scale choral works with orchestras including the oratorio The Raising of Lazarus (Op. 67, 1970) and Herefordshire Canticles (Op. 93, 1979), a second and third piano sonata (Op. 71, 1972; Op. 157), a second and third string quartet (Op. 91, 1977; Op. 112, 1986), song cycles with piano and/or instrumental ensembles, and accompanied and unaccompanied smaller-scale choral music. On the wide scope of his work, Joubert has commented: \\"I've never really wanted to be pigeonholed as a composer. I've always wanted to write anything that I was either asked to, or wanted to write. I've never wanted to specialise, although I have to a certain extent been pigeonholed already. I'd rather not be looked upon as sort of limited in that way.\\" The Aston Webb Building of the University of Birmingham. Joubert lectured at the University between 1962 and 1986, and remained an Honorary Senior Research Fellow there. In July 2007, the University conferred on him an Honorary Doctorate of Music (D.Mus.). In 1986 Joubert took early retirement from the University to concentrate on composition, although he maintained his ties by becoming an Honorary Senior Research Fellow there in 1997. He was conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Music (D.Mus.) by the University of Durham in 1991, and received another from the University of Birmingham on 18 July 2007.; . He was Composer in Residence at the Peterborough Cathedral Festival in 1990 (which also commissioned his Six Short Preludes on English Hymn Tunes, for chamber organ (Op. 125, 1990), and at the Presteigne Festival in 1997, and served as the chairman of the Birmingham Chamber Music Society for 25 years. Joubert remained active as a composer. 2007 was the year of his 80th birthday, and was celebrated with a series of concerts, the \\"Joubertiade 2007\\",The name was apparently inspired by the Schubertiade, a music festival honouring Franz Schubert founded in 1976 which is held primarily in the village of Schwarzenberg, Austria: see the Schubertiade Schwarzenberg website. throughout the United Kingdom.

Possibly a satire on Peter's reforms, or just a representation of carnivalesque inversion, \\"turning the world upside down\\". Popular prints is a term for printed images of generally low artistic quality which were sold cheaply in Europe and later the New World from the 15th to 18th centuries, often with text as well as images. They were some of the earliest examples of mass media. After about 1800, the types and quantity of images greatly increased, but other terms are usually used to categorise them.  15th century  The Seven Ages of Man, German, 1482, British Museum From about 1400, there began a \\"visual revolution that inundated Europe with images during the fifteenth century\\" (Field) as the woodcut technique was applied to paper, which was now manufactured in Christian Europe, instead of being imported from Islamic Spain. In the 15th century, the great majority of these images were religious, if playing cards are excluded. They were sold at churches, fairs and places of pilgrimage. Most were coloured, usually crudely, by hand or later by stencil. One political cartoon relating to events in 1468-70 has survived in several different versions (many from years later). Old master print is a term that at this period includes popular prints, but later is restricted to more expensive and purely artistic prints. Although early information as to prices is almost non-existent, it is clear from a number of sources that small woodcuts were affordable by at least the urban working-class, and much of the peasant class as well. During the middle of the century, the quality of the images became typically very low, but there was an improvement towards the end, partly because it was necessary to keep pace with the quality of images in engravings. Engravings were always much more expensive to create, as they needed greater skill to create the plate, which would last for far fewer impressions than a woodcut. They did not come into the popular prints category until the 19th century, when different techniques made them much cheaper.  16th century  Der Gro√üe Komet √ºber Prag, 12. November 1577, Zentralbibliothek Z√ºrich Broadsheets, also known as broadsides, were a common format. They were usually single sheets of paper of various sizes, typically sold by street-vendors. Another format was the chapbook, usually a single sheet cut or folded to make a small pamphlet or book. In Spain there were pliegos, in Portugal the papel volante, and in other countries other names. These covered a great variety of material, including pictures, popular history, political comment or satire, news, almanacs (from c. 1470), poems and songs. They could be very influential politically, and were often subsidized by political factions for propaganda purposes. See Broadside (music) for their musical use. The Reformation hugely increased the market for satirical and polemical prints in all counties affected. In France the Wars of Religion, and in England the English Civil War and the political convulsions after the Restoration all produced huge quantities of propaganda and polemic, in images as well as text. Despite being often issued in large numbers, their survival rate was extremely low, and they are now very rare, with most having not survived at all. This has been demonstrated by analysis of the records of the London Stationers Company from 1550 onwards; some blocks were in print for over a century with no copies now surviving. They were very commonly pasted to the walls of rooms. Paper was still sufficiently expensive that all available spare pieces tended to be used in the toilet. One of the biggest surviving collections with 439 prints is Wickiana at the Zentralbibliothek Z√ºrich.  After 1600  James Gillray's The Plumb-pudding in danger (1805), which caricatured Pitt and Napoleon, was voted the most famous of all UK political cartoons. Library of Congress Newspapers began in the early 17th century as an upmarket and expensive form of broadsheet (still a term for a large-format newspaper). The first in English came in 1620. During this century, books also became much cheaper and began to replace some types of popular print. These trends continued during the next century, and although most of the traditional types of popular print lived on until the 19th century or beyond, they were by then part of a much wider print culture, and the term is generally not used of them. One type of publication continuing into the 20th century is the Brazilian cordel literature (\\"string literature\\" ‚Äî it is hung on strings by the sellers) that continue to use woodcuts, and is part of a continuous tradition going back to the Portuguese papel volante of the 17th century. Lubok prints in Russia were another local variant. Political caricature prints for sale as single sheets are found as early as the 15th century but reached the peak of their popularity in much of Europe in the 18th and early 19th century, before the form migrated into newspapers and magazines. Above all, they were popular in England, where a high degree of freedom of the press meant that dedicated print-shops, often also acting as the publishers, could openly sell and display scathing images of the Royal Family and government politicians, a business that had to remain \\"under the counter\\" in much of Europe.

The museum is situated on a bluff overlooking the eastern end of the Columbia River Gorge. The structure was originally intended as a mansion for entrepreneur Samuel Hill (1857-1931), and was designed by architects Hornblower and Marshall. It was named Maryhill for Hill's wife, daughter of James J. Hill, a Great Northern Railroad baron, and was intended to be used as a home at which they could entertain Samuel Hill's school friend King Albert I of Belgium. Construction was halted upon America's entry into World War I. The unfinished museum building was dedicated on November 3, 1926 by Queen Marie of Romania, and was opened to the public on Hill's birthday (May 13) in 1940. The museum's first physical expansion was completed when the Mary and Bruce Stevenson Wing opened to the public in May 2012. It includes a plaza that overlooks the Columbia River, an education center, a collections suite, and a caf√©. Notable in the Maryhill Museum collection are: * Plaster and bronze sculptures and watercolors by Auguste Rodin, including versions of some of his most important works: The Burghers of Calais, The Thinker and portions of The Gates of Hell. * European and American paintings, including works by William McGregor Paxton, R. H. Ives Gammell, William Stanley Haseltine, Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton and Edwin Blashfield. * American Indian art, including baskets and beadwork from the Columbia Plateau region, * Mannequins and replica stage sets from the Th√©√¢tre de la Mode, * More than 300 chess sets from around the world, * Eastern Orthodox icons, including some donated by Queen Marie of Romania, * Palace furnishings and personal items that once belonged to Queen Marie, * Memorabilia associated with the dancer Lo√Øe Fuller, * Art Nouveau-era glass by √âmile Gall√©, Ren√© Lalique and others, * A permanent exhibit about Samuel Hill's life and projects, * An outdoor sculpture park containing more than a dozen works by Pacific Northwest artists, * Maryhill Loops Road, the first asphalt road in Washington state (1911) and site of the annual Maryhill Festival of Speed‚Äîthe only International Gravity Sports Association World Cup race in North America. The Maryhill Museum building was designed as a private residence for Sam Hill by Washington, D.C., architects Hornblower & Marshall. It was designed in a Beaux-Arts style and built of steel-reinforced concrete beginning in 1914. Hill imagined the structure as a ranch building amidst a 5,300-acre agricultural community that he was developing at the eastern end of the Columbia River Gorge. During a 1917 visit by his friend Lo√Øe Fuller, he decided to turn his unfinished home into ‚Äúa museum for the public good, and for the betterment of French art in the far Northwest of America.‚Äù Hill's contribution to the new museum included almost 90 American Indian baskets, more than 70 Rodin sculptures and watercolors, and many personal items. Fuller, herself, provided the museum with plaster casts of the hands of more than a dozen period celebrities. She gave the museum numerous small, carved ivory crucifix figures that were originally given to her by D√©sir√©-Joseph Mercier, Cardinal Archbishop of Mechelen. She also convinced some of her many friends to make their own donations to the fledgling museum. Palace furnishings of Queen Marie and other related items. During her 1926 visit for the museum's dedication, Queen Marie of Romania gave Maryhill more than 100 objects. These included personal items, Romanian folk objects, Russian icons and diverse textiles. That same year, Queen Marie's oldest daughter Elisabetha, the former Queen Consort of Greece, gave the museum a collection of small Tanagra figurines and a number of ancient Cypriot amphorae. A year earlier, the museum had received its very first donation‚Äîthree silver filigree objects‚Äîfrom Queen Marie's second daughter, Marie, Queen Consort of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Maryhill Museum owes a profound debt to its fourth great patron, Alma de Bretteville Spreckels. Following the deaths of Hill (1931), Fuller (1928) and Queen Marie (1938), she worked tirelessly to turn Sam Hill's unfinished mansion into an art museum. Over the years, Spreckels had acquired many objects from Queen Marie that were intended for a \\"Romanian Room\\" in San Francisco's California Palace of the Legion of Honor. She instead donated this material to Maryhill Museum in 1938. It included Queen Marie's gold throne and other unique pieces of Byzantine- inspired furniture, a replica of her coronation crown, and other objects. Spreckels also gave Maryhill a collection of art glass by artists such as √âmile Gall√© and Ren√© Lalique, some Art Deco ceramics by Seraphine Soudbinine, European paintings, and ecclesiastical textiles from the Armenian Apostolic Church. Detail of Rodin's Minotaur, one of many Rodin sculptures at Maryhill. Spreckels‚Äô efforts also helped bring the Th√©√¢tre de la Mode to Maryhill. After being displayed in Paris in 1945‚Äì1946, the mannequins toured Europe and the United States. Their final American venue was the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. Organizers then attempted to return them to Paris, but the Th√©√¢tre de la Mode originator, the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, was unwilling to pay custom charges. The mannequins were stored in San Francisco's City of Paris department store while a decision was made about their future. Spreckels suggested that the mannequins be sent to Maryhill, and they arrived at the museum in time for the 1952 season. Others also contributed to the early growth of Maryhill's art collection. Clifford Dolph, who served as the museum's first director (1938‚Äì1972), had a passion for chess. With the encouragement of the museum's Board of Trustees, he began collecting chess sets in 1957. Dolph was also an astute admirer of realist painting and many of the museum's most important works of art were acquired during his tenure. He exhibited, purchased and promoted the work of American artists associated with Classical Realism. In 2000, the R. H. Ives Gammell Studios Trust gave the museum a 23-panel series titled A Pictorial Sequence Painted by R. H. Ives Gammell Based on The Hound of Heaven. The paintings had premiered at Maryhill in 1957 and the museum's relationship with Gammell and the artists in his circle can be directly linked to the decision to permanently place the works at the museum. American Indian art has always been an important part of Maryhill Museum's mission. Beginning with Sam Hill's own collection, the Indian basketry holdings now total more than 900 items. A particularly important Indian art donation was made in 1940 by Mary Underwood Lane. She was the granddaughter of Cascade chief Welawa, also known as Chief Chenoweth. Lane's gift included fur trade-era objects and many carved, woven and beaded items from the Middle Columbia River region. A large collection of Arctic material was given to the museum in 1979 by the heirs of Harvey T. Harding, who had operated a store in Nome, Alaska, from 1899 to 1907. Harding kept a journal of his Arctic experiences and a careful record of the objects that he collected‚Äîmany of which are identified by place and date of collection. The museum collection also includes numerous historic photographs, archival materials and reference texts. Maryhill Stonehenge, a concrete replica Stonehenge, is located at the eastern end of Maryhill Museum's property. It was commissioned by Sam Hill and dedicated in 1918 as a memorial to local World War I dead. It was completed in 1929.

Symptoms include an inability to tolerate any time spent without that person, obsessive fantasies surrounding the person, and spending inordinate amounts of time seeking out, making, or looking at images of that person. Characteristics Although obsessive love is not categorized under any specific mental diagnosis by the DSM-5, it can often accompany other mental illnesses.Obsessive Love Disorder, from Healthline Depending on the intensity of their attraction, obsessive lovers may feel entirely unable to restrain themselves from extreme behaviors such as acts of violence toward themselves or others.

It is generally seen at elevations of up to 800 m above sea level, where it is found in tall lowland or hill forests. Description The fearful owl is a large forest owl growing to a length of about . It has a rufous facial disk and distinct white eyebrows. The inner edge of the facial disk is also white. It is usually mottled brown with deep ochre underparts and blackish streaks. This species may be confused with the Solomon hawk owl, although the latter is slightly smaller and more slender. It is also similar in appearance to the laughing owl, which is now extinct.The Hawk Conservancy Trust Its call is similar to a clear human scream, increasing in volume and tone and emitted in a series, each pulse being repeated at intervals of ten seconds. Distribution and habitat The fearful owl is endemic to the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea and to Choiseul Island and to Santa Isabel Island in the Solomon Islands. It is found in old- growth lowland and hill forest, usually in primary forest but also sometimes in nearby secondary forest and woodland edges to at least above sea level. Behaviour Though generally nesting in tree holes and cracks, nests of the fearful owl have been found on the epiphyte-covered branches of large fig trees (Ficus spp.), both in primary forest and close to the forest edge and near gardens. Status The fearful owl preys on phalangers, especially the northern common cuscus. Overhunting of the northern common cuscus may be threatening the fearful owl, although habitat loss due to logging is the primary cause of population decline.

Since most diesel locomotives are diesel-electric, they have all the components of a series hybrid transmission except the storage battery, making this a relatively simple prospect. Surplus energy from the power source, or energy derived from regenerative braking, charges the storage system. During acceleration, stored energy is directed to the transmission system, boosting that available from the main power source. In existing designs, the storage system can be electric traction batteries, or a flywheel. The energy source is diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, or hydrogen (for fuel cells) and transmission is direct mechanical, electric or Diesel electric locomotives may have most of what they need for regenerative braking since they might already use dynamic braking. This uses the traction motors as generators to absorb much of the train's energy, but without a way to store the generated electricity it is simply dumped into the atmosphere as heat with large rooftop resistor banks and cooling fans. Using a storage system means that a non-fully electric train can use regenerative (as opposed to merely dynamic) braking, and even shut down the main power source whilst idling or stationary. Reducing energy consumption provides environmental benefits and economic savings. A smaller scale version of the concept is found in hybrid automobiles, such as the Chevrolet Volt. Development The Patton Motor Car, manufactured by Patton Motor Company, was a gas-electric hybrid system, although the term hybrid was not yet in use. William H. Patton filed for a patent on February 25, 1889; the drawings on his patent application resemble later descriptions of his first prototype.W. H. Patton, Motor for Street Cars, , granted Aug. 13, 1889. Patton built a tram car that was in experimental service in Pullman, Illinois in 1891 and a small Patton locomotive was sold to a street railway company in Cedar Falls, Iowa in 1897. The latter used a 2-cylinder, 25 hp gasoline engine to drive a 220 volt generator that served to charge the 200 Ampere hour 100 cell lead acid battery in parallel with the traction motors. The engine ran at constant speed, with a shunt-wound generator that also served as an electric starter motor. A conventional series-parallel controller was used for the two 35 hp traction motors that drove the wheels of the locomotive.The Patton Motor, The Street Railway Journal, Vol. VII, No. 10 (October, 1891); pages 513-514. Includes Photo.The Patton Motor Car, The Railway World, Vol. VII, (April 7, 1898); pages 114-115. Includes photo and drawing.The Patton Motor Car, English Mechanic and World of Science, no. 1713 (Jan. 21, 1898); page 524. The term mixed drive train came to be used at the turn of twentieth century. The Pieper system was applied to Belgian (Vicinal tramway) and French (Compagnie des Chemins de Fer de Grande Banlieue) railcars as early as 1911. La Nature, 1921 Bulletin de la soci√©t√© d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale, 1924 The Thomas system, manufactured by Thomas Transmission Ltd. of England, which is similar in design to the mechanical part of the Hybrid Synergy Drive, was used in the United Kingdom and tested in New Zealand in a NZR RM class railcar. =Czechoslovakia= In 1986, Czechoslovak locomotive manufacturer ƒåKD built a prototype hybrid shunting locomotive termed the DA 600. The locomotive was powered a 190-kW diesel engine and four electric motors, with a maximum overall power 360 kW powered from batteries. The batteries were recharged while the diesel engine was running, by regenerative braking or from external electric power. After tests on the Railway test circuit Velim and some minor tweaks, the locomotive was lent to the Olomouc train depot and successfully operated there for ten years. Czechoslovak socialist economics failed to start mass production, mainly because of a lack of proper battery manufacturing capacities. =Japan= In May 2003, JR East started test runs using a KiYa E991 \\"NE Train\\" (\\"New Energy Train\\") railcar, testing the system performance in cold regions. The design had two 65-kilowatt fuel cells and six hydrogen tanks under the floor, with a lithium-ion battery on the roof. The test train was capable of 100 kilometres per hour (60 mph) with a range of 50‚Äì100 kilometres (30‚Äì60 mi) between hydrogen refills. Research was underway into the use of regenerative braking to recharge the test train's batteries, intending to increase the range further. JR had stated that it hoped to introduce the train into scheduled local service during the summer of 2007. Technology tested on this train was incorporated in the KiHa E200 diesel/battery railcars entering service in 2007. The first JR Freight Class HD300 shunting locomotive was delivered from Toshiba on 30 March 2010. The new locomotive uses lithium ion batteries, and is designed to reduce exhaust emissions by at least 30% to 40% and noise levels by at least 10 dB compared with existing Class DE10 diesel locomotives.JR Freight press release: \\"Êñ∞ÂûãÂÖ•ÊèõÂ∞ÇÁî®Ê©üÈñ¢Ëªä(Ë©¶‰Ωú)„ÅÆÂΩ¢ÂºèÂêç„Å®„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶\\" (Class name and design of new shunting locomotive prototype) (10 February 2010) .

In 2008, a pair of British Rail Class 139 railcars were ordered to provide full service on the branch line from 2009 onwards. During 2007, a modified Class 43 power car ran on the Great Central Railway and then as part of the Network Rail New Measurement Train (a 200-kilometre per hour track-recording train). The Hitachi developed system used a battery-assisted diesel-electric drive system; the hope being that it would demonstrate a cut in emissions by up to 50 percent and a reduction in fuel consumption costs of 20 percent. The modified locomotive, named Hayabusa, was semi-permanently attached to a converted passenger carriage containing the battery bank during the testing period. =North America= Railpower A Green Goat hybrid shunting locomotive In 2004, Railpower Technologies, a Canadian company, began running pilots in the United States with the Green Goat shunting locomotives.

He was Professor Emeritus at the Ouro Preto Mining School (now part of the Federal University of Ouro Preto) and at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, in Belo Horizonte. At both institutions, he taught geological sciences for over 35 years. He was a grandson of Councillor Joaquim Caetano da Silva Guimar√£es and of the Senator Manoel Teixeira da Costa. Guimar√£es was brought up in a family which had produced such Brazilian writers as Bernardo Guimar√£es and Alphonsus de Guimaraens. He was also a nephew of scientists Pandi√° Cal√≥geras and Paul Ferrand. Career Guimar√£es' interest in mineralogy, petrography and geology was inspired during his student years at the Ouro Preto Mining School by the lessons and assignments given by Professor Costa Sena. He graduated in 1919 from this school with the title of Civil, Mining and Metallurgical Engineer. His first prize was a study trip to Europe. His traveling companion was engineer Israel Pinheiro, who about 40 years later was a governor of the state of Minas Gerais, after doing managerial work for the construction of Bras√≠lia, Brazil's specially planned national capital city, from 1956 to 1960. Guimar√£es' first professional assignment was not in the branch of geology, but rather in the construction of what is now Rui Barbosa Avenue through the old Vi√∫va hill in Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of Brazil. Guimar√£es published over 200 papers, books and memoirs, and gave numerous conferences. Three books have been published as tributes to him by his former students and collaborators. One of these is Contributions to Geology and Petrology (1985). This book probably lists all works produced by Guimar√£es, either as the sole author or in collaboration with other scholars, from 1924 to 1978. The book was financed by CBMM (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Minera√ß√£o), which owns the world's largest niobium ore (pyrochlore) mine, in the Barreiro area of Arax√°, Minas Gerais. This ore reserve was discovered by Guimar√£es and his team when he was the Head of Geology of the former Geological Survey of Minas Gerais (1931‚Äì1932). CBMM created the Djalma Guimar√£es Medal to be granted to the best geologist graduated at either the Ouro Preto Mining School or the UFMG Institute of Geosciences in Belo Horizonte.

The town was first settled by Europeans in the 1840s. Queensland‚Äôs first gold discovery was at Kilkivan in 1852 and subsequent findings escalated into a gold rush in the 1860s. The town was named for a pastoral run owned by pastoralist John Daniel MacTaggart (1823‚Äì1871) after his father's farm name near Drumlemble, Kintyre, Scotland. The nearby Australian 'Glenbarr' property owned by MacTaggart was also named for a nearby Scottish farm. Kilkivan Post Office opened on 8 June 1868. It was known as Neureum between 1876 and 1881.

William Roark (2006), Concise Encyclopedia of Real Estate Business Terms A foreclosing beneficiary will typically set the opening bid at a foreclosure auction for at least the outstanding loan amount. If there are no bidders that are interested, then the beneficiary will legally repossess the property. This is commonly the case when the amount owed on the home is higher than the current market value of the foreclosure property, such as with a mortgage loan made at a high loan-to- value during a real estate bubble. As soon as the beneficiary repossesses the property it is listed on their books as REO and categorized as an asset. (See non-performing asset). Origin The term originates from the term other real estate owned (OREO), which is used on financial statements to classify real estate property owned by a financial institution but which is not directly related to its business. These financial institutions are often the lender. Lenders are primarily in the business of making loans with the intent that nearly all of those loans will be repaid in full with interest. Seizing, managing and reselling real property collateral to recover unpaid loan balances is secondary to lenders' primary line of business. Property management companies, for whom real estate management is their primary business, use the term OREO. In balance sheet terms, OREO assets are considered non-earning assets for purposes of regulatory accounting. Saturday, 6 January 2018 In the context of national banks in the U.S., the term OREO is legally defined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in regulations promulgated pursuant to , specifically in and . Process As soon as a property goes into a distressed status (the borrower/home owner misses mortgage payments) the beneficiary will want to determine the amount of equity that the property has. A popular method to determine the equity is to obtain a Broker's Price Opinion (BPO) or order an appraisal. Based on the amount of equity that is determined from the BPO, the bank will decide whether to allow a short sale (if requested by the homeowner). If no short sale is requested by the home owner, the beneficiary will continue the foreclosure process. If the beneficiary is unable to sell the property through a short sale or at a foreclosure auction it will now become an REO property. After a repossession from which the property becomes classified as REO, the beneficiary will go through the process of trying to sell the property on its own or obtain the service of an REO Asset Manager. The beneficiary will remove the liens and other debts on the home and try to resell it to the public, either through future auctions, direct marketing through a real estate broker, or by itself. The asset manager may also try to contact REO realtors that specialize in certain ZIP codes to help sell this bank owned property. Real estate investors will often purchase these properties because of discounts offered to compensate for the condition of the property. Many larger banks and government institutions have REO/asset management departments that field bids and offers, oversee up keep, and handle sales. Some REO properties on the open market will be listed in MLS by the broker who performed the BPO.  Property preservation  Bank REO properties are generally in poor condition and need repairs and maintenance, both to satisfy property upkeep laws and to preserve and prepare the property for sale. Maintenance is generally the responsibility of the mortgage servicerProperty Preservation Servicer Contacts, Mortgage Bankers Association and is often in turn provided by a specialized property preservation company. These property preservation services include: securing a property (changing locks, boarding up), debris removal, property maintenance (winterizing, cutting grass, repairing or tarping roof leaks), and rehabilitation.\\"Property Maintenance & Management: Property Preservation Matrix\\", 2010, Fannie Mae\\"Cleaning house\\" by Kristen Hampshire, Inside Business, May 1, 2008 In addition to preventing damage to the property, securing a property is used to prevent or discourage re-entry by former occupants or by squatters, which can both damage the property and require legal proceedings to remove, further complicating a sale. Swimming pools must also be secured to prevent deaths or injuries from drowning and falls. Lenders may purchase \\"real estate owned\\" insurance to protect against loss and liability relating to lender-owned properties. REO insurance differs from \\"forced placed\\" insurance (also \\"lender placed\\" insurance), which a lender purchases for borrower-owned property when the borrower does not insure the property.Forced Placed insurance, Virginia State Corporation Commission Bulk real estate owned Bulk REO or bulk real estate owned, from a real estate investor‚Äôs point of view, is like investing on wholesale real estate properties. On the other hand, banks or lenders sell or open their assets in group for auction at a very low price compared to their market value.

It was published for the Mac OS X the following year by Feral Interactive. The game, set in a fantasy medieval world, focuses on the concepts of pagan tribalism, renaissance enlightenment, and imperialist theocracy.  Development  Warrior Kings started life at the back-end of Eidos plc's title: Plague, the first large-scale full 3D strategy title featured at E3/LA in 1997. Plague was originally designed by Dave Morris from a concept by Ian Livingstone, and the technology was designed and developed by Sam Kerbeck. When Eidos closed the internal game development division at its corporate HQ in 1999, the Plague team transferred to a new company, Black Cactus, which continued to develop the game, now titled Warrior Kings, initially with investment from Eidos. With the winding-up of Black Cactus in January 2005, rights in the game reverted to Dave Morris. Creative Director Jamie Thomson said historical events provided the inspiration for the game, which made the game world \\"much more fully realised and logically consistent\\". Critical reception In The Video Games Guide, critic Matt Fox described the game as \\"ambitious\\" with \\"true 3D environments\\", but criticized the overall gameplay and AI interaction. Gameplay There are three different paths to choose in this game: 'Pagan', 'Imperial' and 'Renaissance', each with its own unique values, style of war, and storyline. =Plot= The story revolves around Artos, the young son of Baron Amalric of Cravant, a small fiefdom within the Holy Empire, the dominant power in a world called Orbis. The Holy Empire is a theocratic state (seemingly an amalgamation of the Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States) devoted to a deity called 'The One God'. It is ruled by a spiritual and militant leader, the Patriarch and the Holy Protector respectively. The new Patriarch, Icthyus Granitas, is cruel and corrupt and the Holy Protector is nothing more than his henchman. As soon as he came to power he began accusing all those who spoke against his rule with false charges of heresy and treason to the state. These lords either changed their minds overnight about the Patriarch or disappeared entirely. Cravant is one such state. On the first level of the game, Cravant is invaded by the Empire, who kill Artos's father on a trumped up charge of treason and raze the city. Artos flees with a small band of loyal soldiers across the sea to Angland (a fictionalised England) where he plots his revenge against the Empire. From there, the player can decide how they do this. There are three 'alignments' that the player can choose from that are listed below. These are Pagan, Imperial and Renaissance. = The Pagan path = The Pagan path is one of superstition, witchcraft, and nature worship. Pagan war involves cheap mass-produced units in combination with indirect damage to one's opposition. The successful pagan player is one who tests enemy borders on a regular basis and then moves to overwhelm it while not counting the cost. Pagan signature units are its demons and witches, all of which have a series of secondary powers and spells to employ against their foes. Once they have become suitably advanced the Pagans may construct a Wickerman and summon a demon called Abaddon, a powerful AI controlled unit that can cause a lot of damage before being destroyed. = The Imperial path = Imperial warfare involves expensive, well-armoured troops and strong fortifications. The successful Imperial player waits and watches behind thick, protective walls until the enemy makes a critical error, then punishes them for it. Signature units for the Imperials are its Priests, Bishops and Inquisitors, who can pray at churches to activate 'Acts of God' to unleash upon their enemies. As with the Pagans, the Imperials can build an Archangel Statue later on in the game and summon an Archangel named the Sword of God, who acts in a similar fashion to Abaddon. = The Renaissance path = The path of the Renaissance is one of human ingenuity and humanity. The Renaissance means giving up some offensive and defensive capability, but with it comes outstanding economy and powerful siegecraft. The Renaissance player knows the enemy and adjusts accordingly. Renaissance players are made unique by their access to gunpowder units, such as gunners and cannons. Though they do not have a demon or angel to aid them, Renaissance players can construct a series of siege engines such as trebuchets, mangonels and even primitive rocket launchers that more than compensate for this loss. = Military power = Winning in 'Warrior Kings' is not about who has more troops but rather who has better tactics. From higher ground arrows travel farther, flat ground allows mounted troops to move faster. Troop formation is also a factor; troops will gain more attack power in a vanguard, move faster in a pillar, cover more ground in a line, and balance damage to them better in an orb.  Sequel  In 2003, the game was followed up by a sequel, Warrior Kings: Battles.

Biography He was born in on June 16, 1911 in Baltimore, Maryland. His family moved to Ireland from 1928 to 1931, and he attended Trinity College in Dublin. He returned to the United States to medical school at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Following graduation, he did residency training in psychiatry and neurology, then considered one specialty, at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York. During World War II, he went into the Navy and was stationed aboard hospital ships and then put in charge of a clinic for \\"battle fatigue\\" in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. After the Navy, Kolb worked at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland (where a collection of his papers are held) and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. In 1954 Kolb was appointed chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Kolb oversaw numerous clinical and research advances during his 21-year tenure, the longest of any director. In 1975 Kolb left his posts at Columbia to become the New York State Commissioner of Mental Hygiene and correct abuses in the state system of mental health. He died on October 20, 2006 in Orlando, Florida. Legacy Kolb was strongly committed to research in psychiatry. Early in his career he did a seminal study of phantom limb pain (see the reference below). Many years later he led a significant study on \\"battle fatigue\\" in Vietnam veterans, finding that post- traumatic stress disorder could cause physical signs and symptoms. The research facility at New York State Psychiatric Institute is called the Lawrence C. Kolb Research Building. His father, Lawrence Kolb (1881‚Äì1972), was also an eminent psychiatrist.

Harris was regarded as one of the finest soccer players of his generation and in 1906 became the first Shelbourne player capped by Ireland. He still remains the club's most capped player. In 1913 he captained the first Ireland team to beat England and in 1914 he was a member of the Ireland team that won the British Home Championship. Harris has been described as an extremely hard player in the mode of Kevin Moran or Paul McGrath and like his Shelbourne, Everton and Ireland teammate, Bill Lacey, he was also very versatile, covering just about every outfield position during his career. Playing career =Early years= Harris initially played soccer with junior clubs Pembroke and Emeralds and in 1898 helped Pembroke reach the final of the Leinster Junior Cup. He was also an accomplished Gaelic footballer during his teens and won honours at club level with Ringsend GAA team Isles of the Sea. In 1901 he won an All-Ireland medal with the Dublin county team. Harris is one of several prominent Dublin Gaelic footballers who successfully switched codes to soccer. Others have included Jack Kirwan, Con Martin, Joseph Ledwidge and Kevin Moran. =Shelbourne= In 1903 Harris made his debut for Shelbourne in the Leinster Senior League. In May 1904 he had a trial with West Bromwich Albion but then returned to Shelbourne and made his Irish League debut in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Glentoran on 17 September 1904 at Serpentine Avenue, Dublin. Harris went on to play in four consecutive Irish Cup finals and in the 1906 final was captain when Shelbourne beat Belfast Celtic 2‚Äì0 at Dalymount Park, becoming the first Dublin side to lift the trophy. His teammates during this era included, among others, Joseph Ledwidge and Bill Lacey. After four years at Everton, Harris returned to Shelbourne in August 1914. In 1920 Harris won the Irish Cup for a second time after both Belfast Celtic and Glentoran were expelled. In 1921 Shelbourne became founder members of the League of Ireland and in 1926 the club won the title. Harris remained a prominent member of the Shelbourne team well passed his fortieth birthday and his second spell at the club saw him play alongside Bill Lacey, Bob Fullam, Ed Brookes and Louis Bookman. During his two spells with Shelbourne, Harris made 71 Irish League appearances, scoring 13 goals, 89 League of Ireland appearances, scoring 6 goals, and a further 36 games and 12 goals in the Irish Cup. =Everton= In March 1908 Harris moved to Everton for ¬£350, the maximum amount allowed at the time. He made his debut for Everton against Woolwich Arsenal and quickly established himself as the team's regular right-half. During his time at Everton he was noted for his consistency and effectiveness and played in six different positions. With Harris in the team, Everton regularly challenged for top honours, twice finishing as League runners-up as well as reaching the semi- final stage in the 1910 FA Cup. His teammates at Everton included fellow Irish internationals Billy Scott and Bill Lacey, who had followed Harris from Shelbourne in February 1909. While at Everton, Harris made 190 league appearances and scored 1 goal. He also played a further 14 games and scored a further goal in the FA Cup. =Irish International= Val Harris (first player on left of back-row) with Ireland team v Wales during 1914 British Home Championship. Harris made his debut for Ireland as a centre-forward on 17 February 1906 in a 5‚Äì0 defeat to England at the Solitude Ground. His teammates that day included Robert Milne and Jack Kirwan. He was the first Shelbourne player to be capped by Ireland and subsequently won a further six caps while at the club. Despite suffering a number of severe injuries related to his robust style of play, Harris was remarkably consistent in his appearances for Ireland and he featured in a run of thirteen consecutive internationals between 1908 and 1912. On 15 February 1913, Harris captained the Ireland team, that also included Billy Scott and two-goal hero Billy Gillespie, as they beat England for the first time with a 2‚Äì1 win at Windsor Park. In 1914 Ireland went a stage further and won the British Home Championship. Harris and Gillespie were joined in the squad by among others, Patrick O'Connell, Louis Bookman and Bill Lacey. Coaching career After retiring as player in 1927 Harris became a coach with both the Irish Free State and Shelbourne. In 1932 Harris took charge of the Irish team as they played the Netherlands. Although the team was chosen by selectors, Harris took charge of training and gave the team talk. Before the game Harris declared Pat O'Callaghan put the tricolour flying high here in the 1928 Olympics and it's up to you lads to see it is still flying high this evening. The words proved inspiring as an Irish team that included Alex Stevenson, Mick O'Brien, Jimmy Kelly and Paddy Moore won 2‚Äì0. Harris would later coach and managed Shelbourne as they won the 1939 FAI Cup, their first success in that competition.

Forster. The story follows the lives of a mixed-race British/American family living in the United States, addresses ethnic and cultural differences in both the USA and the UK, as well as the nature of beauty, and the clash between liberal and conservative academic values. It takes its title from an essay by Elaine Scarry‚Äî\\"On Beauty and Being Just\\". The Observer described the novel as a \\"transatlantic comic saga\\".Stephanie Merritt, \\"Turn over a new leaf\\", The Observer, 2 January 2005. The novel was shortlisted for the 2005 Man Booker Prize on 8 September 2005. Smith won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for fiction and Orange Prize for Fiction in June 2006.\\"Zadie Smith Wins Orange Prize\\" . Article at The Book Standard Plot summary On Beauty centres on the story of two families and their different yet increasingly intertwined lives. The Belsey family consists of university professor Howard, a white Englishman; his African-American wife Kiki; and their children, Jerome, Zora and Levi. They live in the fictional university town of Wellington, outside Boston. Howard's professional nemesis is Monty Kipps, a Trinidadian living in Britain with his wife Carlene and children Victoria and Michael. The Belsey family has always defined itself as liberal and atheist, and Howard in particular is furious when his son Jerome, lately a born-again Christian, goes to work as an intern with the ultra-conservative Christian Kipps family over his summer holidays. After a failed affair with Victoria Kipps, Jerome returns home. However, the families are again brought closer nine months later when the Kippses move to Wellington, and Monty begins work at the university. Carlene and Kiki become friends despite the tensions between their families. The rivalry between Monty and Howard increases as Monty challenges the liberal attitudes of the university on issues such as affirmative action. His academic success also highlights Howard's inadequacies and failure to publish a long-awaited book. Meanwhile, the Belsey family is facing problems of its own as they deal with the fallout of Howard's affair with his colleague and family friend Claire. Zora and Levi become friends with Carl, an African-American man of a poorer background than their own middle- class standing. Zora uses him as a poster-child for her campaign to allow talented non-students to attend university classes. For Levi, Carl is a source of identity, as a member of a more \\"authentic\\" black culture than Levi considers his own background to be. Inspiration The book is loosely based on Howards End by E. M. Forster; Smith has called it an \\"homage\\". Among the parallels are the opening sections (Howards End begins with letters from Helen to her sister, On Beauty with emails from Jerome to his father); the bequeathing of a valuable item to a member of the other family (the Wilcox house Howards End is left by Ruth Wilcox to Margaret Schlegel; Carlene leaves Kiki a painting); and, more broadly, the idea of two families with very different ideas and values gradually becoming linked. The setting of much of the novel, the fictitious Wellington College and surrounding community, contains many close parallels to the real Harvard University and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Smith wrote part of the novel as a fellow at Harvard's Radcliffe Institute. Smith gives herself a very brief Hitchcock-style cameo in the novel: the narrator (or, indirectly, Howard) describes her as a \\"feckless novelist\\", a visiting fellow of the fictional Wellington faculty (as Smith was of Harvard's) who is quick to abandon a tedious meeting. The failed final lecture that concludes the novel is loosely based on an infamous job talk given by former Harvard professor Leland de la Durantaye for the Harvard English Department on Lolita.

Early life Komrskov√° was born on May 6, 1983, to father Jan Komrska, a gymnastics coach, and mother Zdena Komrskov√° (n√©e Dor≈à√°kov√°), a 1972 Olympian. She started gymnastics at the age of four and was coached by her parents in Zl√≠n. Her younger sister, Aneta, also competed in gymnastics, while her older sister, Lucie, was a leading Czech long jumper.  Gymnastics career  At the age of 10, Komrskov√° became a member of the Czech national junior team, and in 1995, she participated in the European Junior Championships for the first time. Two years later, she won three titles in the senior national championships in 1997, including the all-around title, with particularly strong performances on the uneven bars and vault. = 1999‚Äì2000 = At the 1999 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tianjin, Komrskov√° qualified to the all-around final in ninth place, but major faults on beam sent her back to 33rd in the all-around final. The Czech team finished in 16th place, qualifying two gymnasts to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. In the Olympic year, Komrskov√° recorded her first success in a World Cup competition (second place on vault in Cottbus, behind Russia's Yelena Produnova) and finished ninth in the all-around at the 2000 European Championships. She and Kate≈ôina Mare≈°ov√° competed for the Czech Republic at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Komrskov√° qualified for the individual all-around final in 29th place despite an infection contracted through blisters on her forearm. Immediately after the final, she underwent minor surgery.Komrskov√°'s 2004 Olympic profile on the Czech Gymnastics Federation web After the Games, Komrskov√° placed fourth on uneven bars and vault at the World Cup final in Glasgow. = 2001‚Äì2004 = Following several podium finishes in World Cup events, Komrskov√° was one of the favorites for the vault title at the 2001 World Championships in Ghent. She advanced to the final and finished fourth behind Svetlana Khorkina, Oksana Chusovitina, and Andreea RƒÉducan, losing the bronze medal to RƒÉducan by 0.037 points. Komrskov√° was the stand-by for the uneven bars final at the 2002 European Championships and the vault final at the 2003 World Championships, missing the former by 0.012. Her 11th-place finish in the all-around at the 2002 European Championships was her top result in those two years. At the 2003 Worlds in Anaheim, California, she clinched the only Czech berth for the 2004 Summer Olympics, but injured her elbow in the process. At the end of the year, she also broke bones in her foot. She missed the 2004 national and European championships but recovered in time for the Olympics in Athens. At the Olympics, Komrskov√° finished 32nd in the all-around qualification and was the second alternate for the final. She said afterward: \\"When I was in the Olympic Games before, I was younger and I was a bit overwhelmed. Now, it's a normal competition for me. I still think the Olympics is the most important competition for an athlete, but now I am a lot more relaxed about it.\\"Interview with Komrskov√° from official 2004 Olympic press service, archived on the FIG site =2005‚Äì2008= After the 2004 Olympics, Komrskov√° decided to end her gymnastics career and try pole vaulting, following the example of Daniela B√°rtov√°, a former Czech gymnast who went on to set pole vaulting records. However, Komrskov√° was hindered by her elbow injury. She then tried to join her sister Lucie in long jumping, but ultimately decided to return to gymnastics. Her parents had retired from coaching, so Komrskov√° began training with the Czech national team coach, Stanislav Vyzina, in Brno. She returned to national competitions in late 2005 and went on to win her first World Cup title: a gold medal on vault at the B-category World Cup in Maribor, Slovenia. In 2006, she performed well at several World Cup events, winning gold on vault and bronze on balance beam in Maribor, and silver on vault in Moscow and Lyon. At the 2006 European Championships in Volos, Greece, Komrskov√° finished fourth in the vault final, only 0.075 off the podium. She also recorded the 11th best all-around total in qualifications, though no individual all-around final was held. At the Czech national championships, she won four of five possible titles. Komrskov√° was the highest-scoring Czech gymnast at the 2006 World Championships and narrowly missed the all-around final: She finished 32nd in qualifications, making her the second alternate. She went on to win the vault titles at the 2006 World Cup final in Brazil and the 2007 European Championships in Amsterdam. At the 2007 World Championships in Stuttgart, she finished seventh on vault, with high execution marks but relatively low difficulty. The Czech Republic earned one gymnastics berth for the 2008 Summer Olympics. As the only Czech gymnast to qualify to a final at the 2007 World Championships, Komrskov√° was a front-runner for the spot. However, she retired instead, saying that because she had been to the Olympics twice, it was time for another Czech gymnast to have the opportunity. Trivia * Komrskov√° is 1.67 m (5.5 ft) tall, which made her one of the tallest elite gymnasts. * In 2001, Czech sport journalists voted Komrskov√° to 18th place in the Czech Athlete of the Year poll. She beat Pavel Nedvƒõd and others. She also won the Progym.cz Agency's Czech Gymnast of the Year poll several times.

Originally composed as an instrumental under the name \\"Lachrimae pavane\\" in 1596, it is Dowland's most famous ayre, and became his signature song, literally as well as metaphorically: he would occasionally sign his name \\"Jo: dolandi de Lachrimae\\". Details Like others of Dowland's lute songs, the piece's musical form and style are based on a dance, in this case the pavan. It was first published in The Second Booke of Songs or Ayres of 2, 4 and 5 parts (London, 1600). The song begins with a falling tear motif, starting on an A and descending to an E by step on the text \\"Flow, my tears\\". This may have been borrowed from an Orlande de Lassus motet or Luca Marenzio madrigal (this type of motif was common in Elizabethan music to signify grief), in addition to other borrowings in the piece. Anthony Boden calls the song \\"probably the most widely known English song of the early 17th century.\\" Variants There have been many instrumental versions of this song, most entitled \\"Lachrimae\\" (or \\"Lachrymae\\", literally \\"tears\\"). In this case the instrumental version was written first, as \\"Lachrimae pavane\\" in 1596, and lyrics were later added. It is believed that the text was written specifically for the music, and may have been written by Dowland himself. The English musicologist Peter Holman claims that the first pavan of \\"Lachrimae\\" (called \\"Lachrimae Antiquae\\", or the \\"Old Tears\\") is \\"perhaps the single most popular and widely distributed instrumental piece of the period\\". According to Holman, it exists in around a 100 manuscripts and printings across Europe including England, Scotland, The Netherlands, France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Italy, in different arrangements for ensemble and solo. The \\"Lachrimae\\" tend to be much more abstract than later music (such as Bach and Chopin) and there is no \\"definitive\\" version of the piece. Dowland and his contemporaries supposedly played their own versions in a semi-improvised fashion, like jazz musicians today.. Holman argues that the popularity of \\"Lachrimae\\" came from its rich melodic and motivic nature. Other English composers in the period generally gave only one or two ideas per strain and padded them out with dull, diffusive contrapuntal writing. In contrast, Dowland's \\"Lachrimae\\" provide a variety of strikingly melodic ideas and furthermore they are tightly and tactfully interconnected. Instrumental versions by Dowland include \\"Lachrimae\\" for lute, \\"Galliard to Lachrimae\\" for lute and \\"Lachrimae antiquae\\" (1604) for consort. Dowland also published Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares (London, 1604), a collection of consort music which included a cycle of seven \\"Lachrimae\\" pavans based on the falling tear motif. Thomas Morley set the \\"Lachrimae Pauin\\" for the six instruments of a broken consort in his First Booke of Consort Lessons (London, 1599). Other composers have written pieces based on the work, including Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Thomas Tomkins, and Tobias Hume's What Greater Griefe, while John Danyel's Eyes, look no more pays clear homage to the piece, as does John Bennet's \\"Weep, o mine eyes\\". In the 20th century, American composer and conductor Victoria Bond wrote Old New Borrowed Blues (Variations on Flow my Tears). Benjamin Britten quotes the incipit of \\"Flow, my tears\\" in his Lachrymae for viola, a set of variations on Dowland's ayre \\"If my complaints could passions move\\". In 2006, the British electronic music group Banco de Gaia produced a vocoded version called \\"Flow my Dreams, the Android Wept\\".Banco de Gaia ‚Äì Farewell Ferengistan CD ‚Äì review on swapacd.com Lyrics  In other media  Lines 8‚Äì10 are quoted in the 1974 Philip K. Dick novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, the title of which is also an allusion to the song. Footnotes Sources  * Dowland, John.
