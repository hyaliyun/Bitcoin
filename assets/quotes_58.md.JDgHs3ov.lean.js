Biography Baxter Taylor grew up in Dallas, Texas and spent summers on the family farm in Fargo, Oklahoma. His grandfather was the inspiration for the family. All of his children sent their children back to the farm as teenagers to get a proper education – some hard work and independence. As a freshman in college, Baxter met a tall banjo player named Bill Cheatwood who introduced him to folk music and Mason Williams. It wasn’t long before they were The Wayfarers, a trio of young \\"sometimes\\" college attendees. Says Taylor, > \\"A friend and fellow folk singer named Steve Brainard opened a coffeehouse > in Oklahoma City, OK named THE GOURD. We all sang there most every night as > the house band and made most of our classes during the day. The house band > (affectionately referred to as The Gourd Singers) also included regular > players/folk singers Johnny Horton and bassist Joe Lawrence. THE GOURD later > became THE BUDDHI (at a different location)- Oklahoma City’s most famous > folk music club.\\" As The Wayfarers Trio, they made a couple of records for Mercury Records and did some touring. After a couple of years the trio split up so that each member could try his hands at being a solo artist. Discography: April 1961, SONGS OF THE BLUE AND THE GREY, Mercury Records. Said Taylor in an interview, \\"It was a great time to be a folk singer. Coffee houses existed as performance venues: people came to hear the music and there was no liquor to bend the audience into an inattentive crowd – and the coffee kept most of the listeners awake. I worked out of Chicago and became friends with Shel Silverstein, an incredibly talented man who could write a clever lyric about anything. We wrote several songs together, including MARIE LAVAUX and THE MONKEY AND THE ELEPHANT.\\" \\"Baxter Taylor has something going for him....a folk singer who somewhere along the line learned to sing...immensely worth listening to.\\" Dan Safran, Dallas Times Herald, 1962 \\"At the time, I still had a contract to record for Mercury Records when Uncle Sam decided that my services might be required to protect my country from some folks over in Asia that I had never heard of. Fortunately, I did not have to make the trip past Kentucky. But, by the time I got out I was ready to settle into a different life.\\" \\"Some of my songs had been recorded, so I took an advance on my song royalties and went back to college, graduated, and got married. When my twin daughters were born, I put the guitar into the closet and went to work for Sears.\\" \\"For about ten years, I hardly touched the guitar. Then one evening a friend from work was over to the house, and after a couple of drinks I decided to sing him some of the songs that I had written. He listened politely until I did a song Shel Silverstein and I had written about the New Orleans witch Marie Lavaux called, 'POOF, ANOTHER MAN DONE GONE.' \\" \\"My friend said, “Up to now I was buying this whole singer/songwriter bit. Now, you try to pass off a hit song as yours. I’m not buying that!” “What are you talking about?” I said. “I’m probably one of only three or four people who know that song.” “Yeah, right,\\" my friend replied. \\"That song is number one on the country charts right now. Bobby Bare sings it.” And he went over and turned on the radio. And they were playing the song. Folks, I’m not making it up - it happened just like that!\\" \\"In 1975, over twelve years after it was written, Shel and I received a BMI award for the song titled MARIE LAVAUX.*** I started writing songs like mad.***\\" \\"I went to Nashville to see if I could interest anyone in my new songs. I talked to a lot of old friends and new acquaintances with common theme being “If I can only get one more good song, I can get a house, raise a family and settle down.” Then I realized “What am I doing here? I’ve already got all those things.” So, I took my guitar and drove back home to Plano, Texas, my home and my family.\\" \\"I did keep singing and writing, though. And from time to time I attend a jam session held every Sunday at The Eagles Lodge. This marvelous group of Dallas musicians has been meeting for over twenty years at various establishments around Dallas. The group changes some, but the music stays fresh and wonderful. I haven’t been on a stage as a professional in a long time, but when it’s my turn to sing, I love it! If a person loves to be in front of an audience, they will always love being in front of an audience.\\" \\"I retired as a school teacher in 2006. I plan to use my experience and talent to make music for myself and other folks as a producer. Instead of me being the center of attention, I would like to help other folks get a bit of the spotlight.\\" \\"I love good music, and there is a lot of it out there. What I would like to do is record some of those singers and their original songs to help them find an audience. Someone once said, “The song is in the singing.” And it’s even more fun if there are listeners.\\"MySpace Notes Category:Living people Category:1940 births Category:Musicians from Oklahoma City Category:American folk singers Category:The Wayfarers Trio members Category:The New Christy Minstrels members ","title":"Baxter Taylor"},{"id":"13708308","text":"Warren Township is one of thirteen townships in Putnam County, Indiana.

He married Martha Pearl Gross, Barnard College, class of 1949. They have three children, each an academic professor: Jonathan, geology, at Portland State University; Rachel at Mount Holyoke College, and Linda at Sweet Briar College. He has one brother who is a physician graduate of Columbia University. His early education was in New York City, receiving the B.A. at University College, New York University (1942) and M.D. at NYU Bellevue Medical Center (1945). His medical training was under the United States Army auspices and he was appointed 1st Lieutenant Army Medical Corps on graduation, serving in active military service from April 1946 to November 1947. He attended the Army School of Military Neuropsychiatry in San Antonio in 1946.http://medicine.stonybrookmedicine.edu/psychiatry/faculty/fink_m. Residency training in neurology and psychiatry from 1948 to 1954 was at New York's Montefiore, Bellevue, and Hillside Hospitals. He received training in electroencephalography at Mount Sinai Hospital under a fellowship of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. Concurrently he attended the William Alanson White Institute of Psychoanalysis, receiving the Certificate for Physicians in 1953. He was board certified in neurology in 1952 and psychiatry in 1954. Academic positions, research and awards Fink was appointed research professor of psychiatry at Washington University in 1962, at New York Medical College in 1966 and professor of psychiatry and neurology at SUNY at Stony Brook in 1972. Early research included federal government- funded research into the changes in brain waves (electroencephalogram) induced by electroshock, antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs, opiates and narcotic antagonists, and cannabis and metabolites. For the past fifty years Fink's main interest has been in electroconvulsive therapy. Over the years his ideas on ECT have evolved from an early suggestion that the biochemical basis of ECT is similar to that of craniocerebral traumaM Fink 1958 Effect of anticholinergic agent, diethazine on EEG and behaviour: significance for theory of convulsive therapy.

Psychiatric Times 23, October. A specific interest compared ECT to seizures induced by flurothyl. A good part of his academic research was in the effects of psychoactive drugs on the electroencephalogram (see Pharmaco- electroencephalography). His most recent interest is in the syndromes of catatonia and of melancholia.M Fink 2013 Rediscovering catatonia: the biography of a treatable syndrome. Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica 127, Issue supplement s441, 1-47. In 1985 Fink founded the journal Convulsive Therapy (now called the Journal of ECT). He was a member of the American Psychiatric Association's task forces on ECT 1975-1978 and 1987-1990. Fink's awards include the Electroshock Research Association Award (1956), the Laszlo Meduna Prize of the Hungarian National Institute for Nervous and Mental Disease (1986), and Lifetime Achievement Awards of the Psychiatric Times (1995) and of the Society of Biological Psychiatry (1996). Retirement In 1997 Fink moved to the Long Island Jewish Hillside Hospital to organize a government supported 4-hospital collaborative program examining continuation treatments in patients with major depression after successful ECT.

The show's title is clearly derived from the 60s spy-fi show The Man From U.N.C.L.E., and parodied different pop culture shows of the day, including The Monkees, Six Million Dollar Man, Shazam!, Scooby-Doo Where Are You! and their numerous imitators up to that point. All 13 episodes of the series were produced and directed by Stanley Z. Cherry; among the executive producers was Don Kirshner. Both Cherry and Kirshner had previously worked on The Monkees, Cherry having written the episode \\"Some Like It Lukewarm\\" in 1968, while Kirshner was the original musical supervisor for The Monkees until early 1967. Although the show has not been released on video, there is an LP of most of the songs from the series, omitting \\"Baby Blue\\", \\"You're Under My Spell\\" and, ironically, the show's theme. The LP was released by Kirshner Records and Tapes in 1977. One of the songs from the series, \\"When It Hit Me (The Hurricane Song)\\" was released as a single; the song was also recorded by Rob Hegel (who co-wrote the song) for his 1980 RCA album. Two other album tracks, \\"Tit for Tat\\" and \\"Baby Blue\\", had both been co-written and previously released by Neil Sedaka on his 1975 album Hungry Years. Overview The \\"Kids from C.A.P.E.R.\\" (the Civilian Authority for the Protection of Everybody Regardless) were a team of four teenage boys headquartered in the 927th Police Precinct in the fictitious city of \\"Northeast Southweston\\"; together they helped the police to solve unusual cases. The CAPERs communicated using \\"Caperband\\" Radios (walkie-talkies with a prominent \\"C\\" on them - they were actually modified Star Trek Communicators made by the Mego Corporation in 1974), and prospective clients contacted them via the Turquoise Telephone. Their headquarters was located in the Krelvin Building (\\"the tallest building in the world with no elevators\\"). The boys all wore brown belts with buckles emblazoned with a big letter \\"C\\" (Doc's buckle was presumably hidden underneath his vest). The group often traveled around Northeast Southweston in the \\"Big Bologna\\", a one-time hot dog vendor wagon converted into a mobile crime lab, though the giant hot dog display remains on the roof. Every episode began with a silent comedy vignette, with a cast member in voiceover giving the \\"Secret Word\\", which was usually key to that episode's plot. At the end of each episode, another silent vignette would appear in which a \\"Caper Code\\" would be given in voice over; a series of letters and numbers such as \\"P3 E8 R19 C2\\" (TIME). This was presumably code for the next week's secret word. Each episode would open with P.T. narrating what was about to happen. The team would then be visited by a girl who needed their help with a problem; in most episodes the girl would become attracted to a different member of the CAPERs. Each episode also featured a song which was performed by one of the CAPERs in a short and a long form at different points in the episode, though emphasis was never placed on the music itself. To wit, unlike the Monkees, the CAPERs did not consider themselves musicians and were never seen playing musical instruments. A recurring gag during the series was the group's explanation of what the acronym C.A.P.E.R. stood for; when asked, the boys would all quickly stand at attention and reply in unison, \\"The Civilian Authority for the Protection of Everybody, Regardless!\\" followed by a four-part harmonization of \\"Ta-da\\", reminiscent of The Three Stooges' harmonized \\"Hello\\". =Characters= *P.T. (played by Steve Bonino): \\"Cool and clever\\" (according to the theme's lyrics), P.T. was the founder and leader of the team and its youngest member. He often broke the fourth wall to narrate, and had a variety of skills and talents including a superhuman sense of smell (he called his nose \\"Seymour\\"). *Bugs (Cosie Costa): The \\"tough and feisty\\" one, he had superhuman strength and speed which he could summon only by looking at his hands, which if tied behind his back easily rendered him helpless. Whenever someone said the word \\"bananas\\", Bugs briefly and inexplicably devolved into an insane rage. *Doomsday (Biff Warren): Despite being \\"all full of sunshine\\" to everyone around him, Doomsday believed he was bad luck to others, hence his nickname and dismal wardrobe (black hooded sweatshirt and pants). Though his childlikeness made him an easy target for trickery, he also had heart, determination, and a gift of communicating with animals. He was always eating or at least thinking about food. *Doc (John Lansing): The oldest, tallest and most serious of the CAPERs, Doc occasionally showed a sense of humor that caught the others off guard. Though reserved and seemingly unaware of his charm and good looks, many girls found Doc irresistible. Supporting Characters *Sergeant Vinton (Robert Emhardt), a veteran policeman at the 927th, Vinton helped P.T. to create the CAPERs and is the team's mentor and adviser. Though he supported the CAPERs' efforts, he never balked at telling them when he thought they were in over their heads. *Kurt Klinsinger (Robert Lussier), a TV reporter who persistently pursued the boys in hopes of getting an exclusive. Klinsinger fancied himself an intrepid journalist, but he became a panicky coward at the slightest sign of trouble. *Mr. Featherstone, a shark puppet who lived a fishtank in their headquarters and also had a tank inside the Big Bologna. He possessed a navigational sense when riding in the Big Bologna, but also spoke in unintelligible gibberish which only the CAPERs could understand.  Production Information  At the start of the 1976-77 television season, The Kids from C.A.P.E.R. was part of a three-hour block of six live action shows that aired Saturday Morning on NBC, alongside Land of the Lost, which was entering its third season, and four other new shows: Monster Squad; McDuff, the Talking Dog; Big John, Little John; and Muggsy. NBC shook up this lineup in late November, cancelling McDuff and putting The Kids from C.A.P.E.R. on hiatus. The Kids from C.A.P.E.R. returned on April 9, 1977, and replaced the cancelled Muggsy in the lineup. Neither C.A.P.E.R. nor any of the other three remaining shows returned to the NBC lineup for the beginning of the 1977-78 television season. The pilot episode was refactored into a flashback episode in the full series: \\"Mummy's the Word\\", presumably to account for the changes in costume and set decoration. These changes are alluded to by lines of dialogue in the newer wrapper material episode, such as \\"Don't you remember the good old days, when the Big Bologna was blue?\\" and \\"Boy, you guys sure dressed funny in those days.\\" The latter is said by Doomsday, the only character to retain his costume from the pilot.

Early life and education Davis was born in Middlebury, Vermont, and moved to New York in 1817 with his parents who eventually settled in Clinton. He attended Clinton Academy and graduated from Hamilton College in 1831. Davis then moved to Syracuse, studied law, and was admitted to the bar. He began the practice of law in Syracuse. Political career He held many political positions in New York and was elected as a Unionist candidate to the 38th Congress. Davis was re-elected as a Republican to the 39th Congress, serving from March 4, 1863 to March 3, 1867. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1866 and after leaving Congress he resumed the practice of law in Syracuse. Davis died in Washington, D.C. on May 2, 1872. His remains were cremated and the ashes deposited in Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse. Family life Davis had an interest in railroading and coal mining. His grandfather Thomas Tredwell represented New York in the United States House of Representatives from 1791-1795.

Upper St. Regis Lake is a part of the St. Regis River in the Adirondacks in northern New York State. Along with Lower St. Regis Lake and Spitfire Lake, it became famous in the late 19th century as a summer playground of America's power elite, drawn to the area by its scenic beauty and by the rustic charms of Paul Smith's Hotel. It is the site of many grand old summer \\"cottages\\" and Great Camps, including Marjorie Merriweather Post's Topridge. Frederick W. Vanderbilt, Anson Phelps Stokes and Whitelaw Reid were among the summer residents. \\"The camps of many of these families began as tent colonies, with separate units for sleeping, dining, games, and so on, and evolved into permanent structures built with understated taste.\\"Jerome, p. 109 Apollos \\"Paul\\" Smith started his hotel in 1859 as a primitive operation that appealed to sportsmen. Gradually, the hotel became something of a fad amongst the wealthy and powerful of New York. As camping became more of a family activity, Smith would allow families to set up camp for day use along the shores of the St. Regis Lakes, returning to the hotel for the night. Eventually, families would lease or buy land from Smith and build tent platforms, and finally clusters of cabins and cottages. Even in the early stages, some of these camps became quite elaborate. In 1883, one of the first families, the Stokes, would arrive in a \\"special parlour horse car direct from 42nd street to Ausable for $100.\\" The party consisted of ten family members and an equal number of servants, \\"three horses, two dogs, one carriage, five large boxes of tents, three cases of wine, two packages of stovepipe, two stoves, one bale of china, one iron pot, four washstands, one barrel of hardware, four bundles of poles, seventeen cots and seventeen mattresses, four canvas packages, one buckboard, [...], twenty-five trunks, thirteen small boxes, one boat, one hamper\\", all of which was then transferred to wagons for the ride to Paul Smiths, and thence by boat to their island campsite.Hooker, p. 2-3 Upper Saint Regis Lake is part of the original Seven Carries canoe route from Paul Smith's Hotel to Saranac Inn.

He was a Marian exile, who left England to escape persecution during the counter-reformation in the reign of Queen Mary I of England. He was the author of a work on limits to obedience to rulers, and a contributor to the Geneva Bible. He was a friend of John Knox, and on Mary's death went to Scotland, later returning to England where he failed to conform. Early life He was probably born (1520) in Chester. When about eighteen he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating as B.A. 4 Feb. 1541, and M.A. 13 June 1544.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Gilpin-Greenhaugh In 1547 he became a senior student at Christ Church, Oxford, and was proctor in 1549. He proceeded B.D. in 1551, and is said to have become Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity about 1548. At Oxford Goodman made friends with Bartlet Green. Marian exile Goodman left England in 1554, and on 23 November his name appears among the signatures to a letter from the exiles at Strasburg. He afterwards joined the schism among the reformers at Frankfurt, and withdrew with William Whittingham and other exiles to Geneva; they jointly wrote a letter to the Frankfort congregation to defend their departure. The congregation at Geneva chose John Knox and Goodman in September 1555 for their pastors, and the two formed a lifelong friendship. During his exile Goodman took part in Miles Coverdale's translation of the Bible, and helped Knox in the \\"book of common order\\". Both he and Knox wrote some acrimonious tracts. The most famous by Goodman was entitled How superior Powers ought to be obeyed of their subjects, and wherein they may lawfully be by God's word disobeyed and resisted . . . Geneva, 1558. The book, in favor of Wyatt's rebellion, bitterly attacked Mary I of England and the government of women in general, which afterwards drew down Elizabeth's displeasure upon the author. Knox's First Blast of the Trumpet was published in the same year, and the tracts were secretly circulated in England. Their violence was generally disapproved, even by their own party. Goodman also published while abroad a Commentary upon Amos, in which he likens Mary to Proserpine, queen of Hades. On Elizabeth's accession, he returned briefly and somewhat furtively to London. In Scotland In June 1559 Knox asked Goodman to join him at Edinburgh, and Goodman went to Scotland early in September, acting as escort to Knox's wife and family from Geneva. In October he was made one of the council appointed by the lords of the congregation to treat of religion, he and Knox preaching daily. In November he became minister of Ayr. In the following July Goodman was appointed to St. Andrews. He also went about Scotland preaching, and in August 1560 spent ten days in the Isle of Man, where he preached twice. Two years later he and Knox together visited some of the reformed churches in Scotland. Return to England Intercessions were meanwhile made for his return to England, though John Calvin exhorted him to finish his work in Scotland. Goodman's irascibility impeded his progress. Cecil told Sadler in 1559 that, next to Knox, Goodman's name was the most odious of his party to Elizabeth, and fellow reformer John Jewel wrote that Goodman was \\"a man of irritable temper, and too pertinaceous in anything he has once undertaken\\". However, John Erskine, 6th Lord Erskine favoured his views, and in 1562 asked leave to bring him in his train to a projected meeting between Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots. Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick from Le Havre also begged (in December) Dudley and Cecil to give Goodman employment with his army in Normandy. At last by Randolph's advice he ventured into England in the winter of 1565. He went to Ireland (January 1566) as chaplain to Sir Henry Sidney, the new lord deputy, who in the spring of 1567 recommended him to be bishop of Dublin, and promised him the deanery of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Goodman, however, received neither of these offices. It was probably when Sidney returned to England in 1570 that he was appointed to the living of Alford, near Chester, and made archdeacon of Richmond. In the next year he was deprived by Bishop Vaughan for nonconformity, and in April 1571 brought before the ecclesiastical commissioners at Lambeth; the commission also moved at this time against Edward Dering, John Field, Thomas Lever, Thomas Sampson and Percival Wiburn. He was obliged to make a full recantation of his published opinions, and a protest in writing of his dutiful obedience to the queen's person and her lawful government. In June he was again examined before Archbishop Matthew Parker, and forbidden to preach. He complained (26 July) to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester of his hard treatment. In August he returned to Chester. In 1584 Goodman refused to subscribe to the articles and the service book, and Archbishop John Whitgift complained of his perversity to the lord treasurer. Having no living he was not however again examined, but allowed to spend the rest of his days peacefully at Chester. When James Ussher came to England to collect books for the Dublin Library, he visited Goodman (4 June 1603), then lying on his deathbed. Goodman was buried at Chester, in St. Bride's Church.

It is related to the bush mallows of California (Malacothamnus) and to Phymosia of Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. These perennial herbs are known commonly as wild hollyhocks and sometimes as globe mallows, Kankakee mallow, Kankakee globe mallow, and Streambank wild hollyhock. More often, the latter terms refer to members of the genus Sphaeralcea, which belong, like Iliamna, to the \\"typical\\" mallow tribe (Malveae) of the mallow and hibiscus subfamily Malvoideae. The name of the genus, proposed by Edward Lee Greene, appears to be a reference to Iliamna Lake in Alaska, even though the genus Iliamna does not occur in Alaska The plants are herbaceous with a racemose inflorescence consisting of showy, slightly fragrant flowers ranging in color from almost white to lavender. The leaves are alternate and shallowly palmately lobed and stems and leaves are coarsely pubescent. The sepals of I. remota plants are broadly lanceolate and longer than wide compared to the broadly triangular ovate sepals that were equally broad and long on I. rivularis plants. Iliamna remota was first reported by the Reverend E. J. Hill on June 29, 1872 on Langham Island in the Kankakee River. Reverend Hill noted that the plants grew in habitats he called \\"gravelly island\\" and \\"dry banks\\". Iliamna remota was designated as endangered by the Illinois Endangered Species Protection Board in 1980. Historical surveys and management recovery plans for I. remota and its vegetation on Langham Island have been reviewed. The island has remained undisturbed since 1945 after farming ceased on that island. In 1966, the island then was dedicated as an Illinois Nature Preserve with the primary purpose to preserve the native Iliamna remota population.

First prototypes were two-wheel drive, battery-powered electric vehicles with two front-wheel hub-mounted motors. A later version was a series hybrid using hub-mounted electric motors in each wheel, powered by batteries and a gasoline-engine generator. See year 1898.  Development  At the age of 23, Ferdinand Porsche boarded a train in North Bohemia, Austria- Hungary (now Czech Republic), and headed for Vienna to embark on his first job. Despite Porsche having no formal engineering education, Jacob Lohner, at his Lohner-Werke, employed him to develop an electric powertrain for his coaches. Porsche's prototype car boasted a low-friction drivetrain, due to the hub-mounted electric motors directly driving the wheels. Each internal-pole electric motor was capable of , peaking to for short bursts. The 1898 \\"System Lohner-Porsche\\" created a press whirlwind across Europe. Lohner received his first order from E.W. Hart, himself a coachbuilder of Luton, Britain. Hart asked for significant modifications. His vehicle was to be capable of running on petrol, as well as electricity, of carrying four passengers, and of employing four-wheel drive. The custom coach was a monster dubbed La Toujours Contente ('always satisfied' in French), a jab at record-holder Camille Jenatzy's electric La Jamais Contente, and was exhibited at the December 1900 Paris Exhibition. The enormous Lohner required 1.8 tonnes of batteries consisting of a 44-cell 80-volt lead-acid battery, all housed in a spring- suspended battery container to protect the fragile cells. The four electric motors weighed a total of 1280 pounds, contributing to a total vehicle weight of over 4 tonnes on its Continental pneumatic tires. With a battery capacity around 270 amp-hours and four forward speeds, the 56-horsepower coach ran in several expositions and competitions. It cost 15,000 Austrian crowns. Despite such ambitious engineering, the car was completed on time and was delivered personally by Porsche. Hart was so impressed, he purchased another, two-wheel drive example at a relative bargain of 7950 Austrian crowns. On November 6–9, 1900, the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland sponsored an electric vehicle endurance trial, in which the four-wheel drive Lohner-Porsche was one of 11 entrants—one of three entrants Hart brought to the Chislehurst starting line. The first-place winner of the trial was a Louis-Krieger car dubbed the 'Powerful'. Thanks largely to its lighter weight and larger-diameter wheels, it achieved a first run of 59 miles at an average of about 10 miles per hour. Le Toujours Contente suffered tire failures on its 34 miles with Porsche at the wheel. One competitor stated, \\"there were inches of mud on the floors; rain came through the roof; the sheds were doorless and the cars and attendants were nightly exposed to the full force of wind and rain.\\" Other electric vehicle entrants managed only 7 miles distance through the muddy, rutted course. Ferdinand Porsche caught a severe cold, contributing to the vehicle's elimination from further competition. Too costly for popular consumption, Lohner utilised the revolutionary drivetrain technology for larger commercial vehicles. Lohner-Werke manufactured rear-drive double-decker buses for Berlin and front-drive fire engines for the cities of Vienna, Frankfurt, and London. Lohner was commissioned to build vehicles for the Austrian emperor, as well as the kings of Norway, Romania, and Sweden. According to a biography by Andreas Stieniczka, the funeral coach for Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose murder in Sarajevo was the event which sparked off World War I, was manufactured by Lohner-Werke. Over 300 Lohner-Porsche vehicles were sold through 1906. In addition to custom coachworks, Lohner supported Porsche's continued racing efforts. Several Austrian land speed records were set, with a top speed eventually achieving with Porsche at the wheel. It was victorious in a number of motorsport events including the Exelberg-Rally in 1901. With both drivetrain engineering excellence in Lohner's custom coaches and motorsport experience, Porsche won the 1905 Potting Prize as Austria's most outstanding automotive engineer. In 1906, Porsche was snapped up by Daimler-Benz as chief designer. Jacob Lohner said at the time: \\"He is very young, but is a man with a big career before him. You will hear of him again.\\" The Lohner-Porsche's design was studied by Boeing and NASA to create the Apollo program's Lunar Roving Vehicle. Many of its design principles were mirrored in the Rover's design. The series hybrid concept underpins many modern railway locomotives, and interest in series hybrid automobiles is growing rapidly.

It was founded in 1892 by Charlotte Thorn and Mabel Dillingham, from New England, in partnership with Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute, to provide education to rural black students. African Americans comprised the majority in this area, and the state had segregated facilities. Calhoun Colored School was first designed to educate rural black students according to the industrial school model common at the time. In addition, the school sponsored a land bank that helped 85 families buy land. It created a joint venture with the county to improve a local road so farmers could get their products to market. As the school developed, it raised its standards, created a large library, and offered more of an academic curriculum. Historic site The principal's house, the only surviving original building, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of the school's importance in the history of education of African Americans. =Present day= Calhoun High School In 1943, the state of Alabama acquired the Calhoun Colored School. A new facility was built on the grounds that serves as the public high school run by the Lowndes County Board of Education. The county is majority-African American in ethnicity. The principal's house on County Route 53 is the last remaining structure from the original school. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of the important achievements of the school and the role it played in African- American education in Lowndes County. School history In 1891, the United States was still adjusting to the aftermath of the American Civil War, Reconstruction, and the Financial Panic of 1873. Many African Americans living in the rural South worked under the sharecropping system. The dependence of southern agriculture on cotton as a commodity crop, whose price continued to drop, contributed to difficulties in the South making economic progress. African Americans, then called \\"colored\\" or \\"negro\\", living in Calhoun (Lowndes County), Alabama were subject to white political and social domination although they comprised the majority of the county's population. Conservative white Democrats had regained power in the state legislature and begun to pass statutes that stripped African Americans from voter rolls or made elections so complicated they were effectively disenfranchised. In 1901 the state passed a new constitution with provisions that created barriers to voter registration. These suppressed voting by most blacks, as well as tens of thousands of poor whites.Glenn Feldman, The Disenfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp. 135–136 Lowndes County, in the Black Belt, had been an area of large cotton plantations before the Civil War. Devoted to agriculture, in 1890 the county had the highest proportion of Negroes to whites of any in Alabama. Most blacks worked as sharecroppers cultivating cotton. Booker T. Washington, then president of Tuskegee Institute, spoke at Hampton Institute (his alma mater) to recruit teachers to help with education of blacks in Alabama. He told of the people of Calhoun and their great desire to educate their children. Two Hampton teachers, Charlotte Thorn and Mabel Dillingham, white women from New England, responded to his plea for help. They traveled with Washington to Calhoun to find a site and get a school built and operating. Thorn and Dillingham used their extensive networks among families and friends to raise funds and receive donations of all kinds. They also used the Hampton Institute publication, The Southern Workman, to publicize frequent articles about the school and aid fundraising. Thorn's nephew, Sidney Dickinson, spent time with his parents during his youth assisting at the school. =Hampton-Tuskegee model= A cooking class at the Calhoun School. Washington, Thorn and Dillingham developed the Calhoun Colored School according to the Hampton-Tuskegee model. First, students would receive a basic elementary education and then an industrial education at the high school level. This model envisioned preparing students for the work available in the rural areas in which most of them lived. Boys would become farmers and perhaps skilled tradesmen, and girls would become wives and homemakers, as well as laundresses, dressmakers, or domestic workers. The best students were encouraged to become teachers and work in the community or outlying areas to promote further education along the Hampton-Tuskegee model. There was a great push to continue to improve literacy among both children and adults, and teaching was a high calling. Second, the school was to be apolitical. The education was not designed to encourage African Americans to challenge the status quo. African Americans were offered a basic education that enabled them to return to their communities and support themselves within the system. Washington feared that if a colored school challenged the politics of the day, white citizens might refuse to allow it to open or would later shut it down. This was not the classical type of education offered to many white students in the north, but rural white students did not have access to such education either. Highly educated African Americans such as W. E. B. Du Bois thought the Tuskegee model was too limited and did not support it. Born in Massachusetts and educated in the North, including a doctorate at Harvard University, he argued for ensuring that the most talented students could get a full academic education, to advance the race. In October 1892 the co-principals Thorn and Dillingham met with 300 blacks from the area who wanted to learn more about their plans to start a school. Many of the adults who came to the first meeting would work to build the teachers' cottages, schoolhouses, barn, shop and dormitories that by 1896 comprised the full campus. N.J. Bell of Montgomery donated the initial of land for the site of the school. By 1896 the school had a working farm of ; 300 pupils, of whom 40 were boarders; and 13 teachers.Ellis, R. H.(1984) \\"The Calhoun School, Miss Charlotte Thorn's \\"Lighthouse on the Hill\\" in Lowndes County, Alabama\\", The Alabama Review, 37(3), pp. 183–201. Retrieved 2007-11-8.\\"IN AID OF COLORED MEN\\", The New York Times, 1896-01-21, p. 9. Retrieved on 2007-11-8. The Hampton-Tuskegee model was based on educating African Americans to build their lives from basic skills. Critics thought that it conformed to white expectations of low aspirations for blacks in the South during this period. But it also related to the needs of the chiefly rural economy of Alabama. It did not emphasize human agency or empowerment for change, and most white citizens and some blacks would not have supported such an idea then. =Fundraising, land bank, and road building= Mabel Dillingham died of yellow fever in 1895. Her brother Pitt Dillingham, a minister, worked with Charlotte Thorn as co-principal for several years after Mabel's death. He also helped by public speaking and giving lectures in the North to support fundraising. The founders, their community, and board had two major ideas that went beyond the Hampton-Tuskegee model. Knowing that land ownership was as or more critical than education to enable blacks to be self-supporting, in 1894 the school organized a land company. With a land bank containing more than , they sold land in 40- to tracts, with financing arranged by Northern friends of the school. In the first 13 years, the school issued 92 deeds for land to 85 people. The new landowners could build real houses on their land. Their three- to eight-room houses were each better than the sharecroppers' cabins which they had occupied before. Although Calhoun was near a railway, freight charges were too high for small farmers. Calhoun had been isolated by poor dirt roads that turned to slick clay in rain. The school tried to get the roads improved to enable farmers to get their goods to market. It took nearly 40 years, but Thorn Dickinson, Miss Thorn's nephew, was able to arrange a joint venture with the county. Using skills earned at Williams College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Dickinson laid out the road, the school students graded it, and the county surfaced with gravel what became Lowndes County Route 33. =Literacy program= Students in military formation. Initially the school's literacy program included oral reading, elocution, rote memory, literature appreciation, and home, school, and community connections. Additionally, outside materials were brought in to appeal to student interests, extensive discussions about words were held, poems were memorized, students were given help with articulation and expression, and students were taught to write their thoughts and spell correctly. \\"Connecting school and home\\" and the emphasis on composition were in addition to the Hampton-Tuskegee model. Later the literacy program included night classes for adults. These non-graded classes were part of the Hampton-Tuskegee model. The missionary committee led community outreach. Students and teachers went into the homes of freedmen to teach them to read and write, skills they eagerly worked for. Outreach included mothers’ meetings, Sunday afternoon church services, and holiday community celebrations on campus. Donations of money and books, mostly by Northern supporters, created the library at the school. While the co-principals officially adhered closely to the two-pronged Hampton-Tuskegee model, their literacy practice revealed a much richer model of teaching. The Calhoun Colored School (CCS) began as a strict follower of the Hampton-Tuskegee model, but the school eventually developed a classical education. This emphasized thinking and problem solving. It included a multifaceted literacy program. When CCS hired college-trained Academic Department heads, they began to use teaching methods and materials that followed national trends. As new teachers from outside CCS came to dominate the teaching force, they created a literacy program that resembled those at some of the better northern schools. Despite good teaching methods, solid curriculum and quality materials, the students of CCS did not make the desired progress in literacy. While these students were living in poverty, they were interested in education and had family support. The social attitudes of that era may have limited the thinking of the faculty and staff. \\"…it hindered their ability to envision African Americans as users of literacy; that is, while minimal access to literacy was made available, opportunities to use literacy in meaningful ways were delimited.\\" =Academic department heads= The principal's cottage, c. 1900 The staff of the Calhoun Colored School, c. 1900 From 1892–1945 there were six different Academic Department heads. Each brought improvements to the curriculum of the school. The first was Susan Showers (1896), who initiated literacy societies for students, home visits by teachers, single grade assignments for teachers, community socials, holiday celebrations, and evening religious services. (Partnering with the community was not part of the Hampton-Tuskegee model). Clara Hart (1898) succeeded Susan Showers. She began the first free kindergarten at CCS, put reading instruction in every grade level, ensured the use of good literature for all the children, and furthered composition work. Mabel Edna Brown (1907) was the first African American to work as Academic Department head. Her focus was to offer a more classical education, which was a major departure from the Hampton-Tuskegee model. She declared, \\"In all grades we are trying to raise the standards of thinking, accuracy, quickness, articulation, and correct expression.\\" She doubled the time devoted to literacy instruction in the primary grades through the sixth grade, to comprise one-half of the school day. By 1909, the kindergarten was using games to teach reading, writing and math. The school also began to solicit donations of books written by African Americans for the school library. Jessie Guernsey, who earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree from New York City's Columbia Teachers College, came to Calhoun in 1912 to begin her tenure as Academic Department head. Under her leadership, high-interest grade-level books were used to teach reading. She also increased weekly recitations, and reinstated using creative writing to teach spelling and grammar. She continued literary societies, debates, musical training and social gatherings. The elementary grades began using state-adopted textbooks, while the secondary grades used more literature, newspapers and magazines. The school added another year of study, to include grade ten. The growth in curriculum and community outreach strained financial resources. At the same time the county- run elementary schools for African American children were becoming more and more popular. Many of the CCS graduates had become teachers in the county school system. In the mid-1920s Edward Allen became the first man to be Academic Department head at CCS. He shifted the curriculum focus from teaching the basics of reading to teaching higher-order thinking skills. This was a major departure from the Hampton-Tuskegee model. During Allen's tenure, he greatly expanded the library, both in number and types of books. In the late 1920s R. Luella Jones came to CCS. She emphasized making the curriculum more rigorous, both to earn accreditation and to ensure placement of graduates in institutions of higher learning. She added college preparatory classes such as Latin, additional science and math classes, and made industrial arts an elective option. She also added grades eleven and twelve so that students could graduate from CCS. The library's collection expanded to over 6,000 volumes. =Closing years= Charlotte Thorn died on August 29, 1932. She had led the school for more than thirty years following Mabel Dillingham's death in 1895. Although Calhoun continued as a private school for several more years, the Great Depression reduced sources of support. In addition, increasing mechanization in agriculture decreased the need for rural labor. With the Great Migration of blacks from the area to northern and midwestern industrial cities for jobs, the area population was reduced to the point that the school could not survive financially.

The trumpet, or horn, in the lower right quadrant of the shield represents the instrument of command and control used by ancient armies. Kings and great nobles used the trumpet to call their martial forces to war as well as to control their movements on the battlefield. Thus, the symbols of the mobile warrior and the military horn are significant for the 721st Mobile Command and Control Squadron. Further, the color white on the unit shield traditionally denotes honor while the color red implies valor and even the blood of life or spirit of self-sacrifice. Both the color red and the horn tie the 721 MCCS to an early medieval legend, that of \\"Roland and the Horn\\" at the Battle of Roncevalles in 778. Charlemagne, king of the Franks, began to return home to France across the Pyrenees Mountains while Sir Roland guarded the rear of his army some distance behind. If ambushed by the enemy, Roland had been instructed to blow the trumpet and Charlemagne would charge to his assistance. Roland was indeed attacked, and in overwhelming numbers. Roland faced a terrible decision: if he called in Charlemagne's forces, all of the army faced destruction, or if he did not sound the trumpet Charlemagne and the main army would continue to safety while he and his tiny command would surely die. Gallantly, Roland and his men put the war horn away and prepared to make their last stand. The next day Charlemagne learned of the valiant deed and named Sir Roland the greatest of his knights.721 MCCS Significance Statement, Dr. David L.

The unit was initially formed with four bomb squadrons (393d, 398th, 421st, and 507th Bombardment Squadrons), being a mixture of both newly constituted and reassigned units. The 398th was formerly a III Bomber Command North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber Operational Training Unit in the southeastern United States, being formed in 1942. It later became a Martin B-26 Marauder Replacement Training Unit until being inactivated in October 1943. Due to a shortage of B-29s, the group was initially equipped with II Bomber Command Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses previously used for training heavy bomber replacement personnel. The unit was then reassigned for advanced training and received B-29s at Fairmont Army Air Field, Nebraska during the late spring and summer of 1944. In May, B-29 groups were reorganized to have three, rather than four squadrons, and the 507th Squadron was inactivated, with its personnel being consolidated into other group squadrons (the 507th would be reactivated a month later as part of the 333d Bombardment Group). In November, the 393d Bombardment Squadron was reassigned to the 509th Composite Group at Wendover Field, Utah, leaving the 504th to be a two squadron group. The 393d became the 509th's only operational B-29 squadron. The 393d would eventually become the only military unit in history to engage in nuclear warfare, dropping Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945. As a two squadron group, the 504th was deployed to Pacific Theater of Operations in late 1944, being assigned to the XXI Bomber Command 313th Bombardment Wing in the Northern Mariana Islands; being stationed at North Field, Tinian. The group began combat operations from Tinian in January 1945 with attacks on Japanese airfields and other installations on Maug and Iwo Jima and in the Truk Islands. Flew its first mission against the Japanese home islands early in February 1945 when the group bombed the industrial area of Kobe. Continued to attack strategic targets in Japan, operating in daylight and at high altitude to bomb such objectives as aircraft factories, chemical plants, harbors, and arsenals. Switched to night incendiary raids attacking major Japanese cities in the spring of 1945, causing massive destruction of urbanized areas. Received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for striking the industrial center at Yokohama late in May 1945. Began incendiary raids in March 1945, flying at night and at low altitude to strike area targets in Japan. Started mining operations against enemy shipping late in Mar, receiving a second DUC for mining Korean shipping lanes, the Shimonoseki Strait, and harbors of the Inland Sea, July–August 1945. In April and May 1945 the group hit airfields from which the Japanese launched kamikaze planes against the invasion force during the assault on Okinawa. During mid June 1945 the 680th Bomb Squadron was attached to the 504th bomb group to bring the group up to full strength with 3 squadrons. The group continued strategic bombing raids and incendiary attacks until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945. After V-J Day, the 504th dropped supplies to Allied prisoners, participated in show-of-force missions, and flew over Japan to evaluate bombardment damage. In the fall of 1945, the group largely demobilized as part of the \\"Sunset Project\\", with some aircraft being sent reclamation on Tinian; others being returned to the United States for storage at aircraft depots in the southwest. By Christmas, the group fleet was reduced to 30 or less planes Many of the remaining veterans signed for \\"any conditions of travel\\" to get home, arriving three weeks later in Oakland, California, where troop trains scattered them for points of discharge close to their homes. The unit was largely a paper organization when it was reassigned to Clark Field in the Philippines in March 1946, and assigned to Thirteenth Air Force. At Clark its remaining aircraft and personnel were consolidated into other units, and it was inactivated in June. =Lineage= * Constituted as the 504th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy on 18 February 1944 : Activated on 11 March 1944 : Inactivated on 15 June 1946Maurer, pp. 276-277 =Assignments= * Second Air Force, 11 March-5 November 1944 : Attached to 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy), 12 March-5 November 1944 * 313th Bombardment Wing, 23 December 1944 * Thirteenth Air Force, 6 March – 15 June 1946 =Components= * 393d Bombardment Squadron: 11 March-25 November 1944 * 398th Bombardment Squadron: 11 March 1944 – 15 June 1946 * 421st Bombardment Squadron: 11 March 1944 – 15 June 1946 * 507th Bombardment Squadron: 11 March-10 May 1944 * 680th Bombardment Squadron: Attached, 15 June 1945; assigned 14 November 1945 – 15 June 1946 * 20th Photographic Laboratory Squadron =Stations= * Dalhart Army Air Field, Texas, 11 March 1944 * Fairmont Army Air Field, Nebraska, 12 March-5 November 1944 * North Field, Tinian, Mariana Islands, 23 December 1944 * Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines, 13 March – 15 June 1946 =Aircraft= * Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, 1944 (Training only) * Boeing B-29 Superfortress, 1944–1946 References =Notes= =Bibliography=  External links * 504th Bomb Group Website Category:Military units and formations established in 1944 Category:Japan campaign Category:World War II strategic bombing units Category:World War II aerial operations and battles of the Pacific theatre Category:Bombardment groups of the United States Army Air Forces ","title":"504th Bombardment Group"},{"id":"13708924","text":"The Global horizontal sounding technique (GHOST) program was an atmospheric field research project in the late 1960s for investigating the technical ability to gather weather data using hundreds of simultaneous long-duration balloons for very long-range global scale numerical weather prediction in preparation for the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP). Technology The GHOST program was to demonstrate technology for a program that would, ultimately, gather data from thousands of balloons simultaneously. Unlike radiosonde balloons which collect vertical atmospheric sounding data over the release point during a relatively short ascent lasting a few hours, horizontal sounding balloons stay aloft for much longer periods lasting several weeks or months, floating at a constant-density altitude. The GHOST design explored the performance a superpressure balloon with a spherical two-layer PET film envelope holding the gas inside at a higher pressure than the surrounding atmosphere, allowing it to maintain a nearly constant altitude. These gas balloons float at a constant density altitude, where the balloon displaces a mass of air equal to its own mass. Expansion of the lifting gas due to solar heating is avoided in a superpressure balloon, since the inextensible PET film allows the pressure to rise as the gas is heated, rather than allow the volume to expand. This allows them to drift with, and track, horizontal atmospheric air currents at a constant air pressure level (a constant altitude) above the Earth's surface. The electronics payload was suspended below the balloon on a tether that also acted as a high frequency band radio antenna. The GHOST payload included a sun angle sensor that varied the repetition rate of its Morse code radio signal to allow technicians on the ground to locate it using an HF receiver and a set of sun angle tables. The balloons could not be flown in the Northern Hemisphere because the Soviet Union would not permit overflights at the time. Results 231 GHOST balloons were launched in a four-year period between March 1966 and December 1969. On September 29, 1968 a 10-foot (3-meter) GHOST balloon at an altitude of approximately 52,000 feet (16,000 meters) completed a full 365 days in flight, becoming the first balloon to fly for a full year. This record-breaking balloon, launched from Christchurch, New Zealand by the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), continued to fly for an additional 76 days, completing 35 circumnavigations of the Earth. The longest flight of the program was 744 days, or just over two years. Legacy For the measurements of the GARP program, the demonstrated flight lifetime at low altitudes (below 12 km) proved to be too short, despite many redesigns of the balloon system to improve the performance. Without both upper level and lower level long- duration balloons, the GHOST system idea was deemed infeasible for the GARP requirements. The GHOST program was superseded by research on the 'Carrier Balloon' system, also known as 'Mother GHOST'. The Ghost Project based at Christchurch Airport New Zealand was still running in 1973. A Ghost project balloon was seen by a member of the public in 1985. Vincent E. Lally of NCAR received the Otto C. Winzen Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2003 for his pioneering work in the application and development of superpressure balloons for worldwide atmospheric measurements, including the GHOST program. Winzen was a pioneer of modern ballooning, and this award recognizes outstanding contributions to the advancement of free-flight balloon systems or related technologies.

It has 37 main keys and 15 smaller bass keys, with 9-voice polyphony: eight notes may be played on the main keys, and one note on the bass. The bass section has one timbre, and the main section has 22, assignable to one of four presets. Like most small Casio keyboards, it also has a drum section with 6 different beats, a tempo knob, and a \\"fill\\" button. The fill button plays sixteenth note pulses of either the \\"snare\\" or \\"kick\\" as long as it is held down. Production started in the early 1980s and ceased shortly thereafter. The successor of the MT-40 came with a gray case, and was sold as the MT-41. Brazilian/British composer Ritchie used the Casio MT-40 in his Brazilian hit song Menina Veneno (1982). Composer Ralph Jones used the Casio MT-30 with cymbals and crystal glasses in his score to Amy Holden Jones' 1982 horror film The Slumber Party Massacre. The MT-40 had a built-in pattern widely reputed to be based either on the Eddie Cochran song \\"Somethin' Else\\", or the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy in the UK\\". The pattern's creator, Casio's Product Development and Music Engineer Hiroko Okuda, has denied either source, saying instead that it was based on a 1970s British rock song she declined to identify. Some have suggested the song may be David Bowie's \\"Hang On to Yourself\\". A synthesizer version of the song's bassline was used as the basis of one of the most popular dancehall music riddims of Jamaican music: the Sleng Teng riddim, which started the \\"digital reggae\\" revolution in 1985.Katz, David (2014) \\"Wayne Smith's Under Mi Sleng Teng – the song that revolutionized reggae\\", The Guardian, 20 February 2014.

It was inactivated when Craig was closed when the Air Force reduced its pilot training program after the Vietnam War. The unit began with its United States Army Air Forces World War II predecessor, the 29th Bombardment Group. It originally conducted anti- submarine warfare over the Gulf of Mexico during the early years of the war. Later, the 29th was a Replacement Training Unit (RTU). In 1944, the group was reequipped with Boeing B-29 Superfortresses and was engaged in combat as part of Twentieth Air Force. The 29th Bomb Group's aircraft engaged in very heavy bombardment operations against Japan, during which it earned two distinguished Unit Citations. History =World War II= Antisubmarine warfare and heavy bomber training The wing was first activated at Langley Field, Virginia, as the 29th Bombardment Group in January 1940. with the 6th, 43d and 52d Bombardment Squadrons assigned as its original components.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 145–146Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 196Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 219 Its organization was part of the pre-World War II buildup of the United States Army Air Corps after the breakout of war in Europe. In May, it moved to MacDill Field, Florida, where it was equipped with a mix of pre- production YB-17s and early model Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Douglas B-18 Bolos. In September 1941, the group expanded whan a fourth squadron, the 21st Reconnaissance Squadron, was attached to it.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 502–503 The group was still at MacDill when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and it began to fly antisubmarine patrol missions in the Gulf of Mexico from January 1942. While the group was engaged in antisubmarine patrols, its 21st Reconnaisssance Squadron was renamed the 411th Bombardment Squadron, recognizing that its mission no longer differed from that of the other three squadrons in the group. By the summer of 1942, the U-boat threat in the Gulf began to diminish, with all German submarines being withdrawn from the area by September.Warnock, p. 16 29th Bombardment Group B-24E Liberator in 1944 No longer needed in the Gulf, the group moved to Gowen Field, Idaho, where it became an Operational Training Unit (OTU) The OTU program involved the use of an oversized parent unit to provide cadres to \\"satellite groups\\".Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi The 96th, 381st, 384th and 388th Bombardment Groups were all formed at Gowen in the second half of 1942.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 166, 269, 271, 276 In 1943, the 29th Group exchanged its B-17s for Consolidated B-24 Liberators. The group mission also changed as the Army Air Forces' (AAF) need for new units diminished and its need for replacements increased. The group became a Replacement Training Unit (RTU). Like OTUs, RTUs were oversized units, but their mission was to train individual pilots and aircrews. However, standard military units, like the 29th Group, were based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, and were not proving well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, the AAF adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 The 29th Bombardment Group and its four squadrons were inactivated. Its personnel and equipment, along with that of supporting units at Gowen Field were combined into the 212th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training School, Heavy) on 1 April 1944.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 81–82 Combat in the Pacific 29th Bombardment Group B-29 Formation 1945 The AAF was organizing new Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment units, and the group was activated the same day at Pratt Army Air Field, Kansas. The group briefly returned to flying B-17s until B-29s became available for training. In May, The AAF reorganized its very heavy bomber units, and the 411th Bombardment Squadron was inactivated, leaving the group with its original three squadrons. The 29th continued training with the Superfortress until December 1944. Training included long range overwater flights to Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico. The group deployed to North Field, Guam, where it became a component of the 314th Bombardment Wing of XXI Bomber Command. Its first combat mission was an attack on Tokyo on 25 February 1945. Until March 1945, it engaged primarily in daytime high altitude attacks on strategic targets, such as refineries and factories. The campaign against Japan switched that month and the group began to conduct low altitude night raids, using incendiaries against area targets. The group received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for a 31 March attack against an airfield at Omura, Japan. The group earned a second DUC in June for an attack on an industrial area of Shizuoka Prefecture, which included an aircraft factory operated by Mitsubishi and the Chigusa Arsenal. Staff Sergeant Henry E.\\"Red\\" Erwin was awarded the Medal of Honor for action that saved his B-29 during a mission over Koriyama, Japan, on 12 April 1945. Sgt Erwin was assigned to job of dropping white phosphorus bombs through a launching chute in the floor of his bomber. A bomb exploded in the chute and shot back into the plane, severely wounding Sgt Erwin and filling the plane with heavy smoke. Despite being blinded by the burning bomb, he picked it up, carried it forward to the cockpit area of the plane and threw it out an open window. Once the smoke had cleared, the pilot was able to pull the Superfortress out of a dive and recover at an emergency base. During Operation Iceberg, the invasion of Okinawa, the group was diverted from the strategic campaign against Japanese industry and attacked airfields from which kamikaze attacks were being launched against the landing force. Following VJ Day, the group dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners of war and participated in several show of force missions over Japan. It also conducted reconnaissance flights over Japanese cities.

It features either a non-fastening double breast cut or a single-breasted version that fastens.Entry at blacktieguide.com Accessed August 4, 2012]. The jackets have shawl or peak lapels. Used in military mess dress, during the 1930s it became a popular alternative to the white dinner jacket in hot and tropical weather for black tie occasions. It also was prominently used, in single-breasted form, as part of the uniform for underclassmen at Eton College, leading to the alternative name Eton jacket. Its origin was a spencer, a tail-less adaptation of the tailcoat worn by both men and women during the Regency period. History The waist-length style of jacket first appeared in the 1790s when George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer removed the tails from his tailcoat. Spencer, it was thought, singed the tails of his tailcoat while standing beside a fire and then cut off the ends, unwittingly starting a new fashion.Regency Fashion History. 1800s Costume History, by Pauline Weston Thomas for Fashion-Era.com Other stories say Spencer—frustrated by his tails catching on brambles—tore the tails off his coat when hunting one day.Making a Man's Tailcoat, by J. Gottfred. In the early 1800s, Eton College adopted it for first year students' uniforms; it was referred to as an Eton jacket. Civilians first adopted a white mess jacket in 1933 to wear in the hot and tropical weather of Palm Beach. The mess jacket soon fell out of fashion for two main reasons. One is that the jacket only worked well with an athletic and slim fit. The other reason is that the mess jacket had gone on to be worn by musicians, bellhops and waiters, leading the class conscious of the era to abandon the garment. It is still used in service industries.

The unit was inactivated on 15 April 1946. The unit served primarily in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II as part of Twentieth Air Force. The 502d Bomb Group's aircraft engaged in very heavy bombardment B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan. Its aircraft were identified by a \\"H\\" inside a diamond painted on the tail. History The unit was established in early 1944 at Dalhart Army Air Field, Texas, being formed as a B-29 Superfortress Very Heavy bombardment Group. The unit was formed with three reassigned bomb squadrons (402d, 411th and 430th). The 402d was formed in 1940, becoming a II Bomber Command B-24 Liberator Replacement Training Unit (RTU); the 411th and 430th having their origins as World War I Air Service Aero Squadrons. The 411th became a II Bomber Command B-17 Flying Fortress RTU; the 430th serving in the Panama Canal Zone as part of the Sixth Air Force before being inactivated. From an original group of 11 officers and 82 enlisted men, the 502d grew to three flying squadrons, a photo lab and thousands of personnel. In September 1944, the newly formed group was sent to its training station at Grand Island Army Airfield, Nebraska. Due to a shortage of B-29s, the group was equipped with former II Bomber Command B-17 Flying Fortresses previously used for training heavy bomber replacement personnel. The 502d eventually received Atlanta-built B-29B Superfortresses. The B-29B was in fact unique, for it was equipped entirely with the only true variant of the B-29 ever manufactured. These aircraft were actually stripped- down versions of the normal B-29, bereft of the General Electric gun system and a variety of other components, in order to save weight and increase bomb- carrying capacity. The resultant unladen weight of 69,000 pounds was a vast improvement, lessening the strain on engines and airframe and enabling the payload to be increased from 12,000 to 18,000 pound ordnance. The only armament on these aircraft was in the tail, where two .50 caliber machine guns were installed. The elimination of the turrets and the associated General Electric computerized gun system increased the top speed of the Superfortress to 364 mph at 25,000 feet and made the B-29B suitable for fast, unescorted hit-and-run bombing raids and photographic missions. In addition, the B-29Bs of the 502nd were equipped with the new AN/APQ-7 \\"Eagle\\" radar sets which gave a much clearer presentation of ground images through a wing-shaped radar vane slung beneath the fuselage. It also gave a biplane effect in appearance. The \\"Eagle\\" was the product of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Eagle radar development group. It had been designed especially for night missions. Missions had to be planned and prepared so that briefing material could be slanted from the radar point of view. During World War II this special antenna and equipment for precision night radar missions was so secret that no B-29s were ever shown with it, and there are no actual official photographs in existence. The 502d was deployed to Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) in late 1944, being assigned to the XXI Bomber Command 315th Bombardment Wing in the Northern Mariana Islands; being stationed at Northwest Field, Guam. Upon arrival the group's personnel were engaged in Quonset hut construction. By mid-July most personnel were able to move into the huts from the initial tents which they were assigned on arrival. On 9 July, the group flew a shakedown mission to Truk, carrying about half a normal payload of bombs. The group entered combat on 30 June 1945 when the group bombed enemy installations on Rota. It then began flying very long range strategic bombardment missions over the Japanese Home Islands, principally attacking targets relating to the enemy's petroleum industry. The 502d was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for attacks on the coal liquefaction plant at Ube, the tank farm at Amagasaki and the Nippon oil refinery at Tsuchizaki in August 1945. It also conducted night incendiary raids attacking major Japanese cities causing massive destruction of urbanized areas. The group continued strategic bombing raids and incendiary attacks until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945. After V-J Day, the 502d dropped supplies to Allied prisoners, participated in show-of-force missions, and flew over Japan to evaluate bombardment damage. In the fall of 1945, the group largely demobilized as part of the \\"Sunset Project\\", with some aircraft being sent reclamation on Tinian; others being returned to the United States for storage at aircraft depots in the southwest. By Christmas, the group fleet was reduced to 30 or fewer planes and the remaining elements of the group was effectively consolidated into the 501st Bombardment Group. Many of the remaining veterans signed for \\"any conditions of travel\\" to get home, arriving three weeks later in Oakland, California, where troop trains scattered them for points of discharge close to their homes. The 502d was inactivated on Guam largely as a paper unit on 15 April 1946. =Lineage= * Constituted as 502d Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) on 25 May 1944 : Activated on 1 June 1944 : Inactivated on Guam on 15 April 1946 =Assignments= * Second Air Force, 1 June 1944 – 7 April 1945 : Attached to 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy), 26 September 1944 – 7 April 1945 * 315th Bombardment Wing, 12 May 1945 – 15 April 1946 =Components= * 402d Bombardment Squadron: 1 June 1944 – 15 April 1946 * 411th Bombardment Squadron: 1 June 1944 – 15 April 1946 * 430th Bombardment Squadron: 1 June 1944 – 15 April 1946 * 29th Photographic Laboratory Squadron =Stations= * Davis–Monthan Field, Arizona 1 June 1944 * Dalhart AAF, Texas 5 June 1944 * Grand Island AAF, Nebraska 26 September 1944 – 7 April 1945 * Northwest Field, Guam, Mariana Islands, 12 May 1945 – 15 April 1946 =Aircraft= * Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, 1944 (Training only) * Boeing B-29B Superfortress, 1944–1946 References * Maurer, Maurer (1983).

It is a founding member of the South Asian Inter-Scholastic Association (SAISA) in 1972, and remains a highly regarded educational institution in Pakistan. It is located near the resort town of Murree, Pakistan, at over 7000 ft. elevation in the foothills of the Himalayan mountains in Pakistan.Murree Christian School The main high school building, made of stone, is a former garrison Church, serving as a Church of Scotland congregation for British soldiers in training in the hill station of Murree, until the church was given to the Anglican Diocese of Lahore during Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, but was not used until the newly formed Murree Christian School started renovating and refurbishing the deconsecrated church. Several other buildings are used as elementary classrooms, staff housing as well as boarding hostels (dorms). Until 2011, high school boys were housed at a building which was formerly Sandes Soldiers Home, for convalescent soldiers of the British Indian Army. Murree Christian School is one of the better known international boarding schools on the Indian Subcontinent, established to serve the needs of the expatriate communities in and around Pakistan after the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 made it increasingly difficult for children to continue to attend other similar schools in India such as Woodstock School in Mussoorie, and Hebron School in Ootacamund, and Kodaikanal International School in Kodaikanal. Attendance in the early 1960s quickly rose to over 100 pupils and the first graduating class was celebrated in 1964. Through the 1970s and up until 2001, the school boasted a multinational community of over 150 students and over 50 expatriate staff from over 25 countries. History MCS High-School Building. Murree Christian School was founded in 1956 to educate the children of missionaries in Pakistan and is located near the tiny crossroads town of Jhika Gali which is in the Murree hills of Rawalpindi District, Punjab province. The school had been functioning without notoriety until 5 August 2002 when gunmen attacked the school killing six people, none of whom were students or expatriatesSix killed in attack on Murree school – Dawn Pakistan, the school has since returned to normalcy with increased security. Since the mid-1960s, not all students have been from missionary families; some are children of expatriate workers of diplomatic missions, non-governmental organisations, or multinational corporations in Pakistan. Some students are from the small Pakistani Christian community, but because the national curriculum of Pakistan is not taught, Pakistani students have very limited options for tertiary education domestically. Courses are taught in English, with supplementary classes for European and Asian native-language speakers as well as Urdu as a foreign language for students. Sports MCS Gym MCS is the smallest member of SAISA (the South Asia International Schools Association) with enrolment under 100 students after reopening in 2004. SAISA facilitates athletic and cultural interaction with other international schools in the region. MCS students join with students from other schools in South Asia for sports tournaments and occasional fine arts productions. Meeting other students from different backgrounds, forming friendships, sharing victory and defeat are some of the beneficial experiences that MCS students have gained from participating in SAISA events. MCS students have also contributed much to the Association through their sense of sportsmanship, manners, cheerful cooperation and team spirit, frequently winning the sportsmanship award.. In preparation for these tournaments, students spend many afternoons after school training and practicing. Boarding life =General information= All the elementary boarders are housed in one group with the boarding parents. Junior and senior high-school boarders have separate departments divided by gender. Grades 7–9 are in the junior-high boys and girls, and students in grades 10 to 12 are in the senior high boys and girls boarding departments. Normally a husband/wife work together for each boarding department, but we also sometimes single boarding parents are accepted as well. Donations Donations from alumni and other benefactors to MCS have been used on multiple projects, such as: Gharial Site: *Improving the rooms and bathrooms on the 2nd floor of the MCS hostel. *Improving and extending Central Heating on the main floor of the Hostel *Building a new guard security office *Adding security equipment The school are continually evaluating sites in order to update them and make them more efficient to operate. Development projects that are next on the list to, work on as funds are available, are: At the Gharial Site: *New lights for stage and wiring for sound system about Rs 200,000 *65 new individual, stack- able desks and chairs @ Rs 12,000 each = RS 780,000 *A new digital projector for class room use = Rs 85,000. *Insulate and re-route the water distribution system and build a high pressure tank *Upgrade the external bathrooms in the high school *Seven sofa sets for boarding, staff room and our staff lounge @ Rs 25,000 each = Rs 175,000 Admissions =General Information= Murree Christian School was established primarily to meet the educational needs of the missionary community working in and around Pakistan. Applications are accepted from families working in other areas who understand the historical evangelical Christian background of the school and accept its centrality in school life. Subsequently the school will contact applicants for an interview. Accepting applicants from an English as a Second Language (ESL) background will be conditional on English proficiency and prior English-language schooling experience. The school does not admit students from Muslim backgrounds due to Pakistani regulations.\\"Admissions.\\" Murree Christian School. Retrieved on 1 February 2016.

Versions Two models were released in 1985: the Alpha Juno 1 (JU-1), and the Alpha Juno 2 (JU-2), which added one octave of notes, a cartridge slot and touch-sensitivity. Alpha Juno synthesizers presented a reduced user interface compared to other synths of the day, with a single \\"Alpha Dial\\" replacing many sliders and knobs - they represented Roland's first truly \\"knobless\\" synthesizers since arch rivals Korg and Yamaha having already made the change to a largely pushbutton programming interface some two years before with the Poly-61 and DX7, respectively. The keyboard features MIDI in, out and thru, mono, stereo and headphone sockets. It also supports an external footpedal controller, and tape backup. The Alpha Juno offered a combination of frequency stability (using digitally controlled oscillators) with more \\"organic\\" quality of analog filters. The Roland programmer PG-300 offers complete control over all MIDI editable parameters of the Alpha Juno, the Alpha Juno 2 and the MKS-50. More recently, software has been written for Microsoft Windows and Apple computers which allows graphical editing of Juno patches through MIDI. The MKS-50 (1987) is a rack-mount version of the Alpha Juno. It has the same synth engine and architecture, with some added features like 16 programmable chord memories, and the ability to store velocity, volume, panning, de-tune, portamento and other similar parameters within each patch. Both Alpha Junos can create the \\"Hoover sound\\" popular in jungle and rave music. Artists who have used the Alpha Juno include the Prodigy, hardcore/gabber music from the Thunderdome albums, Son Dexter and a great many other rave acts. The bassline on Madonna's Vogue was an MKS-50.  Factory presets  The factory presets for the Alpha Juno were created by Eric Persing and Oceanmind.

The Book primarily appears on the tombs of Merneptah, Twosret, Ramesses III, Ramesses VI, and Ramesses VII and serves as a counterpart to the Book of Caverns.Book of the Earth by Jimmy Dunn writing as Taylor Ray Ellison The central figures in the story are Osiris, Ra and Ba, while the overarching plot is the journey the sun takes through the earth god, Aker. Original sources The scenes were found on all of the walls of the tombs of Ramesses VI and Ramesses VII. There were a few additional scenes found on the walls of other royal tombs extending from the New Kingdom to the Late Period, but since many scene from the Book were scattered around, the ordering of the illustrations is slightly convoluted. Jean-François Champollion was the first one to publish the scenes and texts from the tomb of Ramesses VI in his Monuments de l'Egypte where he deciphered the hieroglyphs depicted in the tombs. Alexandre Piankoff was the first one to really study the composition of the images and hieroglyphics and looked for a meaning behind the illustrations. Bruno H. Stricker provided an explanation of the Book as a divine embryology in 1963. Structure of the book Although it is uncertain, it is believed that the surviving panels of the original composition were each divided into three registers. Thus making it unclear about whether or not scenes from other tombs are actually part of the story of the Book of the Earth or if they are separate. Scholars believe that the Book consists of two halves with one half containing scenes of punishment. The Book of the Earth uses the sun disc as a reoccurring theme. The scenes are oriented so that they are facing to the right, and the illustrations can be read from right to left, like in the tomb of Ramesses VI. This is the opposite of the typical configuration according to Alexandre Piankoff.Piankoff, Alexandre (1954). The Tomb of Ramesses VI. Pantheon. Content The Book is divided into five main components; Part E, Part D, Part C, Part B, and Part A. These components make up the theme of the creation of the solar disc and the theme of the sun god, Re's journey in the underworld and making it out into the light. Most of the content takes place within Part D and Part A. =Part E= In this part, there are six gods shown praying to a sun disc at burial mounds. This is smallest portion of the Book that is known, and Part E is most likely not the beginning of the Book of the Earth. =Part D= Part D is probably the beginning of the composition, where most of the setting is introduced. A majority of the content of the Book of the Earth is also located within this section. The realm of the dead is depicted with Osiris, as the primary figure, located within a tomb that is guarded by serpents. Beneath Osiris are the gods Anubis and another god who have their arms stretched out to provide protection over his corpse. This scene depicts renewal, while the scenes on both adjacent sides depict punishment. In the scenes of punishment, the gods of punishment are represented and are holding cauldrons. Next, the mummy of the sun god stands upon a large sun disc that is enclosed by two pairs of arms rising from the depths of Nun. Surrounding this scene is a wreath of twelve stars and twelve small disks that indicate the course of the hours. The hands of two goddesses hold the ends of this illustration. The final scene in this section shows Aker, who is representing the barque of the sun god, as a double sphinx. The barque is supported by two uraei, and inside the barque are Khepri and Thoth who are praying to the sun god. Underneath the barque are two royal figures with Isis and Nephthys who are holding a winged scarab beetle and a sun disc. The middle register begins with Horus rising up out of a divine figure called the \\"Western One.\\" Next, there are seven mounds that each contains a god. In the next scene, the propagation of Horus is repeated in which Horus is now falcon-headed, and rises from the body of Osiris which is being protected by the corpses of Isis and Nephthys. In the next scene, Nun's arms are holding the solar disc, and other arms and two uraei hold another sun disc. A serpent is located on the top of this sun disc, which might signify the regeneration of the sun. Like many Ancient Egyptian texts, the bottom register shows the punishment of enemies in the Place of Annihilation since it is below the gods. Since gods are more important figures, they are depicted above others. The sun god is shown above with several sarcophagi and four enemies below. Finally, we find a corpse lying in a large sarcophagus located in the Place of Annihilation, which Re calls the \\"corpse of Shetit.\\" This is the realm of the dead where gods and goddesses above the scene hold their hands out in prayer. In the last scene, we find the Apophis serpent being seized by ram headed gods. =Part C= Part C comprises three registers that might be connected to Part D, but the exact sequence is unclear. The upper and middle registers both start off with images of the sun god in his ram-headed form. Two ba-birds are praying to him while an unknown god is greeting him in the middle register. Behind the unknown god are two additional gods, one being ram-headed and the other being serpent-headed. These gods have their hands stretched out in front of them, towards the sun disc, in a protective gesture. Out of this gesture, the falcon shaped head of \\"Horus of the netherworld\\" is projected. =Part B= The registers of this section are less obvious, and many parts might be considered to belong to Part A. The first scenes in this section consist of four oval shapes with mummies inside, which are able to breathe from the rays of the sun god. There are also four burial mounds that have been turned over and are being protected by serpents. The main part of this section depicts a mummy, who is standing, called \\"corpse of the god,\\" which is also the sun disc itself. In front of him, a serpent rises out of a pair of arms and holds a god and goddess in the act of praise. Behind the mummy is another pair of arms, called the \\"arms of darkness,\\" that is being supported by the crocodile, Penwenti. Next, there are four more ovals containing mummies with four ba-birds, one ba-bird for each mummy. This, along with two additional hieroglyphs, represents shadows. Underneath this illustration are depictions of barques that contain the mummies of Osiris and the falcon-headed Horus. At the end of this segment of the Book of the Earth, the upper portion shows a depiction of a large burial mound, containing the sun disc with an unknown god praying to it. Two heads and two goddesses that are located on both sides of the large burial mound also give praise. Directly below this, on the bottom register, are four gods and ba-birds that are also praying. =Part A= In the beginning of this section, the sun god is enclosed by mummies at a burial mound called the Mound of Darkness. Above this mound, a solar barque is shown. Following this scene, Aker is depicted as a double sphinx. the solar barque is located between the entrance and the exit of the realm of the dead, with its stern side facing the exit. Below shows the resurrection of the corpse of the sun, which is a scene that typically occurs in royal sarcophagus chambers. A falcon head emerges from a sun disc, and the light is shown falling on the \\"mysterious corpse\\" which is lying down. In the next scene, twelve goddess, each representing an hour of the night, are depicted. Each goddess has the hieroglyph of a star and a hieroglyph of a shadow with a beaming disk above her. At the beginning of the fourth scene, a few of the mummies are enclosed within four large circles. In the fifth scene, a central god, who is thought to be Osiris, is surrounded by the corpses of Shu (Egyptian deity), Tefnut, Khepri and Nun. The sixth scene, shows a pair of arms rising from the depths. A goddess called Annihilator stands up with her arms reaching to embrace a sun disc. The arms are supporting two praying goddesses named West and East in a reverse orientation. It is believed that the upper register of this part ends with a line containing a title of this work, though it is still unknown. The middle register begins with the solar barque again. It is towed by fourteen ram-headed gods with all of their bas. Next, a god stands in his cave, surrounded by twelve star goddesses who are extending discs to him. The following scene, which is scattered around the tomb of Ramesses VI, shows five burial mounds with a head and arms emerging from it. They are raised up in a gesture of praise. In the third scene, the birth of the sun is represented. This scene also occurs on the sarcophagus of Ramesses IV, but there is more detail and more story on that sarcophagus than in this scene.

She was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2002.  Birth and early life  Elizabeth Buffum Chace was born Elizabeth Buffum in Smithfield, Rhode Island on December 9, 1806, to Arnold Buffum and Rebecca Gould, the Buffum and Gould families were some of the oldest families in New England. A birthright Quaker, Elizabeth Buffum grew up in a household that was anti-slavery, her father Arnold holding strong beliefs in that regard and being president of the New England Anti-Slavery Society.  Marriage and early activities  On April 4, 1828, Buffum married Samuel Buffington Chace, also a birthright Quaker of an old New England family. It was after her marriage to Samuel that Elizabeth began to become truly influential in the anti-slavery movement. Although Samuel was not as outspoken as his wife, he shared her beliefs and together, they opened their home in Valley Falls, Rhode Island as a Station on the Underground Railroad, at great personal risk, to runaway slaves helping them escape to Canada. Elizabeth had ten children with Samuel. The first five died in childhood to diseases that ravaged the families of that time. In 1835, Elizabeth helped to found the Fall River Female Anti Slavery Society, after the original group struggled to integrate the free black women who wished to join as members.Stevens, Elizabeth C. Elizabeth Buffum Chace and Lillie Chace Wyman: A Century of Abolitionist, Suffragist, and Workers' Rights Activism. United States: McFarland Publishing, 2003. Her and her sisters held the point of view of working to end all racist practices, and not just working towards abolition as the original group intended. She named the group the \\"Fall River Anti- Slavery Sewing Society\\"Stevens, Elizabeth C. Elizabeth Buffum Chace and Lillie Chace Wyman: A Century of Abolitionist, Suffragist, and Workers' Rights Activism. United States: McFarland Publishing, 2003. (The word Sewing was later changed to include Female)  The Civil War Years  With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the Chaces continued their striving for the outlaw of slavery and although firmly supportive of the Union cause, were disappointed that Abraham Lincoln did not move immediately to abolish slavery. Elizabeth Buffum Chace met and corresponded regularly with many of the most significant Anti-Slavery figures of that time; she associated personally with William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and William Wells Brown, and hosted them frequently at her home. As an illustration of just how dedicated to and involved in the anti-slavery movement the Buffum family were, while John Brown was being held in Virginia after his actions at Harpers Ferry and right prior to being hanged, Elizabeth's sister Rebecca Buffum and her son Edward journeyed to Virginia from Rhode Island specifically to visit with Brown in his cell. They requested and received special permission from the Virginia authorities to do so thinking that they could \\"minister\\" to John Brown. By their own account of the visits, John Brown welcomed them openly.  Later years  In her later life, Elizabeth continued to advocate for the political rights for women and for prison and workplace reform. She died December 12, 1899 (aged 93) and was buried at Swan Point Cemetery.  Legacy  Bronze bust in the Rhode Island State House Conscience of Rhode Island In 2001, Rhode Island Secretary of State, Edward S. Inman III selected Elizabeth Buffum Chace out of a field of 36 nominees including Anne Hutchinson and Christiana Carteaux Bannister, to be singularly honored with a bronze bust in the Rhode Island State House as \\"The Conscience of Rhode Island\\" for her tireless championing of the rights of the less fortunate. This was the first time in the history of the Rhode Island State House that an image of a woman was displayed within the building. The bust of Elizabeth Buffum Chase was created and sculpted by the Bolivian born artist Pablo Eduardo of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Influence of the family Samuel's and Elizabeth's progeny played large roles in higher education in the 20th century. Their son, Arnold Buffum Chace, became the Chancellor of Brown University and a renowned mathematician associated with the Rhind Papyrus. Their daughter, Lillie Buffum Chace Wyman, became an author publishing several books and writing regularly for such magazines as The Atlantic Monthly in addition to being a tireless social reformer. And, their grandchildren Richard Chace Tolman and Edward Chace Tolman both became professors of renown. Richard played a crucial role as Scientific Liaison for the United States Army on the Manhattan Project, and Edward, a pioneer in Behaviorism, successfully sued the University of California, Berkeley for firing him for refusing to sign the infamous Loyalty Oath of the 1950s during the McCarthy Era. Samuel's and Elizabeth's grandson, Malcolm Greene Chace, was a US Collegiate Tennis Champion, and father of American ice hockey. However, the Chace family is perhaps best known for its involvement in textile manufacturing. The textile company associated with the Chace family, the Valley Falls Company, later became known as Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates, later Berkshire Hathaway. Influence on the Foundation of the Rhode Island State Home and School Buffum was one of the largest impetuses in the Foundation of the Rhode Island State Home and School in 1885.

He began his tennis career after moving to the French part of Switzerland to attend the National Training Center. He showed promise during his junior days and was eager to begin his professional debut. Tennis career Ivo turned pro in 1997. He won his first title in India at a small $25,000 Challenger, beating Danai Udomchoke 6–2, 6–3. Ivo was chosen to represent Switzerland along with the rest of the Swiss Davis Cup team 7 times during his career.Davis Cup - Players His career was one that had few highlights and perhaps he was best known in the tennis world for his relationship with former world #1 Martina Hingis. His best ranking was 102, and he remained in the 100s for much of his career. He is what most in the tennis world would call a \\"journeyman\\"—one who spends much of their career on the Challenger circuit and in ATP qualifying draws. Perhaps his most notable win was his defeat of Roger Federer in qualifying at the 1999 US Open. Ivo defeated the then 18-year-old Federer in the second round of qualifying in straight sets. Never again, in the ensuing 19 years, would Roger fail to advance to the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament. Business career Ivo began putting to use the many contacts he had made over the years while traveling to 60 different countries. He founded a company called Hi-Pro in the summer of 2004. His company specializes in marketing and promotional products and has since grown to be one of the biggest companies in its field in Switzerland. In 2006, Ivo Heuberger and the Swiss Tennis team federation signed a deal that would make Hi-Pro the official clothing provider for the Swiss Davis Cup Team. Hi-Pro now also provides the official staff uniforms for the Basel Swiss Indoor Tennis Tournament. Personal life In September 2007, Ivo married Martha Dominguez who is a Miami-based fashion blogger.

In 1893, the office of Church Architect was dissolved (to be reinstated for a time in the mid 20th century), Young thereafter practiced privately with the LDS Church as a frequent client. Young practiced as an architect, landscape architect and designer from 1879 to circa 1935. A preponderance of his work centered on church commissions, or commissions offered him by extended Young family members, or higher echelon church friends. Early life Young was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, the son of Brigham Young and Emily Dow Partridge (a daughter of Edward Partridge). He studied at the University of Deseret and then the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy, New York. At Rensselaer he studied civil engineering and architecture. Early career After graduating in 1879, Young returned to Salt Lake City and practiced as a railroad engineer; gradually his first love of architecture, landscape architecture and design took precedence over engineering. Young is considered Utah's first academically trained architect and landscape architect. He married Alice Naomi Dowden on 22 September 1881. They had ten children. Young entered into a polygamist marriage on January 11, 1887 when he married Marion Penelope Hardy in Juarez, Mexico. Young and Hardy were married, or sealed, by church apostle Erastus Snow.Abraham H. Cannon (1859-1896) Diaries, Date: January 11, 1887, Vault Mss. 62, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. As his father had hoped, Young taught in Utah's schools, first as an instructor and later as a professor of \\"architecture and mechanical drawing\\" at the University of Deseret (Salt Lake City) from 1883 to 1888; and later as a teacher of mathematics at Brigham Young Academy (Provo, Utah) from 1897 to 1900. Young also served on the Brigham Young Academy's Board of Trustees from 1886 to 1901. Young also served two terms in Utah's Territorial Legislature (1883–1887). Young's early landscape design commissions include the Utah Territorial Insane Asylum (1881, with architect John H. Burton as the asylum architect) and Salt Lake City's Liberty Park (1881–83, via a public design competition). These commissions represent Utah's earliest academically informed landscape design projects. Young's noteworthy early architecture commissions include a dormitory for Brigham Young College (1882–1885; Logan, Utah Territory), the Bear Lake Stake Tabernacle (1883–1888; Paris, Idaho), the Brigham Young Academy (designed in 1884, completed 1892; Provo, Utah Territory) and the Templeton (Zion's Bank) Building (designed in 1883, completed 1890; Salt Lake City). The Bear Lake Tabernacle and the Brigham Young Academy buildings are extant examples of Young's early design work, and are considered two of the LDS Church's most beloved last 19th century architectural landmarks. Appointment as LDS Church Architect In 1887, after the death of Truman O. Angell, Young was appointed Church Architect, and the architect for the Salt Lake Temple, by church president Wilford Woodruff. After re-designing the towers and finials, and the final appearance of the windows, Young focused his energies on designing the temple's lavish late Victorian/Neo-baroque interior. Besides the construction of interior supports, none of the interior designs drawn by Angell (or Wm. Ward, Wm. H. Folsom, and Angell's son, T.O. Angell Jr.) had been executed. Thus as Angell is considered the primary architect of the temple's exterior, Young is considered the primary architect for its interior. He also designed the temple's original Annex, the Temple Square electrical system, heating plant and greenhouse/conservatory, and the general landscape design for Temple Square. With the completion of the Salt Lake Temple in 1893, Young was released as Church Architect. Mid to late career At mid-career Young practiced with his oldest son, Don Carlos Young, as Young & Son, Architects; and was responsible for the design of the 2nd Eagle Gate (c. 1892, an overarching symbolic gateway to Brigham Young's Salt Lake farm), Latter-day Saint University (later LDS College and LDS Business College, located on the corner of North Temple and Main Street); the LDS Church's Bishop's Building (50 North Main St.), and the Church Administration Building (47 East South Temple). Between c. 1920 and 1935, he practiced as an institutional architect, designing (or supervising the designs) of hundreds of different yet mildly standard plan-like buildings for the LDS Church. Young worked for his step brother, Willard Young, who served as head of the church's building department. Thus, even though he was no longer sustained in the church's general conference as church architect, Young was essentially described as such from 1887 to this death. Influence on other architects Young acted as mentor to dozens of younger architects and engineers, including many of his own children. This familial list includes Don Carlos (Don) Young Jr., who assisted his father in a failed circa 1911-1917 bid to design the Utah State Capital building. Young & Son took second place behind Salt Lake City architect Richard K.A. Kletting. D. C. Young Jr., was also responsible for designing with Danish emigrant Ramm Hansen (as Young & Hansen, architects) the LDS Church's flagship meetinghouse in Washington, D.C., known as the \\"Washington Chapel,\\" located on 2810 Sixteenth Street, N.W., sheathed no less in railroad shipped Utah granite. Finally, J. D. C. Young's youngest son, George Cannon Young, was also a successful mid-20th century Utah architect. With his son, Richard Young, G. C. Young designed the LDS Church's twenty- eight story Church Office Building (completed 1972; Salt Lake City) which was the tallest building in Salt Lake City until 1998. Death Young died in 1938 in Salt Lake City as the oldest remaining son of Brigham Young.

It was discovered in 1961/2 in the course of the archaeological trial excavations related to the construction of the motorway. The first archaeological excavations were conducted in 1978 by the Museum of Macedonia, under the leadership of Voislav Sanev. The stratigraphy of the settlement has a cultural layer that indicates life was continuously taking place in the period between year 6000 and 4300 BC. The land was used mostly for agriculture, conserving the remains of a multifaceted settlement. The evidence of the multiple stages of the settlement is found within a three-foot layer which shows the three stages of life within the community and that the settlement was part of the Anzabegovo-Vršnik cultural group. One of the first structures found was a house, believed to be a sanctuary, demonstrating evidence for religion. The most representative finding of site is the discovery of Pre-Indo-European sculptures of the Great Mother, suggesting the existence of the Cult of the Great Mother Goddess. These findings are remarkable evidence of the material and spiritual life and high artistic and aesthetic achievements of the Neolithic man from Macedonia.

Career Malléjac was born at Dirinon. Previously a worker in the munitions factory in Brest, he was professional from 1950 with the Stella-Dunlop team. His biggest accomplishment was when riding for the Terrot Hutchinson team, he won a stage and wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for five days on his way to finishing the 1953 Tour de France second overall behind Louison Bobet. In 1955, as rider number 9 in the French team led by Bobet, Malléjac prepared to ride over Mont Ventoux on stage 12 from Marseille to Avignon. It is a climb that riders have always feared because the first two-thirds are through a forest where the air seems humid and scarce and the rest through a bleak, lunar landscape that is proof of Mont Ventoux's history as a volcano. The French writer Antoine Blondin wrote: Ten kilometres from the summit, said the journalist Jacques Augendre, Malléjac was: \\"Streaming with sweat, haggard and comatose, he was zigzagging and the road wasn't wide enough for him... He was already no longer in the real world, still less in the world of cyclists and the Tour de France.\\" Malléjac collapsed, falling to the ground with one foot still trapped in a pedal. The other leg pedalled on in the air. He was, said Pierre Chany, \\"completely unconscious, his face the colour of a corpse, a freezing sweat ran on his forehead.Chany, Pierre (1988) La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Éditions La Martinière, France Malléjac was hauled to the side of the road by Sauveur Ducazeaux, an official of another team, and Dumas summoned. Georges Pahnoud of the Télégramme de Brest reported: Dumas had to strap Malléjac down for the journey to hospital at Avignon. Malléjac and Dumas were equally furious, Malléjac insisting he had been drugged against his will and that he wanted to start legal proceedings, Dumas saying: \\"I'm prepared to call for a charge of attempted murder.\\" Malléjac recovered and rode the Tour four more times before he stopped racing in 1959. He retired to run a driving school at Landerneau, near where he was born. He denied wrongdoing up to his death in September 2000 at Landerneau.

Their sound has been compared to a mixture of Dead Can Dance, David Lynch, Katatonia, Celtic Frost and Clock DVA. History =1992-1994= Forgotten Sunrise was formed in summer 1992 as the result of a common interest of Anders Melts and Jan Talts to make death metal in Estonia. Two friends with previous experiences, Margus Gustavson and Tarvo Valm, joined the yet unnamed band. After six months and having their first songs, in 1993 a quality demo “Behind The Abysmal Sky” was recorded. A few months later a contract with a Finnish label, Rising Realm Records, was signed and by the end of the year the “Forever Sleeping Greystones” mini-CD had been recorded. The mini-album was released at the end of 1994. The band attracted a great deal of attention and played concerts until differences caused the drummer and the guitarist to leave the band. =1996-1999= With Renno Süvaoja and Tiiu Kiik joining the group, computers were now a part of the process of making the music. In the meantime the band's style had progressed and in 1996, Forgotten Sunrise basically started from the beginning. A period of studies and experimenting followed until Forgotten Sunrise was again ready for stage. In 1997, they appeared with a new sound. Though old atmospheric death metal was mixed with trip hop, techno, folk and drum'n'bass merged with shoegaze and indie-pop, the dreary grim atmosphere and severe message were still intact. With the style the group itself called Deathbeat, the first promotional CD was out in 1999 and a self-released mini-album “a.Nimal f.Lesh\\" in 2000. =2003-2008= Forgotten Sunrise signed a two album contract with the Italian label, My Kingdom Music. The first album, Ru:mipu:dus, was released in January 2004 and before that a full-length single “Ple:se Disco-Nnect Me” was given out. The album received positive reviews. In 2005, the track “Never(k)now” was given out as a promotional single. The second album, Willand, was recorded in fall 2005 and was released in spring 2007. In 2006, Gerty Villo joined the band with keyboards and female vocals. In 2007, Pavel Torpan joined with guitars and Different Knots of Ropelove, a 12 track remix CD (including remixes by Alec Empire, Pehr Herb, Darkmen etc.), was released. =2009= A full-length CD-single, \\"The Moments When God Was Wrong\\", was self-released and the demo tape \\"Behind The Abysmal Sky\\" with a mini-CD \\"Forever Sleeping Greystones\\" with 7 live bonus tracks was re-released on CD. =2010= Ragnar Kivi joined the band with electronic drums.

Dedicated media featuring Green Lantern primarily include: the 2012-2013 animated television series Green Lantern: The Animated Series, the 2011 live action film Green Lantern with accompanying video game Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters, and animated films Green Lantern: First Flight in 2009 and Green Lantern: Emerald Knights released in 2011. Novels/audios Green Lantern: Sleepers is a trilogy created by Christopher J. Priest and written by Mike Baron, Michael Ahn, and Priest. Each book focuses on a different Green Lantern—Kyle Rayner, Alan Scott, and Hal Jordan, respectively. Pocket has published a series of Justice League of America novels. Of these, Exterminators by Christopher Golden includes Hal Jordan as part of the team, and Hero's Quest by Dennis O'Neil is a solo Green Lantern story. All of these stories have been made into full-cast dramatizations released by GraphicAudio. Television =Animation= The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure Hal Jordan was the featured character in a solo series which was part of The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure (1967) as well as part of the Justice League segments. These would be the character's first animated appearances. Gerald Mohr is the voice of Green Lantern. Super Friends In addition, Hal Jordan's Green Lantern was an occasional supporting character in the various Super Friends incarnations: Challenge of the Super Friends, Super Friends, Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians. Michael Rye provided the voice of the Green Lantern for these appearances. Justice League John Stewart in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. John Stewart is a member of the Justice League in the Justice League animated series. In this series, Stewart's ring was initially constrained to permitting him to fly, generating a protective force field, creating walls, and firing energy blasts; this limitation was established as being due to Stewart's mindset, not an inherent limitation of the ring itself (the series' version of Stewart is a former U.S. Marine, not an architect). After being berated by Katma Tui for his unimaginative use of the ring, Stewart has learned to generate complex tools (to defuse a bomb in one instance) and weapons. (He was also shown to be more creative when transformed into a child in the episode \\"Kids Stuff\\".) In a development not seen in any other version of the Green Lantern mythos, Stewart's eyes glow green when wearing his charged power ring. The glow fades when the ring runs out of power. The series has been inconsistent about the ring's effectiveness against yellow; Stewart is seen fighting Sinestro in one episode, and the yellow energy does not prove to be a significant problem for the Lantern, although in a later episode of Justice League Unlimited, the Flash threw yellow Jell-O at him, breaking his force field. Stewart's voice is provided by Phil LaMarr. Other DCAU appearances Kyle Rayner in the Justice League Unlimited series *Kyle Rayner appears as Green Lantern in \\"In Brightest Day...\\", an episode of Superman: The Animated Series. This version is recruited by Abin Sur, and fights Jordan's old enemy Sinestro (voiced by Ted Levine). Guy Gardner makes a cameo as the mugger who steals Jimmy Olsen's camera. Rayner is voiced by Michael P. Greco. *Rayner is briefly mentioned in one episode of Justice League and appears as one of the Green Lanterns attending Superman's funeral in \\"Hereafter\\". He later reappears after the series became Justice League Unlimited in \\"The Return\\", bearing a far greater resemblance to his comics counterpart. Rayner's appearance (where he and the Corps unsuccessfully attempted to defend Oa from Amazo) finally explains why Stewart is the Green Lantern of Earth; Rayner had been stationed on Oa all along. Will Friedle, who voices Batman (Terry McGinnis) in Batman Beyond provides Rayner's voice in \\"The Return\\". *A character known as Scott Mason / Green Guardsman appears in the two-part Justice League episode \\"Legends\\", in which Stewart and several other members travel to a parallel universe. This other universe has its own superhero group, the Justice Guild of America, whose members are modeled on Golden Age versions of the Justice Society of America characters. Green Guardsman is an homage to the Golden Age Green Lantern. His power ring is unable to affect aluminum. The voice of the Green Guardsman is provided by William Katt. *The Justice League version of Stewart appeared in several episodes of Static Shock, both as a member of the League and in a solo appearance. Phil LaMarr reprises his Justice League role as Green Lantern, as well as providing the voice for Static. Kai-ro as appeared in Batman Beyond. *\\"The Call\\", a two-part episode of Batman Beyond, features a future Justice League that includes a Green Lantern who was an eight-year-old Asian child; he later appears as a young adult in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Epilogue\\".

Another nod takes place in the season seven episode, \\"Spartan\\", when Oliver's friend, John Diggle's stepfather's name is revealed as Roy Stewart (portrayed by Ernie Hudson). In the end of the series finale episode, \\"Fadeout\\", Diggle seemingly receives a power ring that falls from the sky. **In The Flash episode, \\"Rogue Air\\", the Flash himself mentions that Ferris Air shut down after one of their test pilots disappeared; alluding to Hal Jordan. In a later episode, \\"Welcome to Earth-2\\", the name \\"Hal\\" is seen on a list of contacts on a phone at Earth-2 Barry and Iris's home. **Alan Scott is mentioned in Legends of Tomorrow as the father of Obsidian (Todd Rice). **In the Elseworlds crossover event, Barry Allen of Earth-90 indicates that on his Earth, Diggle is a Green Lantern when he mistook Earth-1 Diggle for his version and asked him where his ring was. **During the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover event, footage from the film Green Lantern was used to establish the existence of the Green Lantern Corps within the universe of Earth-12. * A live-action Green Lantern TV series is currently in the works for the HBO Max streaming service, with Greg Berlanti and Geoff Johns producing and Seth Grahame-Smith will be serving as the showrunner and co-writer with Guggenheim.

It was the original location of León. It is the present location of the town of Puerto Momotombo in the Municipality of La Paz Centro of the Department of León. It is administered by the Instituto Nicaragüense de Cultura (Nicaraguan Institute of Culture). León Viejo was founded on June 15, 1524 by the Spanish conquistador, Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, who was decapitated at the town's Plaza Mayor (Main Square) in 1526 by governor Pedrarias Dávila, his Lieutenant. Settled by Spanish colonists, León Viejo originally had a native population of about 15,000 and it is located on the southwestern banks of Lago de Xolotlán or Lago de Managua (Lake Xolotlán or Managua), south of volcano Momotombo. The area suffered frequent volcanic activity, culminating in the earthquakes of 1594 and 1610. The city was not destroyed by the 1610 quake, however due to the damage caused to the infrastructure and the seismic activity, the settlers held a referendum and decided to relocate the city to its present location, about to the west. Nevertheless, the old city was gradually buried by the continuous expulsions of ash and volcanic stone coming from Momotombo, and by lake sediments. The ruins of León Viejo were discovered in 1967 and excavations begun the following year revealing that the city had a similar layout to other cities in America at that time, laid out on a grid system with a main square located at its center. León Viejo occupies an approximate area of 800 m x 500 m. Around the Plaza Mayor and on the surrounding streets, 16 ruins have been partially restored. The city had three monasteries: \\"La Merced\\", \\"San Pedro\\", and \\"San Francisco\\", which remained active until October, 1559. The ruins of La Merced and San Pedro have been identified, however they have been damaged by natural disasters over the years. In May, 1982 tropical storm Alleta wasted the walls of the city. In October, 1988 Hurricane Joan caused new damages to the ruins, and in October, 1998 Hurricane Mitch affected an estimated 40% of the site, damaging several houses, La Merced convent, and La Fortaleza. León Viejo is the only 16th-century, colonial city in America that has never suffered city-planning alterations during its history. This fact was the main argument in the request to the UNESCO when it was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000. History of local archaeology The conquistadores found the country occupied by numerous entrepreneurial towns busy on the practice of the arts and peaceful industries. Dr. Berendt, great explorer and scholar of aboriginal people of Central America, in the light of philological results obtained by himself and by American diplomat Ephraim George Squier (1849), as well as traditions preserved mainly by Oviedo, Torquemada and Herrera, believed that the Cholutecas, chorotegan, Dirianes and Orotinas were descendants of the people who migrated from Cholula, Mexico. These people occupied the greater part of the country from the Gulf of Fonseca to Nicoya, its territorial continuity interrupted near the current city of Leon by the Marabios, and again a by an Azteca colony occupying the narrowest part of the strip of land between the Pacific and the Lake of Nicaragua, and the islands of the Lake. The King and his latest national capital wore name Nicarao (Conference read before the American geographical society, July 10, 1876, by Dr. C. H. Berendt). The former inhabitants of this region left abundant relics of their civilization in burial mounds, cemeteries, etc.* In 1987 Elphidio Ortega, Advisor to the Organization of American States (OAS), conducted 14 stratigraphic wells on the, site contrary to previous researchers, he suggested that the colonial settlement was not located on the native site, but rather alongside a prehispanic town. Lourdes Dominguez, a Cuban national also made investigations in 12 wells, both outside the limit of some structures from which obtained more 1100 pieces of ceramic evidence. After her research, Dominguez proposed the theory that the ruins of León Viejo site were built on a prehispanic settlement, since the abundance of ceramics was enough evidence to make such a statement, this theory came into contradiction with Elphidio Ortega, who concluded that the colonial city was established along an indigenous settlements, but not over it.5° Anthropology Centoamerican Congress, Nicaragua National Museum, Archaeological Investigations performed in León Viejo, February 23, 2004. (Spanish) In 1996, Devora Ederman Cornavaca, postgraduate student at the University of California Los Angeles obtained permission from the Department of cultural heritage of the Nicaraguan Culture Institute (INC) to carry out excavations in León Viejo, aimed at studying the impact of the Spanish society on the native populations of the region. The first area that excavated was near current limits city, and found evidence of a possible smithy, the second excavation made was on an agricultural parcel limited south with León Viejo, in what is now part of the buffer zone of the site. Unfortunately the final results report of this research period has not been published. But Cornavaca, states that the Spanish settlement was located outside of the native town of the area. (Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America an Encyclopedia - Susan Toby Evans and David L. Webster. Pages: 401-402). Investigation The anthropological research Department of Nicaragua National Museum (MNN) conducted excavations and archaeological explorations in León Viejo, digging trenches 8 X 2 meters in width and length respectively, oriented north to south. Excavations recovered material consisted of: ceramic, porcelain, metal, wildlife remains and human remains. a fragment of a musical instrument, possibly a \\"flute\\" made from remains of a human humerus was found, associated to a set of prehispanic materials. E. Espinoza, in his article on \\"Shamanism\\" in prehispanic Nicaragua, points out that the German archaeologist G. Haberland., registered in a burial zone, a musical artifact associated with human remains that probably belonged to a shaman; hence it is inferred that this type of object is linked to a ritual or ceremony. In the cathedral a skull trepanation (surgical intervention) specimen was found, of a woman belonging to the prehispanic population. One of the few cases with this type of surgery (trepanation) recorded in the history of the Nicaraguan archaeology of. The abundance of pottery, stone artifacts as chalcedony, basalt, and fragments of prismatic knives (Obsidian), which was probably brought from different sources in the Central American region. This allows assumptions about forms of trade in prehispanic peoples. It is a coveted raw material in many great ancient cultures that used it for the production of domestic and ceremonial tools. =Funeral burials León Viejo= Found in the east sector of grid 3D, the first 20 cm, had previously been removed, this condition was observed in the next 40 cm, i.e. at the end of the second level. Morphologically the soil is a mixture of volcanic sand, clay and degraded of bedrock dirt geologically known as pumice, by which dirt takes a white color - yellowish and very soft texture. Due to the soil characteristics, it proved impossible to define the morphology of the burial, no special arrangements were observed, only that the head rested on small volcanic stones \\"Tufa\\". The burial is atypical, the skull is on the south side as if looking at Momotombo mountain, or perhaps the Lake, the position in which the individual was laid is not well defined, his right hand has the ulna - radius - in the chest and the right hand ulna - radius on the facial bones as if covering the face, metacarpal bones and phalanges are associated with the clavicle and left scapulae. It is possible that the burial may be an extended burial and corpse has been buried when the body became stiff which is why the hand is on the face. The skull has a hole at the top of the left parietal caused by circular trepanation or surgery which was practiced on the bone to cure some illness. Furthermore, a set of holes caused by osteoporosis was observed through an electronic magnifying glass, the operation was performed in the same region of the skull (Personal communication with Dr. Henry Guerzten, Pathology Professor at the University of Virginia, USA) The skeleton is quite complete and in acceptable preservation condition, according to biometric data obtained from the measurement of the skull bones ranges from 22 to 23 cm. and postcranial bones, the column including pelvis 55-56, femur 42, shinbone - fibula 34 cm, respectively, a height of between 1.50 and 155 was calculated approximately and bone anatomy infer that this is a young woman between 25 and 30 years of age, female. All dental parts are anatomically articulated and morphologically incisors teeth (spade-shaped) make us to infer that it is a specimen belonging to the Imabite people Chorotega indigenous population of the area. Over the pelvic region of the specimen a sacrum and coccyx and a lumbar vertebra were found, by the feet a package of bones was found that corresponds to the lower extremities, near the head found bone remains of bones belonging to the upper limbs of another individual, the perturbed human remains mixed seem to correspond to a mature adult, male. With regard to the interpretation of the cultural context of this funerary burial, the burial space is not on a main altar, but another area of burial, although this space is also considered a place privileged in the Church, it is difficult to infer whether the burial was disturbed when the different were stages of construction of the most important Spanish religious temple was erected in the city, but do not discard the possibility the corpse to retain his place and position. Archaeological evidence shows that there was disturbance of the human remains of other specimens, and not with the individual unearthed in grid 3D and was buried as looking at the volcano. If we talk about that it is an individual of the prehispanic population; then it is possible that the orientation of this person have some link with a ritual, a ceremonial act or a human sacrifice to honor one of their gods, the God of the mountain, the God of heights or the Momotombo volcano, prehispanic population feared these large volcanoes, but also paid tributes because they associated height to their gods, they believed that being in the highest places could come into contact with one of their gods. The team resorted to data on burials types recorded both in Europe and America: as noted by Goodwin (1945), burial rites are closely delimited by customs, and the position and orientation of the body can help show the distribution of a cultural group, both in space as time. Variations in type of burial that are associated with a given people can contribute to determining differences in beliefs and customs, although as noted Ucko (1969), the ethnographic interpretation of burials can be a risky affair. That there were considerable variations in the type of burial even in prehistoric times is something that has been left clearly exposed Marija (1956), but the interpretation is not always easy. The presence of stone artifacts is remarkable, as fragments of prismatic knives made of Obsidian (volcanic glass), reported chips of obsidian, chalcedony quartz, wildlife remains corresponding to small mammals, reptiles, birds and fish, part of these materials were associated with the human bones. Indigenous peoples that lived around the city, in what could have been the largest settlement around Imabite, with about 15 thousand people according to Oviedo. =Funerary Burials 2= This second burial was located between the southern profile grid (C - 1A) and north grid profile (C - 1B) the skeleton has the body and head tilted slightly to the northwest, with the feet below the first step of the altar. The burial was discovered below the human remains that correspond to the second Archbishop who arrived in Nicaragua in 1540 fray Francisco Mendavia, and was buried between 80 and 100 cm deep at the altar of the Cathedral. The bones under Mendavia tomb were found at between 160–180 cm depth, the specimen was buried with the head toward the west side and face toward where the sun rises or facing the altar, the skeleton was anatomically articulated in a stretched position with both arms parallel to the femur, this burial form is not a Christian habit, it is more associated with prehispanic burials. Human remains are: properly articulated skull, clavicles, shoulder, humor bone, dices - radius, femurs, ulna - fibulae, cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, pelvis and bones of both hands and feet. Biometric data from the specimen are as follows: skull 23 cm, left femur 44 cm, right tibia 36 cm and the column including the pelvis 55 cm, infer that the height of the individual range between 1.55 and 1.60 cm approximately. According to the biological characteristics of bones and teeth appear to correspond to an adult individual female, 30–35 years of age approximately. Most of the molars display a very marked wear that is typical of the prehispanic Nicaragua population, the upper molars are spent in the form of channel, attrition in the enamel and well-worn dental cusps, teeth of this specimen were compared with a collection of dental pieces belonging to archaeological excavations and indigenous people. Pathological problems were observed in two dental pieces, the molar inferior M1 on both sides have lesions caused by decay, by examination through an electronic magnifying observed a set of holes mainly in the proximal and distal parts of the long bones that were possibly affected by osteoporosis. =Archaeological artefacts recovered during excavations= During the excavation process several archaeological objects were found that corresponds to the pre-Hispanic period and a few to the colonial period, these artefacts were developed with different types of raw material, for example: lithic, human bones, clay, metal etc. The material have been systematically controlled and with great scientific rigor. Fishing net artefacts made with fragments of pottery negative Usulután and oval shape, long 5.5 cm, level 6, depth 1.20 cm. C - 3D. Weight for fishing nets, one has circular measure 3.3 cm diameter and 5 cm wide and oval shaped fragment. Level 3, depth of 40–60 cm. C - 3 c. C - grid-2 level 1 c, a device was recorded with elaborate tip with red ceramic. =Pre-hispanic ceramic= The specimens found consists of 2239 ceramic remains, that include, monochrome ceramic, Lago Negro modeling, Red slip ware, Castle Esgrafiado, Sacasa striated, Managua Polychrome, Leo Punteado, Vallejo Polychrome, Usulután negative, colonial associated to Perulera and unclassified Perulera ceramic. Within the material recorded during the excavation found a total of 17 ceramic monochromatic vessels with fabric impressions, they were distributed in the excavation. Notes: The domestic pottery type monochrome vessels were examined through a magnifying glass and with X 40 Power. The test allowed to observe tissue impressions, noting that the printed fabric are different dimensions, i.e. size and shape, inferring that the cloth was of different thickness. Waste coal was observed and vegetal remains in clay, in some fragments could see varied pigmentation probably due to the temperature at which the utensils were used or the use in the kitchen. Ceramic vessels have been recorded with tissue impressions in the Managua area during the \\"Archaeology of the Managua Metropolitan area\\" project (Lange 1996, down: 43). Test # 1: This probe test discovered an architectural well-shaped structure, consists of a hole of about a meter in diameter and was discovered at about 40 to 50 cm, depth. The discovered structure in the north wall of the building and in the surface part before the beginning of its circular shape, is made up of descendant levels in the form of steps, subsequently the well diameter enlarges as the depth increases. The structure was built on the rock or \\"matrix\\" known as pumice stone and was excavated to a depth of 2.30 m, it was undefined. The structure was not morphologically defined and is not known what its purpose was; to clarify these aspects further excavations must be made. Lithic artifacts: Obsidian: the analysis was conducted on 175 artifacts recovered in the excavation at the main altar of the Cathedral ruins. The analytic process took into account technological morphology features, based on the quality of the material. As the sample did not have a large diversity of types and waste, the artifacts were classified into three basic categories: core fragments, chips and knives. The categories based on the stone tools are: tip points, knives, scrapers, axes, metates and grinding stone or pestle. Knives: These are chips that have a length double than the width and parallel side edges. They are considered to be a superior cutting tool and associated with more complex sociocultural levels. The prismatic razors represent the technological apogee of implements because there are many complicated steps to make them (Finlayson in Lange, 1996. Page: 139). A total 83 artifacts or prismatic knives were found, of which 50 seem to have been manufactured with raw materials from Ixtepeque Guatemala. 26 artifacts or fragments were identified as likely to have been manufactured with raw materials from the Chayal, El Salvador. 6 of the objects were possible manufactured with raw materials from the Guinope, Honduras. And one artifact is of undetermined origin. From the lithic waste (chips) 31 fragments were recorded of which 11 appear to be from Ixtepeque, Guatemala; 8 chips might come from the Chayal, El Salvador, and 12 chips seem to be raw material brought from Guinope, Honduras. Quartz: A fragment was registered in the upper part of an archaeological artifact with anthropomorphic motifs, only displays a part of a face with one of his eyes, made with gray grey. The totals of quartz stone remains collected are 13, of which 3 were considered as fragments of possible artifacts and 10 are waste (chips). Chalcedony: two items of this material were found, a complete spearhead with stalk, leaf shaped: measuring 3,8 cm long, wide on the proximal part 0,5 cm., 0,6 cm on the medial side and 0.1 to 0.2 cm, distal part. A leaf shaped arrowhead with its peduncle designed as if to be assembled on a wooden handle or other materials; the dimensions are: length 2.5 cm, width at proximal 0.6 cm, the medial part 0.8 cm, and distal part 0.2 cm. This object is considered one of the most complete, well manufactured and defined, presents an excellent preservation state in its morphology; although some wear was noted in both sides, by which it is inferred that the cutting edge and its functional tips were used. This artifact is considered as a hunting weapon for smaller animals or determined for a more delicate and specific activity, its quality, design and finish allow inferring that it was made by people specialized in this type of tools. It was found with remains of pottery, animal and human prehispanic remains. Lithic summary: 175 Lithic fragments were recovered and were classified as follows: 92 are considered as artifact fragments, 77 waste or chips, 4 core residues, 2 green stone residues. Two (2) of these instruments by its excellent condition were identified in the complete artifacts (material chalcedony) category, and as a result of importance, is the greater frequency of artifacts (fragments) of Obsidian prismatic knives (83), probably made with raw material from different sources in the Central America region. This allows an interpretation about trade, the exchange of raw materials or objects, which developed between the prehispanic settlements that inhabited the area of León Viejo (Imabite) and other towns of Central America. Metal: A metal sample consists of a number of nails and fragments (63) of different shapes and size, pins (4), and undetermined metal residue. All these objects have evidence of rotten wood and decomposition (oxidation) evidence. There was a piece of metal shaped as a \\"key\\" 4.7 cm long. Remains of animals at the main altar of the Cathedral The total animal samples in quantitative terms are very small, but even so, remains of several specimens were collected that provide valuable information to the research. The animal remains collected in the excavation were separated in the most accepted taxonomic order: mollusks (47), fish (53), reptiles (21), amphibians (2), birds (37), and mammals (287). =Hypotheses on the burials= The city of León de Imabite, known today as León Viejo, has been dated from the initial European contact (1522–1524) up to its abandonment in 1610. Archives information suggests the fact that in this area there was human occupation and was used as an Imabite native burial area. For example, seven (7) funeral burials unearthed at the main altar presented anthropological evidence and characteristic features of prehispanic burials. Furthermore, 4 unearthed specimens are below the soil of the Spanish occupation, that according to the stratigraphic geomorphology are registered at a depth ranging from .60 to 1.80 m. and one of burials was found in a funeral urn with animal remains inside. Unfortunately, many of the skeletons were disturbed and were destroyed by diverse vandalism actions which have limited anthropological results. This also had the effect that human remains of several specimens appear scattered and intermingled with other materials during the investigation. Incisors (teeth) that are present among human osteology remains are spade shaped. This feature has a high frequency in the native populations and low frequency between most of the European population (Ubelaker, 1994: 26). The anthropological biometric data of skulls, jaws and teeth of these specimens is evidence that they belong to the native population of the area. The presence of cultural materials totally predominant by prehispanic artifacts; such as 84 fragments of obsidian prismatic knives, weapons with well-defined carving (arrow), polychrome Managua type ceramic, monochrome ceramic, ceramic vessels with fabric impressions and wildlife remains, among others, are tangible evidence of the site occupation before the Spaniards arrival. unearthed and exhumed human remains during four field seasons carried out in Leon Viejo on the three most important religious structures of colonial times, such as the Convent, Church and Cathedral de la Merced, the specimens are distributed between 11, 25 and 31 respectively, it was possible to determine the ontological remains of 67 individuals among men, women and children of different ages. Include Spaniards remains, between rulers and Viceroyalty religious. Interpretation of Disperse Human Remains These unearthed human remains specimens do not come from tombs or funeral burials, (osteology material disturbed by vandalism). During the excavation process a total of 25 burial were discovered of which most had articulated human bones and in some cases in packages of disjointed bones and skulls but feasible to locate anatomically. The characteristics of these specimens, do not allow origin determination. It was possible to diagnose pathological problems in some specimens mainly at dental level. In addition to the skeleton, considered most complete; a large number of human bone remains fragments were found scattered in the excavation, there is no specific origin, but it was possible to identify and associate with biological elements that allow inferring that they correspond to 5 male individuals, skeletal fractions that possibly belonged to 23 specimens of undetermined gender and 4 infants of different ages, all of which add to 32 individuals. =Conclusion= Based on laboratory tests performed on remnants with osteology emphasis is easy to determine the archaeological remains that predominate in the specimens come from prehispanic social groups inhabiting the place; while considering the burials found cultural historical importance Another element that provides important data are the animal remains found associated with other cultural evidence. It is possible to assume the human consumption of different species belonging to zoological groups: such as large and small mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and mollusks. These records allow speculation on the ecosystems that existed in the area and therefore the possible diet of the inhabitants of the region during prehispanic and historical times. In parallel to these studies, obtained a range of data related to architectural aspects and constructive systems of structures affected by the investigation. The presence of cultural materials belonging to the early colonial period in the site, in relation to utensils is almost zero, the sample is reduced to a few nail fragments from coffins and probably iron remains and nails used in the construction of buildings. Archaeological records allow assuming that there are different chronologies for the León Viejo site. In considering results, conclusions and assumptions of research preceding ours, it is considered that archeologist Lourdes Dominguez conclusions, somehow match the results of the current research, in that the Spaniards built their buildings on cultural deposits or a settlement that belonged to the prehispanic population of the place. Not preclude the possibility that the Spaniards constructed and imposed their religious temple on a site where native population gathered and perhaps the main plaza of the native communities in the area.

He was born into a family of poets and storytellers, which included his brothers Séamus Ó Grianna and Seán Bán Mac Grianna, in Ranafast, County Donegal, at a time of linguistic and cultural change. Mac Grianna is the most high-profile modern writer in Ulster Irish. Education and early activities Seosamh was born to Feidhlimidh Mac Grianna and Máire Eibhlín Néillín Ní Dhomhnaill. He was educated at St Eunan's College, Letterkenny, and St Columb's College in Derry. He trained as a teacher in St Patrick's College, Dublin, from which he graduated in 1921. He became involved in the Irish war of independence, and in the civil war was interned as a republican by the pro-treaty government for fifteen months. He began a teaching career but, with his poetic and independent character, soon discovered that his vocation did not lie there. Creative career Mac Grianna started writing in the early 1920s, and his creative period lasted some fifteen years. He wrote essays, short stories, travel and historical works, a famous autobiography, Mo Bhealach Féin, and a novel, as well as translating many books. He was imbued with a strong, oral traditional culture from his childhood, and this permeated his writings, particularly in the early years. Latter career and death Towards the end of his career, Mac Grianna grew increasingly analytical and critical as he examined the changing face of the Irish-speaking districts and the emergence of an Anglicised Ireland with no loyalty to, or sympathy with, a heroic and cultured past. He was probably the greatest Gaeltacht writer of his time, whose work had developed considerably before he was stricken by a severe depressive psychosis in 1935. In 1959 his wife committed suicide and his son, Fionn, drowned in Dublin Bay. That same year he admitted himself to St Conal's Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny, where he stayed for most of the next 31 years. He died in 1990.SEARC'S WEB GUIDE – Seosamh MacGrianna (1900–1990) In 2016, BBC Two Northern Ireland broadcast a documentary entitled Ar Mo Bhealach Féin in which Seán Mac Labhraí retraced the steps of Seosamh Mac Grianna and his 300-mile journey through Wales.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries. Fuchsia, a steam tug, was built in 1863 by Fincourt, New York City; purchased by the Navy 16 June 1863; and commissioned in August 1863, Acting Master W. T. Street in command. Construction, acquisition, and commissioning During the later stages of the Taiping Rebellion, Shanghai local authorities contracted Henry Gamaliel Ward, brother of American mercenary Frederick Townsend Ward who had died in combat fighting for the Qing Dynasty earlier, to purchase 5 steamers. Henry Ward ordered the constructions of 3 steamers, one of them being Kiang Soo (), the other two being Dai Ching (later USS Dai Ching) and Chih Kiang (later USS Tulip). Instead of delivering the steamers to China, Ward re-sold them to the Union Navy. Kiang Soo was purchased on 22 June 1863 and renamed Fuchsia in August.*  Assigned to the Potomac River Flotilla  Fuchsia reached Washington Navy Yard 8 August 1863 to join the Potomac Flotilla in patrol duty on the Potomac, Rappahannock, Piankatank, Tappahannock, Curitoman, and St. Mary's Rivers. On 21 October, sailing with , Fuchsia apprehended the steamer Three Brothers, sailing unladen without proper papers. Nine days later, as she cruised in the Rappahannock, she sent a landing party ashore to arrest two men known to be blockade runners, and the next day she took a Virginia soldier prisoner.  Search and destroy missions  On 7 March 1864, Fuchsia made a foray up the Piankatank, searching for the Army tug Titan previously taken by the Confederates. Finding the tug burned to the water's edge, she sent men to disable the tug's boilers, preventing their future use by the Confederates. Similar reconnaissance and patrol duty, in the course of which she often fired on Confederate detachments ashore and in turn came under fire, continued throughout the war.  End-of-war decommissioning and sale  Fuchsia cruised the same waters until decommissioned at Washington, D.C., 5 August 1865. She was sold 23 September 1865 to Russell & Company for $11,000 USD.

South Africa is part of the IBSA Dialogue Forum, alongside Brazil and India. History During the latter years of the apartheid era, South African companies made several investments in Brazil. However, while Brazil developed relations with the former Portuguese colonies of Africa, it didn't cultivate a strong relationship with the apartheid-era government, and instead developed ties with the allies of such anti-apartheid organizations such as ANC and SWAPO. After South Africa held its first non-racial elections in 1994, president Fernando Henrique Cardoso became the first Brazilian head of state to visit South Africa in 1996. Relations developed quickly between the two countries, especially after the election of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as president in 2002. Lula's government has developed strong ties with Thabo Mbeki's government in South Africa, particular in the areas of AIDS/HIV, fair trade, reform in the United Nations Security Council, land reform, and other socio-economic issues.

It consists of a constellation of satellites, usually in molniya orbits, designated under the Kosmos system. The satellites are built by the company NPO Lavochkin and are launched on Molniya-M rockets. Oko can be directly translated as the Russian word for eye. As of June 2014, only two of the eight satellites in orbit were still functional, rendering the system inoperable.  History  US-K are the first generation of Oko satellites, the first of which was launched in 1972. The vast majority of the satellites launched (86 out of 100 as of March 2012 ) have been US-K satellites in molniya orbits. Seven first generation satellites were launched into geosynchronous orbits, called US-KS, starting in 1975. A decree of 3 September 1979 led to the creation of the second generation satellites US-KMO which had their first launch in 1991. In total, 101 satellites have been launched. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the rate of launches decreased, but Russia remained committed to the programme. A fully functioning constellation with 5 satellites was restored in 2001, but a fire in May 2001 in the Oko control facility at Serpukhov-15 near Kurilovo outside Moscow reduced the number of operational satellites to 2. A further satellite was launched in the same year. Between 2002 and 2006, there were no Oko launches, until another Oko satellite, designated Kosmos 2422, was launched in July 2006. In 2006, Russia had one operational US-KMO (Kosmos 2379) satellite and four US-K satellites (Kosmos 2422, Kosmos 2393, Kosmos 2351, Kosmos 2368). In June 2011, Kosmos 2422, Kosmos 2430, Kosmos 2446 and Kosmos 2469 were reported to be the only operational satellites. Ground track of Kosmos 2469  Satellites  The Oko satellites are drum-shaped, 2 metres long and with a diameter of 1.7 m. They weigh 1,250 kilograms without fuel and 2,400 kilograms when fully loaded. They have a 350 kg infrared telescope pointing toward Earth, with a 4 m conical sunshield and an instrument bus. The telescope, which is the satellites' main instrument, is able to detect radiation from ascending missiles. Two solar panels provide a total of 2.8 kW of power. There are also several smaller, wider-angle telescopes to supplement the main instrument. The satellites have 16 liquid fuel engines for attitude control and 4 for maneuvering. The system requires at least 4 satellites to be fully functional. The danger of false alarms increases when there are fewer than 4 satellites in orbit, due to the inability to double-check a detection. However, this risk is reduced by the presence of the US-KMO geosynchronous satellites. The satellites are built by NPO Lavochkin and launched with Molniya-M rockets. The advantages of Oko include that the system is reliable and well-established, and that it uses the relatively inexpensive (but now discontinued) Molniya launcher. The last US-K satellite (Kosmos 2469) was launched on 30 September 2010. As of December 2015, the entire Oko programme is being replaced by the new EKS system.

There were two pylons, one behind the other and, beyond them, there was a double cave sanctuary, the underground chambers of which were marked with mounds on the surface. These mounds of earth probably functioned as 'primeval mounds'. During the Middle Kingdom's 12th Dynasty, the old temple was completely rebuilt on a bigger scale.

It was directed by Nathan Rissman and written, narrated, and produced by Madonna through her production company Semtex Films. The film premiered at the 7th annual Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, on April 24, 2008 and at the 61st annual Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France on May 21, 2008. The film also headlined the 2008 Traverse City Film Festival. On December 1, 2008, it premiered in the U.S. on the Sundance Channel for World AIDS Day. On March 26, 2009, the film was uploaded by Madonna's team onto YouTube and Hulu for free viewing. The film won the VH1 Do Something Docu Style Award in 2010. Film The film documents the lives of orphans in Malawi, where an estimated 500,000 children have lost parents to HIV and AIDS. Many of these children live on the streets. The film also shows the efforts with Madonna's charitable organisation Raising Malawi in helping with improving their lives and conditions. Madonna said about the film: \\"To say that this film is a labor of love is trivial. It's also the journey of a lifetime. I hope you all are as inspired watching it as I was making it.\\" The film, released in 2008, was described by long-time friend Rosie O'Donnell as \\"devastating and amazing.\\" Both Madonna and O'Donnell attended a private screening on October 11, 2007. Book A companion book containing 180 pages with 106 duotone and 44 four-color photographs taken during the visit, as well as stills from the video was released in January 2009. Author proceeds from the sale of the book were to be donated to the charitable organization Raising Malawi for their extensive work with orphans throughout Malawi. *Released: January 2009 *Photographer: Kristen Ashburn, with foreword by Madonna *Publisher: PowerHouse Title The title is derived from former Archbishop of Cape Town and anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu's speech regarding the African philosophy of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is an idea present in African spirituality that says \\"I am because we are\\", or we are all connected, we cannot be ourselves without community, health and faith are always lived out among others, an individual's well being is caught up in the well being of others. In Malawi, this African philosophy is known as \\"uMunthu\\". In Chichewa, it is kali kokha nkanyama, tili awiri ntiwanthu (when you are on your own you are as good as an animal of the wild; when there are two of you, you form a community).” Reception Nathan Rissman and Madonna at the film's premiere The film received positive reviews in the media. The Times, giving it 4 out of 5 stars, wrote: \\"This rich material makes for a completely absorbing film. Certain scenes, such as women and children literally dying of AIDS in front of the camera, drew gasps from the shocked audience in the screening room at Cannes. It's impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Not that the film portrays Malawian people as innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control. Rissman doesn't shy away from the culture of drinking, crime and violence that is prevalent in the country. Together, he and Madonna have made a shocking and incredibly moving film that is much more than an extended Comic Relief appeal.\\" A news article in The Guardian said, \\"Madonna the documentary-maker came, saw and conquered the world's biggest film festival yesterday with a powerful polemic on the effects of disease and poverty on Malawi...The queen of reinvention presented her film, I Am Because We Are, which she wrote and produced, to general acclaim. Alongside her was her former gardener Nathan Rissman, who directed.\\" The film was shown at the 2008 Traverse City Film Festival, held from July 29 to August 3. Michael Moore, who founded the festival, said in May 2008 about the film: \\"I saw her film a month ago and was so deeply moved in a way that rarely happens with movies these days. I asked her immediately if she would come to our festival and she said, \\"yes.\\" I have known her for years and she is truly one of the most caring and generous people I have met. Her presence here in Traverse City will have a profound impact on people.\\" In the fall of 2008, Madonna released a video message announcing plans to build a school in Malawi, the Raising Malawi Academy for Girls.

Thirty-seven Malacothamnus taxa have been described, but circumscriptions of many taxa are controversial due to overlapping morphological variation and limited analyses. At one extreme, Thomas Kearney recognized 28 taxa.Kearney, T. H. 1951. “The Genus Malacothamnus, Greene (Malvaceae).” Leaflets of Western Botany VI (6):113–40.Kearney, T. H. 1955. “Notes on Malvaceae VII: A New Variety in Malacothamnus.” Leaflets of Western Botany VII (12):289–90. At the other extreme, David Bates who wrote the 1993 Jepson Manual and the Flora of North America treatments recognized only 11.Bates, D. M. 1993. “Malacothamnus.” In The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California, edited by James C. Hickman, 751–754. Berkeley: University of California Press.Bates, D. M. 2015. “Malacothamnus.” In Flora of North America North of Mexico, edited by Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 6:280–85. New York and Oxford. A more recent researcher of Malacothamnus, Tracey Slotta, recognized 17 taxa, reviving two species and four varieties subsumed by Bates.Slotta, T. 2004. “Phylogenetics of the Malacothamnus Alliance (Malvaceae): Assessing the Role of Hybridization and Molecular and Morphological Variation in Species Delineation.” Ph.D. dissertation, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.Slotta, T. 2012.

Mihály Cseszneky was appointed chief-lieutenant to the Castle of Várpalota in 1559, after he and Balázs Baranyai had liberated several villages under Ottoman occupation in the southern part of Veszprém and Fejér counties. For his merits King Ferdinand I donated him the villages of Bakonynána, Dudar, Káloz, Láng, Aba and Felegres. Being the right-hand of castellan György Thury, in 1566 he played an important role in the defense of the castle of Várpalota with 450-500 Hungarian warriors against the 7000-8000 Turkish soldiers of Arslan, Pasha of Buda. Under the leadership of castellan Thury and chief-lieutenant Cseszneky the defenders successfully withstood the siege until Count Salm's relief troops arrived from Győr. Then the warriors of Várpalota helped Salm to reconquer Veszprém and Tata. Despite being acknowledged as a hero, Count Cseszneky did not receive enough money from the royal treasury for the maintenance of the castle of Várpalota, thus he was compelled to raise funds by making forays against the Ottomans, and sometimes holding the local people to ransom. In 1588 the villagers of the region complained to Ferenc Nádasdy, the \\"Black Beg\\" about Cseszneky. Nevertheless, his behavior was not exceptional at that time, and there was no other means to manage the defense of the castle and the peasants against the Turkish attacks.

He started publishing in 1952. Many of his early papers are concerned with the study of Whitehead products and their behaviour under suspension and more generally with the (unstable) homotopy groups of spheres. In a 1957 paper he showed the first non-existence result for the Hopf invariant 1 problem. This period of his work culminated in his book Composition methods in homotopy groups of spheres (1962). Here he uses as important tools the Toda bracket (which he calls the toric construction) and the Toda fibration, among others, to compute the first 20 nontrivial homotopy groups for each sphere. Among his most important contributions to stable homotopy theory is his work on the existence and non-existence of so-called Toda–Smith complexes. These are finite complexes which can be characterized as having a particularly simple ordinary homology (as modules over the Steenrod algebra) or, alternatively, by having a particularly simple BP-homology. They can be used to construct the Greek letter infinite families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. In his paper On spectra realizing exterior parts of the Steenrod algebra (1971), Toda deduced several existence and non-existence results on these complexes. The existence parts are still unsurpassed. Toda did also important work on the algebraic topology of (exceptional) Lie groups.

The Bulgarian government sent the archaeologist Karel Škorpil to organize excavations. The artifacts were later researched by the archaeologist Bogdan Filov.

Listed at and , he batted and threw right-handed. Biography Marshall played in the minor leagues from 1937 to 1942 and from 1946 to 1952. He served in the United States Army from June 1943 through October 1945. In 13 minor league seasons, he appeared in 1057 games, compiling a .240 batting average with 38 home runs and at least 155 RBIs. While predominantly a catcher, he also played 46 games as a second baseman in 1942. Marshall's lone major league appearance came with the St. Louis Cardinals on June 14, 1941, in a home game against Brooklyn Dodgers played at Sportsman's Park. With the Cardinals losing in the eighth inning, 12–5, Marshall entered the game as a pinch runner, replacing fellow catcher Gus Mancuso, who had just reached first base on a fielder's choice. Marshall did not advance, as the next two batters made outs, ending the inning. Marshall stayed in the game defensively for the top of the ninth inning, handling relief pitcher Ira Hutchinson. In an uneventful inning, Marshall made one putout, retiring batter Jimmy Wasdell. The Cardinals did not score in the bottom of the ninth, and Marshall did not have a plate appearance. As this was his only major league appearance, he holds a career 1.000 fielding average in MLB. Born in Wilmington, Delaware, Marshall worked for the United States Postal Service after his professional baseball career, retiring in 1983. He was a coach for Babe Ruth League baseball for 18 years, and was a 1982 inductee of the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame. Marshall was married and had one daughter. He died in his home city in 2007, aged 87, and was interred there.

Origin  The story of Syamantaka appears in the Vishnu Purana and the Bhagavata. The jewel originally belonged to the Sun god, who wore it around his neck. It was said that whichever land possessed this jewel would never encounter any calamities such as droughts, floods, earthquakes or famines, and would always be full of prosperity and plenitude. Wherever the jewel remained, it would produce for the keeper eight bhāras of gold daily. (\\"Four rice grains are called one guñjā; five guñjās, one paṇa; eight paṇas, one karṣa; four karṣas, one pala; and one hundred palas, one tulā. Twenty tulās make up one bhāra.\\") Since there are about 3,700 grains of rice in an ounce, the Syamantaka jewel was producing approximately 170 pounds of gold every day. It was also the source of the dazzling appearance of the Sun god.  A gift from the Sun God  On one occasion Satrajit, a Yadava nobleman, and a devotee of Surya, the Sun God, was walking along the sea shore, praying ardently, when the god himself appeared before him. Seeing the god in an indistinct and dazzling fiery shape, Satrájit asked him to appear in a less blinding form, so that he could see him clearly. For this, the Sun God took the Syamantaka jewel off his neck, and Satrájit saw him of a dwarfish stature, with a body like burnished copper, and with slightly reddish eyes. Having offered his adorations, the Sun God offered him a boon, and he asked for the jewel. When Satrájit returned to Dwarka with the jewel, people mistook him for the Sun God, such was his dazzling glory that even Krishna asked him to present the jewel to Ugrasena, the supreme leader of the Yadavas, but Satrájit did not comply.  Theft and recovery  Satrajit and Prasena with the Symantaka Mani Satrajit later presented it to Prasen, his brother, who was also the ruler of a Yadava province. Prasen wore it often, until once while hunting in the forest while wearing it, he was attacked by a lion, which killed him and fled with the jewel. But it couldn't get away with it, for shortly after, it was attacked by Jambavant, described as king of the 'bears' or 'gorillas' according to different scriptures, who killed it after a fierce fight and took off with the bounty. Jambavant was loyal to Rama, and was considered one of the seven immortals or Chiranjeevi. Now there was a rumour that Lord Krishna also had an eye on the Syamantaka jewel and when the incident of Prasen's mysterious disappearance became public, the people accused Krishna of murder and theft. In order to prove his innocence, Krishna sought to find out the true culprit and recover the jewel. As he followed on the trail of the deceased Prasen, he came to the spot where the corpses of Prasen and his horse still lay, along with pieces of teeth and nails of a lion. From there he followed the footsteps of the lion, which led him to the spot of the second struggle, where the corpse of the lion was lying. From there, he followed the tracks of a bear, which finally led him to the entrance of Jambavan's cave, where the latter's children were playing with the priceless jewel. Thereafter, he engaged in furious, protracted combat with Jambavan for 28 days, and Jambavan gradually grew tired. As he was the strongest living entity at that time, he wondered who could be weakening him. It was then that Jambavan realized that he had been sparring with none other than Sri Rama himself. Jambavan, who was hot- headed but pious by nature, returned the jewel to Krishna, who later married Jambavati, Jambavan's daughter.  Krishna's marriage to Satyabhama  Meanwhile Krishna's companions, having waited twelve days for Krishna to come out of the cave, returned to Dwaraka despondent. All of Krishna's friends and family members became extremely sorrowful and began regularly worshiping Goddess Laxmi to assure the Lord's safe return. Even as they performed this worship, Krishna entered the city in the company of His new wife. He summoned Satrajit to the royal assembly and, after recounting to him the entire story of the Syamantaka jewel's recovery, gave the jewel back to him. Satrajit accepted the jewel, but with great shame and remorse. He went back to his home, and there he decided to offer Lord Krishna not only the jewel but also his daughter Satyabhama, so as to atone for the offense he had committed against the Lord's lotus feet. Sri Krishna accepted the hand of Satrajit's daughter, Satyabhama, who was endowed with all divine qualities. But he refused the jewel, returning it to King Satrajit.  Deaths of Satrajit and Satadhanwa  Krishna on horseback After a few days, Krishna and Balarama were off to Hastinapura after there were rumours that the Pandavas have been burnt to their deaths in a fire. Kritavarma, Akrura and Satadhanwa, who had their eyes on the dazzling jewel, conspired to make use of Krishna's absence from Dwaraka as an opportunity. Satadhanva one night entered the house of Satrajit and killed him in his sleep, making off with the jewel. A sorrowful Satyabhama rushed to Hastinapura to inform Krishna about the ghastly death of her father. Krishna and Balarama immediately started for Dwaraka to avenge Satrajit's death, hearing of which Satadhanwa fled on his horse, keeping the jewel with Akrura. He was chased down by Krishna and Balaram and finally killed by Krishna near Mithila. Later Krishna returned to Dwaraka, and upon realizing that Akrura had already fled to Kashi with the Syamantaka jewel, summoned him up, and asked him to admit his guilt. When Akrura complied, Krishna let him keep it, on the condition that it was to remain in the city of Dwaraka.  Identification Theories  The Puranas or the Mahabharata do not say what happens to the gem after Krishna leaves the material world. There has been many attempts in identifying the true jewel and its existence in the modern Indian society. However, some speculate that the legendary Syamantaka Mani might be in fact the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond, which was known to have been in the possession of the Mughal emperors of India, followed by the Sikh empire, and currently one of the Crown Jewels of England under the current monarch queen elizabeth ii. Whether the Syamantaka Gem is actually the Koh-i- Noor diamond is unknown. The Koh-i-Noor, of course, does not match the superlative descriptions of the Syamantaka, and considerable poetic license would have to be assumed. Srīmad-Bhāgavatam (Bhāgavata Purāṇa) (SB10.34.30) Lord Govinda chased the demon wherever he ran, eager to take his crest jewel. Meanwhile Lord Balarāma stayed with the women to protect them. (SB10.34.31) The mighty Lord overtook Śaṅkhacūḍa from a great distance as if from nearby, my dear King, and then with His fist the Lord removed the wicked demon’s head, together with his crest jewel. (SB10.34.32) Having thus killed the demon Śaṅkhacūḍa and taken away his shining jewel, Lord Kṛṣṇa gave it to His elder brother with great satisfaction as the gopīs watched. (SB10.56.45) The Supreme Personality of Godhead told Satrājit: We do not care to take this jewel back, O King. You are the sun-god’s devotee, so let it stay in your possession. Thus We will also enjoy its benefits. Syamantaka Ruby or Shyamantaka Blue Sapphire? A common mistake of spelling it wrongly as \\"Shyamantaka\\" has led to the incorrect idea that Syamantaka was a sapphire (Saturn's gem). Also according to Jyotish or Planetary Gemology, Ruby is the gem of the Sun in the Navaratna. Two verses from the Bhagavat Purana, which describe Satrajit wearing the gem given to him by Surya, the Sungod show that Syamantaka is a ruby. :“Wearing the jewel on his neck, Satrajit entered Dwaraka. He shone as brightly as the sun itself, O King, and thus he went unrecognized because of the jewel's effulgence”. – Ref. SB 10.56.4 :“As the people looked at Satrajit from a distance, his brilliance blinded them. They presumed he was the sun- god, Surya”. – Ref. SB 10.56.5 The evidence and logic indicate that Syamantaka was a ruby.

It is assigned to the Tenth Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and is stationed at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. The group's mission is to provide theater and Air Force commanders with trained aircrews and maintenance personnel and systems for airborne surveillance, warning and control of U.S. and allied military aircraft. The 513th is an associate unit of the 552d Air Control Wing, Air Combat Command (ACC) and if mobilized, the group is gained by ACC. Its World War II predecessor, the 3d Combat Cargo Group was a United States Army Air Forces combat organization. It served primarily in the China Burma India Theater and Pacific Ocean Theater of World War II. In 1948, the group was redesignated as the 513th Troop Carrier Group. History An E-3 Sentry airborne warning and control system aircraft breaks away from a Mississippi Air National Guard KC-135 Stratotanker during a presidential support mission to Argentina Constituted and activated in India in 1944. Supported ground forces during the battle for northern Burma and the subsequent Allied drive southward. Flew Allied troops and materiel to the front, transporting gasoline, oil, vehicles, engineering and signal equipment, and other items that the group either landed or dropped in Burma. Also evacuated wounded personnel to India. Moved to Burma in June 1945. After the liberation of Burma, the group hauled critical supplies such as gasoline to China. From late 1945, it continued airlift missions as needed in China until April 1946 when inactivated. Redesignated 513th Troop Carrier Group (Special). Activated in Germany on 19 November 1948. Assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe. Using C-54's, transported food, coal, and other supplies during the Berlin airlift, Operation Vittles. Inactivated in Germany in October 1949. Activated in the continental United States on 8 November 1955. Assigned to Tactical Air Command and equipped with C-123 aircraft. From November 1955 to November 1958, participated in numerous tactical exercises and operations, including troop drops and airlift in support of construction of the Distant Early Warning Line stations in the Canadian Arctic regions. An E-3 Sentry lands here on the Tinker runway on 23 March 2007, after completing one of the many missions done by the aircraft since its arrival at Tinker 30 years ago From April 1966 to January 1976, the group provided intra-theater airlift in support of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, U.S. European Command, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization operations and exercises, using C-130s and crews rotating to Europe from Tactical Air Command and Military Airlift Command wings based in the United States and C-124s and crews from Air Force Reserve groups. It maintained and operated EC-135s as an airborne command post and acted as host organization for American units at RAF Mildenhall until February 1992. In addition, the group collected samples from the atmosphere for the purpose of detecting and identifying nuclear explosions. In March 1996 the Air Force re-activated the 513th Air Control Group (513th ACG) as an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Reserve associate command and control unit in concert with active-duty Airmen. It was intended to help offset the effects of growing mission requirements on the 552 ACW.John Pulley (Staff writer), 'Air Force Snapshot: 513th Air Control Group, Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.', Air Force Times, 30 November 1998, p. 32 From March 1996 to April 1997, the group was assigned to the U.S. Air Force Reserve's 507th Air Refueling Wing. It took part in worldwide contingency operations and counter-drug missions. In 1997, the group was reassigned under the command of the active duty 552nd Air Control Wing, while remaining a part of the Air Force Reserve. It is currently the only reserve unit to fly the Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. By November 1998, Air Force Times reported that '..the 513th is in the final stages of a 2 1/2-year activation plan. Staffing is expected to increase by about 75 more people by fall 1999. Once that happens, officials expect the Reservists to perform 11 percent of aircrew duties on the 552nd's AWACS and fly 5 percent of sorties. Flight hours are expected to increase to 740 by the end of fiscal 1999.' The 513th ACG's subordinate units include the 970th Airborne Air Control Squadron, the 513th Operations Support Squadron, the 513th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron and the 513th Maintenance Squadron. The current commander, Col. Laurie Dickson who took office January, 2018 is the first female commander of the 513th ACG. The Air Force's fiscal year 2015 budget request called for the inactivation of the 513th ACG and the retirement of seven E-3 Sentries. The House Armed Services Committee passed an amenedment in May 2014 to block the inactivation of the group and save three aircraft which were intended to be retired.

It is located in Ulster Park, about from Kingston, New York. This haunted attraction covers and includes a hay ride, corn maze, and five haunted houses. Background The hayride opened for the Halloween season in 1992, stemming from a disguise business Michael Jubie developed during his time as an undercover police officer, as well as the couple's love of Halloween. As of 2015 it featured twelve distinct attractions and employed over 350 people during the season. Headless Horseman Hayrides and Haunted Houses is located on a , 200-year-old farm. Attractions =Hayride= Storyteller dressing to guide wagon riders on the hayridePatrons are first taken on a hay ride on a wagon which holds 25–30 customers. Customers are given ample opportunity to be scared by actors during the trip, which is facilitated by a \\"storyteller,\\" another actor who is on the wagon for the ride. Each year the hayride has a different theme, and the storyteller narrates the tale, interacts with other characters, and sets the mood for customers. The veteran actors along the trail attend regular acting classes to sharpen their scaring skills. There is some debate about the ideal place to sit on the wagon for the most enjoyment, but the hayride is scary enough to cause some customers to jump off the wagon, or knowingly leave valuable possessions behind.Haunted houses get really scary by Craig Wilson, USA Today, October 12, 2006, accessed November 2, 2007 at 00:08 =Corn maze= The corn maze is the third stage in the visit.

These vessels were planned and constructed by Mr. Samuel H. Pook, of Fair Haven, Conn. The engines selected for these vessels are known as Wright’s segmental engine.

It is alternatively named known by its literal English translation, Left Right. Originally set to premiere at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and then at the 64th Venice International Film Festival the same year, the film eventually missed both, ultimately premiering at the 58th Berlin International Film Festival in 2008. The film was picked up for international distribution by the Paris-based company Films Distribution.  Plot  The film follows a divorced couple living in modern-day China who discover that their daughter is dying of leukemia. Doctors inform them, however, that the child can only be saved with stem cells from an umbilical cord of a sibling. Unfortunately both parents have since remarried. The film follows the emotional strain that this development brings to both marriages.

Ultimately both films failed to make the festival. Sources stated that In Love We Trust was officially delayed due to bureaucratic red tape, as it awaited examination by the Chinese Film Bureau. The film missed another opportunity to premiere at a major international film festival when it failed to debut at the 64th Venice International Film Festival in August 2007. This time, the reason for dropping out was not bureaucratic, but rather due to the fact that post-production editing had not yet been completed. In late 2007, it was announced that In Love We Trust would premiere at the 58th Berlin International Film Festival in 2008 where it would compete for the Golden Bear. The film would ultimately go on to win the Silver Bear for Best Screenplay in Berlin, with the Golden Bear going to the Brazilian film Tropa de Elite.

It is the sequel to Cosmos and was inspired by the famous 1990 Pale Blue Dot photograph, for which Sagan provides a poignant description. In the book, Sagan mixes philosophy about the human place in the universe with a description of the current knowledge about the Solar System. He also details a human vision for the future.  Summary  The first part of the book examines the claims made throughout history that Earth and the human species are unique. Sagan proposes two reasons for the persistence of the idea of a geocentric, or Earth-centered universe: human pride in our existence, and the threat of torturing those who dissented from it, particularly during the time of the Roman Inquisition. However, he also admits that the scientific tools to prove the Earth orbited the Sun were (until the last few hundred years) not accurate enough to measure effects such as parallax, making it difficult for astronomers to prove that the geocentric theory was false. Pale Blue Dot as republished by NASA in 2020 for the images' 30th anniversary. Using modern image-processing software, the brightness and colors were balanced to enhance the area containing the Earth. After saying that we have gained humility from understanding that we are not literally the center of the universe, Sagan embarks on an exploration of the entire Solar System. He begins with an account of the Voyager program, in which Sagan was a participating scientist. He describes the difficulty of working with the low light levels at distant planets, and the mechanical and computer problems which beset the twin spacecraft as they aged, and which could not always be diagnosed and fixed remotely. Sagan then examines each one of the major planets, as well as some of the moons—including Titan, Triton, and Miranda—focusing on whether life is possible at the frontiers of the Solar System. Sagan argues that studying other planets provides context for understanding the Earth—and protecting humanity's only home planet from environmental catastrophe. He believes that NASA's decision to cut back exploration of the Moon after the Apollo program was a short-sighted decision, despite its expense and declining popularity among the American public. Sagan says future exploration of space should focus on ways to protect Earth and to extend human habitation beyond it. The book was published the same year comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 crashed into Jupiter, an event Sagan uses to highlight the danger Earth faces from the occasional asteroid or comet large enough to cause substantial damage if it were to hit Earth. He says we need the political will to track large extraterrestrial objects, or we risk losing everything. Sagan argues that in order to save the human race, space colonization and terraforming should be utilized. Later in the book, Sagan's wife, Ann Druyan, challenges readers to pick one of the other planetary dots photographed and featured in the book, and imagine that there are inhabitants on that world who believe that the universe was created solely for themselves. She shared Sagan's belief that humans are not as important as they think they are. The first edition of the book includes an extensive list of illustrations and photographs, much of it taken from public archives of information released by NASA.

After being separated from his mother while still young, Luna spent five years in Nootka Sound, an ocean inlet of western Vancouver Island, where he had extensive human contact and became recognized internationally. Although Luna was healthy and his presence in the area attracted extensive publicity, there were concerns that his behavior could endanger watercraft and people. After years of debate, the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) authorized an effort in June 2004 to rescue Luna and return him to his pod. The plan was opposed by the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nations, who believed Luna was the reincarnation of a former chief. Remaining alone in Nootka Sound, Luna was killed accidentally by a tugboat propeller in March 2006. Early life Luna was born into a population known as the Southern Resident Community, consisting of three families called \\"pods\\": J-pod, K-pod and L-pod. This population, which consisted of approximately 83 killer whales at the time of Luna's birth, was studied since the 1970s. Scientists recognized each individual in the population by photo-identification, and tracked individual movements and social relationships over decades. Luna was born into a group in L-pod known as the L2 matriline, which consisted of the matriarch, Grace (L2), Luna's uncle, Orcan (L39), Gaia (L78), Wavewalker (L88), and Luna's mother, Splash (L67). Luna was first seen on the morning of September 19, 1999, near the San Juan Islands of Washington state as a newborn alone with his mother. Later that day, Luna was seen leaving his mother to follow orcas from K-pod, and did not reconnect with her until several days later. On September 26, Luna was seen nursing from Splash (L67). Luna was given the name \\"L98\\" at birth according to the scientific naming conventions for resident killer whales. A Seattle newspaper held a naming contest in 2000, resulting in L98 being given the common name Luna, Latin for moon. At the time, it was not known if Luna was male or female. The contest winner, eight-year-old Ashley Green from Bellingham, Washington, explained, \\"The orca whale explores the ocean like the moon explores the Earth and that is why his/her name is Luna.\\" Southern Resident killer whales spend summers in Haro Strait and the waters near southeastern Vancouver Island, including the Juan de Fuca Strait and Strait of Georgia, leaving the area each fall and returning in the spring. It is not known where they spend the winter, although have been seen along the northern coast of British Columbia to as far south as California. Southern Resident orcas are considered an endangered species by the governments of Canada and the United States. Appearance in Nootka Sound Location of Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia Float plane dock at Muchalat Inlet of Nootka Sound Over the winter of 2000-2001, five members of L-pod disappeared, considerably more than the typical mortality rate of one or two animals per year. In July 2001, Luna - with an estimated length of - reappeared alone in Muchalat Inlet of Nootka Sound, and by the fall, appeared to be in good health, feeding on sardines. Muchalat Inlet extends inland from Nootka Sound, approximately wide, long, and with a maximum depth of , to the town of Gold River on the west coast of Vancouver Island. The Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nations band named Luna \\"Tsux'iit\\" when he appeared in Gold River Inlet a few days after the death of Chief Ambrose Maguinna. Because the Chief had said he wished to return after death as an orca or wolf, the band believed that the appearance of Luna was symbolic and likely to be the reincarnation of Maguinna. At first Luna, avoided boats and kept his distance from people. DFO tried to keep Luna's presence in Nootka Sound a secret until December 2001, by which time he had been there for six months. International attention was diverted from Luna when Springer (A73) appeared alone in Puget Sound, becoming the orca center of attention in 2002. Contact with humans The Uchuck III at Friendly Cove in Muchalat Inlet, June 2012 By September 2002, Luna was determined to follow boats, such as the Uchuck III, which traveled Nootka Sound regularly to deliver supplies to fishing camps and loggers. Luna followed the boat to a dock at Gold River where his curiosity and playfulness caused damage to vessels and a float plane. Some people were fined for petting Luna. Observers of Luna's friendly behavior concluded that it was not possible to keep him away from people, conceding that human interaction was warranted for his social benefit until he could be reunited with his pod. Killer whales are intensely social, and boats and people seemed to provide the companionship and physical contact that Luna would normally have received from his orca pod. Many Gold River residents and tourists found Luna to be highly social, interactive, and playful. It is illegal in Canada for observers to disturb a wild marine mammal, and for Southern Resident orcas, a minimum distance is required. Cetaceans which lose their fear of boats generally fare poorly in the long term, as they can be injured by boat propellers. DFO posted signs asking the public to keep its distance from Luna, and sent out monitors to educate the public and keep them away from Luna. Stewardship Over the years 2002-6, interacting programs of stewardship formed to protect Luna, with aspirations of returning him to join his pod in the Pacific. Beginning in 2002, Canadian and American whale advocacy organizations, some forming a Luna Stewardship Fund, pressured the Canadian and US governments and the public to move Luna out of Nootka Sound and return him to his pod in the open ocean. By October 2003, the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) was collaborating with the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service on a plan to lure Luna toward a reunion with his pod where he could hear his family's calls. If that plan failed, an alternate plan was to catch Luna in a net pen in the Gold River marina, then transfer him by truck to near Victoria where he would be released to make an acoustic connection with his pod. In 2004, the Mowachaht-Muchalaht First Nation people of Gold River - interpreting Luna as their reincarnated tribal chief - opposed DFO attempts to capture him, and used canoes to lead Luna westward along Nootka Sound toward the ocean. The effort proved unsuccessful when Luna returned to Gold River, and the DFO called off the relocation plans. Joint plans by the DFO and Mowachaht-Muchalaht First Nation people for Luna's stewardship persisted through early 2006. Attempts for pod reunion  Dock at Muchalat Inlet of Nootka Sound; Luna was killed in the far-western region of the inlet in Mooyah Bay By May 2004, DFO and Vancouver Aquarium, assisted by the leading NGOs, were initiating Plan A, the boat-follow option. The first step was to train Luna to follow the designated DFO boat, hopefully out of Nootka Sound and into the path of passing Southern Resident orcas. Hopes for the boat-follow rose notably in mid-May 2004 when Luna's family members were sighted off the west side of Vancouver Island, but still some away from Nootka Sound. The pod never came closer, and by late May, researchers confirmed that the rest of the Southern Resident Community of orcas had in fact taken the route along the east coast of Vancouver Island, eliminating any chance of a natural reunion. By June, DFO began preparations for Plan B, the translocation. In June, 2004, the translocation operation was initiated with the assistance of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. DFO tried to lure Luna into a floating pen in order to move him to southern Vancouver Island where his pod had been observed. At one point, Luna allowed the team to lead him to the pen opening, but he escaped. That was as close to capture that Luna experienced. Despite the setback, the US and Canadian funds for relocation were still in place (US $200,000), and the Luna team was poised to attempt another rescue in the spring. Death Plaque at Muchalat Inlet, Nootka Sound, commemorating Luna On March 10, 2006 in Mooyah Bay of Muchalat Inlet, Luna approached a boat he knew — the ocean tugboat, General Jackson — whose crew were interacting with the whale. It is believed that Luna went up to the tugboat intentionally, as he often did, to engage in playful activity. Apparently underestimating the power of the idling vessel — tugboats have much more powerful engines than other ships of their size — Luna was pulled by suction from the propellers into the six-foot diameter blades and killed. Because his body was so damaged from the blades, nothing could be recovered for research. Legacy The Gold River Chamber of Commerce published an essay about Luna and a 24-minute documentary video produced and narrated by Suzanne and Mike Chisholm in 2006. In 2007, CTV produced a made-for-television film, Luna: Spirit of the Whale, starring Adam Beach, Jason Priestley, Tantoo Cardinal, and Graham Greene. The film is a fictionalized account of Luna's story, containing some real aspects of his life, and was filmed on location in Nootka Sound and at Gold River. This movie version of Luna's life, however, had a much-different ending, with Luna rejoining his family. The commercial documentary, Saving Luna, produced by Suzanne Chisholm and Michael Parfit, was introduced at a Seattle film festival in 2008, and played in theaters and television across Canada in 2009.World falls in love with Luna (September 29, 2008), \\"Victoria Times Colonist\\" It was broadcast in 2010 on the BBC with the title A Killer Whale Called Luna, and in 2011, with Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson as executive producers, turned into the theatrical film The Whale. Chisholm's and Parfit's notes were also turned into a book in 2013, The Lost Whale: The True Story of an Orca Named Luna. The loss of Luna reduced the number of mature males of Southern Resident orcas to just two individuals who have fathered more than half the calves born since 1990.

Page (1922) An Introduction to Electrodynamics from the Standpoint of Electron Theory, preface :As the dependence of electromagnetism on the relativity principle is far more intimate than is suggested by this covariance, it has seemed more logical to derive the electrodynamic equations directly from this principle. He derived a complete electromagnetic theory, including Maxwell's equations, from only Coulomb's law and the Lorentz transformation. Page proposed an emission theory that successfully explained blackbody radiation and other phenomena in electrodynamic terms, but was eventually abandoned in favor of later theories of quantum mechanics.

Even though punk genres at times are difficult to segregate, they usually show differing characteristics in overall structures, instrumental and vocal styles, and tempo. However, sometimes a particular trait is common in several genres, and thus punk genres are normally grouped by a combination of traits. Afro- punk Afro-punk (sometimes spelled AfroPunk) refers to the participation of African Americans in the punk and alternative music cultures. Afro-punks represent a majority in the punk culture in predominantly black regions of the world that have burgeoning punk communities, such as in parts of Africa. There are many punk rock bands with black members, and several with lineups that are all black. Notable bands that can be linked to the Afro-punk community include: Death, Pure Hell, Bad Brains, Suicidal Tendencies, Dead Kennedys, Fishbone, Wesley Willis Fiasco and Suffrajett. Anarcho punk Anarcho-punk is punk rock that promotes anarchism. The term anarcho-punk is sometimes applied exclusively to bands that were part of the 1970s/1980s anarcho-punk movement in the United Kingdom. Some, however, use the term to refer to any punk music with anarchist lyrical content. Examples of anarcho-punk bands include Crass, Conflict, and Icons of Filth. Art punk Art punk or avant punk refers to punk rock and post-punk music of an experimental bent, or with connections to art school, the art world, or the avant-garde. Examples of Art punk artists include A Frames, Art Brut, the Blood Brothers, Glenn Branca, Chicks on Speed, Chimera, Country Teasers, Crass, Daughters, the Death Set, and Devo. Christian punk Christian punk (or Christ punk, as it is called in reference to crust punk) is punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Given the edginess of punk and some of its subgenres, such as hardcore punk, many bands have been rejected by the Christian music industry. Due to the message and nature of Christian punk, many traditional punks ridicule it. Examples of Christian punk bands include MxPx, Crux, Dogwood, Officer Negative, and Outer Circle. Crust punk Crust punk (also known as Crust or Stenchcore ) is a subgenre which evolved in the early-1980s in England, and has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills. Crust is partly defined by its \\"bassy\\" and \\"dirty\\" sound. It is often played at a fast tempo with occasional slow sections. Vocals are usually guttural and may be grunted, growled or screamed. While the term was first associated with Hellbastard, Amebix have been described as the originators of the style, along with Discharge and Antisect. Deathrock Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s. Deathrock songs use simple chords, echoing guitars and prominent bass. Drumming emphasizes repetitive, post-punk beats within a time signature. To create atmosphere, scratchy guitars are sometimes used. Lyrics can vary, but are typically introspective and surreal, and deal with the dark themes of isolation, gloom, disillusionment, loss, life, death, etc.; as can the style, varying from harsh and dark to upbeat, melodic and tongue-in-cheek. Deathrock lyrics and other musical stylistic elements often incorporate the themes of campy horror and sci-fi films, which in turn leads some bands to adopt elements of rockabilly and surf rock. Garage punk Garage punk is punk rock heavily influenced by garage rock. Other influences include soul music, beat music, surf rock, power pop and psychedelic rock. Often it uses lo-fi aesthetics over catchy melodies. Examples of garage punk bands include New Bomb Turks, Mudhoney, Foxboro Hot Tubs and the Hives. Glam punk Glam punk (also called glitter punk) fuses elements of punk rock and glam rock, commonly reflected in image. Iggy Pop is a good example of this genre, as were the New York Dolls. Mötley Crüe's first album, Too Fast for Love, had many elements of glam punk in it. Hardcore punk Hardcore punk (or hardcore) music is generally faster and more aggressive than earlier punk rock. Hardcore, which originated in the late 1970s, was heavily involved with the rise of the independent record labels in the 1980s, and with the DIY ethics in underground music scenes. It has influenced a number of music genres which have experienced mainstream success, such as alternative rock, grunge, alternative metal, metalcore, thrash metal, and post-hardcore. Examples of early hardcore punk bands include Black Flag, Bad Brains and Minor Threat. Examples of later hardcore bands include Gorilla Biscuits, Youth of Today and Agnostic Front. Horror punk Horror punk mixes Gothic and punk rock sounds with morbid or violent imagery and lyrics, which are often influenced by horror films or science fiction B-movies. The genre is similar to, and sometimes overlaps with, deathrock, although horror punk music is typically more aggressive and melodic than deathrock. Some horror punk bands dress up in black clothes, skeleton costumes, and skull face paint. Examples of horror punk bands include Misfits, Balzac and Wednesday 13. Oi! Oi! is a working class street-level subgenre of punk rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the 1970s. It had a goal of uniting punks, skinheads, and other working class youths. Notable early Oi! bands include: Cockney Rejects, Angelic Upstarts, the 4-Skins and the Business. Peace punk Peace punk is a subgenre of punk rock with anti-war lyrics. The lyrics in peace punk advocate nonviolence and also often equality, freedom, animal liberation, veganism, ecology, human right and anarchy. The lyrics are against racism, sexism, homophobia, war, poverty, capitalism, the government and the military. Most peace punk bands are also anarcho-punk bands. Examples of peace punk bands include Crass and Flux of Pink Indians. Punk pathetique Punk pathetique or Fun punk is a subgenre of British punk rock (principally active circa 1980–1982) that involved humour and working class cultural themes. Musically it was related to (and had crossover with) the Oi! subgenre. Example of Fun punk include TV Personalities, the Shapes, the Adicts and Notsensibles. Queercore Queercore is a subgenre of punk that emerged in the 1980s after the publication of the zine J.D.s in Toronto. As a genre, queercore explores issues of gender identity, gender expression, and sexuality. Popular queercore bands include Limp Wrist, Queer Mutiny and Pansy Division. Festivals such as Queeruption feature music, art, film, performance art and DIY-aesthetic. Riot Grrrl Riot Grrrl is a feminist punk/indie rock genre and subculture, whose popularity peaked in the 1990s. The subculture features elements such as female-centric bands, concerts and festivals; collectives, support groups, workshops, self-defense courses, activism and fanzines. Examples of Riot Grrrl bands include Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney and Bratmobile. Skate punk Skate punk, also known as skatepunk, skate-punk, skate-thrash, surf punk, or skate- core, is a subgenre of punk that derived from hardcore punk. Skate punk most often describes the sound of melodic hardcore bands from the 1990s with an aggressive sound, and similar-sounding modern bands. Skate videos have traditionally featured this aggressive style of punk rock. Bands include, NOFX, The Offspring, Suicidal Tendencies, Pulley, Pennywise, Millencolin, Ten Foot Pole, Strung Out, Title Fight. Street punk Street punk is a working class subgenre of punk rock which emerged in the early 1980s, partly as a rebellion against the perceived artistic pretensions of the first wave of British punk. Street punk developed from the Oi! genre, and then continued to go beyond the confines of the original Oi! style. A notable Street Punk band is Dogs In The Fight. Taqwacore Taqwacore is a punk rock subgenre dealing with Islam and its culture, originally conceived in Michael Muhammad Knight's 2003 novel The Taqwacores. The name is a portmanteau of hardcore and the Arabic word Taqwa, which is usually translated as \\"piety\\" or the quality of being \\"God-fearing\\". Although Muslim punk rock dates back to at least the 1979 founding of the British band Alien Kulture. Knight's novel was instrumental in encouraging the growth of a contemporary North American Muslim punk movement. Taqwacore bands often challenge Islam as it exists, promoting a very liberal- progressive agenda. Trallpunk Trallpunk is a subgenre of punk known for fast drumming, a melodic sound and often politically oriented lyrics. It emerged from the late-1980s Swedish hardcore punk scene. Examples of trallpunk bands include Asta Kask, De Lyckliga Kompisarna and Krymplings. Punk rock fusion subgenres =2 Tone= 2 Tone (or Two Tone) was a music genre created in England in the late 1970s by fusing elements of ska, punk rock, rocksteady, reggae and new wave. The 2 Tone sound was developed by young musicians in Coventry, West Midlands, England.\\"Jerry Dammers interview by Alexis Petrides\\", Mojo, Jan. 2002. Accessed on 2-tone.info October 18, 2007 The genre is the precursor of the third wave ska scene of the 1980s and 1990s. Examples of 2 Tone bands include the Specials, the Selecter and Madness. =Anti-folk= Anti-folk (sometimes antifolk or unfolk) is a subgenre of folk music and punk rock that seeks to subvert the earnestness of politically charged 1960s folk music. The defining characteristics of this anti-folk are difficult to identify, as they vary from one artist to the next. Nonetheless, the music tends to sound raw or experimental; it also generally mocks perceived seriousness and pretension in the established mainstream music scene. =Celtic punk= Celtic punk is punk rock fused with influences from Celtic music. Often, the bands add Celtic instruments such as bagpipes, fiddle, tin whistle, accordion, mandolin or banjo. Celtic punk bands often play covers of traditional Irish or Scottish folk songs, as well as original compositions.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (London: Rough Guides, 2003), p. 798. Examples of Celtic punk bands include the Pogues, Flogging Molly, the Real McKenzies and, Dropkick Murphys. Scottish Gaelic punk Scottish Gaelic punk is a subgenre of punk rock in which bands sing some or all of their music in Scottish Gaelic. The Gaelic punk scene is, in part, an affirmation of the value of minority languages and cultures. Gaelic punk bands express political views, particularly those related to anarchism and environmentalism. =Chicano punk= Chicano punk is music by punk bands of Mexican American ethnicity. The subgenre originated in Chicago's Pilsen and Little Village neighborhoods during the mid-1990s and later spread to the Los Angeles punk scene. Examples of Chicano punk bands include Los Crudos, Los Illegals and Cruzados.  Spanish raw punk  Spanish raw punk is punk fused with the combination of Spanish punk and d-beat.

Ska-core is a subgenre of ska punk, blending ska with hardcore punk. The more punk- influenced style often features faster tempos, guitar distortion, onbeat punk- style interludes (usually the chorus), and nasal, gruff, or shouted vocals. The more ska-influenced style features a more developed instrumentation and a cleaner vocal and musical sound. Examples of ska punk bands include Less Than Jake, Operation Ivy and Catch 22. Examples of ska-core bands include the Suicide Machines and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Voodoo Glow Skulls. =Synthpunk= Synthpunk (also known as Electropunk) is a music genre combining elements of electronic music and punk rock. A number of bands use electronics and punk music together although the methods and resulting sounds can differ greatly. This has even led to the creation of more genres such as digital hardcore. Examples include Mindless Self Indulgence, The Prodigy, Atari Teenage Riot and Left Spine Down.

Origins Born before 1426, he was the son and heir of John Stourton, 1st Baron Stourton, and his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir John Wadham of Edge, Branscombe, Devon, Justice of the Common Pleas, and his second wife Joan Wrottesley. Career In 1447 he was elected Member of Parliament for Dorset, gaining the seat again in 1460, and by 1450 had been knighted. In that year he was on a commission of oyer and terminer for treasons in Wiltshire, followed in 1451 by appointment to the commission of the peace for Dorset, sitting later for Somerset and for Wiltshire as well.

Dretke 402 F.3d 551 (5th Cir. 2005), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard a case appealed from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (trial court) on the issue of the instructions given to a jury in death penalty sentencing. The decision took into account the recent United States Supreme Court decisions concerning the relevance of mitigating evidence in sentencing, as in Penry v. Lynaugh. Facts of the case On December 24, 1987, Grace Kehler returned home in Fort Worth, Texas, to find 26-year-old Michael Trekell (born March 27, 1961), with whom she lived, and their infant son Jayson (born August 1987) dead, the deaths ruled homicides by forensic investigators. On December 26, 1987, Fort Worth police were called to a Fort Worth motel where a police standoff occurred. James Bigby later surrendered without incident. He gave a written statement to the police confessing to the murders two days later. Bigby was charged with the murder of the male victim and of drowning the man's infant son, both of whom he knew. The mother of the murdered infant identified Bigby as being with her son just prior to his death. When the case came to trial in 1991, Bigby used the insanity defense with several psychiatrists testifying to his mental illness. One testified that Bigby suffered from an intractable paranoid schizophrenia with paranoid delusions that prevented him from distinguishing between right and wrong, and concluded that Bigby committed the murders as a direct result of his mental illness. During a trial recess, Bigby removed a gun from the unoccupied bench of the judge in the courtroom, went to the judge's chambers and aimed the gun at the judge's head, saying \\"Let's go\\", after which Bigby was subdued by the judge. The defense made a motion for a mistrial and requested the judge's recusal from the case. Both defense motions were denied. The judge testified in an administrative hearing that Bigby's assault had not biased him against Bigby and the trial was allowed to continue. After the defense rested its case, the judge allowed the rebuttal by the state to introduce testimony regarding Bigby's stealing the gun and threatening the judge, portraying the incident as attempted escape, and further saying this was evidence that Bigby was conscious of his guilt and therefore not eligible for the insanity defense. After the conclusion of the trial, the jury rejected Bigby's insanity defense. The jury's verdict found Bigby guilty of capital murder in a double homicide and imposed the death penalty. Appeals Bigby's direct appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stating that the trial court erred in giving the jury unconstitutional instructions, in violation of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989). In Penry v. Lynaugh, the issue was the instructions given to the jury--the jury was instructed to address the issues of whether the death of the victim was deliberate, whether there was probability that the defendant would constitute a continued threat to society, and whether the conduct was an unreasonable response to provocation by the victim. In Penry v. Lynaugh the Supreme Court decided that the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights were violated because the three issues the jury was instructed to consider were not broad enough for the jury to weight the effect of mitigating evidence. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, despite almost identical jury instructions given at the sentencing phase of Bigby's trial, affirmed both the conviction and sentence. After several subsequent denials of appeal and a denial of a writ of habeas corpus by the district court, Bigby appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which granted a certificate of appeal to examine Bigby's claim of denial of the right to a trial presided over by a fair and impartial judge and other claims, including the complaints of inadequate instructions to the jury as outlined in Penry v. Lynaugh. Decision On March 8, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit overturned the district court, granted a certificate of appeal, vacated Bigby's sentence, and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to grant habeas corpus relief. Aftermath Bigby's case went to a retrial in September 2006 (double jeopardy did not apply, as the ruling did not acquit him outright), where the jury imposed the same death penalty that their counterparts had 15 years previously. Bigby's subsequent appeals were unsuccessful, and he was executed by lethal injection on March 14, 2017.\\"Man who killed a father and his son in Arlington in 1987 is executed\\", star-telegram.com; accessed March 15, 2017. Significance Thus the court struck down jury instructions in death penalty cases that do not ask about mitigating factors including a consideration of the defendant's social, medical, and psychological history, saying that the jury must be instructed to consider mitigating factors even when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests that an expanded explanation including these factors be given in the jury instructions to insure the jury weighs all the mitigating factors. This ruling also established that a defendant's mental disorder must be considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing in a death penalty case, even if mental illness was not brought up in the trial.

He married Katherine Berkeley, daughter of Sir Maurice Berkeley of Beverstone Castle, Gloucestershire and Anne West, daughter of Reginald West, 6th Baron De La Warr. They had a son, Francis and a daughter, Anne, who died unmarried. He was knighted in 1475, and succeeded to his father's titles in 1479. His brother-in-law, Sir William Berkeley, was a leading member of Buckingham's revolt in 1483, and was attainted as a traitor by the Parliament of 1484. Richard III was prepared to pardon Berkeley on condition that Stourton, who retained the King's confidence, and had sat in the Parliament which passed the attainder, enter a bond for 1000 marks as surety for Berkeley's good behaviour. Shortly afterwards Berkeley fled the country to join Henry VII and Stourton was obliged to find the money to pay the bond. The triumph of Henry VII in 1485 might have brought him some rewards (although Henry was not as a rule overly generous to his supporters), but both Stourton and Berkeley died in the first months of the new reign. John was succeeded by his son Francis in 1485; Francis died in infancy. His widow remarried Sir John Brereton, and had one surviving daughter Werburga.

With limited funding for maintenance, NASA then closed the facility and it was listed for demolition. In 2004, NASA determined that the IDRF could be adapted to support the Constellation program. It was re-opened in 2005 to conduct landing tests associated with the development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Orion. The facility was renamed the Landing and Impact Research Facility (LandIR) and minor modifications were made, including a new parallel winch system to support full-scale Orion testing and a new hydro-impact basin (splashdown pool) below the gantry. Construction of the basin was completed in 2011. After Constellation was cancelled, the LandIR continued performing impact testing since the CEV will be used to service the International Space Station.

It formed about 460 to 440 million years ago in relatively shallow sea water. It is often mistakenly referred to as a volcano, probably because early investigators described it as a volcano or volcanic plug. It was here during the Saratoga Campaign of the American Revolution that General John Stark of New Hampshire cut off the retreat of British General John Burgoyne's army, hence its name. Geology A 1912 picture of Stark's Knob. Note how the right side (northern half) is stripped bare of vegetation. Stark's Knob formed in the Connecticut River Valley during the Taconic orogeny, when the shrinking Iapetus Ocean caused marine sediments to accrete onto the coast of the North American continent. This bulldozing effect also inevitably dragged in an island chain that probably resembled the Japanese Island chain. As a result, pressure in the rocks caused magma to erupt on the sea floor. The pillow lava that eventually formed Stark's Knob flowed out of these cracks and onto the sea floor. Fossils of snails found in sedimentary rock sandwiched between the pillows indicate that the lava formed during the early, or more likely, Middle Ordovician age. The snails also show that the lava was formed in shallow seas, as the species of snail was native to shallow water. Eventually the rocks were pushed up and out of the water. Over time, the rock was upthrust and tilted to a westerly direction. The thrusting also pushed the rock from the Connecticut River Valley to its present location, just west of the Hudson River. History =Revolutionary War= During the American Revolution's Saratoga Campaign, the knob provided a crucial asset for American forces led by General John Stark. Forces were stationed between the knob and the nearby Hudson River to block possible escape of British forces led by General John Burgoyne. British forces were in nearby Schuylerville at the time, just south of the knob. Accounts differ to what happened next, but either Stark's forces placed cannons on the knob or, more likely, placed them at the base of it, blocking the only avenue of escape for the surrounded British. The knob is named for General Stark.Parks and Recreation, Village of Schuylerville website, accessed November 6, 2010 =Modern History= In 1916, the property was deeded to the state. This was partly to prevent the mining of the formation for use in road building. After many years of virtual neglect and a number of proposals to sell the property, the state finally decided to take action to prevent the site's further decay as well as curb vandalism and maintain trails. In 2005, the site was incorporated into the master plan of Hudson Crossing Park, a bi- county park centered on Champlain Canal Lock 5 Island.

The ZEXEL rebranding was a two-year project involving a worldwide name search and complete marketing strategy analysis. The company logo featured red, white and blue colors picked to represent precision, technology and excellence. A CD was even distributed to employees featuring a new company theme song. The name itself was compiled of the \\"Z\\" from zenith, because the company reached the zenith of its performance under its old name of Diesel-Kiki, and the word \\"excel\\" because the company wanted to excel at customer satisfaction. Somehow in their translation though, it came out ZEXEL instead of ZEXCEL. The company was reorganized as Bosch Automotive Systems Corp. and Valeo Japan in 2000 after Robert Bosch GmbH of Germany and Valeo of France bought majority shares in Zexel Corporation. Zexel name is now a Bosch brand, but the assets were split between Bosch and Valeo. Research and development Since its inception as Diesel Kiki Ltd., the company has developed a number of products that exemplify Japanese automotive engineering quality. Because of the firm's sizeable research and development capacity, it is also involved in international environmental protection projects such as the reduction of ozone depleting substances, mitigation of smoke emissions, and so on. Ownership changes Following the Bosch takeover, there was a series of ownership changes that resulted in the division of the major business groups: fuel injection pumps, automotive airconditioners, bus airconditioners and mobile refrigeration units, and the differential and airbag product lines. For example, M.C. Bernardo Inc. (the exclusive representative of Diesel Kiki/Zexel in the Philippines) had to turn over business to Robert Bosch Philippines, like other Zexel partners in other countries and regions. =Automotive airconditioners= Valeo of France bought the automotive airconditioner business, and refocused manufacturing to support the European market. The shift in focus was the reason why Zexel Automotive Climate Control Systems (ZACCS) stopped its operations providing products, unit prototyping and after-market services to Isuzu, Nissan, Nissan Diesel and Columbian Motors (a Kia assembler) in the Philippines. Zexel's US operations were headquartered in Decatur, Il. and focused on A/C compressors for Saturn at that facility. Being a vane type compressor, their notable feature was near silent operation and a variable displacement capability meaning they did not cycle on and off resulting in much smoother engine running. The Texas facility produced evaporator assemblies, otherwise called cooling units, hook up tubes and condensers. Customers of that plant included Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Volvo. The plant produced more than three thousand condensers per day and pioneered certain aspects of parallel flow condensor design and manufacturing. =Bus airconditioners and refrigeration= Thermo King bought into the bus airconditioner and refrigeration lines. =Differentials= The Torsen differential was purchased by Toyoda Machine Works Ltd. which eventually merged with another company to form JTEKT Torsen North America.

It is known only from Khanh Hoa and southern Phu Yen provinces, but may also occur in eastern Dak Lak and northern Ninh Thuan provinces. This species was initially described as a subspecies of Cuora galbinifrons, but was shown to be genetically distinct.Stuart, B. L. & Parham, J. F. (2004). \\"Molecular phylogeny of the critically endangered Indochinese box turtle (Cuora galbinifrons)\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution. 31: 164-177. This is the same for Cuora galbinifrons bourreti, which is much closer related to Cuora galbinifrons, though, in osteology, genetics and morphology than is Cuora picturata to either one. Thus, this variety probably truly deserves species status. This species has the highest-domed carapace of all Cuora species, the shape resembling a conquistador helmet. While the head coloration of Cuora galbinifrons subspecies is highly variable even in different populations, this is not the case with C. picturata, whose head is always yellow with a fine, greyish reticulation. 250px References * Lehr, E.; Fritz, U. & Obst, F.

Ellis is fourteen and lives in Tucson, Arizona. His parents have split up and he lives with his mother Wendy, and Goat Man. Goat Man ostensibly looks after Wendy's garden and swimming pool and in return lives in the pool house.

Micipsa, on his deathbed, left his two sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, together with his cousin, Jugurtha, joint heirs of his kingdom. Sallust claims the arrangement fell apart almost immediately due to the unprincipled ambition of Jugurtha and the longtime jealousy of his two half-brothers. At the very first meeting of the three princes their animosity displayed broke into the open. Hiempsal, the younger and most impetuous of the two brothers, gave mortal offence to Jugurtha. After this interview, it being agreed to divide the kingdom of Numidia, as well as the treasures of the late king, between the three princes, they took up their quarters in different towns in the neighborhood of Cirta. But as Hiempsal had imprudently established himself at Thirmida, in a house belonging to a dependant of Jugurtha, the latter took advantage of this circumstance to introduce a body of armed men into the house during the night, who put to death the unhappy prince, together with many of his followers.Sallust, Bellum Jugurthinum 5, 9, 11, 12Diod.

Grant was born around 1570, and lived at Norbrook in Warwickshire. He married the sister of another plotter, Thomas Wintour. Grant was enlisted by Robert Catesby, a religious zealot who had grown so impatient with James's lack of toleration for Catholics that he planned to kill him, by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder. Grant's role in the conspiracy was to provide supplies for a planned Midlands uprising, during which James's daughter, Princess Elizabeth, would be captured. However, on the eve of the planned explosion, Guy Fawkes was discovered guarding the explosives the plotters had positioned in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords, and arrested. As the government searched for Fawkes's accomplices, Grant and the others engaged in a futile mission for support for the uprising. They stole horses from Warwick Castle, and further supplies from Hewell Grange, before stopping at Holbeche House. The plotters laid in front of the fire some of the gunpowder they had collected, to dry out, but a stray spark ignited the powder, and in the resultant conflagration Grant was blinded. Government forces besieged the house, and he was captured and taken to London. At his arraignment in January 1606 Grant pleaded not guilty to high treason, but he was nevertheless sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, and was executed three days later, on 30 January. Background Born some time around 1570, John Grant lived at Norbrook, near Snitterfield in Warwickshire. He was married to Thomas Wintour's sister, Dorothy, with a son, Wintour Grant. He is described by author Antonia Fraser as a melancholy individual, but also an intellectual who studied Latin and other languages. He was a resolute character, as the poursuivants who searched his home for Catholic priests were no doubt aware; he was so unwelcoming to them that they eventually shied away from Norbrook. Grant was also involved in the Essex Rebellion against Elizabeth I, as were several of the men with whom he became better acquainted through what became known as the Gunpowder Plot. Plot English Catholics hoped that the years of persecution they had suffered during Elizabeth's reign would end when James I came to the throne, as his attitude appeared moderate, even tolerant towards Catholics. In Robert Catesby's view however, James had reneged on his promises, and he quickly lost patience with the new dynasty. He therefore planned to kill James by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder, and inciting a popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the throne. Catesby enlisted the help of six fellow Catholics, and by 25 March 1605 he had recruited three others: Robert Wintour, Christopher Wright, and Grant. Grant had received a letter from Catesby inviting him to a meeting that took place in Oxford at the Catherine Wheel inn, where he and Robert Wintour swore an oath after which they were told of the plan. Grant's role in the uprising centred on his house at Norbrook, ideally located in the English Midlands close to Warwick and Stratford, and to Catesby's childhood home at Lapworth (then owned by John Wright). In summer 1605 Grant likely stored weapons and ammunition at Norbrook, but he was also to take charge of the provision of rare war horses from the nearby Warwick Castle. Concern over the plague had delayed Parliament's opening from February, to October 1605, and the government later claimed that by December 1604 the plotters were busily digging a tunnel beneath Parliament. No evidence exists to substantiate this claim, and no trace of a tunnel was ever found, but perhaps because of the change of dates Grant seems not to have been involved in the endeavour, which was stopped when the tenancy to the undercroft beneath the House of Lords became available. By 20 July the explosives were in position, but the opening of Parliament was again prorogued, this time until 5 November 1605. As Catesby added three more to the conspiracy, the last few details were worked out; Fawkes was to light the fuse that would set off the explosion, and then escape to the continent, while the others would incite the Midlands uprising, and capture James's daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Thus, as the plot moved closer to fruition, on Monday 4 November Grant and a friend were to be found in Dunchurch at the Red Lion inn, with the newly recruited Everard Digby and his \\"hunting party\\". The group attended a Mass the next morning, before moving on. Failure Tipped off by an anonymous letter to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, late on Monday night the authorities had made a search of Parliament. There they had discovered Fawkes guarding the gunpowder the plotters had placed in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords. Catesby and the others, en route to the Midlands, had been alerted to his arrest by those conspirators who had since fled London, and together had rode to Dunchurch to meet Digby and his party. By Wednesday 6 November the government was busy searching for Fawkes' accomplices, and towards the end of the day Grant's name appeared on the list of suspects drawn up by the Lord Chief Justice. However, confirmation of his status as a fugitive would not arrive until the next day, when provoked by their raid for supplies on Warwick Castle, the government issued a public proclamation naming Percy, Catesby, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour and both Wright brothers as wanted men. On the same proclamation Grant was misidentified as Edward Grant, and Catesby's servant, Thomas Bates, was probably also misnamed as Robert Ashfield. From Warwick they rode to Grant's home at Norbrook, collecting muskets, calivers and ammunition that he had stored there. Then they continued west through Snitterfield toward Alcester, before stopping at Huddington at about 2:00 pm that afternoon. Early the next morning they attended a Mass conducted by Father Nicholas Hart, who also heard their confessions—a sign that in Fraser's opinion demonstrates that none of them thought they had long to live. Riding through pouring rain, the fugitives helped themselves to arms, ammunition and money from the vacant home of Lord Windsor at Hewell Grange. Any hopes they harboured of a larger uprising were dashed by the locals, who on hearing that the party stood for \\"God and Country\\", replied that they were for \\"King James as well as God and Country\\". The group finally reached Holbeche House, on the border of Staffordshire, at about 10:00 pm. Tired and desperate they spread in front of the fire some of the now-soaked gunpowder taken from Hewell Grange, to dry out. An ember from the fire landed on the powder, and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant and another man. Grant was blinded by the conflagration, his eyes \\"burnt out\\". Some of the plotters disappeared into the night, but Grant stayed with Catesby, Thomas Wintour, Rookwood, the Wright brothers and Percy. With the arrival of the Sheriff of Worcester and his company early on 8 November, the house was besieged. Catesby and Percy were killed, as were both Wright brothers. Wintour and Rookwood were each wounded and were easily captured, as was Grant. Trial and execution Grant and the survivors were taken first to Worcester in the custody of the Sheriff, and then to the Tower of London. At their arraignment on 27 January 1606 all except Digby pleaded \\"Not Guilty\\", but the outcome was never in doubt; they were all found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. The first executions were scheduled for Thursday 30 January 1606. Along with Digby and Robert Wintour (Bates was brought separately, from the Gatehouse Prison), Grant was strapped to a wattled hurdle and dragged through the streets of London to St Paul's churchyard, by St.Paul's Cathedral. Digby was the first to ascend the scaffold, and before he was executed gave a short speech. Wintour followed, saying little. Grant was next. At his trial, when asked why a death sentence should not be pronounced against him, he had replied that he was \\"guilty of a conspiracy intended, but never effected.\\" Similarly, when faced with the executioner's halter he refused to confess—the only one of the condemned to do so. He was led quietly up the ladder and crossed himself, before being hanged and then subjected to the latter part of his sentence. The other four plotters were executed the following day, in Old Palace Yard.

Hayden Community High School is part of the Phoenix Union High School District. The campus is located at 3333 W. Roosevelt Street just west of downtown Phoenix, Arizona, United States. Carl Hayden's enrollment is 2,209 students, over 93 percent of whom are Hispanic. The school predominantly serves students from partner elementary districts Isaac, Murphy and Riverside, however students from across the district come to the school for its two Phoenix Union Magnet Programs: Computer Studies and Marine Science. History Carl Hayden High School is named after Carl Hayden, a U.S. Representative and Senator who represented Arizona for 57 years, from 1912 to 1969. The school opened in 1957 and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007-2008 with the completion of a $22 million renovation and administration building. Facts * Carl Hayden is a Performing School, according to the Arizona Department of Education.http://www10.ade.az.gov/ReportCard/SchoolSummary.aspx?id=5440&ReportLevel;=1 *Carl Hayden has received worldwide acclaim for its Robotics team, which won the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) International Chairman's award in 2008, recognized as the team that best represents a model for other teams to emulate and best embodies the purpose and goals of FIRST. The team first received recognition for beating MIT and other universities in an underwater robotics competition in 2004, a story that has been chronicled on ABC's Nightline and in The Reader’s Digest, among others. A 2015 motion picture, Spare Parts, featured the story of these four boys who defeated all odds: Cristian Arcega, Lorenzo Santillan, Luis Aranda, and Oscar Vasquez, are the real-life students whose huge accomplishment put Carl Hayden on the map. Not only this, but Carl Hayden again beat MIT and other elite universities for the next two years, thus making a hat-trick of wins. The Falcon Robotics team now hosts its own National Underwater Robotics Competition (NURC) in Chandler each June. * Carl Hayden implemented a Pathways to Success partnership thanks to a $1.2 million grant from The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation to community organizations that helps high school students in Phoenix prepare for post-secondary education.

The species is endemic to Southeast Asia. Geographic range C. bourreti is found in central Vietnam and adjacent Laos. Taxonomy Although Stuart and Parham (2004) argued that C. bourreti was quite distinct, possibly enough to justify its elevation to a full species, osteologic studies by Fritz et al. (2006) have shown that it probably better remains as a subspecies of C. galbinifrons. This is further substantiated by the finding of intergradation zones in north-central Vietnam, where hybrid populations of C. g. galbinifrons and C. g. bourreti are known to exist (Fritz et al. 2003). Etymology C. bourreti is named in honor of French herpetologist René Léon Bourret.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Campbell's Island is an island and unincorporated community in the Mississippi River. The island is located in Hampton Township, Rock Island County, Illinois. It is adjacent to the city of East Moline and is connected to the city by a bridge. It is the site of the Campbell's Island State Memorial, a listed historic site overseen by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. House-In-The-Woods Inn, 1907 Streetcar connecting Campbell's Island to Watertown (now East Moline) History =War of 1812= Campbell's Island was the site of the Battle of Rock Island Rapids, one of the westernmost battles of the War of 1812, when a band of approximately 500 Sauk warriors allied with the British Army clashed on July 19, 1814, with an American force led by Lieutenant John Campbell of the 1st U.S. Regiment of Infantry. Campbell was leading three gunboats along the Mississippi River to carry military supplies to Fort Shelby, located at the present site of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.\\"Rock Island (Campbell's Island)\\", U.S. National Park Service, accessed October 19, 2007. One boat carried 42 people – soldiers of the 1st U.S. Regiment of Infantry and members of their families. The other two boats carried 66 U.S. Rangers. The British- allied Indians attacked the flotilla in their canoes and forced Campbell to turn back.Gilpin, p. 249-250 The American loss was 8 men of the 1st Regiment killed and 16 wounded;4 Rangers killed and 8 wounded.Eaton, p. 21 This victory helped to enable the Sauk to maintain their control over the Quad Cities area for almost 20 more years. The Campbell's Island State Memorial, dedicated in 1908, commemorates this battle. However, the movement of Euro-American militiamen and families into northwestern Illinois continued, and in the Black Hawk War of 1832 the Sauk were decisively defeated. The Quad Cities area was \\"opened to settlement,\\" and Campbell's Island was named in honor of the loser of the 1814 battle, John Campbell.\\"Campbell's Island\\", Illinois State Historical Society (historic marker), accessed October 13, 2007. Five currently active infantry battalions of the Regular Army (1-1 Inf, 2-1 Inf, 1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf and 4-3 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of elements of the old 1st and 7th Infantry Regiments that were at the Battle of the Rock Island Rapids. =Early 1900s= At the turn of the 20th century, Campbell's Island was bought by a streetcar company who intended to build an amusement park which would have covered the island. In 1904 the first streetcar bridge was constructed atop a closing dam that had been built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1899.Coopman, David T. Rock Island County. Charleston SC, Chicago IL, Portsmouth NH, San Francisco CA: Arcadia Publishing, 2008. Campbell's Island was a popular resort area in the early to mid 20th century. Cottages were available for rent, and some of the more affluent built their own summer cabins. Extra streetcars were added to the island in the mornings and afternoons to accommodate seasonal residents traveling to and from work in the cities. The House-In-the-Woods, built in 1904, offered dining on the first floor and orchestra concerts in the ballroom on the second floor. It was destroyed by fire in 1911, but rebuilt the following spring and eventually renamed The Campbell's Island Inn. In the late 1950s the inn became the Ship's Wheel Boat Club, encompassing a visitor's dock and marina. After surviving flood damage in 1965, the boat club and marina burned down in 1979.http://qctimes.com/news/local/ask-the- times/2aa5427a-584c-11e1-9d73-001871e3ce6c.html Today The size and shape of Campbell's Island has been somewhat variable in historic times, due to additions and subtractions created by the power of the Mississippi River. Today, the island is approximately 1.25 miles (2 km) long and 0.5 miles (0.8 km) wide. It is the home of a suburban community that dwells on a ring road that circles the island. The low-lying Campbell's Island is subject to flooding, and many of the island homes are raised, built on stilts, or otherwise constructed so as to minimize damage during periods of high water such as the Great Flood of 1993. The bridge to East Moline was built in 1938 and completely rebuilt in 1999.\\"Campbell's Island Bridge\\", Upper Mississippi River Bridges Project, accessed October 13, 2007. The Rock Island Rapids, a riffle in the Upper Mississippi River after which the 1814 battle was named, have disappeared.

Life He was the eldest son of William Stourton, 7th Baron Stourton and Elizabeth Dudley, daughter of Edmund Dudley, a key adviser to Henry VII. His parents' marriage was unhappy, due to his father's liaison with Agnes ap Rhys, or Rice, daughter of Rhys ap Gruffydd and granddaughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk; in their later years his parents lived apart. To the understandable chagrin of his children, William left almost the whole of the Stourton inheritance to Agnes Rice, resulting in years of litigation between his children and Agnes. Charles was on very bad terms with his father, calling him a \\"false hypocrite\\" for whom prison would be too good. Stourton succeeded his father as baron in 1548. He was a nephew of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, as well as a Catholic. A Wiltshire resident, he was asked for help by Mary Tudor in the succession crisis of 1553, but hesitated in supporting her until her victory was clear.Ives pp. 220-221 In August 1553 he was described as an \\"archpapist\\" by a London pamphleteer.Ives p. 235 He had a reputation for being quarrelsome and violent, and was clearly regarded as a public nuisance even before he was charged with murder. The legal difficulties and family quarrels caused by his father's affair with Agnes Rice, and his decision to disinherit his children, may to some extent explain Charles's violent temper, although lawsuits over property were then an everyday part of life among the English landed classes. Execution for murder He was executed, as were four of his servants, on 16 March 1557 at Salisbury for murdering two men, William Hartgill and his son John Hartgill, following a trial at Westminster on 28 February previous. Stourton had been most reluctant to plead to the indictment, until he was reminded by the judges that he faced the horrific penalty of peine forte et dure (being pressed to death under heavy stones) if he did not. William Hartgill, described as a \\"surly and cross old man\\", was a neighbour with whom Stourton had long been on bad terms. Stourton had quarreled with his widowed mother, who wished to remarry, and Hartgill had taken Lady Stourton's part in the quarrel. As not infrequently happened in that age, the feud degenerated into a private war, eventually causing the intervention of Star Chamber. Stourton was fined and ordered to pay damages to the Hartgills: this humiliation seems to have been the motive for the crime. On the pretext of arranging a meeting to pay them the money, Stourton ambushed the Hartgills at Kilmington church, kidnapped them and had them brought to his house, where after being imprisoned for a time they had their throats cut. Stourton did not actually commit the murders but was found guilty of ordering them.The Newgate Calendar- Lord Stourton and four of his servants... executed for the murder of William Hartgill. Before his execution he is said to have expressed true repentance for this and his other crimes.Newgate Calendar Family  Stourton married Lady Anne Stanley, daughter of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby and Lady Dorothy Howard. They had three sons: *John, who became Baron in 1557. *Edward, who became Baron in 1588. *Charles; and three daughters: * Mary, who married John TregianCornwall Record Office, AR/17/107 * Anne, who married Edward Rogers * Katherine, who married Richard Sherborne.

Ltd. of Melbourne, Australia and managed by CEO, Luke Connell. The game opened on 5 March 2007 and first appeared in the virtual world of Second Life. Transactions occurred outside of Second Life on the WSE website.* The game initially used the Linden Dollar currency from Second Life and in July 2007 integrated a new virtual currency called the World Internet Currency (WIC, WICS, W$). The WIC currency, similar to the Linden Dollar, could be converted to/from USD. In its first 25 days, the WSE generated $200,000 in trading volume. Players of the game were not legally protected as with a real stock exchange, instead trading was governed by the Linden Labs terms of service and the listing rules created by Connell. In July 2007, an avatar with inside information hacked the WSE computers and made off with 3.2 million LD (or about $12,000US). The WSE shut down temporarily to investigate and perform system upgrades. As a result, WSE software development and upgrades were moved in house and positions were no longer available to anonymous Second Life avatars. The incident sparked debate over the WSE's classification as a game since the virtual currency, Linden Dollars, were able to be exchanged for real money. Connell maintained that no crime had occurred since all transactions and companies involved in the game were fictional. He blamed the backlash against the WSE on a few disenchanted companies whose initial stock offerings failed to perform to their expectations. Shania Stewart, whose avatar first reported the theft had her company delisted from the WSE shortly thereafter. She later told BusinessWeek that the delisting occurred because \\"she believed the exchange had no intention of disclosing what happened\\". Linden Labs declined to comment on the incident.

It is distributed from the extreme southern part of the Chinese Guangxi province southwards to central Vietnam and central Laos. This species reaches up to 30 cm straight carapace length and is thus the largest Cuora species. Due to demand of traditional Chinese medicine, this species is nearly extinct in the wild, but is readily bred on Chinese turtle farms.Zhou, T.; McCord, W.; Blanck, T. & Li, P. P. (2007). \\"Cuora trifasciata and Cuora cyclornata - captive breeding in China\\". Reptilia (GB). (50): 68-73. Extremely high prices are paid for this species in China. It can be distinguished from Cuora trifasciata by its larger size and generally more oval or rounder shell, which is usually also flatter, a white, pink, or orange chin, and head coloration with an orange-brownish-olive dorsal head pattern and less black pigment.

This bird is sometimes considered to be con- specific with the greater double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris afer). It is sometimes placed in the genus Nectarinia. Description The sunbird is a medium-size species. The adult male has a glossy, metallic green head, throat upper breast and back with a golden sheen. The upper-tail coverts are metallic blue and the tail black glossed with blue. The throat and upper breast are metallic green, the lower breast scarlet and the rest of the underparts are dark olive. When displaying, yellow feather tufts are visible on the shoulders. As with other sunbirds the bill is long and decurved. The eye is dark brown while the beak, legs and feet are black. The adult female has dark greyish-brown upper parts and a blackish-brown tail. The chin and supercilium are greyish-buff and the underparts brownish-grey, with the central part of the lower breast and belly being paler or slightly yellowish. Ecology This bird's flight is fast and direct on short wings. It is usually seen singly or in pairs, with the male chasing away conspecifics. It feeds mainly on nectar from flowers, but takes some fruit, and, especially when feeding young, insects and spiders. It can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perches to feed. It is a bird of forest edges, clearings, montane grassland, plantations, secondary growth, scrubland and grassland.

It was sold to Andrew Mellon by the Soviet Government in 1931 for $1,166,400, the largest sum ever paid for a painting until that time. The Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings in 1930 and 1931 resulted in the departure of some of the most valuable paintings from the collection of the State Hermitage Museum in Leningrad to Western museums. Several of the paintings had been in the Hermitage Collection since its creation by Empress Catherine the Great. About 250 paintings were sold, including masterpieces by Jan van Eyck, Titian, Rembrandt, Rubens, Raphael, and other important artists. Andrew Mellon donated the twenty-one paintings he purchased from the Hermitage to the United States government in 1937, which became the nucleus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.  History  The Annunciation by Jan van Eyck (1434) was purchased for the Hermitage by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia in 1850. It was sold to Andrew Mellon in June 1930 for $502,899. In the late 1920s, the Soviet government urgently needed foreign currency to finance the rapid industrialization of Russia ordered in the first Five Year Plan. The government had already sold off collections of jewelry, furniture and icons seized from the Russian nobility, wealthy classes, and the church. In February 1928, the State Hermitage Museum in Leningrad, along with the Russian Museum, was ordered to make a list of art works worth at least two million rubles, for export. A special agency called 'Antiquariat' was created under the Narkompros (the People's Commisariat of Enlightenment) and opened an office in Leningrad to oversee the sale. The Hermitage was instructed to sell 250 paintings for at least 5000 rubles each, plus engravings and a number of golden treasures from ancient Scythia. Mezzettino by Antoine Watteau, was purchased for the Hermitage by Catherine the Great in 1767. It was sold in May 1930 to Calouste Gulbenkian, who sold it in 1934 to the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The sale was secret, but word was quietly spread to selected western art dealers and collectors that the paintings were on the market. The first foreign buyer to purchase Hermitage paintings was Calouste Gulbenkian, the founder of the Iraq Petroleum Company, who began buying paintings in early 1930, trading them for oil with the Russians. These works later formed part of the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, in Lisbon. However, the organizers of the sale were dissatisfied with the amounts they received from Gulbenkian, so they looked for other buyers. Saint George and the Dragon, by Raphael, was purchased for the Hermitage by Catherine the Great in 1772, and later hung in the gallery of portraits of the generals who had defeated Napoleon. It was sold to Andrew Mellon in 1931. Andrew Mellon was an American banker, Secretary of the Treasury for Presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, art collector and, at the time, American Ambassador to Great Britain. He conceived the idea of founding a National Gallery for the United States modeled after the National Gallery (London). He heard about the secret Hermitage sale from Knoedler and Company of New York, dealers which he regularly used for his art purchases. Franz Zatzenstein-Matthiesen, a young German art dealer, had been asked by the Soviet Government to compile a list of the hundred paintings in Russian collections, which should never be sold under any circumstances. He was surprised soon afterwards to find several of the paintings on his list were in Paris, purchased by Gulbenkian. Gulbenkian asked him to act as his agent on further purchases, but Matthiesen instead formed a consortium with Colnaghi's of London and with Mellon's firm, Knoedler. In 1930 and 1931 the consortium bought twenty-one paintings from the Soviet government, which they offered to Mellon, who had the right of first refusal.Walker, 1964, pp 24-6 By the end of 1931, Mellon had acquired twenty- one paintings for a total price of $6,654,000. They included Van Eyck's Annunciation and Raphael's The Alba Madonna. The latter painting was sold for $1,166,400, the largest sum ever paid for a single painting until that time. The consortium sold several other paintings to other clients, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The sale remained secret until November 4, 1933, when it was reported in the New York Times that several Hermitage paintings, including the Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych by van Eyck, had been purchased by the Metropolitan Museum. The sales came to an end in 1934, possibly as a result of a letter to Stalin from the deputy director of the Hermitage, Joseph Orbeli, protesting the sale of Russia's treasures. The director of the Hermitage, Boris Legran, who had been brought to the museum to conduct the sale, was dismissed in 1934 and replaced by Orbeli. In 1937, Andrew Mellon donated the twenty-one paintings, along with the money to build a National Gallery of Art to house them, to the United States Government. The paintings were, and remain, the heart of the National Gallery collection. Other sales were made in the same period, notably the Codex Siniaticus from the Russian National Library, sold in 1933 to the British Museum (after 1973 British Library) for £100,000 raised by public subscription (worth £ in ), and The Night Café by Vincent van Gogh. In the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Parliament of the Russian Federation passed a new law prohibiting the sale of Russian art treasures to foreign countries. For many years the National Gallery was reluctant to lend the paintings it had bought from the Hermitage back to that Museum, for fear that the Russian government would keep the paintings in Russia. That policy changed after 1990, when Mikhail Piotrovsky became director of the Hermitage. A number of the National Gallery paintings have been on loan to the Hermitage, including Venus with a Mirror by Titian, which was lent to the Hermitage at the time of the first visit of the President George W. Bush to St Petersburg in 2002.  Timeline  February 1928 Hermitage ordered to prepare list of paintings for sale.

He first arrived on the St. Thomas along with Gabriel Milan in 1684, having contracted to serve the Danish West India Company for four years.Westergaard, West Indies, 34 However, in 1686, he was back in Denmark, to testify in the trial against Milan, who was under scrutiny due to his gubernatorial rule.Westergaard, West Indies, 38 In 1688, Lorensen returned with Adolph Esmit to the West Indies, as bookkeeper and assistant. For this, his wage was 14 Danish rigsdaler per month.Westergaard, West Indies, 40 Upon Christopher Heins' death in October, 1689, Lorensen was elected governor.Westergaard, West Indies, 41Knox, Account, 60 = Governorship = The death of vice-governor Heins in October, 1689, and the election of John Lorentz to take his place, did not improve the position of the Brandenburgisch-Africanische Compagnie on the islands nor the relations between them and the Danish West India Company. Within a fortnight after his election Lorentz issued an order forbidding the Brandenburgers to bring any privateers or prizes into St. Thomas harbor.Lorentz's Journal (October 19, 1689) This was in strict accordance with paragraph 35 of the treaty,Schück, II, 267 and with Denmark's neutral position in the King William's War, which was just beginning; hence it could not reasonably be objected to; but when on November 7, he issued a mandate forbidding the Danish inhabitants from buying any wares from the Brandenburgers' magazine that could be found in stock at the Danish company's warehouse, and further forbade the payment of debts to the Brandenburgers until the debts to the Company had been satisfied, there was reason for the Brandenburgers to feel apprehensive.Lorentz's Journal (November 7, 1689); P. B. O., 1683–1728 (November 7, 1689) The most trifling complaint against the rival company became the subject of solemn investigation by the zealous governor.C. B., 1690–1713. See especially Lorentz' letters to the directors in 1696 and 1697. Brandenburger director M. Laporte naturally looked towards the planters for moral support. They had two representatives in the Governor's council and would expect to benefit from the presence of two rival companies on the island. The result was that government and colony were soon divided into two rival camps, each affecting to suspect the worst of the other.  Life lease  On July 27, 1689, a life lease was granted to Nicholas Jansen Arff, by which he secured the right to use Fort Christiansborg, the Danish \\"castle\\" on the Guinea coast, and to carry on the slave trade with the West Indies, on the payment to the Company of a \\"two per cent\\" duty.est. Reg., 1670-99 (July 27, 1689). The slave trade had been carried on in the few years immediately preceding by ships sailing from Glückstadt. A Portuguese Jew, Moses Joshua Henriques, was appointed factor in Glückstadt for ships sailing to Guinea on April 27, 1686. Arff's ships were to sail from Copenhagen. Rothe, Rescripter, II. This was followed on February 13, 1690, by a contract with a reputable and venturesome Bergen merchant, Councilor of Commerce (Commerce-Raad) Jørgen Thormöhlen of Möhlenpriis, who leased St. Thomas from the Company for a period of ten years. He was to pay 4,630 sldl. each year, which was just four per cent. of the 115,750 sldl. capital entered on the books of the Company.C. B., 1690–1713. Thormöhlen himself wrote his name Thor Möhlen. By these two contracts the management of both the Guinea and West India ends of the Company's business went into the hands of private proprietors.  Controversy  Before the news of these changes could be received at St. Thomas, and before Lorentz had received a request from Thormöhlen to remain at his post until further orders, the vice- governor was preparing to bring the matter of the contested land rental to a definite settlement in the Company's favor, if necessary, by force. He was proceeding according to secret instructions from the directors in Copenhagen.Lorentz's Journ. (November 24, 1690); directors to Lorentz (December 22, 1691); C. B., 1690–1713. The rental which was calculated upon the current price of tobacco was estimated at 20,000 rdl. annually, that is, more than six times the rental fixed in the Thormöhlen contract.Lorentz' Journal. (December 5, 1691). If strictly enforced it would spell ruin, which was apparently precisely what was intended. On St. Thomas, an atmosphere of suspicion pervaded everything. On the last day of October Lorentz declined an invitation to a banquet given by director-general Laporte, for he felt that it was to be merely a meeting of Laporte's adherents among the planters, --- his \\"creatures.\\" Among those suspected of disloyalty to the Danish company were two members of the governor's council, Captain DelicaetCaptain Delicaet, scenting trouble, had left on the day of the banquet. \\"Als hat er sich Reversiren mussen Innerhalb 14 Tage wiederumb einzustellen; Weile es seine Gewohnheit war, wann etwas wichtiges solte vorgenomen werden da er sich in mitlerweile an seite hielte.\\" Lorentz' Journal (October 13, 1690). and Lawrence Westerbaen, the latter a refugee from St. Eustatius. Every remark of these men that might possibly be unfavorably construed was carefully noted by Lorentz in his diary. At a meeting of the council called by the governor with a view to ascertaining how these men stood, Captain Delicaet was quoted as having declared: \\"It is a difficult matter, for we have to do, not with common people, but with lords and princes.\\" The governor informed his significantly that he would know well enough what was prosper to do when the time for the payment approached. Among the planters the governor worked cautiously, drawing the loyal ones among them still more closely to his side. He was fully determined to be prepared \\"in case any should be inclined to rebellion.\\"Lorentz' Journal, (November 14 and 17, 1690).  Taxes  The time limit for the payment of the tax according to Lorentz's calculations was November 23; so on the 24th the latter called the council together again and had an itemized bill prepared for 20,000 rdl. 46½ styvers. This bill together with a letter was taken by the two professedly loyal councilorsThomas Berentsen and the secretary Joachim von Holten. Lorentz' Journal. (November 25, 1690). to Laporte on November 25. Two days later the director-general came before the council to read his reply in which he stated his reasons for refusing payment. The main argument advanced was that he had no orders from his chiefs to make any such payment.Lorentz' Journal, (November 27, 1690). After Laporte's departure the council decided, in view of the expected arrival on any day of three Brandenburg ships,Raule had sent 3 ships (Churprincess, Salamander, and Drache) to Guinea, and 2 (Churprinz and Fuchs) to St. Thomas. Schück, I, 231 (note 53). to institute judicial condemnatory proceedings after three days' elapse. Finally, on December 2 (O.S.), 1690, came the day of reckoning, when the vice-governor and his council marched over to the Brandenburg warehouse, with the Company's smith to break the lock, and a committee of inhabitants, mainly planters, to appraise the condemned goods.Francis (Frans) Martens, Lucas Volckers, Adrian (Ariaen) Sorgeloos, and Jacob Elias. Lorentz's Journal (December 2, 1690). On Laporte's refusal to accede to the council's formal demand to open the magazine and after vigorous protests and appeals by the Brandenburgers the doors were forcibly opened and the appraisal begun. Lorentz carefully notes in his journal Laporte's remark to Delicaet and Berentsen that \\"if they (the Brandenburgers) were as strong in the land as we (the Danes) we should not have done what we did.\\" He quotes this as an evidence of their \\"good(!) intentions\\" and of \\"what they had up their sleeves.\\" By Christmas Eve, two of the Brandenburg warehouses had practically been empties of all their sugar and cotton.Lorentz' Journal (December 24, 1690). The value was estimated by the director-general at 24,652 pieces-of-eight, remarkable precision, considering that he had refused to send a representative to participate in the weighing.Lorentz' Journal (December 2/12, and December 8/18, 1690); Schück, I, 232.  Seizure  The seizure was not carried out without a certain danger to the colony. Meetings were held on the quiet at the houses of various planters, and were attended by the Brandenburg officials. At some of these gatherings anti-Company indignation found vent. Thomas Berentsen, one of Lorentz's most trusted councilors, who tried to investigate one of these meetings, found Laporte and all the Brandenburg employees there as well as an English captain from st. Kitts, one \\"Callehan\\" and several planters. Laporte himself forced Berentsen out through the door, uttered sundry threats against the Danes and accused him of being one of the demons of the Brandenburgers.Lorentz's Journal (December 19, 1690). The proposal to seize the Brandenburg houses and slaves was considered by the vice-governor and council, but was finally dropped as inexpedient.Lorentz' Journal (December 30, 1690). Three Brandenburg ships, the frigates Electoral Prince and Salamander, and a snow arrived in St. Thomas Harbor on March 7, having on board about four hundred men, and provided with a commission to seize French ships.Lorentz's Journal (March 7, 1691); Cal. Col., 1689-92. No. 1382 (April 3, 1691). A snow is a two-masted, square rigged vessel. The arrival of the three vessels set numerous rumors afloat concerning their intentions; but their passports had been issued on August 18, preceding, over three months before the seizure of the sugar and cotton, hence any action they might have taken would have been entirely upon the authority of the captains and the St. Thomas officials of their company. As it was, Laporte confined himself to repeating his request for restitution of the confiscated goods and to making an offer of forty marines to supplement the weak garrison at the fort, both of which overtures were firmly but politely declined by Lorentz. The latter even sent in a further claim of his own for the balance of the rental, his estimated falling considerably short of that of the director- general.Lorentz' Journal, (March 10 and 17, 1691); Höst (p. 34) says sixty. The vessels left in a little over a month with only a part of the expected cargoes.Lorentz' Journal (April 10, 1691). Cf. Schück (I. 232), who asserts that they had to return empty. Meanwhile, a Brandenburg bark had left St. Thomas on January 8 to carry the news of the Danish company's violence to Emden and Berlin.Lorentz' Journal (January 8, 1691). With that the scene of interest shifts from St. Thomas to Copenhagen, whither by June the Brandenburg envoy Pierre de Falaiseau had betaken himself to demand on behalf of his master the recall of Lorentz and the punishment of the guilty parties. Christian V hastened to send a letter to Lorentz (June 20) asking for an explanation and for the necessary documents. When in September the news came that Lorentz had seized the Electoral Princess and her cargo of slaves new force was added to the former complaint, and to persons outside of official circles it began to look as if the Esmit-Milan drama was to be acted over again in a revised version with Laporte in Stapleton's role.  Delays  The distance and the slowness of communication between the home government and the West Indian factories were bound to delay final action many months. The problem for the Danish government was no easy one, for it was forced officially to disavow the violence of its representative who had been guilty of nothing worse than carrying out the orders of the Company's directors.The close association between government and commercial enterprise in Denmark at this time is indicated in a statement by Hugh Greg, secretary of the English legation in Copenhagen, made in a letter to George Stepney, secretary of the Berlin legation, that \\"all the ministers here are merchants.\\" Danske Samlinger, 2 R. IV, 212. The directors' orders to Lorentz were issued April 9, 1690. Mariager MS., 93. The loosely drawn provisions in the treaty of 1685 were the main obstacles to satisfactory settlement. As the Elector's envoy Falaiseau and his colleague expressed it, \\"if M. Raule had drawn up a clearer contract, he would have spared us considerable trouble, but it is all over now.\\"Falaiseau and Worckum to Frederick III. Schück, I, 233, n. 63 (February 6/16, 1692). The exigencies of the war had nevertheless forced the two states to consider a closer alliance, so a temporary settlement of the St. Thomas difficulties was hastily concluded on April 11/21, and ratified by Christian V on April 23 (O.S.), 1692. A supplementary agreement of June 10/20 fixed the mode in which payment should be carried out.Schück, II, 398 (NO. 137a; Interims-Vergleich mit Dänemark wegen St. Thomas); 403 (No. 137b: Dänische Ratifikation); 405 (No. 137c: Neben Rezess zum Interims-Vergleich). It was arranged that the seized goods, the value of which was fixed at 16,000 rdl., should be restored to the Brandenburg company with such other seizures of ships or goods as might have been made thereafter; and that for the next three years the Brandenburg African Company should pay 3,000 rdl. annually in lieu of all other sums due or claimed, the sum to be paid yearly to the Danish company through the Hamburg bank.  Difficulties  The difficulties with the Danish authorities at St. Thomas had led the Brandenburg government to make renewed efforts to secure an independent foothold in the West Indies. Again they tried to take possession of Crab Island, but when the Brandenburg party arrived there on December 19, 1692, they found the Danes already on the ground and their Dannebrog banner defiantly waving above them.Schück, I, 233. Dannebrog is the popular designation for the flag of Denmark. John Lorentz, who continued in off ad interim until the proprietor Thormöhlen could provide a governor, had sent a captain with some men to Crab Island a few days before the Brandenburg bark made its landing. Though Laporte spread rumors threatening forcible seizure of the island, no further serious efforts were made in that direction.Lorentz to directors (June 6, 1693). C. B., 1690–1713. The Tobago negotiations were renewed and a treaty made with Duke Frederick Casimir who had only recently married the Elector Frederick's sister, Elizabeth Sophie; but England still refused to give up her claims to the island.Schück, I, 234. St. Eustatius likewise came in for attempts. The French had captured it from the Dutch in 1689, but had been forced in 1690 to surrender it to the English,Cal. Col., 1689-92, Nos. 65 (April 3, 1689), 1004 (August 3, 1690). who in turn delivered it up to the Dutch in 1692.Cal. Col., No. 2010 (January 14, 1692). The English were naturally unwilling to give up an island originally belonging to an ally;Schück, I, 235. Cf. \\"Neues Oktroi . . .\\" of September 14/24, 1692 (¶4), in Schück, II, 417. and of course the Dutch had no desire to surrender their most valuable slave trading factory in the Leeward Islands.  Death  Lorensen died in 1702. According to Knox, \\"he was a worthy and faithful officer, and his death was much regretted, both by the company and Mr. Thormøhlen, into whose plans he had warmly entered. His salary had been only four hundred rix-dollars, with perquisites, no doubt, appertaining to his office.\\"Knox, Account, 64 Note that Knox also claims Lorensen was alive in 1707 when St. Thomas was visited by Père Labat.Knox, Account, 62 It is likely that the correct year is 1701, as Labat was only in the West Indies from 1694 to 1706.

College career Goodwin transferred from Texas A&M;–Kingsville to Texas A&M; in 1993. While in Kingsville, he was a Lone Star Conference award recipient as a tight end. He walked on to the Texas A&M; football team and soon received a full scholarship. He played as an offensive tackle for the Aggies for two years where he was an All-Southwest Conference pick, second team All-American, and GTE Scholar Athlete. Throughout his college career, he received All-Conference honors at two different schools at two different positions. Goodwin graduated from Texas A&M; with a degree in agricultural economics. NFL Goodwin was the 97th pick of the 1996 draft to the Minnesota Vikings as a tight end. He played as a tight end in the NFL for nine years: five with Minnesota, and three with the Miami Dolphins. Although he signed with Atlanta in March 2004, he was forced to retire four months later due to a hip injury. While in the NFL, he served as Team Captain in the 1999 and 2000 seasons. He was also an NFL Players Representative for three years, a 2002 USA Today All-Joe pick, and a spokesman for several commercials, including a nationally televised Snickers commercial. Goodwin was also a draft day commentator for various Austin, Texas media outlets. While Goodwin logged only 37 catches and two touchdowns throughout his pro career, he was known more for his blocking abilities. Goodwin was picked up by the Miami Dolphins in 1999 while he was a restricted free agent by then head coach, Jimmy Johnson. Johnson paid for him to come in and improve their running game, and Goodwin did. A high point in his career came in 2000 when Merril Hoge dubbed Goodwin as \\"the best blocking tight end in the league\\" in one of his ESPN commentaries. Many believe that 2000 was Goodwin's best year. Hoge went on to say that Goodwin can easily handle any defensive end with no help drastically improving the offensive line. When Goodwin was awarded the \\"All Joe\\" pick, his teammates were quoted as saying that he is the sixth offensive lineman. Personal Goodwin's charity and volunteer work have included Habitat For Humanity, numerous visits to the children's hospitals in the Metropolitan area, the Cystic Fibrosis foundation in Miami, and Special Olympics. He has a first cousin who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and Goodwin has been quoted as saying, \\"if only all kids could be as smart and well adjusted as he is\\"). Goodwin participated each year in the Miami Dolphins Fishing Tournament in which the proceeds are used to help the Cystic Fibrosis foundation. Goodwin, an avid outdoorsman, caught the largest tuna in the 1999 tournament. Goodwin currently works as a real estate developer and vice president of Oldham Goodwin Group, LLC. He resides in College Station, Texas with his wife, Amber (also Texas A&M; University Class of 1997), and daughter Ella Grace.

History =Intermediate School= The school opened on 5 October 1896 in Talbot Street as a co-educational Intermediate school under the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889. It was known locally as Gowerton County School. =Grammar school= In May 1940, the Talbot Street school became a boys' grammar school when a girls' grammar school opened on Cecil Road. =Comprehensive= The school in its present form was created in 1973 from the merger of Gowerton Girls' Grammar School and Gowerton Boys' Grammar School. The Upper School was at Cecil Road and the Middle School was on Talbot Road. In 1987 the school was centralised on the Cecil Road (former girls' school) site. Gowerton School today serves pupils from the north and west of the Gower peninsula and from the Swansea suburbs of Gowerton, Waunarlwydd and Dunvant from age 11 to 18, with a successful sixth form specialising in A level and Welsh Baccalaureate courses. ESTYN inspections in 1994, 2000, 2005, 2011 and 2017 have been consistently good. The 2011 inspection report under the new Welsh inspection framework noted the school's outstanding ethos, inspiring leadership, good performance and excellent prospects, with high academic expectations and achievements, excellent care for pupil welfare and sector leading use of ICT in teaching. In July 2013, parents supported boys wearing skirts as they had not been permitted to wear school shorts or to roll their trousers up during particularly hot summer weather. Location The school is located off Cecil Road in Gowerton. Opposite the school's entrance on Park Road is Ysgol Gyfun Gŵyr, a Welsh speaking school that used to house the Boy's Grammar School. School layout The school is large compared to other secondary schools in the UK. It has three main blocks, a block consisting of demountable buildings and an additional block. * 'A' block houses the main entrance/reception, office, main hall, canteen, gymnasium and the English and modern foreign language departments. * 'B' block houses mathematics, design and technology, religious education and the STF unit. It also houses the main literacy block for those pupils with problems with literacy. It also houses the pupil support offices and houses the sixth form canteen and common room. A pair of science rooms are located in the block. * 'C' block houses the arts and humanities departments. * 'D' block houses the Welsh language department and also houses the school nurse's room. There is also a drama room, sports hall with male and female changing rooms, weights room and a Business Studies/Psychology room. * 'F' block is used for science and is the newest building, constructed in 2009. In addition to the main blocks there are also the tennis courts, two playing fields and a redgra adjacent to F Block and C Block.

It had a population of 245 as of the 2016 census, down from 285 in the 2011 census. Crookstown is part of the Cork North-West (Dáil constituency). History To the south of Crookstown village is the ruin of the 16th century Clodagh Castle, once home to one of the branches of the McSweeney clan. Another ruined castle, Castlemore Castle or Dundrinan Castle, lies to the north of the village. Crookstown Road railway station, located close to Castlemore Castle approximately 2 km from the village centre, operated as a stop on the Cork and Macroom Direct Railway from 1866 until services on the line ceased in the 1940s. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) was active around Crookstown during the Irish War of Independence, and Crookstown House, an estate house owned by the Warren family was burnt-out by the IRA in June 1921. It was later rebuilt. According to biographer Tim Pat Coogan, Michael Collins was likely on his way to a meeting in Crookstown when he was killed in an ambush at nearby Béal na Bláth during the Irish Civil War. Geography Crookstown is approximately 30 km from Cork City, and 4 km from Béal na Bláth. It lies between the River Bride and River Brouen, and in 2012 was subject to flooding when both rivers burst their banks. Economy Crookstown is a rural village with a number of shops, pubs and other businesses. A large mill, built c.1810 at Bellmount close to the village, was once economically important to the area. The area is now better known for its brick and concrete factory at Castlemore. Amenities The Crookstown area is served by a Garda station and post office. Local sports clubs include Crookstown United (which fields teams in the Munster Football Association's 'shipping league') and Crookstown Karate Club (members of which have competed in national and international competition).

At the time of the line's closure in 1959 this was the oldest operational electric locomotive in the British Isles. The Hellingly Hospital Railway was a light railway owned and operated by East Sussex County Council, used for transporting coal and passengers to Hellingly Hospital, a psychiatric hospital near Hailsham, from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway's Cuckoo Line at Hellingly railway station. The railway was constructed in 1899 and opened to passengers on 20 July 1903, following its electrification in 1902. After the railway grouping of 1923, passenger numbers declined so significantly that the hospital authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and that service was withdrawn. The railway closed to freight in 1959, following the hospital's decision to convert its coal boilers to oil, which rendered the railway unnecessary. The route took a mostly direct path from a junction immediately south of Hellingly Station, past Farm and Park House Sidings, stopping places to load and unload produce and supplies from outbuildings of the hospital. Much of the railway has been converted to footpath, and many of the buildings formerly served by the line are now abandoned. Construction and opening Hellingly Station in the early 20th century, showing the wooden platform before it was shortened In 1897, East Sussex County Council purchased of land at Park Farm, about three miles (5 km) north of Hailsham, from the Earl of Chichester, to be the site of a new county lunatic asylum that became Hellingly Hospital. Construction work on the hospital began in 1900, to the design of George Thomas Hine, Retrieved on 20 June 2008. who had designed the nearby Haywards Heath Asylum. Building materials were transported to the site by a mile (2 km) standard gauge private siding from the goods yard at Hellingly railway station on the Cuckoo Line. The connection was built by the asylum's builders, Joseph Howe & Company, and was authorised by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) on condition that East Sussex Council paid the cost, estimated at £1,700. A small wooden platform was built at Hellingly railway station, opposite the main line platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used only for the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off when not in use. Coal yards and sidings were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903. Route Route of the Hellingly Hospital RailwayThe railway left the Cuckoo Line at Hellingly Station. Although the railway joined the Cuckoo Line at both the northern and southern ends of the platform, virtually no through trains ran. Due to the arrangement of the lines at the junction with the Cuckoo Line, passenger trains to and from the hospital reversed south of Hellingly station. After leaving the main line immediately south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on the west of the line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce in the early years of the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from here to the hospital at 1 in 50.Railway Magazine December 1950 pp. 869-873 H. R. Stones The Hellingly Hospital Railway About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe. As it approached the hospital, the line split; the southern fork led to a siding to the north-west of the hospital, while the other turned sharply east and south through almost 180° before splitting again. One fork ran into a large workshop and the other led to a short platform, which was initially used for passengers. Following the suspension of passenger services it was converted into a coal dock. The line had no signals or automatic points to control the switching between lines at junctions with the main line and with the sidings. On the approach to a level crossing the fireman ran ahead with a red flag, to stop the traffic; he also manually operated the points. Motive power Joseph Howe & Company used an 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive to transport building materials during the hospital's construction. The locomotive was purchased new in 1900, and sold in 1903 following the completion of the hospital and electrification of the line. In 1902, the decision was taken to electrify the railway using power generated from the hospital's own power plant, the line was electrified at 500 V DC using a single overhead line. The hospital was also connected to the local 11 kV electricity distribution system. Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co provided a small 0-4-0 electric locomotive capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It is not known where the locomotive was manufactured, as the company has no record, but the design of the controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small railcar with space for 12 passengers was also provided. The locomotive and the railcar were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from the overhead wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and the locomotive from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational electric locomotive in the British Isles. Retrieved on 29 May 2008. Operations Layout of LBSCR (dotted) and HHR (solid) lines and platforms at Hellingly station At the railway grouping of 1923, the LBSCR became part of the Southern Railway and the agreements between the hospital (renamed the East Sussex Mental Hospital in 1919) and the LBSCR were updated. The wooden platform at Hellingly station was drastically shortened in 1922. Because service levels depended on patient numbers and the hospital's coal and food requirements, the line never operated to a timetable. By 1931, passenger numbers had fallen to such an extent that the hospital authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and the passenger service was withdrawn. The passenger car was moved to the hospital grounds, fitted with an awning, and became the hospital's sports pavilion. surviving into the mid-1990s before being destroyed in a fire started by vandals. The wooden platform at Hellingly station was removed in 1932, and the platform at the hospital was converted into a coal bay. There were only two minor accidents: a car that collided with the locomotive whilst driving through the hospital grounds, and a wagon whose brakes failed whilst stabled at Farm Siding, which rolled down the line to Hellingly station. On 22 November 1939, plans were put in place for the restoration of passenger services to allow ambulance trains to reach the hospital, and authorisation was given for their operation. However, the line was never used to transport patients, as although Park House was used as a hospital by the Canadian Army during the Second World War, patients left ambulance trains at Hellingly station and were transferred to Park House by road. Closure In the late 1950s, the hospital, under the control of the Hailsham Hospitals Management Committee since the 1948 establishment of the National Health Service, decided to convert its boilers from coal to oil. The railway was therefore no longer needed to transport coal; the last load was delivered on 10 March 1959, and the empty coal wagon returned to Hellingly on 25 March 1959. Under the terms of the agreement between the hospital authorities, the LBSCR, and its successors, the hospital authorities were obliged to keep the railway in good repair to allow its use by main-line wagons. With a greatly reduced need for goods traffic to the hospital following the conversion of the boilers, it was decided that the railway was not worth the expense of continued maintenance and necessary upgrading, and the line was officially closed on 25 March 1959 following the departure of the last coal wagon. The line was used for occasional excursions by railway enthusiasts for a short period after official closure, using the electric locomotive and a brake van borrowed from British Railways. The exact date of the last run is not recorded; the last recorded use of the line was an excursion organised by the Norbury Transport and Model Railway Club on 4 April 1959, but it is known that later excursions ran. In the early 1960s a railway society in Yorkshire proposed to buy the track as a preserved railway. However, as the psychiatric hospital was still open the request was not considered practical, and the track was lifted in the early 1960s. The fittings and locomotive were disposed of by H.Ripley and Sons of Hailsham. Present day Hellingly station, 2008 The Cuckoo Line closed shortly after the Hospital Railway. Hellingly station closed to passengers on 14 June 1965, and the line closed for goods traffic on 26 April 1968. The station building complete with platform is now a private residence, and the Cuckoo Line trackbed was converted to the Cuckoo Trail long-distance footpath in 1990. Much of the route of the Hospital Railway is also now a footpath. Traces of the railway can still be seen, including a cast iron pole that supported the overhead wire, the remains of the engine shed (burnt down in 2004), and a short section of track. Hellingly Hospital is now closed Approval for redevelopment as a housing complex was obtained in 2009.

Seventh Day School Geography Geographically, Nedumkandam lies in between the Periyar Tiger reserve/Thekkady and the hill station of Munnar. It is known as the land of migratory farmers, most of whom have migrated from Central Travancore areas like Kottayam, Palai, Kothamangalam and Muvattupuzha in search of better agricultural land in the 1960s to 1980s period. The land occupies the modern nedumkandum was either bought by the migrants from the native tribal people who were the traditional inhabitants of the land or was encroached from the then evergreen rain forests of western ghat. Most of these forests have now converted to agricultural lands or gave-way to the modern township. The major agriculture crops produced here are cash-crops like cardamom, pepper and coffee. Besides there are a wide variety of other cash crops like tea,ginger, clove,coco,nutmeg etc. are also cultivated in small scales, in some areas according to geographic conditions available Location The town of Nedumkandam is situated along the sides of Thekkady and Munnar state highway almost midway between these two famous tourist destinations in western ghat and it extends a stretch of approx. 3 km. As a town with a history of less than four decades, it is a testimony to the high rate of migration from the low lands of Kerala in that time span where elephants roamed until the early sixties. It has evolved as a major township for the neighboring villages with Hospitals, Educational institutions, Banks and a spate of Government offices littered among the business centers. Pepper and cardamom are the mainstays of the economy. Pepper cultivation is predominantly a Malayalee activity. Land holdings are small, generally ranging from 10 cents to and a couple of cows for a family are common. In the dawn hours, riders with pails of milk can be seen descending to the town from their boards in the hills around Nedumkandam. The milk, collected by societies and carted off to Kochi, Kottayam etc. has sustained many a family in the lean years after their pepper vines were decimated by the wilt disease. Cardamom farms are larger and about half of the owners are Tamilians whose parents ascended the ghats from Cumbam, Bodinaikanur areas of Tamil Nadu to cultivate the forest soils of the Cardamom Hill Reserve areas.

Charlotte Mary Stourton was married to Catherine Winifred Weld's brother, Joseph Weld. They were always on friendly terms, and she came to place great trust in him: she appointed him one of the executors of her will, and to act for her as her man of business generally, in her last years. Most crucially, he was one of her trustees who acted for her in regard to the destruction of her private papers. He was a witness on the celebrated occasion, 24 August 1833, when she permitted the Duke of Wellington to burn a horde of her private papers relating to her secret marriage to George IV.Longford, Elizabeth Wellington-Pillar of State Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1972, p. 288. At her special request a number of documents which she particularly valued, including her marriage certificate, were preserved and deposited in Coutts Bank, sealed and witnessed by Stourton.Leslie, p. 13. Quite separate from these papers was the memoir which Mrs Fitzherbert dictated to Lord Stourton, and which he preserved. This contains invaluable evidence about her marriage to the future George IV, and of their years together. On one crucial and much debated subject- whether there were any children of the marriage- she remained reticent. Stourton, who attributed her reticence to \\"natural delicacy\\" apparently believed that she was implying that there were no children. Soon after Mrs. Fitzherbert's death, Stourton took great offence at the publication of the Memoirs of Lord Holland, which claimed that she had never regarded herself as more than a royal mistress.Leslie, p. 13. Stourton appealed to the Duke of Wellington to release the crucial documents, including the certificate which proved that a marriage had taken place, and which were still in Coutts Bank (although the marriage violated the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the certificate would show that Mrs Fitzherbert was, according to the laws of her own Church, lawfully married). The Duke, acting on the wishes of Queen Victoria, who detested any reminder of the Fitzherbert marriage,Apparently due to the rumours about children of the marriage, who might use the evidence of a lawful marriage to contest the succession. refused. The conscientious Stourton made several further appeals, but the Duke remained implacable.Longford, p. 319. William at his death entrusted his brother Charles with the task of publishing the truth about the royal marriage. Charles was unable to obtain the documents deposited in Coutts Bank, but he used his brother's memoir as the basis for his biography of Mrs. Fitzherbert, published in 1856.Leslie, p. 13.

See Old Book of Tang, vol. 194, part 1 and New Book of Tang, vol. 140, part 1.), personal name Ashina Simo (阿史那思摩), Chinese name Li Simo (李思摩), full regal title Yiminishuqilibi Khagan (乙彌泥孰俟力苾可汗), Tang noble title Prince of Huaihua (懷化王), was a member of the Eastern Tujue (Göktürk) royal house who was given the title of Khan of Eastern Tujue for several years, as a vassal of the Chinese Tang Dynasty.  Background  After Emperor Taizong of Tang conquered Eastern Tujue in 630, he briefly settled the Eastern Tujue people within Tang borders, but after a failed assassination attempt against him by a member of the Eastern Tujue royal house, Ashina Jiesheshuai in 639, he changed his mind and decided to resettle the Eastern Tujue people between the Great Wall and the Gobi Desert, to serve as a buffer between Tang and Xueyantuo. He created Ashina Simo, a member of Eastern Tujue's royal house as well, as Yiminishuqilibi Khan (or Qilibi Khan for short), and Ashina Simo served as the khan of the recreated Eastern Tujue khanate for several years. However, in 644, faced with constant pressure from Xueyantuo, Ashina Simo's people abandoned him and fled south back to Tang territory. Ashina Simo himself also returned to Tang and served as a Tang general until his death, probably in 645.  During the reigns of Ashina Duojishi, Ashina Silifu, and Ashina Duobi  He was born in 583. What is known is that he was of the same royal Ashina clan as the khans of Tujue, a grandson of Taspar Qaghan His father Tugruq Shad (咄六設) was a son of Taspar, which would make him to senior to Shibi Khagan, Chuluo Khagan and Illig Khagan who were brothers to each other and who successively served as khans. Despite Ashina Simo's royal lineage, it was said that on account of his appearance, which appeared more Sogdian than Tujue, Ashina Duojishi and Ashina Chuluo both suspected him of being born out of an adulterous relationship, and therefore did not entrust him with great authorities. Throughout their reigns, he thus only carried the title of Jiabi Tegin (夾畢特勒), and could not be a general. According to Suzuki Kosetsu, it was a political situation created by Issik Khagan's descendants, who did not want succession crisis. In 624, during a dispute that Eastern Tujue had with China's Tang Dynasty, which was then a vassal of Eastern Tujue, as part of the negotiations, Ashina Duobi sent Ashina Simo to meet with Emperor Gaozu of Tang, and Emperor Gaozu honored Ashina Simo with the title of Prince of Heshun. Late in Ashina Duobi's reign, with Tang strengthening and Eastern Tujue weakening due to internal problems, many of Eastern Tujue tribes surrendered to Tang, and while apparently Tang made overtures to Ashina Simo, Ashina Simo remained faithful to Ashina Duobi. His faithfulness to Ashina Duobi continued even after Emperor Gaozu's son Emperor Taizong launched a major attack commanded by the general Li Jing in 629—such that when Tang forces captured Ashina Duobi in 630, Ashina Simo remained with him and was captured with him. Emperor Taizong was impressed with Ashina Simo's faithfulness and made him a general and a commandant, in command of the people formerly directly under Ashina Duobi. He also created Ashina Simo the Prince of Huaihua in 23 July 630.  As khagan  Emperor Taizong initially settled the Eastern Tujue people within Tang borders, but after a failed assassination attempt against him by Ashina Duojishi's son Ashina Jiesheshuai in 639, he changed his mind. On August 13, 639,兩千年中西曆轉換 he created Ashina Simo (who was by this point also given the imperial clan surname Li and therefore also known as Li Simo) as the Yiminishuqilibi Khan (or Qilibi Khan for short) and ordered the settled Tujue people to follow Ashina Simo north of the Yellow River to settle between the Great Wall and the Gobi Desert. The Tujue people, fearful of Xueyantuo — a former Eastern Tujue vassal that had become powerful and taken over Eastern Tujue's former territory — initially refused. Emperor Taizong thereafter issued an edict to Xueyantuo's Zhenzhu Khan, Yi'nan, delivered by his official Guo Siben (郭嗣本), ordering Xueyantuo not to attack the newly reestablished Eastern Tujue. Yi'nan, while displeased at the development, initially agreed. Emperor Taizong then carried out a formal creation ceremony for Ashina Simo, presided by the great general Li Xiaogong, and also held an imperial feast in Ashina Simo's honor. He created the Eastern Tujue princes Ashina Zhong (阿史那忠) and Ashina Nishu (阿史那泥熟) as Ashina Simo's assistants. In spring 641, Ashina Simo's people finally crossed the Yellow River, and he established his headquarters at Dingxiang (定襄, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). He was said to have 30,000 households, 40,000 troops, and 90,000 warhorses. He submitted a petition to Emperor Taizong, stating: Emperor Taizong agreed. In winter 641, indeed, with Yi'nan anticipating that Emperor Taizong would soon be offering sacrifices to heaven and earth at Mount Tai and would take his soldiers with him, he believed that he could destroy Ashina Simo quickly. He therefore had his son Dadu (大度) to head Xueyantuo troops, along with conscripted troops from vassal tribes Tongluo (同羅), Pugu (僕骨), Huige, Mohe, and Xi (霫), launch a major attack on Eastern Tujue. Ashina Simo could not resist the attack, and withdrew within the Great Wall to Shuo Prefecture (朔州, roughly modern Shuozhou, Shanxi) and sought emergency aid. Emperor Taizong sent the generals Zhang Jian, Li Shiji, Li Daliang, Zhang Shigui (張士貴), and Li Xiyu (李襲譽), to attack Xueyantuo to assist Ashina Simo, with Li Shiji in overall command. Around the new year 642, Li Shiji dealt a major defeat to Dadu, who fled after heavy casualties. Emperor Taizong, while sending an emissary to rebuke Yi'nan, did not take further actions against Xueyantuo at this point. It was said that Yi'nan continued to be unhappy with Eastern Tujue's existence, and continued to harass Eastern Tujue. (Yi'nan, however, tried to maintain peaceful relations with Tang, and at one point was engaged to marry Emperor Taizong's daughter Princess Xinxing, but Emperor Taizong regretted the marriage agreement and broke it in 643 under the pretense that Yi'nan's offer of bride price (with livestock) was not paid for on time.) When Emperor Taizong sent further emissaries to order Yi'nan from attacking Eastern Tujue, Yi'nan's response was: Around the new year 645, Ashina Simo's people, apparently under the Xueyantuo pressure, collapsed and abandoned Ashina Simo. (At this time, Emperor Taizong was deep in his preparation to attack Goguryeo, and therefore, if Xueyantuo had attacked, might not have been able to protect Eastern Tujue.) They crossed the Yellow River south, seeking to be settled among Sheng (勝州, also in modern Hohhot, but south of the Yellow River) and Xia (夏州, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi) Prefectures. Despite officials' opposition, Emperor Taizong agreed, and did so. Ashina Simo, with his reconstituted state in shambles, also returned to China, and was again made a Tang general, ending Tang's attempt to recreate Eastern Tujue as a vassal.  After return to Tang  Emperor Taizong soon launched a major attack on Goguryeo, and Ashina Simo followed Emperor Taizong on the campaign. During siege of Baekam (백암성), Ashina Simo was injured by an arrow, and it was said that Emperor Taizong personally sucked the pus out of his wound, which greatly inspired the soldiers.Zhizhi Tongjian, vol 197 Taizong himself also tended to the injury of another Turkic General who was wounded during the war against Goguryeo, Qibi Heli.Skaff 2012, p. 95. It was said that after Ashina Simo returned to the Tang capital Chang'an (implying that this is after the end of the campaign in fall 645), he died. He was buried with great honors near the tomb of Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun, where Emperor Taizong would eventually be buried himself as well.

During his tenure, he began a mission at Trois-Rivières, founded the community at Sillery, and saw the establishment of the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec. Biography Le Jeune was born to a Huguenot family in Vitry-le-François in the region of Champagne, France in 1591, and converted to Roman Catholicism at the age of sixteen.Jaenen, Cornelius J., \\"Paul Le June\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia Le Jeune received a thorough preparation for the Jesuit priesthood; he was a novice for two years between 1613 and 1615, and he was deeply influenced by his mentor Father Massé, whom he met at the collège Henri IV de La Flèche. During his studies, Le Jeune developed a keen interest in missions and became convinced that education was a key element in any successful attempt to spread Christianity. After finishing his philosophical studies Father Le Jeune was a teacher at the colleges in Rennes (1618–19) and Bourges (1619–22).Pouliot, Léon. \\"Le Jeune, Paul\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 1979 In 1624, Le Jeune was ordained, and in 1632 he was named superior of the Jesuit mission in Canada. He had not requested the posting to New France, but accepted without complaint and embarked from Le Havre with two companions on 18 April 1632. It was a difficult voyage and the forty year old Le Jeune was terribly seasick. They arrived a Tadoussac on June 18, 1632. New France Le Jeune's first year was spent in the French settlements.

While his work during those six months did not result in mass conversions as he had hoped, his ethnographic account of the Montagnais and his personal anecdotes about the cold, hunger, and conflicts he encountered are recorded in Relations des Jésuites de la Nouvelle-France of 1634.

Koemer suggests that Le Jeune's identification of a distinction between animate and inanimate nouns eventually assisted John Eliot in his grammar of the Natick language.Koemer, E.F.K., Essays in the History of Linguistics, John Benjamins Publishing, 2004 Le Jeune decided that in order to effectively carry out his apostolate, he needed to establish mission settlements, on the model of Jesuit missionary work in San Ignacio Miní in Misiones Argentina and bordering region of Paraguay, a hospital to care for the aged and the ill, and schools for educating the young. He wrote: \\"I believe that souls are all made of the same stock, and that they do not materially differ; Hence, these barbarians having well formed bodies, and organs well regulated and well arranged, their minds ought to work with ease. Education and instruction alone are lacking.\\"Vessey, Mark; Betcher, Sharon; Daum, Robert and Maier, Harry O., The Calling of the Nations, University of Toronto Press, 2015 Le Jeune encouraged his missionaries to learn the native languages. In 1634 he sent Father Jacques Buteux to the trading post at Trois- Rivières to instruct the indigenous people who used it as a summer stopping place.Campbell, T.J., \\"Paul Le Jeune\\", Pioneer priests of North America, 1642-1710, Vol. 3, Fordham University Press, 1910 In 1635 a Jesuit college to educate French and Amerindian boys was established in Quebec,Fay, Terence J., History of Canadian Catholics, MQUP, 2002, 9780773523135 with Antoine Daniel in charge, but closed after five years. That December Le Jeune preached the sermon at Samuel de Champlain's funeral. In a 1637 letter he cautions all missionaries not to make the “savages” wait for them when embarking in the morning, to never show distaste for any of their customs, and to help out during portages, or over-land journeys, from one river to another.\\"Early Missions - French\\", The Catholic University of America That same year he laid the foundation of a house for missionaries at Sillery, named after benefactor Noël Brûlart de Sillery, who provided the funds. Le Jeune found that devotional images helped a good deal in conveying ideas he was trying to express. Fleming, Patricia; Gallichan, Gilles and Lamonde, Yvan. History of the Book in Canada: Beginnings to 1840, University of Toronto Press, 2004 Religious processions had an important civic function. Le Jeune recorded a celebration held in Quebec in 1639 honoring the birth of Louis XIV. Along with fireworks and cannon salutes, a procession was held in conjunction with the Feast of the Assumption, in which the French and more than a hundred Indians, six of them dressed in sumptuous French royal garments, processed from the hospital, to the Ursuline convent, and finally to the Jesuit church. Prayers were said in both French and the local Indian language, and when the procession ended, the Governor provided a feast for all in attendance. The procession had become a centerpiece of the fragile multicultural community.Angelo, Mary P. \\"Seventeenth-Century Jesuit Missionary Processions in New France\\", The Newberry By 1639 there were less than 100 converts among the Hurons, who numbered several thousands. Le Jeune and his contemporaries did not limit their efforts in conversions and education to Native Americans. While there were fewer slaves in the French colonies than in the English and Spanish ones, Le Jeune's interactions with African slaves in Quebec set a key precedent that would inspire later generations of priests, teachers, activists, and abolitionists. Jesuit practice viewed all people as equal before God and as having equal need for salvation. Thus, it was incumbent on the Church to provide for the intellectual and spiritual well-being of slaves. Le Jeune himself adopted a very direct approach to this issue. As early as 1634, Le Jeune expressed enthusiasm because he found himself teaching African children the alphabet, and in Volume V of The Jesuit Relations he emphasized the need for Africans to gain sufficient learning and literacy so that they could demonstrate enough of an understanding of Catholic dogma to secure the rite of baptism. Since Jesuits consistently emphasized the role of the intellect, it is logical that they advocated education for slaves throughout the colonies. Most of the priests' work was with slave children; unlike adults, they were granted time away from their masters for basic schooling, and since so much cultural disruption had already taken place, slave parents were not generally viewed as opponents to education in the same way that Native American parents were. In their work with the children of colonists, slaves, and Native Americans, Le Jeune and his fellow Jesuits used the same sort of materials, such as a primer or hornbook that were used throughout the North American colonies. These materials transmitted traditional European cultural and religious beliefs while they encouraged literacy. Teaching the catechism, biblical passages, and religious stories was, the Jesuits believed, the primary role of literacy in New France. He established the chapel of Notre Dame de Recouvrance in Quebec and assigned Fathers Charles Lallemant and Anne de Nouë to it. In August 1639 Sister Marie of the Incarnation arrived in Quebec. The Ursulines established a convent in the lower town (Basse- Ville).Fournet, Pierre Auguste. \\"Ven. Marie de l'Incarnation\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 2 April 2016 Also on board were three Canonesses of St. Augustine of the Mercy of Jesus to establish a hospital underwritten by Marie Madeleine d'Aiguillon, niece of Cardinal Richelieu in response to a report from Le Jeune that had been published in the Relations in France. Le Jeune remained the superior of the Jesuit mission until 1639 when he was replaced by Father Barthélemy Vimont, but he did not return to France until 1649. Upon his return, he served as the mission procurator of New France until 1662, only two years before his death. Long-term implications The writings and experiences of Le Jeune and his fellow Jesuits are reflected in the Code Noir passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685. This document outlined the rights of both slaves and their masters throughout the French colonies and notably advocated that slaves gain enough education that they would understand and embrace Catholicism. In fact, slave masters were required to offer access to baptism. Le Jeune’s influence was not limited to Canadian territories or seventeenth century Jesuits; when the French settled Louisiana, there was a clear sense that literacy and religion were interconnected. Even after Louisiana became part of the United States, Catholic priests and laypersons continued to advocate for slave literacy. Indeed, the lack of formal education for slaves became a key factor in the Catholic Church’s later support of Abolitionism. =Toponyms Le Jeune= In recognition of the work of the missionary life Paul Le Jeune, some geographic names have been assigned to this Jesuit who came from France, and founder of the hamlet of Trois-Rivières in 1634: * \\"Canton Le Jeune\\" (Township Le Jeune), Sainte-Thècle, Quebec.

The building originally served the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 13, 2009.  History  In 1929, the Riverside YWCA selected the corner of 7th (now Mission Inn Avenue) and Lime Streets as the site for its new building. The association's directors hired architect Julia Morgan to design the building over the objections of Frank Miller of the Mission Inn, who wanted an architect who would design the building in the Mission Revival Style architecture. Morgan used the Mediterranean Revival and Classical Revival styles in composing the design. In 1960, the Riverside Art Center began fundraising to purchase the YWCA building, which had recently come onto the market. On July 5, 1967, the YWCA officially sold the building to the Riverside Arts Center for $250,000. In 1982, the building was designated a Registered Historic Place and a city historic landmark. In 1992, a three-phase renovation of the building was undertaken with the financial assistance of the City of Riverside.  Architecture  The building combines elements of Mediterranean and Classical architecture in an \\"innovative tri-block design\\". The first floor originally housed a swimming pool, an open-air atrium, and a gymnasium. The second floor featured bedrooms, offices, and meeting rooms with a small stage. On the roof was a badminton court. A garden, and an outdoor fireplace were added in the late 1930s as a memorial to Ruth Muir, former Secretary (Executive Director), after she was brutally assaulted and murdered at the age of 48, while vacationing in La Jolla.

Tullow has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange. It has secondary listings on the Ghana Stock Exchange and Irish Stock Exchange. Tullow has interests in over 70 licenses across 14 countries with 28 producing fields and in 2019 produced on average 86,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Its largest activities are in Africa and South America, where it has discovered new oil provinces in Ghana, Uganda, Kenya and Guyana. Its main production comes from Ghana. The offshore Jubilee oil field which was discovered in 2007 and started production in December 2010 is Tullow's largest discovery. As of 31 December 2019 Tullow had group reserves of of oil equivalent including commercial reserves of of oil equivalent. History The company was founded by Aidan Heavey in 1985, in Tullow, Ireland as a gas exploration business operating in Senegal. Tullow listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange and Irish Stock Exchange in 1986 and the FTSE 100 index in September 2007. In 2000, Tullow acquired £201 million worth of gas fields and infrastructure in the North Sea from BP. At the same time, Tullow re-registered in the UK. In May 2004, Tullow completed the Energy Africa acquisition for $570 million. In 2006, the company began drilling its first well in Uganda and has since drilled circa 50 wells around the Lake Albert region. In 2007, Tullow drilled two deep water wells offshore Ghana discovering the massive Jubilee fieldGhana Discovers More Oil! Ghana web, 25 February 2008 – its largest ever discovery and the beginnings of proving up a second new major oil province. 2008–2009, was its next phase of growth with a major focus on Africa, based on delivering first oil in Ghana in 2010. In February 2010, the company initiated a \\"tax planning\\" exercise that was criticised by Heritage's counsel during the Heritage/Tullow court case in 2013, as an attempt to reduce the amount of tax the firm was liable to pay in Uganda. Richard Inch, Head of Tax at Tullow, firmly rejected the criticism whilst giving evidence in this case. In November 2010, the Jubilee field was brought on to production, in record time, some 40 months after its discovery. A new major discovery was also made at the Enyenra (Owo) and Tweneboa fields in Ghana during the year. In 2011, the company bought into twenty five Dutch, North Sea Gas fields and in March 2012, a new oil reserve was discovered in Kenya. In 2012, the company encountered non-commercial reservoirs at its Teak-4A well off Ghana leading to the well having to be plugged and abandoned. Tullow completed the purchase of Heritage Oil's licences in the Lake Albert area in 2010, for $1.45bn and on 21 February 2012, completed a farm down of two thirds of its interests to Total and CNOOC for $2.9 billion US. But Tullow and its partners have yet to reach agreement with the Government of Uganda over a plan to develop Lake Albert including a proposed refinery and export- pipeline. In 2012, there were some production delays at the Jubilee field but the Company announced on 13 February 2013, that production issues at the Jubilee field had been successfully and cost-effectively remediated and that production was now at around of oil per day with an expected 2013, year end exit rate of over of oil per day. The firm and its leadership were criticised in January 2013 after a decrease in its share price. This was reportedly because the company had failed to reach production targets at a project in Ghana because of 'operational hiccups'. This prompted the broker Investec to rate the company a 'sell' and decrease its target price. Also causing problems were the oil fields known as the TEN that Tullow discovered off the coast of Ghana. The fields were a significant find but the projected development cost of the fields was estimated to exceed $5 billion, which is too much for a firm of Tullow's size. The Company has suggested it may reduce its share in projects to help reduce the cost burden of developments. In Uganda, Tullow and its partners CNOOC and Total continues to work with the government of Uganda on the development plan for Lake Albert which is to include a local refinery and international pipeline. In April 2014, Tullow braced itself for a substantial investor backlash over excessive payouts to senior directors at the company. CEO Aidan Heavey came under particular scrutiny after it emerged that his pay had risen from £2.6 million to £2.8 million in 2013, despite Tullow's share price decreasing by as much as 30 percent during that period.Tullow faces pay backlash Sunday Times, April 2014 On 17 March 2017, Tullow announced a $750 million rights issue as the oil producer struggled with a very low oil price. Tullow generated production of 94,700 boepd in 2017. In 2018, Tullow produced . Company's founder Aidan Heavey retired from the board and Dorothy Thompson became the new chair of the board. In 2019, Tullow produced . CEO Paul McDade resigned in December 2019 and Dorothy Thompson was appointed as executive chair until a new CEO was appointed.In April 2020, Tullow announced that Rahul Dhir had been appointed as the new CEO with effect from July 2020. On 23 April 2020 Tullow announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets in Uganda to Total for US$575 million in cash plus post first oil contingent payments with an effective date of 1 January 2020. Operations Tullow Oil plc is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in Europe. The Group is focused on Africa and South America, where Tullow is already a dominant player following exploration success in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. The Group has interests in over 70 licences across more than 14 countries, producing from a total of 28 fields. In 2019, average working interest production was 86,800 barrels per day of oil equivalent, generating sales revenue of $1,683 million with capital expenditure of around $490 million. Major projects In late October 2013, Tullow announced it had plugged and abandoned a wildcat well offshore Norway in the Barents Sea due to ‘poor quality reservoir rock’. After prolonged exploration for oil and natural gas in French Guiana in partnership with Shell Oil, Tullow failed to find evidence of hydrocarbons in November 2013. In March 2014, Tullow Oil was forced to invoke a force majeure clause on its oil production project offshore Guinea after the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened a corruption investigation into the firm's partner in the project, Hyperdynamics Corporation. Tullow took over the concessions to the project only a year previously in April 2013, and had plans to start drilling for oil in the second quarter of 2014. The delay set Tullow back notably in Guinea and the firm will only resume operations when the issues are resolved. Controversies =Heritage Oil court case= Court proceedings at London's High Court commenced after Tullow Oil sued Heritage Oil in a claim that it was forced to pay Heritage's $313 million tax bill after Tullow acquired Heritage's Ugandan assets. In 2010, Tullow had paid Heritage $1.45 billion for its 50 percent share in two huge Ugandan oil fields - Blocks 1 and 3A. The Ugandan government initially demanded $405 million from Heritage in capital gains tax, and, with Heritage's agreement, Tullow paid the Ugandan Revenue Authority (URA) $121.5 million. This was a third of the original tax demand, as Ugandan tax rules required a one-third payment before Heritage could challenge the demand. Tullow placed the remaining $283.5 million into an escrow account, pending the outcome of the challenge, which left a reduced $1.045 billion payment that went directly to Heritage in exchange for the assets. However, in 2011, Tullow complied with another URA demand for a further $313.5 million payment, which was the balance of the original tax demand, plus an extra $30 million which the URA had added to the bill. Tullow signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with TOTAL and CNOOC on 30 March 2011. The second payment to the URA was made on 7 April 2011. The farm down to TOTAL and CNOOC was completed over 10 months later on 21 February 2012. The Total-CNOOC transaction netted Tullow $2.9 billion in a farm-down arrangement sanctioned by the government. Heritage claims that Tullow was motivated to pay the $313.5 million by the desire to help the deal go through. During the trial, it emerged that senior directors at Tullow had discussed making an \\"undocumented\\" $50 million payment to the Ugandan government before considering funding parts of President Yoweri Museveni's re-election campaign. Angus McCoss, an exploration director at Tullow, suggested to other executives in a group email in April 2010 that the company should pay for an oil licence to \\"meet the short term needs and demands\\" of President Museveni. Graham Martin, Tullow company secretary, responded firmly in court, saying this was an \\"outrageous suggestion\\".High Court Transcripts UK Foreign Minister William Hague was also dragged into the row after the High Court was told that the Foreign Office leaked official documents to Tullow Oil, while lobbying on the company's behalf. Tullow's vice president of Africa, Tim O’Hanlon, was also alleged to have suggested that Museveni slur Heritage as part of a deal to settle the tax dispute. Additionally, it was brought up that Tullow's CEO, Aidan Heavey, is a known donor to the Conservatives, having donated more than £50,000. President Museveni denied the bribery claims in an official statement on 18 March 2013. The statement caused some controversy for the court case as he went on to claim within that Tullow Oil completed the tax payment in order to successfully transact business within the country, a claim that Tullow denied in court. In a public statement in Uganda, Jimmy Mugerwa (Tullow Uganda) deeply regretted the embarrassment caused by \\"false allegations\\" and quoted a personal letter from Aidan Heavey to President Museveni which stressed Tullow's history of \\"fair and ethical dealings\\".The Daily Telegraph 2013: Tullow's Uganda relations less than slick. During the court case, Graham Martin, Tullow's General Counsel, was criticised by Heritage's QC for disposing of hand-written notes potentially relevant to the proceedings. Martin rejected the criticism and stated that he had destroyed the notes when he had periodically cleared his office in Kampala in 2010-12. On 14 June 2013, it was announced that Tullow Oil won the arbitration of the court case with Heritage Oil. =Political lobbying= In March 2013, British government ministers were implicated in receiving business-related donations from oil and resources companies including Tullow Oil. A report by the World Development Movement (a political campaigning group) alleged \\"that one third of ministers in the UK government are linked to the finance and energy companies driving climate change\\" and that \\"Government figures were embroiled in the nexus of money and power fuelling climate change include William Hague, George Osborne, Michael Gove, Oliver Letwin, Vince Cable and Prime Minister David Cameron himself. Both William Hague and Michael Gove were said to have connections to Tullow; Hague reportedly telephoned the president of Uganda to lobby for the firm's £175 million tax bill to be waived, while Tullow's CEO, Aidan Heavey, donated £10,000 to education secretary Gove before the 2010 general election. =Tax avoidance= In 2013, Platform London, an environmental campaigning group, released a report that alleged that Tullow Oil was avoiding UK tax by minimising the amount of profit that passes through the company’s UK books and routing it through an international network of subsidiaries instead. The report also accused the firm of exploiting international legal mechanisms in Uganda to avoid tax. Tullow's 2012 full year results show that the company has an effective tax rate across the 25 countries in which it works of 40%. =Tax dispute= In December 2012, reports surfaced in the press that Tullow Oil was subject to arbitration with the government of Uganda at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in the United States. The dispute arose after value added tax was imposed on goods and services that Tullow purchased for its oil exploration work in the country. The original case was filed in October 2012 at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and due to the case being under seal, the intricacies are not open to the public. Information on the ICSID website reveals that the basis of the court case relates to \\"petroleum exploration, development and production agreement\\". Tullow Oil is represented by Kampala Associated Advocates. In light of this legal representation, Peter Kabatsi, Uganda's former solicitor general and partner at Kampala Associated Advocates, has denied that he negotiated agreements with oil firms during his tenure as solicitor general, quashing claims of conflict of interest. The founder of Kampala Associated Advocates is Elly Kurahanga, the President of Tullow Uganda. Government sources said that the real cause for concern for Uganda is the manner in which it lost millions of dollars over the last decade – money that could have stayed in the country. A report by the organization Global Financial Integrity (GFI) reveals that illicit financial flows from Uganda between 2001 and 2012 amounted to $680 million; in Tullow's case however, the firm argues that it is challenging tax demands that non-governmental organizations like GFI and the Tax Justice Network say should go towards government investment in healthcare, education and infrastructure. =Bribery allegations= In 2011, the Attorney General of Uganda initiated Parliamentary investigations into bribery allegations levelled at Tullow Oil and three cabinet ministers, named as Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Kutesa and his internal affairs counterpart, Hilary Onek. Another MP, Gerald Karuhanga acted as the whistle blower when he submitted documents on the incident in Parliament during the October 2011 Special Oil Debate. On hearing the allegations, MPs also called for the accused to resign. On 11 April 2012, a Tullow Oil delegation appeared in front of an Ad Hoc committee of the Ugandan Parliament which was investigating these claims. A submission and supporting documents were handed over to the Committee – proving unequivocally that the allegations made against Tullow were false and based on forged documents. The submission to the Ad Hoc Committee can be downloaded from Tullow's website. After the investigation was announced, a lawyer, Severino Twinobusingye, sued the Attorney General in an attempt to block investigations into the bribery allegations, as well as calls for those accused to resign. Twinobusingye also wanted court to order for him to be paid for the costs incurred in the case. In March 2012, judges awarded Twinobusingye two-thirds of the total costs and decreed that the accused should not have to step down. In July 2012, the Constitutional Court threw out the Parliamentary Commission's intended appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the January 2012 ruling that blocked it from being party to the oil sector probe case. In February 2013, the court ordered the government to pay 12.9 billion shillings in costs to Twinobusingye in a move that was described as \\"very unprecedented in the country’s history\\". =Kenyan opposition to exploration= Tullow ran into difficulties in July 2013 after pastoralists in the Turkana County of Kenya rejected the firm's proposal to move to a new exploration site at the Twiga 2 oil site in the Lokichar basin. They complained that the ongoing oil exploration in the region has interfered with pasture land and that future pastures for their animals would be decimated. In late October 2013, local communities in Turkana County staged demonstrations demanding jobs and other benefits from any potential future operations in the region, prompting the firm to suspend drilling and sending the firm's share price down. The locals also managed to gain entry to facilities and two oil blocks, resulting in looting and vandalism. Resumption of drilling was only achieved after peace talks were agreed with local leaders in mid-November. =Illegal waste dumping= In July 2013, Tullow Oil was accused of dumping two trucks of human waste in Kakindo village in Western Uganda, causing serious health risks to locals and a number of diseases. The incident was blamed by the firm on its subcontractor, Saracen Uganda Limited, who in turn blamed another contractor they used. However, the incident did not do well for the firm's reputation in the country after it drew the wrath of members of parliament. Tullow claimed the entire responsibility lay with its contractors, who they believe were cutting corners. The incident was also not the first time the firm had been accused of illegal waste dumping, with reports in 2012 claiming the firm dumped toxic drilling waste in a game park and other areas occupied by people.

Philosophy and Music  Persimfans was formed during the early years of the Soviet Union. Because there was no conductor, major decisions were undertaken by committees and all members of the orchestra had to be familiar with the entire score. The quality of playing amazed many contemporaries who believed there must be a conductor hidden away behind the stage. Persimfans also inspired the formation of other conductorless orchestras throughout the Soviet Union and the West in the 1920s, but most only lasted for a few years.  Contemporary Revival  In 2008, a contemporary revival of Persimfans was created by Konstantin Dudalov- Kashuro, Peter Aidu and Gregory Krotenko under the aegis of the Moscow School of Dramatic Art's Music Laboratory. In 2014 Persimfans was awarded the Sergei Kuryokhin Contemporary Art Award.

They are usually made of a specially designed 7-ply maple plywood deck with a polyurethane coating for smoothness and durability and wheels attached to the underside by a pair of skateboarding trucks. The skateboarder moves by pushing with one foot with other foot balanced on the board, or by pumping one's legs in structures such as a bowl or half pipe. A skateboard can also be used by simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope and allowing gravity to propel the board and rider. If the rider's leading foot is their right foot, they are said to ride \\"goofy;\\" if the rider's leading foot is their left foot, they are said to ride \\"regular.\\" If the rider is normally regular but chooses to ride goofy, they are said to be riding in \\"switch,\\" and vice versa. A skater is typically more comfortable pushing with their back foot; choosing to push with the front foot is commonly referred to as riding \\"mongo\\", and has negative connotations of style and effectiveness in the skateboarding community. In the early 2000s, electric skateboards have also appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery. There is no governing body that declares any regulations on what constitutes a skateboard or the parts from which it is assembled. Historically, the skateboard has conformed both to contemporary trends and to the ever-evolving array of stunts performed by riders/users, who require a certain functionality from the board. The board shape depends largely upon its desired function. Longboards are a type of skateboard with a longer wheelbase and larger, softer wheels. The two main types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. The shape of the board is also important: the skateboard must be concaved to perform tricks. Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing, while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks and riding in skateparks. History Skateboarding started in California in the 1950s. The first skateboards were made from roller skates (attached to a board). Skateboarding gained in popularity because of surfing: in fact, skateboarding was initially referred to as \\"sidewalk surfing\\". Initially, skateboards were handmade from wooden boxes and planks by individuals. Companies started manufacturing skateboards in 1959, as the sport became more popular. In postwar America, society was carefree with children commonly playing in the streets. Boards were also continuing to evolve as companies tried to make them lighter, stronger and improve their performance. Skateboarding is a very individual activity. Skateboarding continues to evolve. Since 2000, due to attention in the media and products like skateboarding video games, children's skateboards and commercialization, skateboarding has been pulled into the mainstream. As more interest and money has been invested into skateboarding, more skate parks, and better skateboards have become available. In addition, the continuing interest has motivated skateboarding companies have to keep innovating and inventing new things. Skateboarding will appear for the first time in the 2020 Summer Olympics. Parts The following descriptions cover skateboard parts that are most prevalent in popular and modern forms of skateboarding. Many parts exist with exotic or alternative constructions. A traditional complete skateboard consists of the deck (often with griptape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), bushings, nuts and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Older decks also included plastic parts such as side, tail, and nose guards. =Deck= The side of a skateboard Modern decks vary in size, but most are wide. Wider decks can be used for greater stability when skateboarding. Standard skateboard decks are usually between long. The underside of the deck can be printed with a design by the manufacturer, blank, or decorated by any other means. \\"Long\\" boards are usually over long. Plastic \\"penny\\" boards are typically about long.) Some larger penny boards over long are called \\"nickel\\" boards. The longboard, a common variant of the skateboard, is used for higher speed and rough surface boarding, and they are much more expensive. \\"Old school\\" boards (those made in the 1970s–80s or modern boards that mimic their shape) are generally wider and often have only one kicktail. Variants of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails. =Grip tape= Grip tape is a sheet of paper or fabric with adhesive on one side and a surface similar to fine sandpaper on the other. Rubber grip tape is also available, which has gathered some popularity due to the lack of damage it causes to skate shoes. Grip tape is applied to the top surface of a board to allow the rider's feet to grip the surface and help the skater stay on the board while doing tricks. Grip tape is usually black, but is also available in many different colors such as pink, red, yellow, checkered, camo, and even clear. Often, they have designs die-cut to show the color of the board, or to display the board's company logo. Grip tape accumulates dirt and other substances that will inhibit grip, so use of a grip eraser or rubber eraser is necessary after riding through mud or with dirty shoes. =Trucks= Independent brand skateboard truck Attached to the deck are two metal (usually made of aluminum alloy) trucks, which connect the wheels and bearings to the deck. The trucks are further composed of two parts. The top part of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the baseplate, and beneath it is the hanger. The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are bushings, also called rubbers or grommets, that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The bushings cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning but the easier it is to control. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn, but the squirrelier the board is to control. Bushings come in varying shapes, urethane formulas, and durometers (stiffness or hardness) which may affect turning, rebound, and durability. A bolt called a kingpin holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. By tightening or loosening the kingpin‘s nut, the trucks can be loosened for increased turning or tightened for more stability. The standard kingpin nut is usually a -24 UNF. The position of the hanger with respect to the baseplate is determined by the pivot, a rod that slots into the corresponding seat in the baseplate. The pivot stops the hanger from rotating around the kingpin. The pivot must allow some movement around the bushings and therefore is not a perfect fit. The space between the pivot and its seat in the baseplate is filled by a pivot cup, a plastic part that takes most of the wear and tear of the pivot and assists in centering. The pivot cup should be periodically lubricated to ensure a smooth turn. In general, an axle width should be chosen that is close to the width of the deck it will be used with.Has a guide to choosing the right size trucks for a skateboard deck http://skate- parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck For example, a wide deck will usually be fitted with trucks that have axles between wide and wide. (Standard truck axle nut size is - 24 UNF, and the thinner \\"jam\\" style with an optional nylon lock.) Trucks that are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels to get in the way when the skateboard is being ridden. Trucks that are too small reduce stability and can cause wheel bite to occur more easily when turning. Longboard-specific trucks are a recent development. A longboard truck has the kingpin laid at a wider angle (usually between 38 and 50 degreesContains a list of dimensions for popular longboard truck manufacturer ) to the deck, giving a greater degree of turning for the same tilt of the deck. Many longboard-specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward. =Wheels= The wheels of a skateboard are usually made of polyurethane, and come in many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. Larger diameters () roll faster, and move more easily over cracks in pavement and are better for transition skateboarding. Smaller diameters () keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity which allows for a better response time, but also make for a slower top speed and are better for street skateboarding. Wheels also are available in a variety of hardnesses usually measured on the Shore durometer \\"A\\" scale. Again like car tires, wheels range from the very soft (about Shore A 75) to the very hard (about Shore A 101). As the A scale stops at 100, any wheels labeled 101A or higher are harder, but do not use the appropriate durometer scale. Some wheel manufacturers now use the \\"B\\" or \\"D\\" scales, which have a larger and more accurate range of hardness. Modern street skaters prefer medium-sized wheels (usually ), as small wheels with lighter trucks can make tricks like kickflips and other flip tricks easier by keeping the center of gravity of the skateboard closer to the deck, thus making the deck easier to spin. Street wheels are harder (A 100/A 101). Vertical ramp or \\"vert\\" skating requires larger wheels (usually ), as it involves higher speeds. Vert wheels are also usually slightly softer (A 98/ A 99), allowing them to maintain high speed on ramps without sliding. Slalom skating requires even larger wheels () to sustain the highest speeds possible. They also need to be soft and have better grip to make the tight and frequent turns in slalom racing. Even larger wheels are used in longboarding and downhill skateboarding. Sizes range from . These extreme sizes of wheels almost always have cores of hard plastic that can be made thinner and lighter than a solid polyurethane wheel. They are often used by skateboard videographers as well, as they minimize noise and roll smoothly over most types of terrain. =Bearings= An animation of the working principle for a ball bearing. N.B. The diagram shows an 8-balled-bearing whereas a skateboard bearing is typically 7-balled Each skateboard wheel is mounted on its axle via two ball bearings. With few exceptions, the bearings are the industrial standard \\"608\\" size, with a bore of (or depending on the axle), an outer diameter of , and a width of . These are usually made of steel, though silicon nitride, a high-tech ceramic, is sometimes used. Many skateboard bearings are graded according to the ABEC scale. The starts with ABEC1 as the lowest, followed by 3, 5, 7, and 9. It is a common misconception that the higher ABECs are better for skateboarding, as the ABEC rating only measures tolerances, which do not necessarily apply to skateboards. Bearing performance is determined by how well maintained the bearings are. Maintenance on bearings includes periodically cleaning and lubricating them. Bearings that are kept unmaintained have their performance greatly lowered and will soon need to be replaced. Bearing cleaning kits are commonly available on the market. The ABEC rating does not determine the speed or durability of a skateboard bearing. In particular, the ABEC rating says nothing about how well a bearing handles axial (side-to-side) loads, which are severe in most skateboard applications. Many companies do not show the ABEC rating, such as Bones Bearings, which makes bearings specifically for skateboarding, often marketed as \\"Skate Rated\\". Each bearing usually contains 7 steel or ceramic bearing balls, although other configurations are used as well. =Hardware= Mounting hardware is a set of eight 10-32 UNF bolts, usually an Allen or Phillips head, and matching nylon locknuts. They are used to attach the trucks (and any type of risers) to the board. Some sets have one different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard. Hardware is available in various lengths for mounting trucks with or without risers. Optional components =Risers/wedges= Risers increase the space between the truck and the deck. This allows the truck to twist further without causing wheel bite (when the wheel touches the deck and stops rotating). Wedges can be used to change the turning characteristics of a truck.A guide describing turning characteristics of different Riser/Wedge types =Shock Pads= Shock pads are made of polyurethane and rubber. They are very similar to risers but vary in the fact that their sole purpose is to cushion the board from the trucks. Since the trucks are metal and the board wood, whenever the board hits the ground after doing a trick, the energy goes through the truck to the board ─ this has caused boards to crack, split, or even break in half, and shock pads were created to prevent this. =Rails/ribs= Rails (or ribs), are narrow strips of plastic or metal that are attached under the deck lengthwise along the edges. They are used for additional grip for grabs, and to enhance sliding while protecting the deck's graphics at the same time. Rails also provide a more consistent feel for slides, as the slide of a regular skateboard will suffer from the wear of the paint or varnish on the bottom of the board. Although rarely used anymore, they are useful for experienced skaters that are capable of grabs. =Sliptape= Sliptape is a clear piece of self-adhesive plastic that sticks to the underside of a deck. It helps protect the board's graphics and allows the board to slide more easily. Another name for this is everslick. =Lapper= A lapper is a plastic cover that is fastened to the rear truck and serves to protect the kingpin when grinding. It also prevents hang-ups by providing a smoother transition for the truck when it hits an obstacle or a metal pipe or round bar. =Nose guard= A nose guard is a plastic bumper used to protect the front of a skateboard which was once popular but is now only commonly seen on older board models. =Tail guard (a.k.a. skid plate)= Bolted onto the underside of the tail end of a skateboard, the tail guard (also known as a \\"skid plate\\") protected the tail end from skid stops and other maneuvers that would otherwise wear away the wood (commonly known as razor tail) and decrease the longevity of the tail. Typically made of plastic, these were widely popular in the '80s but their usage quickly diminished with the arrival of two-tail board designs, which became increasingly popular in the 1990s. =Tail Devil= A \\"tail devil\\" is a sparking device made of flint which is placed either on the tail or nose of the skateboard (or both) to create a sparking effect mainly visible after dark when the tail or nose of the boards scrapes against the ground. =Copers= Plastic half tubing that protected the axles of the trucks. In the 1980–85 period, shopping cart handles were cut by some to fit as a makeshift coper. =Sublimated graphic= Sublimation (phase transition) is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through an intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation is an endothermic phase transition that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram. In this case, ink is transferred to a base layer, fibreglass for example, through heat and pressure, the result is a full color graphic that will not come off as easily as the more common heat transfers. This application is often found with bamboo boards and composite construction longboards where fibreglass can allow for various degrees of flex or stiffness depending on the ride you're looking for, cruising and carving versus slalom and downhill. =Skateboard Multi-tool= While not part of a skateboard, an all in one skateboard tool capable of mounting and removing trucks & wheels and adjusting truck kingpins are commonly sold by skate shops. Some tools include a metal grip-tape file and can also be used as a bottle-opener. Tools which can be used for the purpose of re-threading wheel axles, working with bearings and even applying grip-tape have been developed.

The burned incense may be intended as a symbolic or sacrificial offering to various deities or spirits, or to serve as an aid in prayer.  Buddhism, Taoism and Shinto in Asia Incense smoke wafts from huge burners in Lhasa, Tibet. The first recorded use of incense was by the Egyptians during the Fifth Dynasty, 2345-2494 BC.https://books.google.com/books?id=GugkliLHDMoC&lpg;=PA112&dq;=Egypt%20incense&pg;=PA111#v=onepage&q;=Egypt%20incense&f;=false , Lucas A., Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries, p. 111 Incense use in religious ritual was either further or simultaneously developed in China, and eventually transmitted to Korea, Japan, Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Incense holds an invaluable role in East Asian Buddhist ceremonies and rites as well as in those of Chinese Taoist and Japanese Shinto shrines for the deity Inari Okami, or the Seven Lucky Gods. It is reputed to be a method of purifying the surroundings, bringing forth an assembly of buddhas, bodhisattvas, gods, demons, and the like. Incense sticks being burnt at a Chinese Buddhist place of worship. In Chinese Taoist and Buddhist temples, the inner spaces are scented with thick coiled incense, which are either hung from the ceiling or on special stands. Worshipers at the temples light and burn sticks of incense in small or large bundles, which they wave or raise above the head while bowing to the statues or plaques of a deity or an ancestor. Individual sticks of incense are then vertically placed into individual censers located in front of the statues or plaques either singularly or in threes, depending on the status of the deity or the feelings of the individual. In Japanese Shinto shrines to Inari Okami or the Seven Lucky Gods and Buddhist temples, the sticks of incense are placed horizontally into censers on top of the ash since the sticks used normally lack a supporting core that does not burn. The formula and scent of the incense sticks used in various temples throughout Asia vary widely.  Christianity  The Catholic tradition employs incense in worship, contained within a thurible. Orthodox Deacons preparing incense for a Cross Procession in Novosibirsk, Russia. Incense has been employed in worship by Christians since antiquity, particularly in the Orthodox Christian churches, the Roman Catholic Church/Eastern Catholic, Old Catholic/Liberal Catholic Churches and some Anglican and Lutheran Churches. Incense is being increasingly used among some other Christian groups as well; for example, the Book of Worship of The United Methodist Church calls for incense in the Evening Praise and Prayer service.The United Methodist Book of Worship, 1992 The United Methodist Publishing House, Nashville TN, page 574.

Many formulations of incense are currently used, often with frankincense, benzoin, myrrh, styrax, copal or other aromatics.  Hinduism  Incense stand used by Hindus to worship gods Incense in India has been used since 3,600 BC. The use of incense is a traditional and ubiquitous practice in almost all pujas, prayers, and other forms of worship. As part of the daily ritual worship within the Hindu tradition, incense is offered to God (usually by rotating the sticks thrice in a clockwise direction) in His deity forms, such as Krishna and Rama. This practice is still commonplace throughout modern-day India and Hindus all around the world. It is said in the Bhagavad- Gita that, \\"Krishna accepts the offering made to Him with love\\", and it is on this principle that articles are offered each day by temple priests or by those with an altar in their homes and businesses. Traditionally, the Benzoin resin and resin obtained from the Commiphora wightii tree were used as incense in ancient India. These resins would be spilled over embers which would give out perfumed smoke. However, the majority of the modern-day Incense of India is mostly of a chemical base rather than the natural ingredients.  Islam  Incense is used in several events such as the Tahfidh graduation ceremony, Ka'bah's purification / cleansing event, and so on. It is to radiate the air and enjoy the soul of the pilgrims. Because according to one of the hadiths of the Prophet, the angels love fragrant scents and hate the foul smells. > The first group of people, who will enter Paradise, will be glittering like > the full moon and those who will follow them, will glitter like the most > brilliant star in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit, or > have any nasal secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat will > smell like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their censers. Their wives > will be hûr al-ʿayn (\\"lovely-eyed\\"). All of them will look alike and will > resemble their father Adam in being sixty cubits tall.Sahih Bukhari, Book > 55: Prophets Olive tree leaves are also burnt as incense in some Muslim Mediterranean countries.  Judaism  The 'ketoret' is the incense described in the Bible for use in the Temple. Its composition and usage is described in greater detail in midrash, the Talmud and subsequent rabbinic literature. Although it was not produced following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, some Jews study the composition of the ancient Temple incense for future use in a restored Temple as part of daily Jewish services. Contemporary Judaism still uses aromatic spices in one ritual, the havdala ceremony ending the Sabbath. In addition, there is a blessing for pleasant smells.  Contemporary Paganism  Incense is also often used in Pagan rituals to represent the element of air, although more modern approaches to incense magic demonstrate that incense actually represents all of the elements. This is attributed to the fact that incense smoke wafts through the air, is created through the use of fire, the incense materials are grown from the earth, and combustible incense is formed using water. It is also believed to release natural energy. Incenses of a wide range of fragrances are also used in spell and ritual for different purposes. Although many Pagan traditions associate specific botanical materials with certain magical attributes (see below), those definitions vary widely from one tradition to another. Generally speaking, Neopagans and Wiccans use incense for two basic purposes in modern rituals. First, incense is believed to create a magical atmosphere that is appropriate for the invocation (or inviting) of deities and spirits often present around the Pagan altar. Second, burning the incense is believed to release the large amount of energy stored within natural incense so that it can be used for magical purposes. The use of \\"perfumed\\", \\"dipped\\", or synthetic incense is generally avoided during magical workings, since such artificial materials are believed to not contain the energies useful for magic. The associations below do not hold true for all traditions, but provide a general look at the magical associations of incense. *Frankincense/Olibanum — burned for purification, a devotional atmosphere, and spirituality and is associated with the Sun. Frankincense is associated with masculine powers. *Myrrh — has similar properties to frankincense, though it is also used for healing and attraction as well. Was used for embalming in antiquity. Myrrh is associated with feminine powers. *Benzoin - effect is purifying. *Sandalwood - effect is both devotional and purifying. *Copal — most often burned for purification, both spiritual cleansing as well as for cleansing physical items. Copal is actually a generic term referring to many different types of resins. Varieties include white, black, and golden. *Dragon's blood — burned for love, strength, and courage and can be used to add potency to any spellwork. *Pine and Cedar — help cleanse space of negative energy.

He has been quoted in the press saying of immigrants, \\"When their children grow up and get the chance to vote, they vote for Democrats.\\"Not So Sweet Home Alabama, by Diane McWhorter, The New York Times, 17 June 2012 He objected to the fact that the law would hurt the Alabama economy, especially agriculture, saying this argument was \\"absolutely, positively wrong\\".Scott Beaulier, Daniel J.

Beason ran well to Bachus' right, saying that if elected he would provide \\"true conservative leadership.\\" Bachus heavily outspent him. The incumbent spent over $1.5 million, outspending Beason 45-1. Bachus defeated him 59%-27%, winning every county in the district, with the notable exception of Blount County, which was won by Blount County Probate Judge David Standridge. Beason did not have to give up his state senate seat to run for Congress; Alabama state senators serve four-year terms, and Beason was not up for reelection again until 2014. 2014 congressional election With Bachus announcing his retirement, the Republican primary field was thrown wide open. Initially, Beason said that he was \\"95 percent sure\\" he would run for re-election to his State Senate seat, but he changed his mind about three weeks later by deciding not to run again. He did not specifically rule out running for the Congressional seat. Radio After leaving elected office, Beason — who had occasionally filled in as a substitute host on Birmingham- area talk radio shows, became a co-host of \\"Yellowhammer Radio\\" on WYDE-FM from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. each weekday. For most of his time on the show, Beason hosted the first hour by himself, with Yellowhammer News publisher Cliff Sims joining Beason for the second hour. Sims left Yellowhammer in 2017 to join the Donald Trump administration, and Beason left the show to host his own show in the time slot prior to Yellowhammer Radio, from 9 to 11 a.m. weekdays.

H. socialis is the type species of Hughmilleriidae, a eurypterid family classified in the superfamily Pterygotioidea that is differentiated by their streamlined bodies, the enlargement of their medium-sized chelicerae and the presence of paired spines on the walking appendages. With the biggest specimen measuring 20 centimetres (8 inches) in length, Hughmilleria is considered a eurypterid of small size. Description Restoration of H. socialis. Hughmilleria is the most basal (primitive) known member of the Pterygotioidea. It was a small-sized eurypterid, with the largest specimen measuring 20 cm (8 in), being surpassed by other members of its superfamily, such as Slimonia acuminata, which measured 100 cm (39 in) in length, and Pterygotus grandidentatus, which could reach 1.75 meters (5 ft 8 in).Lamsdell, James C.; Braddy, Simon J. (2009-10-14). \\"Cope's Rule and Romer's theory: patterns of diversity and gigantism in eurypterids and Palaeozoic vertebrates\\". Biology Letters: rsbl20090700. . ISSN 1744-9561. PMID 19828493. Supplementary information The telson (the most posterior segment of the body), which was lanceolate and styliform, is distinctly a Eurypterus-like feature. The marginal compound eyes, the relatively large chelae and the cordate (heart-shaped) metastoma (a large plate that is part of the abdomen) show a great resemblance to Pterygotus. The carapace was parabolic or subquadrate with oval marginal eyes, the chelicerae were able to extend beyond the carapace margin and the appendages II–V were spiniferous. The genus is in various ways similar to the more derived eurypterids of its superfamily, the Pterygotioidea, however, it lacked the expanded and flattened telson that the pterygotids and Slimonia had. This suggests that Hughmilleria did not need to use the telson as a rudder to swim. Hughmilleria is distinguished from other members of Pterygotioidea by its streamlined body, its subquadrate prosoma (head), its medium-sized chelicerae, its small overall size and the various characteristics it shares with Eurypterus. History of research Fossils of H. shawangunk. The genus Hughmilleria was erected by the American geologist Clifton J. Sarle in 1903 to contain the species H. socialis, which was recovered for the first time in the Pittsford Shale Member of the Vernon Formation, New York. This species is the most abundant species of pterygotioid in the area with around 450 specimens found. The generic name derives from Hugh Miller, a Scottish geologist and writer who found fossils of eurypterids of the Silurian, among them Hughmilleria. A variety of H. socialis was also described, Hughmilleria socialis var. robusta, but currently it is considered a synonym of the species mentioned.Dunlop, J. A., Penney, D. & Jekel, D. 2015. A summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives. In World Spider Catalog. Natural History Museum Bern, online at http://wsc.nmbe.ch, version 18.5 http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/resources/fossils/Fossils18.5.pdf (PDF). Four years later, a second species was discovered among the fauna of the Shawangunk grit at Otisville. It was described as Hughmilleria shawangunk and was smaller than H. socialis. The temporal range of H. shawangunk has been placed between the Llandovery and Ludlow epoch. The largest specimens measured 12 cm (5 in) in length, and differ from the type species by the carapace, which was broader, and the compound eyes which were larger and more prominent than the eyes of H. socialis, among other aspects. The family Pterygotidae was erected in 1912 by John Mason Clarke and Rudolf Ruedemann to constitute a group for the genera Pterygotus, Slimonia, Hastimima and Hughmilleria. However, Erik N. Kjellesvig- Waering emended the family in 1951, when the genera Hastimima, Hughmilleria, Grossopterus and Slimonia were referred to their own family, the Hughmilleriidae, which left Pterygotus as the only genus within the Pterygotidae. In 1961, Erik N. Kjellesvig-Waering split Hughmilleria into two subgenera, Hughmilleria (Hughmilleria) and Hughmilleria (Nanahughmilleria), although Nanahughmilleria would be later raised to the genus level. In 2007, a new species of Hughmilleria from Hunan, China, was described as H. wangi based on an almost complete specimen (CNU-E-HLT2006001). The specific name is in honor of Junqing Wang, who found the fossil of the species in 1992. This species was recovered from the Xiaoxiyu Formation of Hunan, in deposits that suggest that it lived in the Telychian age of the Silurian, which makes it the oldest eurypterid discovered in China. H. wangi differs from the North American species by the presence of epimera (lateral \\"extensions\\" of the segment) on the entire postabdomen and a slightly wider carapace than in the other species. Measuring 6 cm (2 in) in length, H. wangi is the smallest known species of Hughmilleria and of the Pterygotioidea superfamily. In addition, if the problematic H. lanceolata really belonged to the genus, it would extend the range of Hughmilleria to the Silurian of Scotland. It was originally described as a new species of the new genus Himantopterus by the English geologist and paleontologist John William Salter. The body of this species was elongate and attenuated behind. Its telson was lanceolated and its swimming legs were narrow. This species has also been related to Nanahughmilleria, but recent studies suggest that H. lanceolata was probably closer to Eurypteroidea. However, the lack of eyes on every specimen of H. lanceolata hinders the resolution of its phylogenetic position. Classification Size comparison of the three species of Hughmilleria Hughmilleria is classified within the family Hughmilleriidae in the superfamily Pterygotioidea. Historically Hughmilleria was first considered a member of the Pterygotidae until it was assigned to its own family alongside other genera that would later be reclassified. Hughmilleria and Herefordopterus shared a subtriangular carapace outline with the pterygotids and the wide telson and genital appendages of all three taxa were similar, although the genital appendages of Hughmilleria and Herefordopterus were more similar to those of Slimonia by the division of these into three segments, in contrast to the undivided morphology in the pterygotids. Still, Hughmilleria and Herefordopterus differed from pterygotids and slimonids by the presence of paired spines on the walking appendages, that along with the characteristics that Slimonia and Ciurcopterus share, suggest that the hughmilleriids were more distant from the pterygotids than Slimonia was. Within Hughmilleriidae, both genera possessed a marginal rim much broader anteriorly than posteriorly and appendages spiniferous of Hughmilleria-type, but Hughmilleria had 18-20 gnathobasic (of the gnathobase, a lower appendage used in the alimentation) teeth on appendage VI, unlike Herefordopterus and the pterygotids, who had 12-13. Therefore, Hughmilleria represents the most basal form of Pterygotioidea. According to Clifton J. Sarle, Hughmilleria was very similar to Eurypterus, and could be confused with a species of this genus if it was not for the presence of the marginal position of the eyes and the relatively large chelae. However, by its cordate metastoma, the intramarginal to marginal position of the compound eyes, the slightly longer preoral appendages, less developed swimming legs and the opercular appendage, Hughmilleria was more like Pterygotus.Clarke, J. K., Ruedemann R. (1912) \\"The Eurypterida of New York\\" The cladogram presented below, derived from a 2007 study by researcher O. Erik Tetlie, showcases the interrelationships between the pterygotioid eurypterids. Paleoecology Painting painted in 1912 by Charles R. Knight depicting various eurypterids discovered in New York. The painting includes Dolichopterus, Eusarcana, Stylonurus, Eurypterus and Pterygotus. Hughmilleria can be seen in the bottom of the right corner. Fossils of Hughmilleria have been found in Silurian deposits from the Llandovery and Ludlow epochs. Together with its close relatives, Hughmilleria dominated the communities in brackish and fresh water, while Pterygotus and Eurypterus dominated marine environments. The Silurian deposits of the Pittsford Shale Member in which fossils of H. socialis have been found shelter various faunas of eurypterids, including Mixopterus multispinosus, Erettoperus osiliensis, Eurypterus pittsfordensis and Carcinosoma spiniferus, among others. Fossils from other organisms were also found, such as the crustacean Ceratiocaris and the ostracod Leperditia. Geological features of the formation, such as the friable and calcareous mudstone, the argillaceous dolomite and the lithology and associated biota suggests that the environment was marginal marine, very shallow and probably brackish.

Alaska Natives have been harvesting salmon and many other types of fish for millennia. Russians came to Alaska to harvest its abundance of sealife, as well as Japanese and other Asian cultures. Job safety left Alaska's commercial fishermen work in one of the world's harshest environments. They endure isolated fishing grounds, high winds, seasonal darkness, very cold water, icing, freezing cold temperatures, days upon days away from family, and short fishing seasons, where very long work days are the norm. Fatigue, physical stress, and financial pressures face most Alaska fishermen through their careers. The hazardous work conditions faced by fishermen have a strong impact on their safety. Out of 948 work-related deaths that took place in Alaska during 1990-2006, one-third (311) occurred to fishermen. This is equivalent to an estimated annual fatality rate of 128/100,000 workers/year. This fatality rate is 26 times that of the overall U.S. work-related fatality rate of approximately 5/100,000 workers/year for the same time period. While the work-related fatality rate for commercial fishermen in Alaska is still very high, it does appear to be decreasing: since 1990, there has been a 51 percent decline in the annual fatality rate. The successes in commercial fishing are due in part to the U.S. Coast Guard implementing new safety requirements in the early 1990s. These safety requirements contributed to 96 percent of the commercial fishermen surviving vessel sinkings/capsizings in 2004, whereas in 1991, only 73 percent survived. While the number of occupational deaths in commercial fishermen in Alaska has been reduced, there is a continuing pattern of losing 20 to 40 vessels every year. There are still about 100 fishermen who must be rescued each year from cold Alaska waters. Successful rescue is still dependent on the expertly trained personnel of the U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue operations, and such efforts can be hindered by the harshness of seas and the weather. Furthermore, the people involved in Search and Rescue operations are themselves at considerable risk for injury or death during these rescue attempts. Salmon seining in Alaska Purse seine usage in the Alaska salmon fishing industry: =Equipment= Fishermen catching salmon on the Columbia River using a seine. A commercial fishing boat, used for purse seining in the Alaskan salmon fishery, is typically between 40 and long. Toward the bow is a cabin, where the skipper and crew live (typically three to six people). The aft third of the boat consists of a flat deck, with a low rail around it. Amidships are hatch covers, which cover the fish hold, a tank where the fish are placed when caught. The stern is a simple flat area that holds the purse seine when it is out of the water. There are several booms, with various types of pulleys, used for working with the seine, and a deck winch for the same purpose. Shortly after the end of World War II, the modern type trawler for use in Alaska was introduce which could be used for all the various fishing seasons with its own processing ability, including freezing, was introduced, tripling production. After crab seas these boats are used as floating factory ships.\\"Floating Refrigerator.\\" Popular Mechanics, October 1947, p. 142 There is also a skiff, a small boat used for towing. When not in use, the skiff is usually towed behind the fishing boat, though in rough weather a boom can be used to lift it up and set it on the deck. For long trips where rough weather is likely, the seine will be placed into the fish hold as well, to lower the center of gravity of the vessel and make it safer. The Krista Gail rigged as a drum seiner in False Creek, Vancouver, Canada. The purse seine itself is usually black in color, with colorful \\"corks\\" (floats of some sort) strung along the cork line, and lead weights strung along the lead line. The size and attributes of purse seines are regulated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, which oversees the industry. A typical length may be long, by deep (distance between cork line and lead line). It is stacked on the stern of the fishing boat with the corkline coiled on the port side, and the lead line coiled on the starboard side, with the web taking up the middle. The seine, when piled on board, is about the size of a large pickup truck, and is very heavy as well. A \\"set\\" is a single operation of the purse seine, intended to result in a catch of fish. =Personnel= Different members of the crew have :skipper's job is to hire crew, manage all operation of the equipment, find the fish, direct the operation, run the booms, navigate the boat, find a market, sell the fish, and pay the crew. ;Skiffman A seiner in the middle of set in Prince William Sound, Alaska :The skiffman has responsibility for the skiff, keeping the fuel tank supplied, maintaining the engine, and driving it around as needed. The skiff is attached to one end of the net when the crew is setting the net. The skiffman is responsible for placement of the net. After the set the skiff and main boat loop. The skiffman hands his end of the net to one of the deck hands. He then swings around the boat and under the net where the other deck hands tosses him a tow line. The skiff man then becomes responsible for the placement of the boat. It is important to keep the net and boat centered. If the tides push the net around the bow then there is a chance of the floats sinking and fish escaping. If there is another boat setting near the boat the skiff man needs to keep his boat and net away from that set. The skipper may signal the skiffman aboard if help is needed to either pull up the bag of fish or \\"brail\\" the fish into the fish hole. Brailing is when a large basket is dipped into the pocket of the net and then hauled aboard. This method of getting the fish on board is still used in some parts of Alaska, however, most boats now bring their fish on board by \\"taking bites\\". ; :The deck hands take care of all of the tasks that need to be done on board during a set, such as detaching the skiff at the start of a set, plunging to scare fish away from the boat where they could escape the net by going under the boat, and cleaning the deck of seaweed and bycatch while the net is deployed, keeping an eye on the net and surrounding seas for snags or whales, stacking the cork line and lead line as the net is being taken back aboard, removing the odd fish/debris that has become entangled in the net, assisting with brailing (scooping the fish aboard at the end of a set), repairing holes in the net, pitching the fish into the fish hold, and on most boats cooking the meals.

History After the completion of the \\"Clover Leaf\\" railroad through the area in 1874 and the establishment of the town of Forest along it, residents petitioned the county commissioners to create a new township for their area out of the existing Johnson and Warren townships. On January 2, 1882, the petition was granted and the township organized with Samuel M. Davis as the first trustee. The first permanent white settlers in the township were Page and Sarah Sims who arrived in 1839 and resided in the township until their death. The arrival of pioneers here was somewhat later than in other parts of the county since Forest was originally within the Big Miami Reserve and off limits to white settlement until 1838. The population grew slowly and remained sparse and scattered for some years. The first church in the township was the Methodist Swamp Creek chapel built in 1850 near the southern border, and later replaced by St. Paul's church.

He developed the domain theory of ferromagnetism in 1907. Weiss domains and the Weiss magneton are named after him. Weiss also developed the molecular or mean field theory, which is often called Weiss-mean-field theory, that lead to the discovery of the Curie-Weiss law. Alongside Auguste Picard, Pierre Weiss is considered one of the first discoverers of the magnetocaloric effect in 1917. Pierre Weiss made several experimental discoveries that led to the development of the strongest electromagnets of the beginning of the 20th century. He worked at the universities of Rennes, Lyon, ETH Zurich where he was raised, and finally at Strasbourg. In these academic institutions he founded several renown laboratories.  Life  Pierre Weiss was born in Mulhouse the 25 March 1865, where he was the first born of Emile Weiss and Ida Schlumberger. At the age of 5, Alsace was annexed to Germany. Weiss conducted his secondary studies at Mulhouse. He later left to continue higher education at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH), where he obtained the diploma of mechanical engineer in 1887 as the first in the grade ranking of his class. At the age of majority, he decided to take the French nationality instead of the German one. In 1888, he practices for the entry exam of the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) at the Lycée Saint-Louis, Paris, where he is admitted. After his years at the ENS, he remained there as a teacher assistant while in parallel he obtained his license in physical sciences and mathematical sciences at the Faculty of Sciences of Paris. During his time in Paris, he met several colleges who will become famous mathematicians like Élie Cartan, Henri Lebesgue, and Émile Borel, and famous physicists like Aimé Cotton, Jean Perrin, and Paul Langevin. In 1895, he is win the title of Maître de Conférences (lecturer) at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Rennes. In 1896, he defends his doctoral thesis in physical sciences, related to the study of the magnetization of crystallized magnetite and some iron and antimony alloys, in front of the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris. His supervisors were Jules Violle and Marcel Brillouin, and the thesis jury was comprised by Charles Friedel, and Henry Pellatt. In October 1896, Pierre Weiss marries Jane Rancès in Paris. Their daughter, Nicole, will later marry the French mathematician Henri Cartan. The Dreyfus affair burst during this time. According to the witnesses testimony, collected by Nicolas Ballet, Pierre Weiss joins the academics that defend Alfred Dreyfus, who was also from Alsace origin, born in Mulhouse, and former student of ETH as him. This position was controversial in his environment at Rennes, Weiss later prefers to continue teaching at the University of Lyon in 1899 due to this issue. Albert Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, Paul Langevin, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and Pierre Weiss at Kamerlingh Onnes home at Leiden. Even when Pierre Weiss does take the mantle of professor at Lyon, he later accepts ETH Zurich proposal to become physics professor and director of the Institute of Physics in 1902. In 1907, he publishes an important work on the nature of ferromagnetism where he introduces the concept of molecular field, a precursor idea to mean field theory. Is at this moment in life that he mets Albert Einstein and Peter Debye, also professors at Zurich. During World War I, he comes back to France where he works with Aimé Cotton in the development of an acoustic system for tracking artillery, known as the Cotton-Weiss method. In 1919, Strasbourg is no longer part of the German Empire but returns to France. Even when the University of Strasbourg (as Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universität de Strasbourg) benefited from important German investment, Weiss had to participate in the several endeavours that had to be performed to reintegrate the institution to the French system (as Université de Strasbourg). The French president Raymond Poincaré declared that the University of Strasbourg had to outperform its precedent German counterpart. In this manner, many faculties and subordinate institutes were also created to promote research. In this environment, Pierre Weiss chooses to become physics professor at the Faculty of Physics of the University of Strasbourg and director of the Institute of Physics. He also founded in Strasbourg, an institute focused in the research of magnetism, similar to the one he founded in Zurich. He receives the resources to gather in Strasbourg many of his collaborators from Zurich, like Gabriel Foëx, Robert Forrer and . Some of Weiss' remarkable students include Swiss explorer and inventor Auguste Picard, Spanish physicist Blas Cabrera, and Louis Néel, French Nobel laureate in physics for his work on magnetism. According to Francis Perrin, son of Weiss' friend Jean Perrin, Louis Néel, young associate from the ENS, arrived at Weiss' laboratory to prepare his thesis in 1928. He becomes his assistant in 1932 and succeeds Weiss at his position in the Chair of Physics at the University of Strasbourg in 1937. Néel remarked the political fervour of Weiss, who supported Popular front which was badly seen in the mostly conservative population of Strasbourg of the time. As a widower in 1919, Pierre Weiss remarries in 1922 with the physicist Marthe Klein. In 1939, Pierre Weiss follows his friend Jean Perrin to the University of Lyon where he dies in 1940.

Part of its flora, inherited from the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana or exchanged later (e.g. Piperaceae with pantropical distribution and but few warm temperate representatives), is shared with the Neotropical Kingdom, comprising tropical areas of Central and South America. Moreover, the Paleotropical flora influenced the tropical flora of the Australian Kingdom. The Paleotropical Kingdom is subdivided into five floristic subkingdoms according to Takhtajan (or three, according to Good) and about 13 floristic regions. In this article the floristic subkingdoms and regions are given as delineated by Takhtajan. Origin A distinct community of vascular plants evolved millions of years ago, and are now found on several separate areas. Millions of years ago, the warmer and wetter areas supported a tropical adapted flora, including forests of podocarps and southern beech. They were a type of flora characteristic of parts of Gondwana but were present in equivalent ecological areas. Over millions of years, these type of vegetation present, covered much of the tropics of Earth. Many species are today relicts of a type of vegetation disappeared, which originally covered much of the mainland of Africa, Madagascar, India, South America, Antarctica, Australia, North America, Europe, and other lands when their climate were more humid and warm. Although warm cloud forests disappeared during the glaciations, they re-colonized large areas every time the weather was favorable again. Most of the cloud forests are believed to have retreated and advanced during successive geological eras, and their species adapted to warm and wet gradually retreated and advanced, replaced by more cold-tolerant or drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities. Many of the existing species became extinct because they could not cross the barriers posed by new oceans, mountains and deserts, but others found refuge as species relict in coastal areas and Islands. In the Carboniferous and Permian, New Zealand and New Caledonia were on the periphery of Gondwana, which included Africa, South America, Antarctica, India, New Zealand and Australia. Paleomagnetic data locate New Caledonia originally near the South Pole. In the Triassic and early Jurassic, Gondwana moved northward, warming the eastern margin. New Caledonia separated from Australia and New Zealand during the breakup of the super- continent, separating from Australia at the end of the Cretaceous (66 mya) and probably completing its separation from New Zealand in the mid-Miocene. The ecological requirements of many of the species, are those of the laurel forest and like most of their counterparts laurifolia in the world, they are vigorous species with a great ability to populate the habitat that is conducive. The geographical isolation and special edaphic conditions helped to preserve it too. Many members of the late Cretaceous - early Tertiary Gondwanan flora survived in islands and Coastal area's equable climate but were eliminated in mainland due to increasingly dry conditions.http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/newcaledonia/ When the large landmasses became drier and with a harsher climate, this type of forest was reduced to those boundaries areas. Tasmania, Chile, New Zealand and New Caledonia share related species extinct in Australia mainland. The same case occurs in the Atlantic Macaronesia islands and Pacific Taiwan, Hainan, Jeju, Shikoku, Kyūshū, and Ryūkyū Islands. Although some remnants of archaic rich flora still persisted in their coastal mountains and shelter sites, their biodiversity were reduced. The location of Islands in the oceans moderated these climatic fluctuations, and maintained the relatively humid and mild climate which has allowed these communities to persist to the present day. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Tertiary vegetal species isolated on islands have led to vicariant species; genera and families extinct in the rest of the world have been preserved as island endemics. For example, genera, Archeria in Ericaceae, or Wollemia in the family Araucariaceae, was known only from fossil remains before the discovery of the living species in 1994 in a temperate rainforest wilderness area of the Wollemi National Park in New South Wales, in a remote series of narrow, steep-sided sandstone gorges near Lithgow. Fossils dating from before the Pleistocene glaciations show that species of Laurus were formerly distributed more widely around the Mediterranean and North Africa, isolated gave rise to Laurus azorica in Azores Islands, Laurus nobilis in mainland and Laurus novocanariensis in Canary Islands.

Ball, M.O. et al. (2004), \\"Available to Promise\\" in Handbook of Quantitative Supply Chain Analysis - Modeling in the E-Business Era, Kluwer It generates available quantities of the requested product, and delivery due dates. Therefore, ATP supports order promising and fulfillment, aiming to manage demand and match it to production plans. Available-to-promise functions are IT-enabled and usually integrated into enterprise management software packages. However, ATP execution may need to be adjusted for the way a certain company operates.  Classification  A fundamental distinction between ATP functions is based on the push-pull strategy. Push-based ATP is based on forecasts regarding future demand - based on anticipation of demand, ATP quantities and availability dates are computed. A prominent example is the traditional determination of ATP based on the Master Production Schedule. The push-based approach is fundamentally limited by dependence on forecasts, which may prove inaccurate. Gross ATP represents the total available supply, and net ATP represents the supply remaining to support new demands, after existing commitments to customers have been accounted for. Pull-based models, on the other hand, dynamically allocate resources in response to actual customer orders. This means that pull-based ATP is able to balance forecast-driven resource replenishment with order-triggered resource utilization,Zhao, Z. (2005), \\"Optimization-based Available-to-promise with Multi-Stage Resource Availability\\", Annals of Operations Research 135, 65-85 but because resources are allocated with each coming order, the process will yield myopic results.  ATP Execution  ATP functions can be executed in real-time, driven by each individual order, or in batch mode – meaning that at a certain time interval, the system checks the availability for orders piled up in that period of time. The process is triggered by the need to check resource availability before making a commitment to deliver an order. For example, ATP calculation using SAP software depends on the level of \\"stock, planned receipts (production orders, purchase orders, planned orders and so on), and planned requirements (sales orders, deliveries, reservations, etc.)\\"  References   External links  * SAP Library on Product Availability Check using ATP * Oracle Data Sheet on Available-to-promise (PDF) * IBM Order Management Order Promising and Scheduling for Sterling v9.2 Category: Business terms ","title":"Available-to-promise"},{"id":"13712445","text":"\\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" is a song by Gerry Goffin and Carole King that was first released by the Drifters in 1961.

In 1897 he joined the Royal Artillery, seeing service in Bermuda, Canada, Malta, England, Ireland, and India. He was promoted to lieutenant 18 June 1900, and to captain on 13 February 1902. After Camberley he was nominated to attend a naval war course, one of the first two army staff officers to be so chosen. In 1909 became a member of the home defence section of the Imperial Defence Committee, which was then involved with the general defence of the United Kingdom. He was at one point the youngest staff officer in the British army.Holmes 2004, p166 He organized, and partly financed, a national petition against proposed Home Rule in Ireland, and helped establish the Junior Imperial League. He accepted an invitation to stand for Parliament, but withdrew when the rules were changed to place officers on half pay if they entered parliament. He signed the Ulster Covenant when it was opened for signature in England. In 1913 he was allowed to retire from his army commission, refusing to resign with the rank of Captain and £120 per year. A confidential inspection report of 1913 commented that Captain Spender had been led away by a ‘too active conscience’ and had been very injudicious, risking his prospects in life. While disputing being forced to leave the army, feeling his services were required in Ulster, Spender sought legal advice from Sir Edward Carson. He invited Spender to Belfast to help organise the Ulster Volunteer Force, a paramilitary group to resist Home Rule. During a period of leave from service in India, Spender met an old friend, Alice Lilian Dean. They were married within a few weeks. After a ten-day honeymoon, he and his wife travelled to Belfast, where Spender became Quartermaster General of the UVF, based at the Old Town Hall in Belfast, while remaining a director of his newspaper in Plymouth. In December 1913, amid widespread suspicions that sympathy for the Unionist cause might make army officers reluctant to move against the Ulster Volunteers, the CIGS Sir John French recommended that Spender be cashiered (stripped of his commission - a social disgrace that disqualified the person from any further Crown employment) “pour décourager les autres”, but this did not happen.Holmes 2004, p. 169 The Great War In July 1914 Spender, as a retired officer, was told to hold himself ready to take up an appointment with the eastern command in Chatham. He returned to England. After the outbreak of war, he was transferred as general staff officer to the new 36th (Ulster) Division. He served with the Ulster division until 1916, and was present at the Battle of the Somme, when he won the Military Cross for his part in the assault on Thiepval. He also won the DSO and was mentioned in despatches four times. In 1916 he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, and served with General Lord Cavan's corps, and then at advanced general headquarters working under Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig (later created Lord Haig). Spender strongly opposed accepting a proposed six- county option for the partition of Ireland, and on these grounds, he declined an invitation from Carson to contest an Ulster constituency at Westminster. About the same time, he gave some support to moves to launch a national party in England — \\"to promote Reform, the Union and Defence\\" — and considered seeking nomination for parliament in a constituency in Devon or Cornwall. Following the war, he joined the Ministry of Pensions in London. Partition of Ireland In 1920 he was approached by Carson and Craig and asked to return to Belfast to help reorganize the UVF. They formed the Ulster Special Constabulary. With the partition, in 1921 Spender was appointed as Cabinet Secretary in Northern Ireland and, in 1925, as permanent secretary at the Ministry of Finance. He opposed any discrimination on religious grounds in the civil service, but was unable to prevent Unionist members of the Northern Ireland parliament dominating the selection boards for other ranks. He was never a member of the Orange Order, despite claims to the contrary from certain quarters. Later life Sir Wilfrid retired in 1944 and returned to England in 1955, he died of heart failure on 21 December 1960 at the East Hill Hotel, his home at Liss, Hampshire. He was survived by Lady Spender (died 1966), whom he married in 1913. They had one child, a daughter, Patricia, Mrs. Dingwall. Quote * \\"I am not an Ulsterman but yesterday, the 1st.

Biography  = Early years (2001-2003) = Dance Nation were discovered by their producers Bradski & Jenski (Brad Grobler & Rob Janssen) in 2001 when their first single \\"Sunshine\\" was released. This was followed by singles such as \\"Dance\\", \\"Words\\", and \\"You Take Me Away\\". In 2004, they switched to the name \\"Double Nation\\" due to legal proceedings. In 2003, they also collaborated with The Lovestern Galaktika Project for the single \\"My First Love\\". = 2003-2005 = In this period, following the label crisis Noculan Music (after inglobed into Jamie Lewis by his Purple Eye Entertainment), that struck not only Dance Nation, but also other trance artists such as Noemi and 666 and the general mutation of the music genres in Europe, going House, Hard House and Elektro, lead Dance Nation to land in Japan, where they still have a great deal of success and their production focused in the last years. From this moment on, the group had a sort of split life, releasing Trance projects for Japanese market and House ones for the European one. In this climate born singles like \\"Beachtime\\" in Japan and \\"I'm Gonna Get You\\" and the House/Elektro track \\"Move Your Love\\" in Europe. It's because their production are more Asian based than European, that it is difficult to find their releases outside Japan, both in online and retail stores and it's because of that too that no one knows about the release of two albums and a compilation. Titles are Trance Champion, released in 2005 by the Japanese label Avex Productions, containing all the past-released singles, including \\"Celebrate Your Life\\", that, listening to some people, should have been the next single; One Nation in 2007 always by the same label; and Christmas Trance in winter 2006, including a lot of popular Christmas melodies rearranged in Trance style, like Dance Nation always did. = Actual situation = At present Dance Nation have released, just before summer, their last single \\"Ridin' High\\", that confirms a general move towards House sounds of the European market. An album is going to be produced too, with an undisclosed release date, containing some remixes of their first single, \\"Sunshine\\".

In November 2008, Anand Jon was convicted at the Los Angeles court Court on one count of rape and multiple counts of lesser sexual offenses. He was sentenced to 59 years to life. Anand Jon was facing similar charges in New York, but before the trial began in 2013, the New York prosecutors had independently dismissed almost all the charges in their case which featured almost the same witnesses and charges as the overlapping Los Angeles case. Career Anand Jon was born in Kerala, India into a Hindu-Jewish-Christian background. At 16, he won a scholarship to the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, Florida and moved to United States. Anand Jon moved to New York and joined Parsons The New School for Design making the transition from fine art to fashion. Parsons alumni include Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford and Donna Karan for whom Anand Jon interned. Upon graduating from Parsons under the mentorship of his Associate Dean, Tim Gunn of Project Runway TV fame, Anand Jon launched his debut collection \\"Amazone\\" in 1999. He was the first Indian to debut at 7th of sixth New York Fashion Week. As the Anand Jon brand rapidly gained popularity with his Kama Sutra Indo chic fusions, he was sponsored by Giorgio Armani. Anand Jon also credits Gianni Versace for his start in the fashion world. Anand Jon lifestyle and design attracted high-profile celebrities, socialites and royalty as clients. He became known as an \\"it girl\\" maker as many of his muses debuted on his runway shows and projects including Michelle Rodriguez, Amanda Hearst and Lydia Hearst, Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton, Ivanka Trump, Marla Maples, Elizabeth Jagger and others. \\"If you were a wannabe, he was the perfect tailcoat to ride on\\" stated Catherine Saxton, a longtime fashion publicist in New York. He designed clothes for celebrities including Mary J Blige, Paris Hilton and Janet Jackson. In 2006 Anand Jon founded his own denim-design company Jeanisis Fashion Inc. and the same year received capitalization from the Joseph Stevens & Co. Inc. investment firm. Anand Jon was scheduled to introduce his Atomize Collection during the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week at Smashbox Studios in March 2007. Arrest and conviction Anand Jon was arrested in March 2007 in Beverly Hills, California on rape and related charges. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. Anand Jon had no prior history of violence and no felony convictions. The prosecutors accused Anand Jon of luring women and girls to his apartment under the pretext of securing modeling jobs. His defense said that the sexual activity was consensual, and that one minor who accused Anand Jon of rape had lied about her age. On November 13, 2008, he was convicted on one count of rape of an adult woman and multiple other charges including unlawful conduct and contributing to delinquency of minors. He was scheduled to be sentenced on January 13, 2009. Although many were concerned about the miscarriage of justice in the Anand Jon Alexander case, in July 2009 the judge denied a request for a new trial. Anand Jon dismissed his attorneys before his sentencing as he suspected that they were in collaboration with the prosecutors. He asked for and was granted permission to represent himself for the sentencing phase of the proceedings. On August 31, 2009, Anand Jon was sentenced to 59 years to life. Anand Jon has also been indicted in Texas and New York on multiple charges alleging sexual assault. All but one of the charges were dropped in the New York trial. Los Angeles case controversy Considerable amount of controversy was raised during and after the Los Angeles case. One of those irregularities is related to juror No. 12. During the trial he violated his oath on several occasions and was referred to by Anand Jon’s lawyers as hardly an impartial juror. Although prohibited, juror No. 12 had discussed the case with his tenant and told her he felt the girls on the stand all seemed to have the same or similar stories, and that he was under the impression they had all collaborated. Due to his fellow jurors’ anger towards him, juror No. 12 felt he was pressured to give a verdict that he didn’t want to give. Also, during deliberations, several jurors complained to the judge that juror No. 12 was refusing to properly deliberate and had made up his mind about the evidence. Although the jury foreman had requested that juror No. 12 be removed for refusal to deliberate, it was denied by Judge Wesley. Another controversy regarding juror No. 12 was his attempt to initiate contact with the defendant's sister, Sanjana. Under fear of repercussion to her brother, she responded to juror No. 12's demands and called the phone number she was handed by him during trial. It was later pointed out by Anand Jon’s team of lawyers that in November juror No. 12 had changed his vote from \\"not guilty\\" to \\"guilty\\" after the defendant's sister refused to meet him. Before a verdict was reached, juror No. 12 re-initiated contact with Sanjana, once again asking her to meet him. After she informed the court, a meeting was scheduled and it was arranged for her to record the meeting with a wire. Prior to the meeting, juror No. 12 was intercepted by District Attorney Investigators informing him of the criminal investigation he was under, thus sabotaging the meeting. Regarding his actions, juror No. 12 was summoned to a questioning where, under oath, he testified to have never spoken with Sanjana during the trial. Defense attorneys then presented a tape with their conversation, along with phone records, proving that the juror had falsely testified. Although juror No. 12 was repeatedly caught committing perjury and was impeached by his own words, he was still allowed to plead the Fifth Amendment to \\"not further incriminate himself\\". The trial judge refused to consider or hold evidentiary hearings in these matters and the defendant’s request for a new trial was denied. Another controversy connected to the Los Angeles trial was the show of inconsistencies in the victims’ stories and the use of false testimonies. During the trial, it was shown that the lead detective had destroyed evidence crucial to Anand Jon’s case and had not taken statements from a number of alleged victims who asserted that Anand Jon had never sexually assaulted them. Anand Jon dismissed his team of defense lawyers during the penalty phase, as he believed that they were collaborating with the prosecution. Additionally, defense lawyer’s daughter Elizabeth took a job with the D.A.'s office during the trial, while she was still working with Anand Jon’s defense crew. The Los Angeles trial resulted in a mixed outcome of guilty, not guilty and hung verdicts. Some prosecution witnesses had sued Anand Jon civilly or gotten civil attorneys such as Gloria Allred. During the New York case, featuring almost the same witnesses and similar charges as the Los Angeles case, the New York District Attorney’s Office dropped almost all of the charges against Anand Jon. The New York prosecution offered a \\"time served\\" plea on a single count, which Anand Jon accepted. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to turn over crucial documents. His attorney believes that these documents will help him with his appeal in California. Anand Jon’s appeal argues that he had ineffective counsel in California; the Manhattan documents indicate that the California lawyers never obtained vital police documents and correspondence showing his accusers were squaring their stories among themselves and with civil lawyers. The Los Angeles trial itself showed there was a lack of physical evidence including the sole rape kit turning out to be negative, with no assault findings. To further prove his innocence, Anand Jon submitted to and passed a polygraph test regarding the rape charge for which he was convicted. The high profile case continues to be controversial due to the questionable integrity of the trial, as well as new evidence and changes of circumstances that have surfaced concerning the New York trial's outcome and writ proceedings in the California case. Personal life Anand Jon is a nephew of Indian classical musician and playback singer, K.J. Yesudas. Anand Jon’s mother Shashi Abraham and his sister Sanjana Jon are successful businesswomen and active advocates to his freedom, urging the Governments of the USA and India to intervene and grant a new trial.Anand Jon gets 59 years for sex crimes Chidanand Rajghatta Times of India Sept 9, 2009 Anand Jon has been actively involved in numerous charity projects as Universe Aids awareness tour to India with his sister Sanjana, and with Michelle Rodriguez in the rescue of wild animals from abuse via \\"the Nature Sanctuary\\".

About of precipitation falls on the upper reaches of Mount Olympus and Blue Glacier each year. During winter, most of the precipitation on Blue Glacier consists of snow. In addition, a significant amount of rain falls on the Blue Glacier as well, especially during spring and summer. Because of this high precipitation and the volume of this body of ice, the Blue Glacier contributes a significant amount of water to the Hoh River via Glacier Creek.Olympic National Park map, 2007 The Hoh River eventually discharges in the Pacific Ocean after flowing down through temperate rain forest in Olympic National Park.

Part of the loose Crosstime Traffic family of books, it is set in a world in an alternate history in which the Soviet Union has won the Cold War. It tied with Jo Walton's Ha'penny for the 2008 Prometheus Award.Prometheus Winnershttp://www.uchronia.net/label/turtcrosst.html Plot summary The Gladiator follows the same concept as the other Crosstime Traffic novels. A parallel world similar in most respects to our own has discovered the technology to visit and trade with other parallels, spreading the notions of liberty and capitalism at the same time. The plot of The Gladiator follows the same formula of the other books in the series with an imperiled company operative and local protagonists being used as guides to the parallel. In The Gladiator, it is indeed the capitalist West that has been consigned to the \\"dustbin of history\\" and the world has been remade in the image of the Soviet Union. The point of divergence from ours was in 1962. U.S. President John F. Kennedy decides to allow the Soviet missiles to remain in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the complete withdrawal from the Vietnam War in 1968. Thus, communism spreads throughout Latin America and Southeast Asia giving the Soviet Union an upper hand in economic and military strength over the United States. Due to the embargo of the many countries that were integrated into the Soviet Sphere, the United States' economy collapses and goes bankrupt and loses its position as a superpower, and most European countries become communist afterward in the 1980s and 1990s, including France and Italy. A hundred years later, communism has taken over nearly every world country (including the United States itself). Capitalism at large has largely been killed off, though small ventures of capitalism had to be kept as a necessary evil. Religion, despite communism's taboo against it, has been relatively untouched in countries such as Italy, where even the staunchest Italian communist was known to attend a Catholic Mass. The protagonists of the novel, Gianfranco and Annarita, are teenagers in an Italian People's Republic, satellite to the interests of the USSR. Amidst the grey Soviet Brutalist tenements, they discover a strategy game shop that is disseminating capitalist ideas with the games they sell. The shop is a front for the Crosstime Traffic trading monopoly, as the protagonists discover when the shop is closed by the authorities and one of the clerks, Eduardo, turns to the protagonists for help.

Reynolds, 113 U.S. 73 (1885), was Supreme Court case determining whether a probate case from Michigan should be moved to federal court and, if so, which federal court should hear it. The court issued a writ of error on the judgment of the Eastern District of Michigan federal court for remanding a case back to the state court and determined that was indeed the appropriate federal court to hear the case.. Background The plaintiff, a citizen of Missouri, prosecuted his claim in the probate court of Ionia County in western Michigan, against the estate of Warren Sherwood, deceased, of which William Reynolds had been appointed administrator. The claim was resisted, and was referred to commissioners appointed by the probate judge, who reported against its allowance. The issue was appealed to the circuit court of Ionia County for a trial by jury and was moved to the circuit court of Jackson County in eastern Michigan after several years delay that the plaintiff believed that due to prejudice and local influence, he would not be able to obtain justice in the state court. It was argued that the case could not be moved to federal court since the original state court had already issued its decision. It was also argued that the cause should have been moved to the circuit court for the Western district of Michigan where the case was originally filed in Ionia County instead of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Eastern District where the case was currently pending in Jackson County. Decision The ruling determined that, since one of the parties was from a different state, that there was federal jurisdiction to hear the dispute. The high court also found that the language of the removal statute is that suits shall be removed into the circuit court of the district where such suits are pending. Undoubtedly this means where they are pending at the time of removal. This suit was not then pending in the Western District of Michigan, but in the county of Jackson, which is in the Eastern District of that state. The court’s opinion was that the case was properly removed from the circuit court of Jackson county into the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Michigan, and that that court erred in remanding it. The judgment was reversed, with instructions to proceed in the case in federal court in the Eastern District according to law.

At the start of the 1973 Tour de France, Catieau won stage 1b into St.Niklaas in Belgium. The third stage of the 1973 Tour de France began in Roubaix and part of the day's stage went over some cobblestones which are traditionally used in the Spring Classic, Paris–Roubaix. When the peloton went over a section of cobblestones at Querenaing, Catieau, Ocaña and three of teammates together with a group of 5 riders attacked and got an advantage. This advantage was over five minutes at one point but the chasing group reduced this to two and a half minutes at the finish.

It is currently owned by Public Television 19, Inc., the holding company for the area's PBS member television station, KCPT. Known as \\"The Bridge,\\" it airs an adult album alternative format. The sale of KTBG to PT19 was announced in April 2013, and after FCC approval, the actual transfer occurred Tuesday, December 17, 2013 immediately after KTBG’s 7pm broadcast of All Things Considered. History KTBG signed on April 1, 1962 as KCMW under the ownership of the Central Missouri State College (now University of Central Missouri.) In 1971 it began airing National Public Radio and jazz programming under the ownership of the University of Central Missouri. In August 2001, the station adopted its current call letters and switched to the current format. The first song played after NPR's Morning Edition was \\"Some Bridges\\" by Jackson Browne. For years, KCMW (now KTBG) operated from a 443-foot tower on the Johnson/Lafayette County line. As a result, even though it operated at 97,000 watts, it only provided secondary coverage of Kansas City itself and was marginal at best west of the Missouri River. This was likely necessary to protect the University of Kansas' KJHK at adjacent 90.7. On April 18, 2013 the University of Central Missouri Board of Governors signed a letter of intent to transfer ownership of KTBG to Public Television 19, owner of KCPT. Kliff Kuehl, CEO and President of KCPT, indicated that while some changes would take place to KTBG once the transfer was approved by the FCC, the station would maintain its current music format. After the transfer to KCPT, the KTBG broadcast studios were moved to the KCPT building in Kansas City, and KTBG's transmitter was moved to a new tower 20 miles closer to Kansas City. Although still relatively short, at 547 feet, it still improved reception in the Kansas City metro. The reported sale price for the station was $1.1 million cash, plus an additional $550,000 in \\"in kind\\" services. Format KTBG airs several music programs, including World Cafe, Eclectic Cafe, and Blues Quest. The station focuses on newer music. For a long time, KTBG also aired Morning Edition, Weekend Edition and All Things Considered because the area's main NPR station, KCUR, only provides rimshot coverage of the eastern portion of the market. Many of the Kansas City stations must conform their signals to protect Whiteman Air Force Base in Knob Noster, near Warrensburg. Unusually for an NPR station, it aired football and basketball games of the University of Central Missouri Mules. When KCPT took over the station, all NPR programming (except World Cafe), as well as UCM sports programming, were dropped from the schedule.

It was opened in 1857 by the Wells & Fakenham Railway, later part of the Great Eastern Railway's Wymondham to Wells branch, and became a junction in 1866 with the arrival of the West Norfolk Junction Railway. It closed in 1964.  Opening  The former Wells-next-the- Sea Station in 2007 Wells was first linked with the railway in 1857 when the Wells & Fakenham Railway opened a line to , largely driven by the efforts of Lord Leicester and the directors of the railway company. It was originally planned to have been open on 1 June 1857, but negotiations with the Eastern Counties Railway, which would operate the line, delayed it until 1 December 1857. They hoped that the railway would help reverse the declining fortunes of the town, whose inability to take ships of increasing size saw it overtaken by other ports. The decline continued notwithstanding the construction of a short branch line to Wells Harbour in 1860. In 1862, the Wells & Fakenham Railway became part of the Great Eastern Railway, a move which brought greater importance to the Wells line by providing a north-south connection with London's increasing food markets. The West Norfolk Junction Railway was the next to come to Wells, on 17 August 1866. The line came from on an single track aimed at exploiting the great arc of coastline between Hunstanton and Yarmouth. This line entered Wells on a sharp curve, turning through a full 180 degrees before converging with the Wells & Fakenham branch from for the final approach. West Norfolk services used the outer face of a sheltered wooden island platform to the south of the station, with the inner face for services to Dereham and . The Dereham side was unusual in that there was a platform on either side of the train, allowing the passengers the choice of which side to alight from, much the same as and stations.  Station facilities  The main red brick two-storey 'L' shaped Georgian-style station buildings were constructed at right angles to the platform ends and incorporated a stationmaster's residence. Wells had a combined engine shed and goods shed, with the locomotives having use of the whole shed when not required for goods. This adjoined the main station building on the Wells & Fakenham platform side. In 1929 the original turntable was replaced by a second-hand version. This lay just to the north of the station, and was capable of accommodating the former Great Eastern's \\"Claud Hamilton\\" locomotives and other 4-4-0 classes, but not the B12s or other large engines. Wells was an outstation of Norwich depot, and there were up to five locomotives based there. The shed officially closed in September 1955 and has since been demolished.  Operations  Plaque on station building Wells was a busy terminal station for almost 100 years, with a dozen or so passenger trains calling each day and goods trains from the harbour. Messrs Dewing & Kersley opened a corn mill adjacent to the station in 1904, and the smell of animal feedstuffs often wafted into the station to mix with the smoke, steam and hot oil odours given off by the locomotives, and the fishy smells coming from the 'Stiffkey Blues' cockles loaded into the guards' vans of trains. The post-war boom experienced by the King's Lynn to Hunstanton line was not felt on the West Norfolk Junction Railway, whose inconveniently- sited stations contributed to declining passenger traffic. Passenger services between Wells and Heacham were withdrawn from 2 June 1952, but the line remained open to freight. In the North Sea flood of 1953, the track between Wells and was so severely damaged that British Railways considered it not worth repairing and the line was closed completely between these two places. The station closed a little over ten years later when the line from Dereham to Wells closed to passenger traffic on 5 October 1964, freight continuing until the end of the month. Present day In 2007 the station building was a second-hand bookshop and pottery, with the site of the platforms an industrial estate known as Great Eastern Way. The old corn mill was used as a furniture warehouse, before being converted into flats. Part of the ground floor is occupied by Wells Antiques Centre and Glaven Veterinary Centre. = Wells and Walsingham Light Railway = Since 1982, there has been a second station at Wells, the terminus of the narrow gauge Wells and Walsingham Light Railway. This station is to the south of where the original line crossed the main coast road on the level.

Lady Jeanne Louise Campbell (10 December 1928 – 4 June 2007) was a British socialite, actress, and foreign correspondent who wrote for the Evening Standard in the 1950s and 1960s. Early life Lady Jeanne was the daughter of Ian Douglas Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll (1903–1973) and his first wife, the Hon. Janet Gladys Aitken (1908–1988), whose own father was Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook. After their divorce in 1934, her father remarried three times, including to Margaret, Duchess of Argyll. Her father inherited the dukedom from his first cousin once removed, Niall Diarmid Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll upon his death in 1949. Her mother remarried to the Hon. Drogo Montagu (1908–1940), the second son of George Montagu, 9th Earl of Sandwich, who died during World War II. Through her mother, she was a granddaughter of the Canadian born press baron Lord Beaverbrook, who was the owner of the Evening Standard. Through her father, she was the great-niece of Queen Victoria's daughter Louise, who married John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll, the fourth Governor General of Canada. Career In the 1950s and 1960s, Lady Jeanne went to New York City, where she became a foreign correspondent for the Evening Standard, which was owned by her grandfather, Lord Beaverbrook. She covered John F. Kennedy's funeral in 1963, writing that Jackie \\"Kennedy has given the American people the one thing they have always lacked: majesty.\\" In January 1974, Lady Jeanne's half-brother, Ian Campbell, 12th Duke of Argyll, set up the Clan Campbell Society of the United States in New York City. She was appointed by him to serve as the Society's High Commissioner, which, essentially, was the personal representative of the head of the Campbell Clan in the United States. Lady Jeanne, a friend of Tennessee Williams, was interested in acting, joined The Old Vic, and starred in La Mama, a play which was held at a downtown avant-garde theater. Personal life Lady Jeanne Campbell was twice married and known for her many lovers. Reportedly, she had affairs with Nikita Khrushchev, Fidel Castro, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, Randolph Churchill, the son of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Oswald Mosley, Ian Fleming, and Henry Luce II, the founder of Time magazine. She was first married to the American writer Norman Mailer (1923–2007) in 1962. He described her as “a remarkable girl, almost as interesting, complex and Machiavellian” as himself.Mahoney, Rosemary. \\"Powerful Attractions\\", The New York Times Magazine, New York, 30 December 2007.

In 1967, she married her second husband, John Sergeant Cram III (1932–2007), a grandson of John Sergeant Cram and Anthony Joseph Drexel Jr., and great- grandson of railroad tycoon Jay Gould. They divorced in 1968 after becoming the parents of: * Cusi Cram (b. 1967), who is also an actress, a Herrick- prize-winning playwright, and an Emmy-nominated writer for the children's animated television program, Arthur. However, it was later revealed that Cusi was not Cram's daughter, but, in fact, the daughter of a Bolivian ambassador to the United Nations. Lady Jeanne died on 4 June 2007. Her funeral was held at St. Joseph's Church on 6th Avenue in New York City. In popular culture Reportedly, Lady Jeanne was the basis for \\"the bitch\\" in Norman Mailer's 1965 novel, An American Dream. The novel was controversial at the time for its portrayal and treatment of women, including the protagonist's murder of his estranged wife, a high society woman.

He was aboard an EB-66 aircraft whose call sign was Bat 21. As the ranking navigator/EWO on the aircraft, he was seated immediately behind the pilot, giving him the call sign \\"Bat 21 Bravo\\". He survived for days behind enemy lines until he was retrieved in a ground operation. His rescue was the longest and most costly search and rescue mission during the Vietnam War. He received the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal and a Purple Heart during his career. Military career Hambleton served in the United States Army Air Forces during the last years of World War II without seeing any combat. Released from active duty at the end of the war, he retained a Reserve commission and was recalled back to active duty by the United States Air Force (USAF) during the 1950s. During the Korean War, he flew 43 sorties as navigator in a B-29 Superfortress. He then worked during the 1960s on various USAF ballistic missile projects such as the PGM-19 Jupiter, Titan I ICBM and Titan II ICBM. From 1965 to 1971, he commanded the 571st Strategic Missile Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, and was also the deputy chief of operations for his squadron's parent unit, the Strategic Air Command's 390th Strategic Missile Wing at Davis- Monthan AFB. =Vietnam War= Hambleton switched from the Strategic Air Command to Seventh Air Force and was assigned to the 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS) in Korat, Thailand as a navigator. The 42 TEWS was equipped with EB-66C/E Destroyer aircraft that flew radar and communications jamming missions to disrupt enemy defenses and early warning capabilities. On his 63rd mission, on April 2, 1972, Hambleton was a navigator aboard an EB-66C gathering signals intelligence, including identifying enemy anti-aircraft radar installations, to enable jamming. The aircraft was helping escort a cell of three B-52 bombers tasked with attacking entrance passes to the Ho Chi Minh trail. While just south of the DMZ and immediately north of Quang Tri at about , the aircraft was destroyed by a Soviet-built SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile. Hambleton was the only one of the three-man crew able to eject. He parachuted into the middle of the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive and landed in the midst of tens of thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers. His eventual rescue from behind enemy lines was the \\"largest, longest, and most complex search-and-rescue\\" operation during the entire Vietnam War. Hambleton had received water survival training at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, and escape and evasion training and survival basics at the Pacific Air Command Jungle Survival School in the Philippines. During the rescue operation, five aircraft were shot down, 11 airmen were killed in action, and 2 were captured. Nine additional aircraft and helicopters were badly damaged during the rescue attempts. General Creighton Abrams finally ordered that no further air rescue operations should be attempted, but ordered a ground rescue operation. Hambleton was a USAF ballistic missile expert with a Top Secret/SCI clearance and his capture by the North Vietnamese Army would have been of tremendous benefit to them and the Soviet Union. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured that he would never have been taken to Hanoi. Hambleton was finally rescued after days by Navy SEAL Lieutenant Thomas R. Norris and VNN commando Nguyen Van Kiet in a covert, night-time infiltration behind enemy lines. Norris was awarded the Medal of Honor and Nguyen the Navy Cross. Nguyen was the only South Vietnamese naval officer given that award during the war. Hambleton was awarded the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal and a Purple Heart during his career. Death  Hambleton died on September 19, 2004, in Tucson, Arizona, at age 85. The cause of death was pneumonia related to lung cancer, according to a family member. In popular media The story of Hambleton's evasion and rescue was told in the 1980 book, Bat 21, written by Air Force Colonel William Charles Anderson.Anderson, William C.BAT-21 Prentice-Hall, 1980. This was followed by the dramatic 1988 film, Bat*21, starring Gene Hackman as Hambleton and Danny Glover as a forward air controller. A second book, The Rescue of Bat 21, based on a large amount of declassified information, was written by Col. Darrel D. Whitcomb and published in 1998. Whitcomb was a decorated pilot and from 1972 to 1974 a forward air controller based in Southeast Asia.

He was one of the first police officers hired by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia when its Day Watch was first formed in 1855. He played a role in the trial of the conspirators in the Abraham Lincoln assassination. Arrested but never charged in the conspiracy, Lloyd's testimony was critical in convicting Mary Surratt. Early life and career John Minchin Lloyd's date of birth is not clear, but two sources have him born in 1835 in southern Maryland in the United States to William Lloyd. He was the oldest of two sons. By 1850, 14-year-old John and his father had moved into Washington, D.C. He probably had little schooling, and instead apprenticed as a bricklayer. By 1855, John Lloyd was working full-time as a bricklayer, and living at 506 8th Street NW. The City of Washington had organized a night constabulary in October 1804, but after members of the Whig Party rioted in the city in 1842 and nearly assaulted President John Tyler, a new police force was organized. In March 1851, the police force was reorganized into a day watch, night watch, and auxiliary. John M. Lloyd was appointed one of new police officers, at a yearly salary of $480 ($ in dollars). It is not clear when Lloyd joined the force or what duties he was assigned, for he does not appear in the list of officers assigned to wards in 1851. But in 1855, records show that Lloyd was assigned to the 7th Police District, and his pay was raised to $576 a year ($ in dollars). His pay rose to $630 a year ($ in dollars) in 1858. The District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department was organized by Congress in August 1861, replacing the police forces of the City of Washington, Georgetown, and the District of Columbia (that portion of the District outside the City of Washington's city limits). For reasons that are not clear, Lloyd left the Metropolitan Police Department in 1862. His profession upon leaving the police force is also unknown. It is well understood, however, that Lloyd was openly sympathetic to the cause of the Confederate States of America. The American Civil War broke out in April 1861, and in 1862 Lloyd may have left the force due to his political views. Involvement in the Lincoln assassination =Leasing the Surratt tavern= Lloyd moved out of the District of Columbia after resigning from the police force, and into Prince George's County. He later told Mary Surratt that he spent time running a tavern there. In December 1864, Lloyd moved to the bustling village of Surrattsville. Mary Surratt, a widow and Confederate sympathizer, owned a tavern, inn, carriage house, corn crib, forge, general store, granary, gristmill, stable, tobacco curing house, wheelwright's shop in the center of town, and of nearby farmland. In the fall of 1864, she began considering moving to her townhouse in the city. Surratt leased her tavern to Lloyd on December 1 for $500 a year, and moved into town the same day. Mrs. Surratt lived in her townhouse with her daughter, Anna, and son, John. Over the next five months, she rented rooms to a number of people, including Louis J. Weichmann; John Surratt; George Atzerodt, and Lewis Powell. These last three men, David Herold and John Wilkes Booth subsequently conspired to kidnap President Abraham Lincoln in March 1865. When that plot failed, they decided to assassinate the president instead. Lincoln was fatally shot at Ford's Theatre on the evening of April 14, 1865. =Meetings with the conspirators= As part of the plot to kidnap Lincoln in March 1865, John Surratt, Atzerodt, and conspirator David Herold hid two Spencer carbines, ammunition, and some other supplies at the Surratt tavern in Surrattsville. On April 11, Mary Surratt rented a carriage and drove to the Surrattsville tavern to collect (she later said) a debt owed her by a former neighbor. But according to Lloyd, Surratt told him to get the \\"shooting irons\\" ready to be picked up. Worried that the inn might be searched by federal troops, Lloyd was concerned about the weapons left in his possession. Later that day, he asked George Atzerodt what to do with them, and was told to bury them. On April 14, Surratt once again visited the family tavern in Surrattsville on April 14 (the day of the assassination) to collect a debt. Shortly before she left the city, Booth visited the Surratt boarding house and spoke privately with Mrs. Surratt. He gave her a package (later found to contain binoculars) to give to Lloyd. Surratt delivered the package, and (according to Lloyd) again told Lloyd to have the \\"shooting irons\\" ready for pick-up and handed him a wrapped package from Booth. (Booth and Herold picked up the rifles and binoculars that evening as they fled Washington after Lincoln's assassination.) Lloyd repaired a broken spring on Mrs. Surratt's wagon before she left. =Arrest and confession= Federal investigators immediately identified Booth and his co- conspirators, and believed they had headed south into Maryland and then Virginia in an attempt to escape. Nodley Anderson, an innkeeper in the hamlet of Piscataway, Maryland, notified them that the Surratt tavern in Surrattsville was a notorious meeting place for Confederate spies, and that Lloyd may know something about the assassination. When questioned, Lloyd initially denied knowing Booth or Herold, and had seen neither man the night of the assassination. He was questioned a second time by D.C. police, and repeated his claims. After the police left, he fled the tavern and went to the home of his wife's relatives in the hamlet of Allens Fresh, Charles County, Maryland. But local Surrattsville residents told investigators that Lloyd did indeed know Booth and some of the other conspirators, and with Mrs. Surratt having been arrested on April 17, federal troops finally went in pursuit of Lloyd. Lloyd had already decided to return to Surrattsville to avoid suspicion, and was arrested on the road there on April 18, 1865. John Lloyd was interrogated at a makeshift headquarters in Robey's post office in Surrattsville on April 18, 19, and 20. His interrogators included Captain George Cottingham, U.S. Army, several other U.S. Army officers, and several D.C police detectives. Whether Lloyd was tortured in order to obtain his testimony is highly contested by published sources. Several sources claim Lloyd was an alcoholic, and was denied liquor in order to take advantage of his illness and make him talk. Some sources claim Lloyd was hung by his thumbs until he agreed to testify against Mrs. Surratt. Higdon says Lloyd was merely threatened with hanging by his thumbs, but not tortured. But most sources claim that Lloyd was merely intensively interrogated without the use of torture or deprivation of alcohol. Larson argues that the interrogation merely consisted of \\"several days of back-and-forth questioning, stalling, intimidation, and obfuscation, manipulating Lloyd and wearing him down in the hopes of extracting a confession.\\" Cottingham revealed that Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton had called for the death penalty for the conspirators. Cottingham played off Lloyd's fears that his family might also be arrested or tried, and that the military would seek to put him to death unless he confessed. Lloyd told Cottingham that he feared being murdered by the other conspirators, but by April 22 Cottingham had wrung a full confession from Lloyd. Lloyd informed his interrogators that John Surratt, Atzerodt, and Herold had hidden a pair of carbines, ammunition, some rope, and a wrench in a wall on the second floor. He admitted that Mrs. Surratt had reminded him of their existence on April 11 and April 14. He also revealed that Booth and Herold had visited the tavern near midnight on April 14, taking one of the guns as well as the field glasses and some whiskey. Booth, Lloyd said, bragged that he had killed Lincoln. Lloyd helped the investigators recover the second gun, which confirmed his testimony. Seeing his wife at the tavern, Lloyd cried, \\"Oh, Mrs. Surratt, that vile woman, she has ruined me! I am to be shot!\\" Lloyd was transferred to the Union Army's headquarters at Bryantown, Maryland, where he was further interrogated by Colonel Henry H. Wells. He revealed more details of the conspiracy, and of Booth and Herold's visit on April 14. Portions of his testimony tended to implicate John and Mary Surratt, George Atzertodt, and David Herold in the assassination plot. Lloyd was transferred to the Old Capitol Prison in Washington D.C., on April 23. He was questioned further there. =Assassination trial testimony= Although John Lloyd was imprisoned for some weeks, he was never charged with any crimes and was eventually released. The reason was his testimony: The law at the time did not permit prosecutors to try a witness for conspiracy if he testified against his co-conspirators. Secretary of War Stanton and military prosecutors understood that Lloyd would go free, but they would win the conviction of Surratt and the others in the process. The prosecution presented nine witnesses against Mrs. Surratt, but most of their case rested on the testimony of just two men—John Lloyd and Surratt boarding house tenant Louis Weichmann. Lloyd testified on May 13 and 15, 1865, regarding the hiding of the carbines and other supplies at the tavern in March, and the two conversations he had with Mrs. Surratt in which she told him to get the \\"shooting irons\\" ready. The defense called Captain Cottingham, and unintentionally damaged its case. Cottingham testified that Lloyd feared that the conspirators would kill him. When asked who Cottingham believed the conspirators to be, he mentioned Lloyd's outburst about \\"Mrs. Surratt, that vile woman\\" and said he had concluded that Lloyd meant Mrs. Surratt was one of the conspirators. Lloyd's testimony had been the most important for the prosecution's case, for it indicated Mary Surratt played an active role in the conspiracy in the days just before Lincoln's death. The defense strategy was to impeach Lloyd's testimony. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism. Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated on the day of Lincoln's death (April 14), implying that he could not have remembered with clarity what happened that day. Surratt's chief attorney, Reverdy Johnson, asserted repeatedly that Lloyd was an unreliable witness, and that the evidence against Mary Surratt was entirely circumstantial. The only evidence linking Surratt to the conspiracy to kill Lincoln, he said, came from Lloyd and Weichmann, and neither man was telling the truth (he said). Lloyd's testimony was coerced, he claimed. The government's case was hindered by its failure to call as a witness the man who shared Lloyd's carriage when he talked with Mrs. Surratt (an individual who could have verified Lloyd's version of the \\"shooting irons\\" story). The nine-member military tribunal hearing the case sentenced Mary Surratt, George Atzerodt, David Herold, and Lewis Powell to death on July 5, 1865. As their crimes had occurred in an area under military jurisdiction, the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act denied them any appeal. The four were hanged at the Washington Arsenal on July 7, 1865. Death and descendants Grave of John M. Lloyd at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C. In October 1865, Lloyd moved back to the District of Columbia from Surrattsville. For the rest of his life, Lloyd worked as a bricklayer and construction contractor in Washington, D.C. He was severely injured in early December 1892 when, while helping to construct a building, the scaffold he was standing on collapsed. He died on December 18. A Roman Catholic, Lloyd was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery. Mary Surratt's grave is about away from Lloyd's. =Personal life= The 21-year-old John married 20-year-old Mary Elizabeth Mahorney (sometimes spelled Mahoney) of Virginia in 1857. They had several children, but all died of smallpox at a young age and none survived him.

Its clients include shipowners and operators, shipyards, and companies involved in the upstream oil and gas markets, as well as windfarm operators. The group employs more than 480 people in 13 offices in Arendal, Athens, Bergen, Bermuda, Helsinki, Hong Kong, Imabari, London, New York, Oslo, Singapore, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo.  History  Assuranceforeningen Gard was founded in Norway in 1907. The establishment of this new marine mutual reflected the historical importance of Arendal as a shipping centre, but it was also driven by owners of sailing ships’ reluctance to subsidise the liabilities arising from steam operations. Although Gard's P&I; business has its origins from this period, its marine activities can be traced back to as far as 1867 with the establishment of Æolus, which later became part of the Storebrand group. With time, the importance of Arendal as a major Norwegian shipping-hub waned and the Second World War took a heavy toll on owners insured with Gard. As a result, by 1945, the Gard's membership had shrunk severely. In the post-war period, Gard progressively regained its position as a major P&I; Club. This development was characterised by two factors, the substantial growth of the Norwegian national fleet between 1950 and 1970, and the increasingly international nature of the membership. While the Gard today retains its Norwegian identity, it has become a global P&I; club, where less than 30% of the current entered tonnage is Norwegian owned or controlled. After having managed If's marine and energy book for more than three years, it was resolved in October 2003 to purchase this portfolio.  Business  The group's business revolves around five client segments:http://www.gard.no/web/products = Shipowners, operators and charterers= The shipowner segment is the largest source of premium volume, and provides liability, property and income insurances to shipowners and operators. Offering tailor-made covers to suit individual operators, as well as many non-standard P&I; shipping covers. Liability insurance, known as P&I; insurance, protects the shipowner against third-party liabilities and expenses arising from the ownership and operation of ships. The insurance is provided through a mutual structure which means that the buyers of the insurance are effectively the insurer. One of the particularities of the P&I; clubs, is that they participate in a claims sharing and collective reinsurance purchasing arrangement through the International Group of P&I; Clubs. The reinsurance programme is the largest in the world and has a capacity exceeding US$5.5 billion. The arrangement, due to its size and structure, enables the clubs to significantly reduce their risk capital requirements in a cost-effective way.https://www.igpandi.org/reinsurance The resulting savings should hence over time be reflected in the premium levels shipowners pay for their P&I; cover. Property insurance covers the assured against losses that may occur to the vessel and her equipment as a result of an accident, while income insurance protects against losses where the ship is wholly or partially deprived of income as a result of it being out of operation. These insurances are provided by Gard on a commercial basis rather than through the mutual organisation. The earnings from this business are therefore retained for the benefit of the mutual members (the buyers of mutual P&I; cover). = Marine builders risk = The Gard group also provides covers for Marine Builder's Risks. This provides cover for the shipbuilding industry against the risks of building vessels (from “keel laying” to delivery) and for conversion projects. A range of covers related to the newbuilding process, such as towage, delay in delivery, non-delivery also fall under this business unit. Mortgage covers are also written for banks and financial institutions. These covers protect policyholder against the perils of non-payment of outstanding loans and interests in “sailing” vessels, i.e., they are not linked to newbuilding projects. = Upstream oil and gas markets = Gard's third business unit provides insurance for companies in the upstream oil and gas markets, these include large oil producers, as well as contractors operating mobile offshore units, such as accommodation units and FPSOs. Cover ranges from traditional property and casualty to liability insurances. =Small craft = For operators and owners of small crafts such as passenger and local ferries, fishing vessels, tugs, dredgers, coastal cargo carriers, pushers, pontoons, barges and more. = Defence = Insurance against legal and other costs incurred in establishing and defending claims from business operations.

To Shinohara's disappointment, French champion David Douillet did not compete at Birmingham due to back injury; Shinohara was quoted as saying, \\"Even though I lifted the double crown at the worlds, it won't mean anything as long as people say it was won in Douillet's absence.\\" Douillet had previously been declared victor at the 1997 championships in Paris after a French judge gave Shinohara a controversial penalty. Three years after, Shinohara received the silver medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics when he was defeated by Douillet due to another disputed judgment about Uchi Mata Sukashi in the finals which was strongly protested by the Japanese participants. Douillet performed Uchi Mata but over- rotated and landed on his back; Shinohara fell to the mat as well. One judge had ruled for Shinohara, while the other two ruled for Douillet. Shinohara cried throughout the medal ceremony as a result of his loss, while head coach and 1984 Olympic champion Yasuhiro Yamashita harshly criticised the judges and apologized to Shinohara for his powerlessness after the ceremony. However, at a later press conference, Shinohara expressed that he was not dissatisfied with the judgment, stating, \\"I lost because I was weak. Douillet was strong.\\" As of 2007, Shinohara coaches judo at his alma mater, Tenri University, where he previously studied as an undergraduate. Among his students is Asian champion Takamasa Anai. Shinohara portrayed himself in the 2016 game Yakuza Kiwami, serving as a potential opponent for protagonist Kazuma Kiryu.

Parler has a significant user base of Trump supporters, conservatives, and Saudi nationalists. Posts on the website often contain far-right content, antisemitism, and conspiracy theories. The site has been described as an alternative to Twitter, and is popular among people who have been banned from mainstream social networks, or who oppose their moderation policies. The site markets itself as a \\"free speech\\" and unbiased alternative to mainstream social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. However, journalists and users have criticized the service for content policies that are more restrictive than the company portrays, and sometimes more restrictive than those of its competitors. , the site had 2.8 million users, many of whom joined in mid-2020. History In June 2020, Dan Bongino (pictured) announced he had purchased an \\"ownership stake\\" in Parler. The company has declined to provide a full list of owners. Parler () was founded by John Matze and Jared Thomson in Henderson, Nevada in 2018. Matze is the company's chief executive officer and Thomson serves as the chief technology officer. Both Matze and Thomson are alumni of the University of Denver computer science program, and some other Parler senior staff also attended the school. Parler launched in August 2018, and its user base grew to 100,000 users by May 2019. A December 2018 tweet by conservative activist Candace Owens brought 40,000 of those users to the site, causing Parler's servers to malfunction. The site initially attracted some Republican personalities including former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, Utah Senator Mike Lee, and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, and some who were banned from other social media networks such as the far-right activists and commentators Gavin McInnes, Laura Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos. Reuters wrote that Parler had \\"mostly been a home for supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump\\" until June 2019. Matze told the news organization that although he had intended Parler to be bipartisan, the site had focused its marketing efforts toward conservatives as they began to embrace the website. In June 2019, Parler said its user base more than doubled when around 200,000 accounts from Saudi Arabia signed up to the network. Largely supporters of the controversial Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the users migrated from Twitter after alleging they were experiencing censorship on the platform. Although Twitter did not acknowledge removing posts by Saudi users that might have triggered the exodus, the company had previously deactivated hundreds of accounts that were supportive of the Saudi government, which Twitter had described as \\"inauthentic\\" accounts in an \\"electronic army\\" pushing the Saudi government's agenda. The influx of new accounts to Parler caused some service interruptions, at times making the site unusable. Parler described the Saudi accounts as part of \\"the nationalist movement of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\\" and encouraged other users to welcome them to the service. Some of the Saudi users tweeted the #MAGA hashtag and photos of President Trump with the Saudi royal family to try to curry favor with Parler's largely Trump-supporting and far-right user base. The Saudi accounts found a mixed reception among the existing user base; some welcomed the Saudi users, others made Islamophobic remarks, and some expressed beliefs that the new accounts were bots. Parler experienced a surge in signups in mid-2020. In May, Twitter sparked outrage among President Trump and his supporters when it flagged some of the president's tweets about mail-in ballots as \\"potentially misleading,\\" and a tweet regarding the George Floyd protests as \\"glorifying violence.\\" In response, Parler published a \\"Declaration of Internet Independence\\" modeled after the United States Declaration of Independence, and began using the #Twexit hashtag (a reference to Brexit). Describing Twitter as a \\"Tech Tyrant\\" that censored conservatives, the campaign encouraged Twitter users to migrate to Parler. Conservative commentator Dan Bongino announced on June 16 that he had purchased an \\"ownership stake\\" in Parler in an effort to \\"fight back against the Tech Tyrants\\" Twitter and Facebook. On June 18, Brad Parscale endorsed Parler in a tweet, also writing, \\"Hey @twitter your days are numbered\\" and including a screenshot of a tweet from President Trump which Twitter had flagged as manipulated media. On June 19, controversial right-wing English media personality Katie Hopkins was permanently suspended from Twitter for violating their policies on \\"hateful conduct\\". An account claiming to be hers appeared on Parler shortly after the ban, and was quickly verified by Parler. After collecting $500 in donations solicited on Parler to purportedly sue Twitter over the ban, Parler removed the account. A Twitter account affiliating itself with the hacktivist group Anonymous claimed responsibility for the impersonation on June 20, saying that the donations would be donated to Black Lives Matter groups, a movement Hopkins has mocked in the past. Parler acknowledged that the impersonator had been \\"verified by an employee improperly\\", and Matze made a public apology. Hopkins herself joined Parler on June 20, with Matze posting that he had personally verified her account. The incident drew some attention to Parler within the United Kingdom. Thirteen MPs had joined as of June 23, and some British right-wing and conservative activists endorsed the service over Twitter. On June 24, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump campaign was looking for alternatives to social media networks that had restricted their posts and advertising, and that Parler was being considered. Texas Senator Ted Cruz published a YouTube video on June 25 in which he denounced other social media platforms for \\"flagrantly silencing those with whom they disagree\\" and announced that he was \\"proud to join Parler.\\" Other prominent Republican and conservative figures also joined in June, including Ohio Representative Jim Jordan, New York Representative Elise Stefanik, and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. Controversial right-wing President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro joined Parler on July 13. Earlier in July, his son Flávio Bolsonaro endorsed Parler on Twitter. As a result of their interest in the site, Parler experienced a wave of signups from Brazil in July. According to Bloomberg News, Brazilian users made up over half of all Parler signups that month. Twitter had also taken down some of President Bolsonaro's posts in March 2020 for violating their rules on spreading disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Alexa Internet 15.7% of visitors to the site over the previous 30 days came from Brazil.  Usage  In the last week of June 2020, it was estimated that the app had more than 1.5 million daily users. , Parler had 2.8 million total users and had been downloaded 2.5 million times, nearly half of which were in June. On June 26, Parler was the top app in the news category on the Apple App Store, and 24th overall. In late June, Parler was in the top five free apps on the Google Play Store. On July 3, Parler was the third most popular app on the App Store. Despite the wave in signups in mid-2020, some news outlets have expressed doubt that Parler will remain popular or enter mainstream usage. According to TheWrap, after several weeks of more than 700,000 downloads a week, Parler's weekly downloads subsided back into the low 100,000s during mid-July. Bloomberg News also reported that downloads of the app had substantially slowed following the initial wave, and described Parler's June download numbers as a \\"small fraction\\" of apps like TikTok, which receives tens of millions of downloads a month. Parler's user base, though it grew substantially in the middle of 2020, remained much smaller than that of its competitors. , Twitter had 300 million active users and Facebook had 2.6 billion active users, whereas Parler had 2.8 million users in total. Slate wrote that alternative social networks like Parler \\"normally ... just don’t get that big\\". Although some high-profile figures have created accounts on Parler, many of them remain more active on and have substantially larger follower bases on mainstream social networks. Mic questioned how long Parler's spike in popularity would last, citing as an obstacle the reluctance among those with large Twitter followings to migrate to a new service. The Daily Beast noted in July 2020 that many high-profile conservatives who opened accounts on Parler in the previous month had since stopped using the site, while remaining active on mainstream social networks. Some have described Parler as a backup in case Twitter bans them. User base and content Parler has a significant user base of Trump supporters and conservatives. It is noted for its far-right and alt-right, conspiratorial, antisemitic, and anti- feminist content. The site also includes anti-Muslim content, although it also has a substantial user base of Saudi nationalists who support Crown Prince and de facto prime minister of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. Both The Independent and The Forward have noted the presence of antisemitic content and conspiracy theories on the site. Matze told The Forward he was unaware of antisemitic content on Parler, but was unsurprised that it was there. He believes removing hateful content only further radicalizes people, saying, \\"If you're going to fight these peoples' views, they need to be out in the open.... Don't force these people into the corners of the internet where they're not going to be able to be proven wrong.\\" Political scientist Alison Dagnes has said of Parler's stance on speech on the platform: \\"I don't think you can have it both ways.... There is no such thing as civilized hate speech.\\" Extremism expert Chip Berlet said of Matze's opinions on hateful content: \\"I think he’s full of it.... I think he knows exactly what he’s creating, he’s encouraging people who basically don’t like other folks in the country... it's bologna, this is a place for people to fester in their own bigotry.\\" Parler has served as an echo chamber for far-right or pro-Trump content, according to The Independent, the New Statesman, and Fast Company. In mid-2020, Jack Posobiec, correspondent of the pro-Trump OANN and former proponent of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, compared the service to a Trump rally, saying that Parler lacks the \\"energy\\" that Twitter draws from having communities of people with differing viewpoints. Around the same time, extremism researcher and professor Amarnath Amarasingam said of Parler, \\"talking to yourself in the dark corners of the internet is actually not that satisfying,\\" and that he was skeptical Parler would excite the far right without left-leaning users with whom they can interact and fight. In June 2020, Matze said he wanted to see more debate on the platform and offered a \\"progressive bounty\\" of $10,000 to liberal pundits with at least 50,000 Twitter or Facebook followers who would join the site; receiving no takers, he later increased this amount to $20,000. Parler refers to users of its service as Parleyers. Parler is one of a number of alternative social network platforms, including Minds, MeWe, Gab, and BitChute, that are popular with people banned from mainstream networks such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, and Instagram. Deen Freelon and colleagues writing in Science characterized Parler as among alt-tech sites that are \\"dedicated to right-wing communities\\", and listed the site along with 4chan, 8chan, BitChute, and Gab. They noted there are also more ideologically neutral alt-tech platforms, such as Discord and Telegram. Appearance and features The Parler feed of Andy Biggs as it appeared on June 30, 2020. Parler is a microblogging service that is both a website and an app. The name was originally intended to be pronounced as in French (, ), but is often pronounced as the English word \\"parlor\\" (, ). It is available on both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Users who register for accounts are able to follow the accounts of other users. Unlike Twitter, the feed of posts – called \\"Parleys\\" or \\"Parlays\\" – from followed accounts appears to a user chronologically, instead of through an algorithm-based selection process. Parleys are limited to 1,000 characters in length, and users can \\"vote\\" or \\"echo\\" the posts of other users whom they follow, functions that have been compared to Twitter's \\"like\\" and \\"retweet\\" functions. A direct messaging feature is also built into the platform, allowing users to privately contact each other. Public figures are verified on the app with a gold badge, and parody accounts are identified with a purple badge. Anyone who verifies their identity by providing government-issued photo identification during signup is identified with a red badge. Parler has been described by Forbes in June 2020 as \\"like a barebones Twitter.\\" The same month, Fast Company wrote that Parler was \\"well-designed and organized,\\" also noting its similar appearance to Twitter. The Conversation described the service in July 2020 as \\"very similar to Twitter in appearance and function, albeit clunkier.\\" Jacob Wohl, a far-right conspiracy theorist who said he would use the platform after he was banned from Instagram and Facebook, criticized the site's user experience in September 2020, saying, \\"Their technical wherewithal is atrocious, Parler hardly works, it’s a website and application that would fit right in, in about 2006. It’s really bad.\\" =Content and moderation= Parler describes itself as a free speech platform, and its founders have proclaimed that the site engages in minimal moderation and will not fact-check posts. They have also said they will allow posts that have been removed or flagged as misinformation on other social media networks like Twitter. Parler's CEO Matze said in an interview with CNBC on June 27, 2020, \\"We're a community town square, an open town square, with no censorship... If you can say it on the street of New York, you can say it on Parler.\\" The website has been popular among conservatives who allege Twitter has been biased when moderating content or flagging misinformation. However, the site has been criticized by some who believe its content policies are more restrictive than the company portrays, and sometimes more restrictive than those of the mainstream social media platforms to which it claims to be an unbiased free speech alternative. Parler's site guidelines disallow content including pornography, obscenity, or indecency; blackmail; support for terrorism; false rumors; promoting marijuana; and \\"fighting words\\" directed towards others. Parler says that their policy is based on the positions of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Supreme Court, although Gizmodo has described this as \\"nonsensical,\\" noting that the FCC only moderates public airwaves, not internet content, and that some of Parler's rules are more restrictive than restrictions imposed by either the FCC or the Supreme Court. On June 30, 2020, after Parler banned a spate of accounts, Matze published a post on the website outlining some of the site's rules. Some of the rules in his post, such as one asking users not to publish photos of feces, were described by The Independent as \\"bizarre.\\" Slate and Gizmodo noted that the top reply to Matze's post identified that \\"Twitter allows four of the five things that Parler censors.\\" Some of the clauses in Parler's user agreement have been criticized as \\"unusual\\" and seemingly contradictory to its mission, including one that allows Parler to remove content and ban users \\"at any time and for any reason or no reason,\\" and one that would require a user to pay for any of Parler's legal expenses incurred as a result of their use of the site. The Daily Dot reported on June 30, 2020 that Parler had been banning left-wing accounts including parody accounts and those criticizing Parler. Newsweek also wrote about accounts being banned from the service, some of which appeared to have been intentionally testing the limits of the site's free speech ethos. The Washington Post described a user who had been banned for speaking out against opposing viewpoints on Parler, and posting a photo \\"that some could consider explicit.\\" Mic wrote that Parler has used the personal information provided during signup to ban those they've identified as \\"teenage leftists.\\" Will Duffield of the Cato Institute wrote that Matze had also apparently instituted a blanket ban on antifa supporters. Matze told The Washington Post that he does not see Parler's site guidelines as contradictory to its stance on free speech. In an interview with CNSNews.com on August 5, 2020, Matze acknowledged that the site's guidelines were \\"really awkward\\" and said that they were being revised by a lawyer. He also said that Parler would never ban hate speech, saying that the company \\"refuse[s] to ban people on something so arbitrary that it can’t be defined.\\" , Parler had a team of 200 volunteer moderators. Matze told Fortune the same month that he wanted to expand the moderation team to 1,000 volunteers. =Registration and verification= Creating an account and using Parler is free. Signup requires both an e-mail address and phone number. At the point of registration, users have the option of supplying a photo of themselves and a scan of the front and back of their government-issued photo identification to have their account verified by Parler. Individual users can set their account to only view Parleys from other verified users, if they choose. According to Matze, the purpose of the verification feature is to allow users to minimize their contact with trolls. Anyone who verifies their identity on Parler is given a red badge, and people considered to be public figures are denoted with a gold badge. According to Matze, the identification document scans submitted by users who choose to have their accounts verified are destroyed after verification. However, the requirement for ID scans to become verified has prompted conspiracy theories about the site's retention and use of user information. Business and finances , Parler has been funded by angel investors. In a June 27, 2020 interview with CNBC, Matze said he wanted to raise an institutional round of financing soon, although he expressed concerns that venture capitalists might not be interested in funding the company because of ideological differences. Fortune wrote in June 2020 that the company plans to add advertising to the site soon. They also plan to generate revenue based on an ad matching scheme whereby companies would be matched with Parler influencers to post sponsored content with Parler taking a percentage of each deal. Slate has questioned Parler's business model, writing that Parler's plan to rely on advertising revenue \\"seems far from foolproof\\" given the 2020 advertising boycotts of Facebook by some large brands who objected to hateful content on the platform. As of June 2020, Parler had 30 employees. The company has not disclosed the identity of its owners; however, Dan Bongino publicly announced in 2020 that he had purchased an \\"ownership stake\\" of unspecified value. Matze said in an interview on June 29, 2020 that the business was not profitable.

Its last assignment was with Air Mobility Command, being stationed at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. It was inactivated on October 1, 1992. History : For additional history and lineage, see 443d Operations Group In 1949, the 443d Troop Carrier Wing, Medium was established and trained as a Reserve troop-carrier wing under supervision of the 2596th Air Force Reserve Training Center, June 1949 – April 1951. The 443d was brought to active duty at Donaldson AFB, South Carolina on August 9, 1951, as a training wing by Tactical Air Command. For almost two years, the 443d participated in tactical exercises in operations, training troop-carrier aircrews using C-46 Commandos for assignment to the Far East, and worked closely with other troop-carrier groups to test and evaluate new troop-carrier doctrine and procedures. With the nearing end of the Korean War, the 443d was inactivated on January 8, 1953. In January 1966, Military Airlift Command (MAC) reactivated the 443d at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, replacing the inactivated Military Air Transport Service 1707th Air Transport Wing, Heavy. The 443d became the primary USAF wing charged with training air and ground crews of C-124 Globemaster II and the new C-141 Starlifter heavy transports, while simultaneously maintaining a capability to perform airlift operations worldwide. With the retirement of the prop-driven C-124 Globemaster II from active service, training diminished in 1967 and ceased in 1968, being replaced by training air and ground crews on the new C-5 Galaxy, a very heavy-lift transport, in 1969. The wing moved from Tinker AFB, Oklahoma to Altus AFB, Oklahoma, in 1969. The wing performed this training mission until 1992 when C-5 and C-141 training was consolidated after the end of the Cold War. Air Mobility Command reorganized Air Force Airlift units in 1992, and the 443d was inactivated on October 1, 1992, as part of the Air Force Heritage program, where notable units were retained and reassigned after the Cold War. The new 97th Air Mobility Wing, a former Eighth Air Force World War II bombardment group, and later Strategic Air Command bomb wing, absorbed the personnel, equipment and aircraft of the 443d upon its inactivation in an administrative transfer.

His position is left-back. Pearce began his career as a trainee with Aston Villa on leaving school in 1991, turning professional in June 1993, but never made a first-team appearance and signed for local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in July 1995. He only made a handful of appearances at Molineux before his transfer to Notts County in July 1997. Pearce had far more chances at Notts County, who had just been relegated to Division Three. Manager Sam Allardyce gave Pearce a regular first-team place and his first season was a great success as he inspired County to Division Three title glory – in a historic season which saw County become the first English football team to win promotion before the end of March. In four seasons at Meadow Lane, Pearce played in some 140 first-team games and was Player of the Year in his final season at the club. He transferred to Peterborough United in June 2001, where due to injury and poor form he managed just 16 competitive first team games in three seasons. He joined Stafford Rangers, moving to Conference National side Northwich Victoria in September 2004. However, he was released by Northwich in December 2004 and rejoined Stafford Rangers. He moved to Redditch United in the 2005 close season, moving to local rivals Worcester City in January 2006. He was released by Worcester in March 2007 and joined A.F.C. Telford United. However, he was released by Telford at the end of the season. He moved from Halesowen Town to Bromsgrove Rovers in the 2008 close season and was appointed as Rovers' captain. However, in December 2008 he was linked with a move from Bromsgrove back to Halesowen Town. On 10 January 2009, he did indeed move back to The Yeltz. In late 2009 he joined Stratford Town on loan, remaining with the club until the end of the season. In February 2011 he joined Barwell as player-coach. In May 2011 he moved to Stourport Swifts as player-coach.

When used by other schools, the lyrics are generally modified by changing the word \\"Auburn\\" to something else, such as the school name or mascot. History The basic lyrical structure of \\"Hooray for Auburn\\" comes from a cheer that was common in the mid-twentieth century. One of the earliest published versions of the cheer is in Lucile Hasley's 1953 book The Mouse Hunter. In 1961, Auburn High School Band director Tommy Goff wrote music for these lyrics after hearing the cheer used by the Auburn High cheerleaders at a junior varsity football game. The song began being used as the Auburn High School fight song later that year. Around 1963, LaFayette High School in LaFayette, Alabama began using the music as their fight song and soon after several other schools in eastern Alabama adopted \\"Hooray!\\".Lucile Hasley, The Mouse Hunter (New York: Sheed and Ward, 1953), 183; Alan Newton, \\"25 Years of Genius\\", Tiger Tales, October 10, 1980.

It is one of the largest NHS trusts in England and together with Imperial College London forms an academic health science centre. The trust was formed in October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust and St Mary's NHS Trust and their integration with Imperial College Faculty of Medicine. It currently manages five hospitals: Charing Cross Hospital; Hammersmith Hospital; Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital; St Mary's Hospital and Western Eye Hospital. In 2017/18 Imperial College Healthcare had a turnover of £1.2 billion, employed approximately 11,800 people and treated about 1.125 million patients. History Imperial College Healthcare was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust and St Mary's NHS Trust with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine. In July 2008 Imperial College Healthcare announced that it would be launching a pilot scheme to reward medical teams with bonuses for successful operations. In January 2009 the results of a study were published in which researchers had successfully captured MRI images of bleeding inside the hearts of 15 Imperial College Healthcare patients who had suffered a heart attack. In November 2009 a team led by Professor Paul Abel of Imperial College Healthcare performed the first removal of a rectal cancer using ultrasound. In 2009, Imperial College Healthcare Trust and Imperial College London become an academic health science centre. In 2013, interventional radiologists at the Trust used the Magellan Robotic System to treat fibroids in a world first. The Trust was designated a Genomic Medicine Centre in 2014. The same year, Hammersmith Hospital became the first in Europe to use a new heart mapping system to treat patients with complicated heart rhythm disorders. In a UK first in 2016, focused ultrasound was used at Charing Cross Hospital to treat essential tremor without brain surgery. The Trust featured in the debut series of Hospital on BBC Two in 2017, and was selected as a global digital exemplar for acute care in partnership with Chelsea and Westminster the same year. In 2019, a patient achieved a sustained remission from HIV-1 after ceasing antiretroviral treatment—becoming only the second in the world to do—after being treated with a stem cell transplant at Hammersmith Hospital. The treatment was offered to the so-called \\"London patient\\" as part of a collaboration by the stem cell transplant team at Imperial College London and HIV scientists at University College London. Organisation Hammersmith Hospital The Trust's chief executive is Professor Tim Orchard. The chair of the Trust was Lord Tugendhat from its inception in October 2007 until December 2011 when he was succeeded by Sir Richard Sykes. The current chair of the Trust is Paula Vennells CBE, who took up her post 1 April 2019. =Clinical structure= The clinical services of Imperial College Healthcare are organised into three divisions: *Medicine and integrated care *Surgery, cardiovascular and cancer division *Women's, children's and clinical support division =Finances= The Western Eye Hospital In 2012/13 it achieved a year end adjusted surplus of £9.0 million with a total income of £971.30 million, of which £752.725 million was from patient care activities and £218.549 million was from other operating revenue. In the same year it had operating expenses of £939.70 million, capital expenditure of £25.0 million. As at 31 March 2013 it had total assets of £855.737 million, total assets less current liabilities of £687.395 million and total assets employed of £664.033 million. It ended 2015/6 in deficit of £47.9 million. This was partly as a result of changes to the NHS tariff. It reported that vacancies had reached 1/6 of the nursing workforce in July 2015. In 2017/8 it predicted a deficit of £25.1 million and did not predict a full- year surplus until 2021–22. The total backlog maintenance bill had risen to £1.3 billion, the largest in the English NHS, and the trust had requested £131 million from NHS Improvement \\"to mitigate high and significant risk items\\". Overseas patients The trust issued invoices to patients thought to be ineligible for NHS treatment totalling £6.7 million in 2018–9, but only collected £2.4 million. Private income The trust has opened a clinic in Dubai. It is one of the most commercial NHS trusts, increasing private income, mostly from general and maternity care, by 19% from 2014 to 2016. About 25% of patients using private services came from overseas. =Staff= During 2017/18 the trust employed an average of 11,800 people: *Doctors—2,600 *Nurses and midwives—4,700 *Allied health professionals—720 *Scientists and technicians—1,200 *Pharmacists—130 *Medical students—900 *Nurses in education, pre-registration—470 It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 8,919 full- time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.06%. 71% of staff recommended it as a place for treatment and 62% recommended it as a place to work.  Outsourcing dispute  In April 2020, over 1,000 Sodexo cleaners, caterers and porters working at the Trust's five hospitals were made NHS employees after months of campaigning by UVW union. They had been severely underpaid in comparison to the NHS pay structure, and denied the sick pay, annual leave and pensions given to all NHS staff. Ten days of strike action and protests at St. Mary's Hospital in October and November 2019 led to negotiations and the non-renewal of Sodexo's contract. =Facilities= It was one of the first trusts to introduce a comprehensive public Wi-Fi service, in 2015. The basic service is free for patients, visitors and staff. There is also a premium service which enables video and audio streaming. It has a contract with DHL Supply Chain for non-emergency patient transport services which cost £12.1 million in 2015–16. Research In partnership with Imperial College London, Imperial College Healthcare is a major centre for medical research. It is also part of one of eleven National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centres. The trust has one of the 11 Genomics Medicines Centres associated with Genomics England which opened across England in 2014. All the data produced in the 100,000 Genomes project will be made available to drugs companies and researchers to help them create precision drugs for future generations. In 2016 it set up a project with DeepMind to develop new clinical mobile apps linked to electronic patient records. In 2018, researchers led by Professor George Hanna at St Mary's Hospital found that a simple breath test has been able to detect pancreatic cancer. Performance The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. At the end of March 2017, the trust was confirmed as one of four additional NHS Global Digital Exemplars; joining the twelve announced in September 2016. The trust shares its GDE status with Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust as a \\"joint Exemplar\\". In 2017/18, the Trust performed 39,000 operations and saw 299,000 emergency attendees. The trust saw almost a one per cent year-on-year rise in attendances and a seven per cent rise in admissions. On average in 2017/18, the trust's emergency department treated and discharged or admitted 87 per cent of patients within four hours, against the national target of 95 per cent.

The plant grows 3 to 6 feet tall from a woody caudex and produces dense racemes of soft lavender-pink flowers. Plants blooms from June through August. They have five to seven lobed, cordate leaves. Seeds have a very hard coat and can remain viable in the soil for more than 50 years, seed germination is often triggered after a wildfire. This species is native to sunny mountain streambanks, meadows, and open forest slopes from east of the Cascade Range, from British Columbia and Alberta to Montana and south to Oregon and Colorado. Iliamna rivularis var. rivularis, which is often called Iliamna remota and has the common name Kankakee globe-mallow, has suffered drastic population declines in the eastern USA; largely from an altered fire regimen caused by long-term fire suppression which has changed the forest canopy structure. Shading limits plant growth and seed germination, additionally the seeds germinate after scarification by fire.

Total premium income for 2018/19 was US$402 million. In addition to Oslo, Skuld has offices in Bergen, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Hong Kong, London, New York, Piraeus and Singapore.  History  Skuld was established in 1897 in Oslo, Norway, as the first P&I; Club outside the United Kingdom. The name has its origins in Norse mythology, according to which Skuld is one of the powerful goddesses known as norns who weave the threads of destiny. The purpose of the association is \\"mutual insurance against liabilities and losses incurred by members in direct connection with the operation of the entered vessels\\".  Present status  As a mutual association, the club has no shareholders and is owned and controlled directly by its insured shipowners, who are known as members of the club and are entitled to vote at the general meeting according to the gross tonnage of the ships entered in the association. The members elect a committee of between 12 and 30 members which meets twice a year, and a board of directors consisting of between five and nine members. The conditions of membership and terms of insurance are contained in the statutes and rules. Skuld underwent a major restructuring in the period 2000 to 2003 which led to a substantial improvement in its financial strength and Standard & Poor's rating of A with a stable outlook. It also led to diversification into other marine insurance, including non-mutual. The annual report for the insurance year ending 20 February 2019 records assets of more than US$1 billion and a contingency reserve of $453 million. At the commencement the 2019/2020 insurance year, the entered tonnage for liability insurance reached 103 million gross tonnes. Some 22% of the tonnage entered continues to be Scandinavian-controlled. Skuld is also a leading provider of charterers' liability insurance. Skuld is one of thirteen members of the International Group of P&I; Clubs that work closely together in reinsurance and industry matters of common interest. The P&I; Clubs in the International Group provide insurance for the liabilities of approximately 90% of the world's merchant fleet. In December 2010, Skuld announced that it had also entered the Lloyd's market. 1 January 2011, Skuld opened as the first P&I; club, a syndicate at Lloyd's, Skuld 1897. 1 January 2017, Skuld acquired Gerling Norway, a global specialist in mainly Hull Insurance – now renamed Skuld Marine Agency or SMA. In July 2019 Skuld closed down its activities at Lloyd's London.  Scope of insurance  The P&I; (\\"Protection and Indemnity\\") insurance provided by Skuld to its members is primarily to cover the liabilities which they incur to third parties arising out of the operation of their ships. The common types of claim which are covered are for death or injury to passengers and crew, oil pollution, cargo loss or damage, collision, wreck removal and stowaways. Shipowners' exposure to these claims has grown in line with increasing regulation of the shipping industry through International Conventions adopted by the International Maritime Organization as well as by domestic or regional legislation. Skuld has been involved in a number of high- profile cases, including the Estonia, Hebei Spirit, Braer, Sea Empress and Scandinavian Star. Skuld also provides shipowners and charterers with additional types of cover. This includes cover for legal assistance and legal costs (\\"defence\\" cover) as well as insurance for operators of units in the offshore and energy sector. In Skuld Marine Agency, Skuld is offering mainly hull and machinery insurance and associated products, with a possibility to write claims lead on selected fleets.

The people of Linha Cristal have the idea of using the money to make a low-budget documentary about the construction of the tank, but the film has to be fictitious. Then, they decide to make a science fiction B movie which tells the story of a monster who lives in the building site of a tank.

This was Lynn Anderson's first Christmas music album. The album was released by Columbia Records, and was very successful. The album reached No. 13 on the Billboard 200 in 1971 (her highest chart position on that chart), but it didn't chart on the Top Country Albums list, since Christmas albums were not counted as \\"country\\" by Billboard during this period. The album, a mix of secular uptempo Christmas classics and new songs from several of the leading Nashville country music songwriters of the day was enormously popular and became a Christmas classic itself among country music and American popular music fans. The album's opening song \\"Ding-A-Ling the Christmas Bell\\" was released as a single and at one point considered as a possible Christmas cartoon special but the project never got off the ground. The album was in print for a decade and, in the 1990s, Sony released limited quantities on CD with new cover art (the image shown above). In 2015 it was reissued on CD by the Real Gone Music label, with alternate charity single mixes of four songs (in mono and with spoken-word intros) included as bonus tracks.

At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, he finished seventh both in the two-man event and in the four-man event. Although on the U.S. Bobsled team in 2002, he was disqualified from competing due to the presence of prohibited substances from food supplements, which he claimed were taken without his knowledge or intent. Jovanovic won a bronze medal in the four-man event at the 2004 FIBT World Championships in Königssee. In 2011, Jovanovic started to compete for Serbia.FIBT Profile He was one of the best pushers in bobsledding, a position requiring extraordinary strength. Career Jovanovic was born and raised in Toms River, New Jersey. At the age of 20, he began to race bobsleds competitively, and proved adept at the art of being the brakeman. A brakeman is a pusher, sitting at the rear of a four-man or two-man sled. \\"The brakeman is crucial in getting the sled started, and stopping the sled after the run. His competitive weight was , and he stood 1.85 meters (6 ft 2 in) tall. His size and performance made him \\"an ideal brakeman\\", something he did not start out to do. \\"I did it because I loved it ... [and] I was naturally good at power lifting and running.\\" Jovanovic talks about pushing off at the top of the course. \\"When it comes to loading into the sled, I think that that is something that only years and years of experience in high competitions, with crowds and years of training properly at high speeds, can really give you crisp, smooth look,\\" he explained. Repeated off season training is the ticket. Where mere thousandths of a second can separate winners, precise teamwork is an absolute necessity. Obtaining \\"the smoothest acceleration\\" is the goal; entry should be automatic, \\"crisp and clean\\". According to Voice of America, Jovanovic was described by U.S. Olympic team officials as \\"one of the most feared brakemen on the Bobsleigh World Cup circuit\\". These officials noted Jovanovic's two first- place finishes in 2004 and \\"strong performances\\" in 2005 as reasons for considering him \\"one of the best\\". Jovanovic was seen as a likely medalist at the 2006 Olympics. His extensive experience and training helped earn him two golds and a silver medal at the 2005 Bobsleigh World Cup. In the two-man with Todd Hays, Jovanovic won a silver and a bronze medal in 2006, but 2006 4-man medal gold was not to be. U.S. sled driver Todd Hays expressed regret that he could not bring home a medal for his teamPavle Jovanovic, Steve Mesler and Brock Kreitzburg. He blamed himself for bad driving. Todd Hays said he had both the right equipment and \\"I have the push. I just didn't drive well again tonight. For some reason, I can't find a rhythm on this track,\\" despite finding the 'rhythm' of all the other tracks in the world. HBO's Bryant Gumbel interviewed Jovanovic extensively about the suspension during Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel season 8. Doping suspension But for testing positive, Jovanovic likely would been the pusher for driver Todd Hays' sleigh—which won the silver medal in four-man in the 2002 Olympics. Instead, he watched the event on television. The American bobsled team had its sights on ending the 46-year \\"American medal drought\\". Jovanovich was integral to the effort. However his nine-month suspension for testing positive for a banned steroid thwarted his aspirations. Jovanovic was set to become a member of the United States bobsleigh in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. However, he failed a drug test on December 29, 2001, for ingesting Nitro Tech, a nutritional supplement he purchased at a General Nutrition Centers store in Salt Lake City eight days earlier that contained norandrostenedione, a derivative of androstenedione, a substance banned by the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency. Supported by his teammates, Jovanovic admitted he took the supplement, but said it had been recommended by a nutritionist, and that he unintentionally ingested the steroid, which was unlisted in the supplement's ingredients. In December 2001, Jovanovic had recommended the products to Curt Clausen, a two-time U.S. Olympic racewalker, who was contending with chronic muscle fatigue from his 100-mile-a-week workouts. Jovanovic recommended a number of carbohydrate and protein supplements, which were claimed to be free of banned substances. However, Clausen discovered (through online research) that they were marketed mainly to bodybuilders, so he passed on them. The next month Jovanovic tested positive for metabolites of the banned steroid nandrolone, 19-norandrosterone and 19-noretiocholanolone. Testing and sport league officials related that there is no other way to preserve sports' integrity. Any lower bar will open the door to many excuses, according to Don Catlin, director of a laboratory at the University of California at Los Angeles that runs many tests for the Olympics and affiliated sports such as cycling and track and field. \\"Everybody has a story,\\" Catlin said. \\"'It came in the food, it came in the drink, a Coke bottle or a Mars bar.' ... There's no way to sort that out. So the court has to say, 'If they're going to test, they have to make everyone responsible. The argument did not matter to the International Olympic Committee, which imposed a two-year ban against Jovanovic. The athletes are held strictly to a standard, irrespective on their knowledge or intent. U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) chief Terry Madden, whose group oversees the domestic testing of Olympic athletes stated: > [Our] message has never wavered. ... You cannot take supplements without > assuming the risks. A number of positive tests have been blamed on > contaminated supplements, and athletes have been warned for years about the > dangers and health risks associated with taking dietary supplements. This is > not an athlete health issue. I believe it is a health issue for the American > public. Jovanovic was put on two-year suspension as a result. Jovanovic maintained it was an accidental ingestion. As a result, in 2002 he watched on a computer screen from thousands of miles away as his teammates broke the 46-year medal drought. Jovanovic said the experience left some bitterness, including \\"I had some disdain for the sport. After I watched the (U.S.) team race in the Olympics, [but] I had to determine if I was going to make it back.\\" After his suspension from bobsledding, Jovanovic worked in Toms River for his father's construction business. He received a bachelor's degree in fluid mechanics from Rutgers University. Without the distraction of training, he was able to spend time with his father. Jovanovic returned to bobsleigh in 2003 and was drug- free . Perspective The suspension of Jovanovic for the use of nutritional supplementswhich he swore he did not know to be steroid adulteratedbecame a cause célèbre. Essentially, he became the poster child for the cause.; ; Team captain Todd Hays was particularly acerbic on the point. In an interview, he pulled items out of a bag and showcased them, referring them as \\"illegal drugs\\" and as would \\"a lawyer setting up Exhibit A for the jury.\\" Noting that the sports supplements and drinks were available for free in the Olympic Village, he questioned their purity. When a reporter asked about the two-year ban Jovanovic was given one day before Opening Ceremonies, he \\"pulled no punches. He 'ripped' supplement makers, the International Olympic Committee, and the United States Anti-Doping Agency.\\" He said that \\"They're very educated about what these companies are putting in these protein drinks and powders. The problem is that the athletes are not educated on this. Apparently, they have tested several hundred supplements and found that 25 percent of them contain banned supplements. The only problem is that they won't release the names of these companies.\\" Hays concluded: \\"As you can see, it's affected me a tad.\\" Being branded a cheater does great harm to athletes. Jovanovic sued the supplement companies. In doing so, he joined a list of athletesat least fivewho sued supplement manufacturers. \\"When athletes flunk strict drug tests, it can cost them plenty—missed competitions, lost salary, endorsement deals.\\" Some harmed athletes have sued for damages, alleging damage to their reputation and lost opportunities. Contaminated and tainted supplements \\"can lead to arrest and criminal prosecution; in others, the bad press alone can have a devastating effect upon consumer confidence and a company’s bottom line—sometimes even before the alleged contamination is confirmed.... If the contamination involves a substance banned in competitive sports, a lawsuit may be filed...\\" The suits allege that the tainted powders, pills and liquids \\"caused them to fail tests designed to spot cheaters.\\" He filed a lawsuit against Century Foods International in Wisconsin over his 2001 failed drug test in October 2005. The manufacturer and other defendants denied liability, and said there was no impurity in their product. This lawsuit was dismissed by agreement on April 12, 2006, in Salt Lake City. Such contamination has been a common problem. Bad labeling, lying, intentional or accidental cross- contamination, and poor manufacture are all potentially implicated. When supplement companies are sued, they typically deny wrongdoing and counter that the players are blame shifting to hide their own guilt. They may even counter sue and allege defamation and trade libel.  Death  On May 9, 2020, the United States bobsled and skeleton team announced that Jovanovic had died by suicide on May 3. Mesler said that Jovanovic was his \\"personal legend\\", and \\"the athlete that set the standard for focus, dedication, meticulousness, and drive\\" in his life and for the team. \\"Pavle was king. He WAS the standard.\\" References =Notes= =Citations= External links * Bobsleigh four-man world championship medalists since 1930 * FIBT profile * FIBT World Championships 2007 four-man results * Mix van curcumin, isoflavonen en androgenen beschermt prostaat (August 14, 2011) Jovanovic in court with supplement over failed 2001 drug test * US Olympic Committee spotlight on Jovanovic's comeback after his doping suspension *Deseret News The 2002 men's bobsleigh team featuring Jovanovic * Category:1977 births Category:2020 deaths Category:American male bobsledders Category:American people of Serbian descent Category:American sportspeople in doping cases Category:Bobsledders at the 2006 Winter Olympics Category:Doping cases in bobsleigh Category:Male suicides Category:Olympic bobsledders of the United States Category:Rutgers University alumni Category:Serbian male bobsledders Category:Sportspeople from Toms River, New Jersey Category:Sportspeople who committed suicide Category:Suicide in 2020 ","title":"Pavle Jovanovic (bobsledder)"},{"id":"13713631","text":"Valley Metal Container (VMC), a joint venture between the Coors Brewing Company and American National Can Company, operates the world's largest single-site facility for aluminum can production.
