Early life Salmon was born in Auckland in 1888, being educated and spending his early life there. Salmon stood around and was strongly built, he was described as cool and unexcitable with nerves of steel and a great sense of humour. In 1911 at the age of 23, Salmon boarded a ship for Africa in search of adventure, disembarking in Mombasa later in the year, he remained there for almost a year conducting a variety of jobs. In 1912 Salmon set out for the remote Uganda Protectorate with the intention of becoming a coffee grower, his initial efforts at growing coffee in the Busoga district were unsuccessful, so he moved to the area of Fort Portal where he enjoyed more success and settled permanently. Great War service In 1914 with the outbreak of World War I, Salmon volunteered for service and was commissioned in December 1914 into the King's African Rifles. Initially serving under Tracy Philipps, Salmon served throughout the East African Campaign, participating in a number of raids into German East Africa. In 1917 Salmon was awarded the Military Cross for his actions, the citation stating: > For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He swam a rapid and > crocodile-infested river by night, two hundred yards from an enemy post, > taking a rope with him with which he afterwards pulled a boat across. He > then armed himself with bombs and proceeded to scout up the enemy's side of > the river. This fearless act enabled us to cross the river, which otherwise > presented many difficulties. By war's end Salmon achieved the rank of Captain, he was not demobilised until 1920, returning to his coffee plantation afterwards. It was during his wartime service that Salmon received the nickname \\"Samaki\\", Swahili for fish, a name that was to stick to him for the remainder of his life. Coffee grower As the owner of a coffee plantation, Salmon was able to obtain a planter's elephant hunting licence, this allowed the license holder to shoot 20 elephant a year to protect their plantations from the depredations of elephant. Salmon gained a reputation as a skilled elephant hunter, always filling his quota quickly and efficiently. Game warden In 1924, in an effort to combat the destruction to cropping and fencing caused by elephant that prevented the development of agriculture, the Ugandan Government created the Uganda Game Department, appointing Captain Charles R.S. Pitman as chief game warden. The entire Protectorate was divided into four large districts and a white hunter with extensive experience, along with a large native staff, was recruited as a game ranger to control the elephant numbers in each district. Salmon was recruited, along with Captain C.K.D. Palmer-Kerrison and veteran ivory hunters and poachers Pete Pearson and F.G. \\"Deaf\\" Banks. At the time there were estimated to be over 16,000 elephant in Uganda, with an annual increase of 12%, and the elephant control section found it necessary to shoot 13,096 head between 1925 and 1935 in order to keep the population within defined parks and areas of unused land. The four white hunters were provided with a salary of ¬£50 a month, and to further improve their lot, in 1925 the Governor of Uganda, Sir William Gowers, made them Colonial Civil Servants by official decree, ensuring a lifetime pension. =Hunting preferences and records= It is estimated that over the course of his life Salmon shot up to 4,000 elephant, more than anyone else in history. Throughout his career Salmon set a number of elephant hunting records that were unparalleled by other hunters, he once shot 40 elephants in a day, 70 elephant in three days and 230 elephant in three weeks and on one occasion 12 elephant with 14 shots in less than two minutes, like W.D.M. \\"Karamojo\\" Bell, Salmon possessed detailed knowledge of elephant anatomy and his hunting technique kept a herd together, instead of scattering at the first shot. Unlike elephant hunters who shot large tuskers for their ivory, in the course of his duties Salmon shot bulls, cows and calves in as humane a way as possible. Salmon used two .416 Rigby bolt-action rifles for the majority of his elephant hunting, although he owned a .470 Nitro Express double rifle which he used occasionally then he had to follow a wounded elephant into thick vegetation, the double rifle allowing for an immediate second shot. Salmon was ably assisted in his duties by his gunbearer Mussa, who was renowned for his ability to rapidly reload for Salmon, allowing him to maintain continuous fire. Mussa achieved a degree of fame, once being the subject of a full page feature in The Field magazine where he was described as \\"The Prince of Gun-bearers\\". Salmon was unique among professional elephant hunters in that he did not consider the African elephant to be intelligent, writing in The Field magazine in 1951: \\"My outstanding impression is of the pathetic stupidity of the overwhelming majority of them. Between the fortieth and fiftieth elephants, the not-so-stupid one would turn up; and then the idea that the whole elephant race was pathetic would be in abeyance for an indefinite period.\\" =Royal guide= Salmon, 1928 In 1924 Salmon, along with Pete Pearson, accompanied a safari for the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother) as hunting guides during their visit to Uganda. In 1928 Salmon, again with Pearson, organised an 8 day hunting safari for the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) during the Uganda leg of his East African royal tour. On the last day of the safari the royal party were following the tracks of a bull elephant near the Murchison Falls when they were charged by another rogue bull, Pearson grabbed the Prince and flung him to safety (into a thorn bush) then he and Salmon fired simultaneously at the elephant, which crashed dead to the ground from the Prince. Salmon again guided the Prince of Wales on a safari during a royal tour of Uganda in 1930 (this time without Pearson who died in 1929). A notable incident during that tour occurred when the prince requested to see Fort Portal in the fabled Mountains of the Moon, Salmon began guiding the royal party from their boat on the Semliki River, not having been in that area for five years and realising the paths had become overgrown, as dusk approached Salmon begrudgingly admitted he was lost. The entire party, including the prince, spent the night huddled in the rain sharing a bottle of whiskey, the prince amused at Salmon's discomfort at getting the heir to British throne lost in the jungle. In 1932 Salmon guided King Albert I of Belgium on a safari and in 1938 Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. =Chief game warden= In 1930 Charles Pitman was seconded to Rhodesia and Salmon was appointed Uganda's chief game warden, continuing in that capacity until ill-health forced him to retire in 1949. In this role, Salmon was actively involved in extending the boundaries of Uganda‚Äôs national parks as well as advocating for the creation of new reserves, Salmon's goal as chief game warden was to allow humans and wildlife to coexist within Uganda. Salmon's reputation as a game warden and elephant hunter was widespread, with articles about him and his exploits appearing in magazines such as The Field and Country Life. Upon his coronation in 1937, King George VI appointed Salmon to the Royal Victorian Order as a Member of the Forth Class. Marriage In 1931 at the age of 43, Salmon met a young South African woman Celia de Groot, who had been travelling alone from Durban to Port Said in her small car, the pair marrying soon afterwards. Celia was a slim woman of medium height who was always impeccably dressed and who was herself a keen hunter and expert shot. Every year Celia hunted three elephant, as were permitted with a sporting license, always with her right handed 7x57 Mauser rifle, despite her being left handed. Celia always shot her elephant in the head, and always hunted with only a native tracker, she shot around 50 elephant over the course of her life. The pair had one child, a daughter Charmain. Later life Upon his retirement from the Uganda Game Department, Salmon and Celia moved to South Africa, purchasing a farm in Natal where Salmon died six years later in 1952.

In their paper, Caballero y Caballero and Bravo-Hollis described Microcotyle tampicensis based on a single mature specimen. Mamaev, in his revision of the family Microcotylidae, transferred the species to the genus Microcotyle as Microcotyle tampicensis and considered Paramicrocotyle a junior subjective synonym of Microcotyle. Currently, Paramicrocotyle tampicensis is a superseded combination.WoRMS (2019). Microcotyle tampicensis (Caballero & Bravo-Hollis, 1972) Mamaev, 1986. Accessed at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=519257 on 2019-01-05 Mendoza-Franco et al., examined five vouchers of Microcotyle tampicensis and noted a striking similarity between this species and Microcotyle archosargi, especially in regard to the morphologically comparable genital atrium. The authors explained this similarity by the differentiation of Microcotyle archosargi based mainly on the organisation and shape of the genital atrium. The authors considered the two species distinct based on the length of the genital atrium. As the examined vouchers were flattened and/or distorted, Mendoza-Franco et al. emphasized the need of examination of specimens of Microcotyle tampicensis from the type-host and type locality to determine a possible synonymy with Microcotyle archosargi. Morphology Microcotyle tampicensis has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with an elongated body, a rounded anterior end and a smooth cuticle, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is asymmetrical and bears numerous clamps, arranged as two rows, one on each side (48 clamps on the left side and 50 on the right). The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two pyriform septate buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, an ovoid muscular pharynx, and a posterior intestine with two branches provided with small lateral diverticula and penetrate the haptor freely to its terminal end. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium, with spines arranged in concentric circles, a dorsal vagina opening in front of the egg at the beginning of the seminal vesicle, a single ovary in form of a question mark, 13 ovoid or slightly spherical testes which are posterior to the ovary. Etymology The specific epithet tampicensis is derived from Tampico, a city and port in Mexico. Hosts and localities The type-host of Microcotyle tampicensis is the Irish mojarra Diapterus auratus The Western Atlantic seabream Archosargus rhomboidalis is also recorded as host of Microcotyle tampicensis The type-host of Microcotyle tampicensis is the Irish mojarra Diapterus olisthostomus (currently Diapterus auratus) (Gerreidae).

Under Shatorov's leadership, the Macedonian regional committee followed Communist International (Comintern) policy and maintained close ties with Georgi Dimitrov.–ß–µ–ø—Ä–µ–≥–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –¢–æ–¥–æ—Ä. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò–∞ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–æ—Ç –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥, –ò–ù–ò, –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ, 2008, p—Ä. 262‚Äì263.

The Macedonian regional committee refused to remain in contact with the CPY, and joined the BCP.

Because of the conflict within the Macedonian CPY regional committee, there was no resistance movement in Vardar Macedonia. The Comintern supported a policy of non-intervention at the beginning of World War II, arguing that the war was an imperialist conflict between national ruling classes. When the Soviet Union was attacked by Nazi Germany, however, the Comintern issued a directive ordering the formation of communist resistance movements in all European fascist-occupied territories and the Macedonian regional committee (RC) began organizing resistance.–ö–æ–∏ –±–µ–∞ –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∑–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –≤–æ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞ –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤, –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ, 1998 The RC (headed by Shatorov) immediately ordered the formation of partisan units ‚Äì the first of which was formed in the Skopje region on 22 August 1941 ‚Äì and attacked Bulgarian guards on 8 September in Bogomila, near Skopje.

Consequently he moved to Sofia, where he began working as one of the Bulgarian resistance movement leaders. Svetozar Vukmanovic welcomes Macedonian and Greek Partisans in 1943 in occupied Greek Macedonia. Under his leadership, the pro- Bulgarian Regional committee was disbanded and pro-Yugoslav Macedonian Communist Party was founded. CPY loyalists were next appointed as leaders of the RC, with Lazar Koli≈°evski secretary;\\"–í—á–µ—Ä–∞ –∏ –¥–µ–Ω–µ—Å: –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞\\" –à–æ–≤–∞–Ω –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏, –ú–∏—à–µ–ª –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏. –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ, 2000. in September 1941, Koli≈°evski was sent to Skopje. The new leadership began forming partisan detachments. Armed insurgents from the Prilep partisan detachment attacked Axis-occupied zones in Prilep, including a Bulgarian police station, on 11 October. This date is considered the symbolic beginning of the Macedonian resistance. In November, Koli≈°evski was arrested and sentenced to death by a Bulgarian military court. He wrote two appeals for clemency (to the Bulgarian tsar and the defence minister), insisting on his Bulgarian origin. Koli≈°evski's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was imprisoned in Pleven, Bulgaria. The Prilep detachment was active until December, when it split into three groups: the first in Skopje, the second in Tikve≈°, and the third in Bitola. Sharlo's leadership was terminated, but elements of his policy were preserved by some of the local communist activists. After the arrest of Lazar Koli≈°evski, the new executive body of the Macedonian RC continued to share Shatorov's pro- Bulgarian ideas and re-established contact with the BCP.Roumen Daskalov, Diana Mishkova eds., Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Two, BRILL, 2013, , p. 534. Bane Andreev of Veles, Macedonia's new party secretary, expressed this ideology. He thought that the Macedonian people believed in Bulgaria's role as liberator, and no Macedonian wanted to fight Bulgarian soldiers; Macedonians should answer the Bulgarian mobilisation call and join the Bulgarian army.Encyclopedia Jugoslavie volume 7, 1955, p. 686. Josip Broz Tito, however, disagreed. Bane Andreev was arrested by Bulgarian police in the spring of 1942,Dimitar Bechev, Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 14. worsening the struggle between pro-Bulgarian and pro-Yugoslav factions; Cvetko Uzunovski created a provisional regional committee which attempted to take over the pro-Bulgarian faction, with little success.Ivo Banac, With Stalin Against Tito: Cominformist Splits in Yugoslav Communism, Cornell University Press, 1988, , pp. 196-197. Although several Macedonian partisan detachments were formed through the end of 1942 which fought Bulgarian, Italian, German and Albanian occupation forces (and despite Sofia's mismanaged administration), most Macedonian communists were not yet lured to Yugoslavia. Between 1941 and 1943, Tito sent five emissaries to Macedonia to persuade his poorly-disciplined comrades; their efforts had limited success, however, and the regional committee was under the de facto control of the BCP.Dimitris Livanios, The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939-1949, OUP Oxford, 2008, , p. 121. At the beginning of 1943, the Montenegrin Svetozar Vukmanoviƒá {\\"Tempo\\") was sent as an assistant to Macedonian partisan headquarters to change that. Tempo tried to organize an energetic resistance and was tasked with setting up a Macedonian communist party within the Yugoslav party. Some of his objectives were to destroy the influence of the BCP in Macedonia and to fight any form of autonomism. Vukmanoviƒá had to Macedonianize the struggle and give it a new ethnic- Macedonian facade. One of his main achievements was that wartime pro- Bulgarianism receded into the background of pro-Yugoslavism. He capitalised on the increasingly-contradictory attitudes of Bulgarian authorities, which adopted a policy of centralisation in 1942 (contradicting their initial agenda of respecting Macedonian autonomy). Yugoslav communists proclaimed as their aim the unification of Macedonia's three regions (Yugoslav, Greek and Bulgarian), attracting Macedonian nationalists. Tempo began to organise armed resistance to Bulgarian rule in earnest. Under Yugoslav pressure, the regional committee was dissolved and replaced by the Communist Party of Macedonia (KPM, part of the Yugoslav Communist Party).Tchavdar Marinov and Alexander Vezenkov, \\"Communism and Nationalism in the Balkans: Marriage of Convenience or Mutual Attraction?\\" in Entangled Histories of the Balkans vol. 2, , Brill Publishers, 2013, pp. 469‚Äì555. Formed on 19 March 1943 in Tetovo, its first central committee was composed primarily of pro-Yugoslav communists. Yugoslav communists recognized a separate Macedonian nationality to stop the fears of the local population that they would continue the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization. They didn't support the view that the Macedonian Slavs are Bulgarians, because that meant in practice, the area should remain part of the Bulgarian state after the war.Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R.

The Medical Association of the District of Columbia, an organization which performed several complementary professional functions involving setting ethical standards and procedures for disciplining members, merged with the Society in 1911. In 1872, Mary Spackman graduated from the medical department at Howard University and applied for a licence to practice medicine but was refused because she was a woman, she then applied again with a fellow graduate Mary Almera Parsons, but both were rejected. In 1875, Mary Almera Parsons appealed to the Federal Government and petitioned congress to amend the charter and allow women to obtain licences to practice medicine, and on the 3rd March 1875 the bill was approved. After the charter amendment, the first woman member of the Society was not admitted for thirteen more years. Dr. Parsons applied for membership annually in the three years following the amendment's passage, and was voted down each time. She became the first woman member of the society in 1888, following her fourth application.

The Lodha Committee report was submitted on 14 July 2015.Lodha Committee Report  History  The establishment of the Lodha Committee was the result of the report submitted by the Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee after an investigation into the 2013 IPL betting scandal. The purpose of the Lodha Committee was to analyse and recommend implementable actions for improving the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), assess the quantum of punishment for Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra in the Indian Premier League (IPL) betting scandal, and analyse the role of Sundar Raman. The report suggested various changes within the BCCI such as the appointment conditions of the CFO and CEO, age of office bearers, advertisements during the IPL matches, and appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) official. The Lodha Committee report was submitted on 14 July 2015. In brief, the Lodha Committee offered the following recommendations: # The retirement age to be fixed at 70 years. Any administrator who (a) has criminal charge/s, (b) is of unsound mind, (c) is insolvent, and (d) holds a position in any other athletic association needs to be removed. The tenure of any officer bearer to be fixed for two consecutive terms. # A \\"one vote per state\\" policy to make BCCI more transparent in its dealings. # BCCI President cannot have a tenure of more than two years. # An independent and sovereign governing body for the IPL. # To ensure that BCCI officials are not involved in any betting, they need to disclose their assets to the governing board. The recommendations of the Lodha Committee shook the BCCI hierarchy and its related associations. The BCCI raised objections to the recommendations and approached the Supreme Court. The final judgment by the Supreme Court was delivered on 18 July 2016, by a two-judge bench consisting of Justice Ibrahim Kalifulla and TS Thakur, the Chief Justice of India. The final judgment upheld the Lodha Committee recommendations, paving the way for a major change within the BCCI.

Irupathiyonnaam Noottaandu was released in India and Gulf Cooperation Council territories on 25 January 2019 by Mulakuppadam Release.  Plot  The story revolves around the life of Appu (Pranav Mohanlal) a boy born and brought up in Goa. The movie starts with the New Year's Eve wherein Macaroni (Abhirav Janan and Appu's friend) and his girlfriend is celebrating . Much to his annoyance there comes the entry of Abusi (Kalabhavan Shajon) and his henchmen who demand the money borrowed by Baba (Manoj K Jayan) as he was the one who assured the guarantee for payment. Macroni flees and is eventually caught by Abusi's men who takes him to their place. After some time Baba appears at their house and he is also caught by them. This leads to the entry of Appu, Baba's only son who is an expert surfer and jet ski rider. Appu assures for the payment and settles a small amont of money and bails out Macroni and Baba. On the eve of Russian new year Appu is confronted by Zaya (Zaya David) as she was creating a scene there since she lost her phone. Appu agrees to drop her to her homestay but is eventually forced to take her to his homestay as she can't remember the location of her homestay since she was drunk. Eventually Appu and Zaya become good friends and they do a variety of activities in goa such as visiting tourist places, jetskiing, and going to casinos. Slowly Appu starts developing feelings for Zaya. He then decides to convey his feelings to her but when he reciprocates his feelings she gets freked out and runs away. When he goes to her the next day he finds out that she has gone away from Goa to her hometown in Kerala. After a few days, Baba approaches him and suggests that he go to Kerala to know whether she had feelings towards him. He then reaches Kerala with Macroni. When he goes to her Palatial house's entrance he finds it locked and finds out that all of them have gone for an engagement ceremony. Feeling sad (as he thinks it was Zaya's engagement) he decides to make it to the church and eventually finds out that it was Zaya's sisters engament but is shocked to know that zaya was a nun. This leads to the formation of various mysteries in his mind (due to her carefree nature back in Goa) and when he confronts Zaya at her convent she reveals that she became a nun because of various consequences as she was sexually exploited by her uncle (on a Christmas Eve when she was young) who worked for the police and this fact was not known to any of her family members as she feared to tell them fearing more harm from her uncle. She becomes a nun because she found out that her uncle didn't show any sort of respect towards any other women but nuns. Appu understands Zaya's plight and assures that he will always be there for her and learns that Zaya loves him and she very much aspires to become a free spirited young girl. On the eve of Zaya's sister's pre-wedding function Appu is employed as a waiter there since the owner of the lodge (Dharmajan Bolgatty) in which he was staying was organising the wedding and he has not paid the rent of the lodge so he decides to take up work as a waiter to clear his dues and in order to meet and converse with Zaya. But as he converses with Zaya he is confronted by her uncle who beats him up and he is thrown out of the function along with the other workers and he is caught by police due to Zaya's uncles initiation. He is freed the next day because of the lodge owner's initiation. He then rushes to the wedding, beats up Zaya's uncle and his men and walks out holding Zaya's hand. They are chased by police and they resort to take up shelter for a day in a priest's (Siddiqe) convent lodging's. Over there they receive the help of Francis (Gokul Suresh) who assures to take them to the railway station without striking their presence in the eyes of police. They are eventually brought to the station and they board the train. However they are shocked to find Zaya's uncle and his men in the train who are in a hunt for them. as they run away from them to a different compartment they are surprised to find Baba who tells Appu that if he wants to live with her, he must stop running away and face them with courage. Taking account of Baba's words Appu decides to fight and this leads to a very serious fight between Appu, Zaya's uncle and his men. However Appu overpowers them but is unfortunately caught by the police in the next station and is taken for questioning. When they go for questioning they come to know that Zaya running away with Appu has resulted in huge media attention as it was a subject of communalism in media's language (as it was framed so). After the initiation of a bishop (played by Innocent who was brought in for compromising the matter) they decide that Appu should go away alone without Zaya. When Appu asks whether she has any last words for him she hugs him tightly. She is then interrupted by her father and this leads to Zaya mustering courage to reveal what she was subjected to when she was young and how she had to live with it. This leads to the sudden understanding of her parents but her uncle who want to defend his stand walks up to Zaya to slap her who is then stopped by her mother and she slaps him. Eventually he is given a legal punishment and Appu happily moves to Goa with Zaya. Appu clears away the dues which he had with Abusi after selling Macroni's land in Kerala and lives happily with Zaya. The film ends on a happy note saying that we must ensure healthy family relationships and must also be warned that women and young girls are subjected to rape within their very own household.

He worked in India from 1902 to 1912 serving as an Imperial Bacteriologist and later collaborated with his wife Edith Berkeley in studies on polychaetes.  Early life  Cyril was born in London, the son of Louis Michael Bergtheil and Alice Maud. While very young, his parents were divorced and his mother married again. It was his step-father Alfred James Puttick who introduced Cyril to science by introducing him to scientific periodicals and visits to the Royal Institution to attend lectures. He studied at St. Paul's school from 1891 to 1895 and moved to Nuremberg, where he learnt German and studied chemistry at the Industrieschule.  Work  = 1987-1903 = Cyril then went to University College London and worked in William Ramsay's laboratory from 1897 to 1899 alongside other researchers like Morris Travers. From 1899 to 1901 he researched agricultural chemistry and bacteriology at the Agricultural College, Wye. While in Ramsay's lab he met Edith Dunington in 1898. In 1902, Bergtheil was appointed bacteriologist in the Agriculture Department of India. He married Edith on February 26, 1902 and they sailed for Bombay the next day. His initial work was to study the manufacture of indigo under chemist Christopher Rawson with the aim to compete with Germany and their synthetic indigo dyes. He worked for eleven years, mostly at the Sirsia indigo research station, Muzzafarpur. The work included attempts to improve the efficiency of extraction of the indigo. They had a daughter Alfreda Alice on March 3, 1903. She was sent to live with her maternal grandmother in England due to her poor health and she later became a zoologist. = 1904-1964 = Bergtheil collaborated with other scientists in India, joining I.H. Burkill along the Hooker trail in the eastern Himalayas during which he became interested in the distribution of earthworms. He collected across altitude gradients and worked on these specimens with Michaelsen, who named a species Megascolides bergtheili after him. The family changed from their German surname around 1916 to Berkeley due to the World War and public suspicion of those with German names or connections. Berkeley began to work on polychaetes in collaboration with his wife. Around 1916-17 he taught bacteriology at the University of British Columbia while his wife taught zoology. They visited the Nanaimo field station in 1917. Berkeley also worked on acetone production from kelp for Hercules Powder Company in San Diego. In 1919 the family moved to live in Nanaimo and Cyril worked as an assistant curator at the station. Together the Berkeleys authored nearly 34 papers between 1932 and 1964.

It has elliptic to wedge-shaped leaves, of between and 1 cm long, green to gray-green, many with several teeth. The flower heads have about fifteen blue-violet ray florets, encircling many yellow disc florets. This species grows in southern Namibia and the west of South Africa.  Description  The gray-green leaves of a form with rough hair.Felicia brevifolia is an evergreen, upright, up to 1 m (5 ft) high shrub, very woody and leafless at the base, covered in a fibrous, gray-brown bark. The older shoots support dense-leaved short shoots, and are topped by young long shoots. The leaves are alternately set, of very different size, between long and wide to long and wide, elliptic to wedge-shaped, without or with (sometimes up to ten) pointed-ovate teeth, with or nearly without a leaf stalk. The surface of the leaves may be carry short bristles, or bristles and glandular hairs, or is felty gray-green. The uppermost leaves are small, lance-shaped and entire. The flower heads are set individually at the top of the long shoots, on up to long stalks. The involucre is up to 1 cm (0.6 in) in diameter and consists of three to four rows of bracts. These bracts overlap, are wide, are covered in glandular and bristly hairs, and have a papery fringe. The outer bracts are about and the inner about long. The fifteen or so female ray florets have blue-violet ligules of about long and wide. They encircle numerous bisexual disc florets, with a yellow corolla of about high, that is sometimes washed red at the five triangular free lobes. In the center of each corolla are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. At the tip of both style branches is a narrowly triangular appendage. Around the base of the corolla are numerous yellowish white, toothed, persistent pappus bristles, which are all of the same length, up to about . Very rarely with a few short (0.2 to 0.3 mm long) basal scales represent short pappus. The dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are elliptic, about long and wide, yellowish brown in colour, with a pale, densely hairy marginal ridge, the surface in the upper half with few silky hairs or hairless, without other adornment.  Taxonomy  As far as known, this species of daisy was first collected by Johann Franz Dr√®ge in 1835 at Zilverfontein in Namaqualand. In 1836, the species was described by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, who named it Agathaea brevifolia, but in the same publication also described Felicia dregei Œ≤ dentata, bases on another specimen collected by Dr√®ge. In 1865, William Henry Harvey regarded De Candole's first name no more than a variety and made the combination Aster scabridus var. brevifolius, and reassigned De Candole's second name to Aster, creating Aster dregei var. dentata. in 1932, German botanist, and explorer in South West Africa, Kurt Dinter described Aster grossedentatus based on a specimen he found in 1929 in Great Namaland in the !Karas Region of Namibia. It was reassigned as Felicia grossedentata by mr. P. Range in 1936. J√ºrke Grau in 1973 considered all these name synonymous and this made it necessary to create the combination Felicia brevifolia. The species is considered part of the section Lignofelicia.  Distribution  Felicia brevifolia can be found in two larger isolated populations, one between to the east of L√ºderitz in Namibia, and in Namaqualand in South Africa. A small population is known from north of Calvinia and possibly from near Ceres.  Conservation  The continued survival of Felicia brevifolia is considered to be of least concern because its population is stable.

The design was originally marketed by Hunter Marine as the Hunter 50 AC (for Aft Cockpit), but the company became Marlow-Hunter in 2012 and the boat was renamed the Marlow- Hunter 50. Production The design was built by Hunter Marine in the United States starting in 2010 and remained in production in 2019. Design The Marlow-Hunter 50 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a B&R; rig masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, an aft cockpit, a walk-through reverse transom with a swimming platform and folding ladder, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by dual wheels and a fixed fin keel or wing keel. The fin keel version it displaces and carries of ballast, while the wing keel version displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and with the optional shoal draft wing keel. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine of . The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . Standard equipment includes a mast furling mainsail, mainsheet traveler on a stainless steel arch. Options include a single self-tacking jib or a self-tacking staysail with overlapping jib in a cutter rig. There are two window arrangements, an earlier one with five individual side ports and a later one with five ports in a sweeping arch. Operational history In a 2011 review, Cruising World writer Herb McCormick noted the large range of options that allow for a high degree of customization of the boat to customer's desires. \\"For instance, there are shoal-draft and deep-draft keel and ballast choices (5 feet 6 inches and 12,544 pounds or 7 feet and 11,216 pounds, respectively); standard or tall rigs (63 feet 4 inches and 68 feet 6 inches, both measured from the waterline); regular or more robust Yanmar diesels (75 horsepower or 110 horsepower), and even two different ways of approaching the headsails and foretriangle configuration (a single self-tacking jib or a self-tacking staysail with an overlapping jib). Regarding the latter, of course, either headsail arrangement is paired with Hunter‚Äôs ‚Äúbackstayless‚Äù B&R; rig, a mainsheet traveler arch, and a battened, full-roach mainsail. For the Hunter Design Team, some things are too iconic to mess with.\\" upon the design's introduction, a brief Sail magazine staff report noted, \\"Below decks excellent use has been made of the hull's considerable volume, with all the deft touches Hunter owners have come to expect.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Related development *Marlow-Hunter 50 Center Cockpit Similar sailboats *C&C; 50 *Hunter HC 50 *Marlow-Hunter 47 References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:2010s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Hunter Marine ","title":"Marlow-Hunter 50"},{"id":"59581684","text":"Polesso, Natalia Borges -FILSA 20171105 fRF Nat√°lia Borges Polesso is a Brazilian writer.

History Methods and procedures in nursing were becoming more knowledge-led. Instead of the former apprenticeship system, whereby nurses were trained at hospitals, the Project 2000 scheme was to contract the training of nurses out to British universities. State Enrolled Nurses (SENs) previously had two years of training. State Registered Nurses (SRNs) were fully qualified nurses before 1990. Implementation Project 2000 was phased in as the primary choice for nurse training from 1990. Prior to then the government was spending around ¬£770m on nurse training. Only around ¬£71m was spent in 1991-92 on its implementation, when 14 Colleges of Nursing were added to the scheme. When the scheme began, universities did not charge any tuition fees and students were paid a nursery to support their living and training costs during the course. The scheme was implemented by the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC), itself created in 1983, which became the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in 2002. State Registered Nurses became Registered General Nurses (RGNs). State Enrolled Nurses were replaced with healthcare assistants, who had no official training and were neither registered.Independent, April 2012 =Training= Project 2000 student nurses studied for 3 years, splitting the time between class based learning, and practical placements. The first 18-month of the course was known as the common foundation programme and provided basic grounding in 4 nursing discipline: Adult, Child, Mental Health and Learning Disability care. This was followed by 18 months dedicated to the nursing discipline of choice. On successful completion of the course students were awarded a Diploma in Nursing relevant to their discipline.

Biography Ivanoviƒá graduated from the Serbian Orthodox Theological Seminary in Sremski Karlovci and for 38 years while in priesthood and teaching, he also translated and wrote biographies, published between 1809 and 1841. His first parish was in ≈†id, and in the Kuve≈ædin Monastery, before he settled in 1812 in Zemun from where he retired in 1834. A novelty in Serbian prose was secular biography at the time, which existed in older Serbian hagiographies, better known as ≈æitije or vita. This trend would continue to develop fully and in direct correlation with classical works. Ivanoviƒá was influenced by Dositej Obradoviƒá who wrote the first individual biographies, a genre that expanded to the form of a biographical collection modeled on popular European literature, the type of compilations that were developed by Cornelius Nepos, Salustius and Plutarch. In 1809, Jevtimije Ivanoviƒá published in Buda his first collection of four books under the long title Novi Plutarh ili kratkoje opisanije slavnjej≈°i ljudi sviju naroda and drevnjej≈°i vremena do danas.

Ivanoviƒá translated this work from German, but he also used the works of the German writer Friedrich Schiller, adding the biographies of the great Serb men. Only five years after Blanchard's original appeared in print in France, the general reader in Ottoman-occupied Serbia and Habsburg Monarchy was to see the first biographies of not only Plutarch but Homer, Voltaire, Socrates, Cicero, Plato, and others.

She was a professor at the University of Wisconsin.  Biography  Kelley was born in Milton, Massachusetts. She became interested in neuroscience during a field trip to Harvard. She completed her undergraduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was captain for both the field hockey and lacrosse teams. She then received a Thouron fellowship which allowed her to pursue a PhD at the University of Cambridge, England, under the supervision of Susan Iversen. She was among the first 13 women to be admitted to Trinity College in 1976. At Cambridge she continued to play lacrosse, and she was a member of the rowing team. She continued her work at the Harvard Medical School with Walle Nauta. Later, she held research and teaching positions at the University of Bordeaux in France, Harvard University and Northeastern University, before settling at the University of Wisconsin, where she was named Wisconsin Distinguished Neuroscience Professor in 2006. At the University of Wisconsin, she was also Director of the Neuroscience Training Program. In 2006, she was honored with Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement Award by the Society for Neuroscience. She died from metastatic colon cancer on August 5, 2007 at her home in Madison, Wisconsin, at the age of 53. Kelley was an accomplished athlete, being a pioneering player for the women's lacrosse team and the field hockey team at the University of Pennsylvania. She started a rowing eight at Cambridge and was stroke for the team. She competed in the May Bumps in a women's four. She was also an avid skier. Kelley was the mother of three children.  Research  Kelley's research focused on the neuroscience of reward and behavior. She was a leading expert in the intracerebral microinfusion technique. During her PhD and the following years she studied the mesocorticostriatal systems and the role of opiods in interactions between the striatum and hypothalamic regulatory circuits in the control of behavior. Following these studies she focused on eating behavior and food intake. She found that eating behavior was mediated by Œº-opioids, but this was mechanism was dependent on the palatability of the food. She later performed studies to determine what part of the striatum was responsible for this mechanism. Together with Min Zhang she performed a microinfusion study that showed that the ventral and lateral areas of the striatum, including both the shell and the core of the nucleus accumbens, were most sensitive to injections of opiods causing behavioural changes. Together with Ned Kalin, Kelley demonstrated the role of the amygdala in the linking of sensory representations and their motivational value. After lesioning the amygdala in rhesus monkeys, they found that the monkeys no longer learn proper fear responses to stimuli, such as a predator. During her time with Walle Nauta, she also performed anterograde and retrograde tracing studies to study the neural projections from the amygdala to the striatum. They showed that these projection were much more extensive than previously thought, and that the amygdala innervates large parts of the caudal striatum. As the amygdala is involved in motivation they speculated that the striatum may in fact also be mediated in a large part by motivation. She furthermore showed that food can act as an addictive substance. She found that the consumption of salty and sweet foods was influenced injection of a Œº-opioid antagonist into the nucleus accumbens in a similar way the intake of alcohol, but not the intake of water, was.  Legacy  Two years after her death, Kelley posthumously received the Patricia Goldman-Rakic Hall of Honor award by the Society for Neuroscience. The University of Wisconsin-Madison established the Ann E. Kelley Fellowship in Behavioral Science in her honour. Kelley's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, established the Ann E.

The design was originally marketed by Hunter Marine as the Hunter 50 CC (for Center Cockpit), but the company became Marlow-Hunter in 2012 and the boat was renamed the Marlow-Hunter 50 Center Cockpit. Production The design was built by Hunter Marine in the United States starting in 2009 and remained in production in 2019. Design The Marlow- Hunter 50 Center Cockpit is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a B&R; rig fractional sloop rig, a raked stem, a center cockpit, a walk-through reverse transom with a swimming platform and folding ladder, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel or wing keel. The fin keel version it displaces and carries of ballast, while the wing keel version displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and with the optional shoal draft wing keel. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine of . The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . Standard equipment includes a mast furling mainsail, mainsheet traveler on a stainless steel arch. Options include a single jib in a bermuda rig or a staysail with overlapping jib in a cutter rig, and a tall mast about higher. The design has a hull speed of . Operational history In a 2009 review, Cruising World editor Mark Pillsbury noted the design's below decks headroom, roomy accommodations and easy engine access but faulted the lack of on-deck handholds. About amenities, he stated, \\"Aboard the 50 CC, however, the real luxury is found aft, where a chaise lounge on the port quarter and a settee to starboard frame an island queen that incorporates a three-panel base that can be folded back to unveil a full-size tub with jets. This was a standard feature on the first few hulls, but it was made an option on later ones at the request of buyers who said they'd take additional storage over bubbles.\\" Of the sailing qualities, he wrote, \\"Sailing upwind in a brisk breeze, we saw boat speeds in the high 6- and low 7-knot range. On a beam reach, we did a little better than 8 knots over the ground, according to my handheld GPS. In the rough seas we encountered, the rack-and-pinion steering felt a little sluggish, but that may have been because it hadn't yet been adjusted.\\" Also in a 2009 review, Sailing magazine writer Bill Springer noted, \\"Hunters have always been known for spacious accommodations, and this boat won our Best Boats award for excellence in accommodation. The slightly raised saloon is bright and airy, thanks to large fixed windows and multiple opening ports and hatches and you get a good view.\\" He concluded, \\"It‚Äôs easy to get distracted by the hot tub and the TV in every cabin and the ‚Äúadmiral‚Äôs seat,‚Äù but in truth there‚Äôs more than that to this boat. It‚Äôs a big sister to the 49, an example of which has just circumnavigated. The sails are easy to handle, and the hull is big and heavy enough to stand up to a breeze. And having a boat that‚Äôs well equipped and offers the comforts of home is not a bad thing at all.\\" In naming the design the 2009 Best Boats - Accommodations, Sailing magazine writer Nigel Calder, stated, \\"the Hunter 50 surely has raised the bar for cruising sailboats much higher than it has ever been before.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Related development *Marlow-Hunter 50 Similar sailboats *C&C; 50 *Hunter HC 50 *Marlow-Hunter 47 References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:2000s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Hunter Marine ","title":"Marlow-Hunter 50 Center Cockpit"},{"id":"59582740","text":"Imran Louza (born 1 May 1999) is a French professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for FC Nantes.

It was a science fiction comic about colonists fleeing Earth in a spaceship called Wildcat just before the planet is destroyed in the year 2500. It featured five stories in each issue: one continuing series for each of the four main characters as they explore an alien planet to see if it is fit for habitation, and a fifth story set on board the ship, which was a single- episode story each week. The four lead characters were Turbo Jones, a millionaire who financed the expedition and the mission commander; Loner, a black mercenary; Kitten Magee, a woman youthful in appearance but with a secretly prolonged life-span; and Joe Alien, an alien with telescopic limbs, and last survivor of his own race. A prelude issue was given away for free with other comics, containing a single story explaining the premise, written by editor Barrie Tomlinson and illustrated by Ian Kennedy. The comic then ran for twelve issues, priced 40p, before being cancelled and merged with Eagle. The series Turbo Jones, Loner, Kitten Magee and Joe Alien continued in the Eagle on rotation until April 1990. There were also a holiday special and a winter special, both in 1989.

Biography Robert Liveing matriculated in 1852 at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating there BA in 1856, MA in 1860, MB in 1861, and MD in 1865. He received his medical education at King's College, London and at Paris, before receiving his MB (Medicinae Baccalaureus) in 1861 from Cambridge. He qualified MRCP in 1866. In 1861‚Äì1862 he held two house appointments (i.e. as assistant physician) at King's College Hospital before joining the staff of Middlesex Hospital, Fitzrovia, London. At Middlesex Hospital he was lecturer on anatomy and physiology from 1862 to 1866, assistant physician from 1866 to 1872, and physician from 1872 to 1876. In 1876 he resigned there as physician (presumably to devote more time to his specialty of dermatology). At Middlesex Hospital he was physician to the skin department from 1879 to 1888, and retired in 1888 to become consulting physician to the skin department. In 1872 Liveing was elected FRCP. In 1873 he delivered the Goulstonian Lectures on Elephantiasis Gr√¶corum, or, True Leprosy. His Handbook on skin diseases was a standard text of dermatology in the 1880s and 1890s. According to the dermatologist Henry Renwick Vickers (1911‚Äì1993), the first four appointments of dermatologists to teaching hospitals in the UK were: Sir William Jenner in 1859, Tilbury Fox in 1860, Robert Liveing in 1879, and Sir Malcolm Morris in 1882. Liveing was a member of the Athenaeum Club and vice-president of the Alpine Club in 1869 and 1870. Family Robert Liveing had seven sisters and three brothers, two of whom were Edward Liveing (1832‚Äì1919) and George Downing Liveing (1827‚Äì1924). On 15 August 1866 in Blendworth, Hampshire, Robert Liveing married Adelaide Mary Dorothea Hawker (1832‚Äì1906), a daughter of Admiral Edward Hawker and his first wife Joanna Naomi, n√©e Poore.

He took over as the commander of the ADF following the 2015 arrest of its former leader, Jamil Mukulu, in Tanzania. Baluku is under sanction by the United Nations and the United States for terrorist activities, and is wanted for war crimes by both Interpol and the International Criminal Court. Biography Very little is known about Baluku's early life; however is known that he was born in the Kasese District of Uganda. Unlike most ADF commanders, who hail from the Musoga tribe, Baluku is part of the Mukonjo tribe. Baluku became a Salafi jihadist at an early age, and formerly served as an Imam at the Malakaz mosque in Kampala, Uganda. Baluku was one of the earliest members of the Allied Democratic Forces, and served as one of Jamil Mukulu's chief lieutenants. After the ADF relocated to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mukulu appointed Baluku to numerous positions within the ADF, and he served as the group's chief Islamic judge and handed down punishments to those who violated the group's interpretation of Sharia law. Baluku also served as the ADF's \\"political commissar\\", and was in charge of teaching the ADF's ideology to new recruits. When Jamil Mukulu was arrested in Tanzania in 2015, Musa Baluku took his place as commander of the ADF and appointed himself \\"Sheikh\\". Unlike his predecessor, Baluku has expanded his outreach into social media in order to recruit more followers, and has publicly aligned the ADF with better-known jihadist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and Al-Shabaab. Baluku is a polygamist, and has taken several wives from both the Congo and Uganda, two of them daughters of Jamil Mukulu. He resided in the ADF's main camp, nicknamed \\"Camp Medina\\", until the camp was overrun by the Congolese army in January 2020. As of February, 2020, he is believed to have relocated to \\"Camp Kajuju\\" in \\"Madina II\\", another ADF camp complex.https://chimpreports.com/un-sanctions-adf-commander-baluku/ ADF defectors and ex-combatants have described Baluku as notoriously violent and short-tempered. Baluku has ordered the abduction of children to serve as child soldiers and has presided over mass killings of civilians by firing squad. Baluku has also been known to consolidate his power within the ADF through brutal intimidation tactics, and has executed suspected dissidents by beheading or crucifixion. Baluku is believed to have been wounded during a Ugandan military attack on an ADF camp on December 22, 2017. In December, 2019, the United States government imposed sanctions on Baluku and five other ADF leaders.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-security/u-s-imposes- sanctions-on-islamist-rebels-in-eastern-congo-idUSKBN1YE2IO References Category:Living people Category:Fugitives wanted by the International Criminal Court Category:People indicted for war crimes Category:People indicted for crimes against humanity Category:People sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act Category:Allied Democratic Forces Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Kasese District Category:Ugandan Islamic religious leaders Category:Salafi jihadists ","title":"Musa Baluku"},{"id":"59582889","text":"The list of shipwrecks in October 1821 includes ships sunk, wrecked, or otherwise lost during October 1821. 1 October 2 October 3 October 4 October 5 October 6 October 7 October 10 October 11 October 12 October 13 October 14 October 15 October 16 October 18 October 19 October 20 October 21 October 22 October 23 October 24 October 25 October 26 October 27 October 28 October 29 October 30 October 31 October Unknown date References 1821-10 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in October 1821"},{"id":"59582899","text":"This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in 2019.

He became a very successful London merchant and financier and made a fortune through directorships and other means. Betts was invited by local Whigs to stand for parliament at Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, but it was a frustrating journey for him. At the 1710 general election he was returned as Member of Parliament after a contest, but his election was declared void on 17 March 1711 after allegations of bribery. This resulted in a by-election on 18 April 1711, in which he topped the poll, but was unseated on petition on 22 May 1711. Also in May, he was elected as a Director of the East India Company, and by this time held some ¬£4,000 worth of Bank of England stock. At the 1713 general election he was elected MP for Weymouth for the third time, but after voting against the expulsion of Richard Steele on 18 March 1714, was unseated on petition on 3 June 1714. Betts was returned for Weymouth at the 1715 general election and this time kept the seat for a whole parliament, sitting on the Dodington interest. He voted against the Administration on the septennial bill but with them on the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts, and he voted against the Peerage Bill. He was returned unopposed at the 1722 general election. In 1727 Betts was again returned after a contest. He did not vote on the civil list arrears in 1729. In 1730 the House considered a petition from Knox Ward claiming that Betts's election should be declared void on technical grounds. Betts was by this time infirm and unable to attend the House and declared the electors should be given an opportunity to make another choice. He did not stand at the by-election. Betts died unmarried 14 March 1738, leaving ¬£5,000 to George Bubb Dodington and ¬£2,000 to Thomas Wyndham, both nephews of George Dodington, and ¬£1,000 to John Tucker.

They belong to a familiar type of literature, a genre used when addressing the general public in mosques in the early Islamic era (1st and 2nd /7th and 8th) centuries. Most of the siyar convey the viewpoint of the school and consist of homilies, epistles, addressed to the fellowship of the believers. These epistles are read out aloud by the preacher, setting out what ought or ought not to be believed, as well as those deeds that ought or ought not to be done. The exhortations at the beginning of the siyar are relatively long and reflect the social context of their time.P. Crone and F. Zimmermann, The Epistle of Salim b. Dhakwan, p.23, Oxford University Press, 2001. The siyar that have so far been reviewed and edited are from what is referred to as the ‚ÄúBasra period‚Äù; most of them were written in Iraq, while some of the others were produced during the ‚Äúregional period‚Äù ‚Äì i.e. ‚Äúabroad‚Äù.Michael Cock, Early Muslim Dogma, p. Cambridge University Press, 1981. Omani siyar The actual texts of the siyar are generally to be found in Omani manuscripts, though there are also some in North Africa, while some have been recopied in East Africa (Zanzibar), either in their entirety or as excerpts. Many of these texts appear in fiqh (jurisprudence) encyclopaedias such as Bayan al Shar‚Äò by Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Kindi (d. 508/1115) and the al-Musannaf by Abu Bakr al Kindi (d. 557/1126). Later, they appeared in volumes with titles like ‚ÄúAl Siyar al ‚ÄòUmaniyyah‚Äù (‚ÄúOmani Siyar‚Äù) or ‚ÄúAl Ibadiyyah‚Äù (‚ÄúIbadism‚Äù).Danylo Radivilov, Rereading Omani Siyar: KhƒÅlid b. Qa·∏•·π≠ƒÅn, Œôn Ibadi Theology, Ersilia Francesca (ed.), 83-92, who works on the Siyar al-‚ÄòumƒÅniyya (n. d.)TijƒÅrat al-‚ÄòulamƒÅ‚Äô wa‚Äôl-siyar al-‚ÄòumƒÅniyya. Manuscript 1082 II of the Scientific Library of Ivan Franko Lviv National University. All the siyar works that have been obtained in manuscript form, were written in Oman during the Ya‚Äòrubi era (1624-1741). They were then copied and reissued in other collections, with each copier choosing those bits that he considered appropriate for his own book or collection. This continued to be the case until relatively recently.Abdulrahman al-Salimi, ‚ÄúIdentifying the (ibad√Ø/omani) Siyar‚Äù, Journal of Semitic Studies LV/1 Spring, 2010. That is why there are discrepancies between the numbers and types of different siyar, as well as in the order in which they are arranged and classified. Scholarly works and Ibadi siyar Scholars began to take a particular interest in these siyar from the beginning of 1980. There were two main reasons for this: first, they were a reliable source of information about events during the early Islamic period. Second, they contained information from an Ibadi angle about the politics and beliefs during Islam‚Äôs ‚Äúformative period‚Äù. Their distinctive rhetorical style meant that they were different from other Arabic literature of the time and made them attractive as sources of information and historical content throughout the ensuing ages. Michael Cook has edited and published a number of old Ibadi texts under the title Early Muslim Dogma. Other works on the subject include The Epistle of Salim Ibn Dhakwan by Patricia Crone and Fritz Zimmermann (2001), and fourteen texts recently edited by Wilfred Madelung and Abdulrahman al-Salimi.W. Madelung and A. Al-Salimi, Ibadi Texts from the 2nd/8th Century, Brill, Leiden, 2017: ‚ÄúThe texts edited are mostly polemical letters to opponents or exhortatory to followers by ‚ÄòAbd Allah b.

Hymenachne is from the Greek hymen meaning \\"membrane\\" and achne meaning \\"chaff, glume, scale\\" and amplexicaulis is from Latin, literally \\"embracing the stem\\" or \\"stem-clasping. This freshwater species is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the West Indies, Northern South America, and Central America.  Biology  Hymenachne is a perennial grass that primarily reproduces via stolons.Csurhes, S.M., Mackay, A.P. and Fitzsimmons, L. (1999). Hymenachne (Hymenachne amplexicaulis) in Queensland (Department of Natural Resources, Brisbane, Australia). This robust species is commonly found growing 1-2.5m tall. The stems are hairless and float prostrate across the top of the water, then grow upright from these bases to support leaves. The flat, triangular leaves (10‚Äì45 cm long, up to 3 cm wide) have a prominent clasping bases, or auricles. The auricles help to distinguish it from other invasive wetland grasses and the native H. acutigluma in Australia. Hymenachne has been shown to increase the stem length between nodes to keep leaves above water during periods of flooding. Its stem is packed with airy tissue called aerenchyma to help the stems float and to aid in flood tolerability. Hymenachne flowers in the early fall and seeds in late fall.Diaz, R., Overholt, W.A., Cuda, J.P., Pratt, P.D. and Fox, A. (2009).

Habitat  Hymenachne prefers constantly inundated soil and is known to survive comfortably in about a meter of water for 20 years. This species was shown to survive poorly in Australia where flooding exceeded 1.2 m.Gonzalez- Jimenez, E. and Escobar, A. (1977). Flood adaptation and productivity of savanna grasses.

Ponded pastures in North Queensland, eds P. Anning and J. Kernot. North Queensland Beef Production Series. Department of Primary Industries, Queensland Government. In its native range in Venezuela, and in invaded areas of Florida, hymenachne was documented to survive in >1.2m of water for nearly a year.Tejos, M.R. (1980).

(1998). Limpgrass and hymenachne grown on flatwoods range pond margins. Journal of Range Management 51, 282-7. Hymenachne has also been found in water greater than 4m deep persisting in floating mats, likely dislodged after a storm event. Conversely, hymenachne is not recorded to survive sites that entirely desiccate.Medina, E. and Motta, N. (1990). Metabolism and distribution of grasses in tropical flooded savannas in Venezuela. Journal of Tropical Ecology 6, 77-89. Hymenachne is known to colonize and form dense monocultures in floodplains, roadside ditches, and lake margins in invaded and native areas.Costa, M. (2005).

It is often found colonizing areas with little shading and competition from other species. Although limited information is available on soil preferences of hymenachne, it has been found in deep, poorly drained muck soils in Florida.Hill, K.U. (1996). Hymenachne amplexicaulis:A review of the literature andsummary of the work in Florida. URL: http://www.naples.net/~kuh/hymen.htm (accessed 17 Feb 2019).

Rapid ecological assessment of aguacalient wildlife sanctuary. Aguacaliente REA. Data stored in BERDS: URL: http://www.biodiversity.bz (accessed 17 Feb 2019).  Invasion  There have been three introductions of hymenachne into Australia, one in Florida, and one in Louisiana.Urbatsch LE; Saichuk JK, 2014. Hymenachne amplexicaulis new for Louisiana. Phytoneuron, 50:1-4. Australia now lists hymenachne as one of the top twenty worst weeds. Hymenachne invasions have been shown to decrease species richness, increase invasive fish populations, and overall cause fundamental changes in floral and faunal composition in Australia. Hymenachne was introduced in Australia as forage for cattle, and likely for the same reason in Florida. The species was used in ponded pastures, or artificial ponds created to hold water for use in the dry season. High reproducibility from stem fragments aids in the dispersal and invasion of this species.Sellers, B.A., Diaz, R., Overholt, W.A., Langeland, K.A. and Gray, C.J. (2008). Control of West Indian marsh grass with glyphosate and imazapyr. Journal of Aquatic Plant Management 46, 189-92. The first herbarium record of hymenachne in Florida is from 1957. The second specimen is not recorded until 1977. The cause for this gap is unknown; however, today it is recorded in 28 counties across the state.

It is managed by the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. The hospital is a Grade II listed building. History The hospital has its origins in a convalescent home for sick and needy children established on East Parade in 1872. It moved to the Baths building in 1873 and was renamed the Royal Alexandra Hospital in 1882. Piecemeal expansions occurred until the site for the present building was purchased. The present building was designed by Alfred Waterhouse, perhaps with later input from his son, Paul, as a children's hospital and convalescent home. The hospital design, which was based on a pavilion incorporating open balconies and verandahs, responded to the importance then attached to fresh air as a treatment. Funding came from voluntary subscription, the town council and the Duke of Westminster. Construction started in 1899 and it was officially opened through a ceremony, first by Winifred, Countess of Dundonald in 1900Liverpool Mercury, etc. (Liverpool, Merseyside, England) - 13 September 1900, Thursday, Page 8 and later by Prince George and Princess Mary in 1902. An additional east wing was added to the original central and west wings between 1908 and 1910. After acute services transferred to Glan Clwyd Hospital, the Royal Alexandra Hospital became a specialist geriatric facility in 1980. Inpatient services were discontinued in 2009.

It belongs to the family Microcotylidae and was first described by Goto in 1899.Goto, S. (1899). Notes on some exotic species of ectoparasitic trematodes (Vol. 12). Imperial University of Tokyo. PDF Systematics Microcotyle stenotomi was first described by Goto in 1899. The drawings given in the original account lacks detail and clarity. Microcotyle stenotomi was subsequently redescribed by Linton in 1940 Linton, Edwin. 1940. \\"Trematodes from fishes mainly from the Woods Hole region, Massachusetts.\\" Proceedings of the United States National Museum. 88 (3078):1‚Äì172 who added only few measurements without improving the original drawings of Goto. McMahon noted the lack of some quantitative features in the original account and the necessity of a redescription of the species. Morphology Microcotyle stenotomi has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a symmetrical narrow body, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is symmetrical, occupies about one-third of body length and bears 46 pairs of minute clamps, arranged as two rows, one on each side. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two small buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a muscular pharynx, a short oesophagus and a posterior intestine with two lateral branches provided with numerous secondary branches on the outer side and very short diverticula on the inner side. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior spacious genital atrium opening at level of oesophagus, armed with numerous very small and slightly recurved spines, a medio-dorsal vagina opening midway between the anterior end of the body and the level of the ovary, a single incompletely S-shaped ovary consisting of an convoluted tube, a uterus opening through the genital pore, vitellarium giving off ducts which unite in a Y-shaped reservoir in the midline behind the ovary, an oviduct at the tip of the Y-shaped vitelline reservoir and a number of testes which are posterior to the ovary and present in a great group in the midpart of the body. Etymology The specific name stenotomi refers to the generic name of the host species Stenotomus chrysops. Hosts, localities, and distribution on the host The type-host of Microcotyle stenotomi is the Scup Stenotomus chrysops The Scup Stenotomus chrysops (Sparidae) is the type and only recorded host of Microcotyle stenotomi. The species has been first described from fish caught off Japan. It has also been reported from New York and from off Cape Hatteras. Suydam investigated its micro-ecology and its distribution on the gills of the host.Suydam, E. L. (1971). The micro-ecology of three species of monogenetic trematodes of fishes from the Beaufort-Cape Hatteras area. Proceedings of the Helminthological Society of Washington, 38(2), 240-246. http://bionames.org/bionames-archive/issn/0018-0130/38/240.pdf Fertilization and elaboration of eggs In 1913, Maccallum described the process of fertilization and egg-laying of this species: \\"After a certain amount of friction together, one adult attached by its anterior end (where the genital atrium is located) to the corresponding portion of the other (in the position of the vaginal opening is situated). As the cirrus and surrounding genital opening are provided with circles of spines, the animals can preserve their position during fertilization. The spermatozoa pass through the Y-shaped reservoir of the vitellaria and are stored in the seminal reservoir, to be ejected when required. When the mature large eggs leave the ovary to join the uterus, the seminal reservoir contracts in order to inject an opaline fluid into the oviduct toward the oncoming egg. The egg advances to come in contact with the seminal fluid. Then it passes along the common duct that receives a granular yellowish fluid that ends up surrounding the egg. The egg then passes into the ootype. By a vermicular moulding process, the yolk is arranged around the egg which begins take its form. Once properly shaped, the egg passes along to the muscular portion of the uterine canal that the openings of the shell gland. This glands produce a fluid over the surface of the egg and forms the shell giving a completed egg with the exception of the filaments. The latest are formed by the contractions of the uterus on the soft material. The completed egg passes to the distal part of the uterus and remains in it until it is deposited\\".

Following Boubli, Mittermeier and Rylands recognized the Trinidad white-fronted capuchin to be synonymous with the brown weeper capuchin, but other authors such as the IUCN regard that as a separate species C. trinitatis. Description The brown weeper capuchin has brown, thick fur with a dark wedge on the forehead and lighter face, cheeks and chin. Its head and body are about with a tail. Distribution and habitat It lives in various types of forest in the Cordillera de la Costa in northern Venezuela, in dry semi-deciduous forests and gallery forests in the Western Venezuelan Llanos, as well as in Trinidad (under the assumption that the Trinidad white- fronted capuchin is synonymous). Tool use Trinidad white-fronted capuchins have been observed using leaves as cups to drink water from tree cavities. The leaves used were modified before by changing the shape of the leaf. The leaves are discarded after one use, meaning that a different leaf is used for repeat visits. These observations suggest that, like the common chimpanzee, wild capuchins demonstrate tool manufacture and use in foraging-related contexts.

The full title of the play is Up Your Ass, or, From the Cradle to the Boat, or, The Big Suck, or, Up from the Slime. According to writer James Martin Harding, the play is \\"based on a plot about a woman who 'is a man-hating hustler and panhandler' and who ... ends up killing a man.\\" Plot Bongi Perez, a hustler, panhandler and lesbian prostitute, encounters various characters on the street as she goes about her day. Rediscovery Up Your Ass was rediscovered in 1999 and produced in 2000 by George Coates Performance Works in San Francisco. The copy Warhol had lost was found in a trunk of lighting equipment owned by Billy Name. Coates learned about the rediscovered manuscript while at an exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum marking the 30th anniversary of the shooting. Coates turned the piece into a musical with an all-female cast. Coates consulted with Solanas's sister, Judith, while writing the piece, and sought to create a \\"very funny satirist\\" out of Solanas, not just showing her as Warhol's attempted assassin. Up Your Ass remained unpublished until published as an ebook in 2014. Reception The play was first performed in 2000 at the George Coates Performance Works theater in San Francisco. Coates turned the piece into a musical with an all- female cast. Coates consulted with Solanas's sister, Judith, while writing the piece, and sought to create a \\"very funny satirist\\" out of Solanas. This version of the play was called \\"fundamentally flawed but farcical fun\\". Writer James Harding describes Up Your Ass as more a \\"provocation than ... a work of dramatic literature\\" and \\"rather adolescent and contrived.\\" Relation to Solanas's attempted murders In 1967, Solanas encountered Warhol outside his studio, The Factory, and asked him to produce this play. He accepted the script for review, told Solanas it was \\"well typed\\", and promised to read it. According to Factory lore, Warhol, whose films were often shut down by the police for obscenity, thought the script was so pornographic that it must have been a police trap.Barron, James (June 23, 2009). A Manuscript, a Confrontation, a Shooting, New York Times, retrieved on 2009-07-06. Solanas contacted Warhol about the script, and was told that he had lost it. He also jokingly offered her a job at the Factory as a typist. Insulted, Solanas demanded money for the lost manuscript. Instead, Warhol paid her $25 to appear in his film I, a Man. Actress Sylvia Miles said that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg on June 3, 1968, asking to leave her play (a partial copy of an earlier draft of Up Your Ass) for him.Fahs, Breanne (2014). Valerie Solanas: The Defiant Life of the Woman Who Wrote SCUM (and Shot Andy Warhol). New York: The Feminist Press. Footnote 198. . Miles said that Solanas \\"had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind.\\"Fahs, Breanne (2014). Valerie Solanas: The Defiant Life of the Woman Who Wrote SCUM (and Shot Andy Warhol). p.133. New York: The Feminist Press. . Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then \\"shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn't know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble.\\"Fahs, Breanne (2014). Valerie Solanas: The Defiant Life of the Woman Who Wrote SCUM (and Shot Andy Warhol). p.133. New York: The Feminist Press. . Breanne Fahs records that Solanas then traveled to producer Margo Feiden's (then Margo Eden) residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as Solanas believed that Feiden would be willing to produce her play. As related to Fahs, Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours, trying to convince her to produce the play and discussing her vision for a world without men. Throughout this time, Feiden repeatedly refused to produce Solanas's play. According to Feiden, Solanas then pulled out her gun, and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play, Solanas responded, \\"Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it.\\" As she was leaving Feiden's residence, Solanas handed Feiden a copy of her play.Fahs, Breanne (2014).

Later that day while Warhol was on the phone, Solanas fired at him three times. Her first two shots missed, but the third went through both lungs, his spleen, stomach, liver, and esophagus. She then shot art critic Mario Amaya in the hip. She tried to shoot Fred Hughes, Warhol's manager, in the head, but her gun jammed.Harding, James Martin (2010).

Built for $36 million under contract to the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the bridge opened for traffic in the fall of 2010. A high rise design similar to the Barbee Bridge which crosses the ICW at the east end of the island, the Swain's Cut Bridge is built over a narrow part of the channel and required only three main spans while the Barbee Bridge needed 37. History Looking south towards Oak island NC 906 & Swain‚Äôs Cut Upon completion of the ICW in the late 1930s, a swingbridge initially provided access from the mainland to Oak Island. Destroyed by a barge strike in 1971, the Barbee Bridge opened in 1975 as its replacement. As Oak Island‚Äôs population grew however, the large volume of summer vacation traffic and hurricane evacuation concerns prompted the state to approve building a second bridge on the west end of the island over Swain‚Äôs Cut. The bridge is named for the Swain family, which owned the land around the bridge during the dredging of the ICW in the 1930s. At the same time the bridge was being built, a three mile long extension of NC906 was constructed to connect it to NC 211. Design and Construction The , deck structure, consists of prestressed concrete girders which carry four traffic lanes across the ICW at 65‚Äô above Mean High Water. The bridge has for the most part been accident free with the notable exception of a construction related incident in December 2008 when a concrete girder placed on a pier dislodged before it was property secured, fell to the ground and killed one worker. The National Bridge Inventory for 2017 listed the bridge condition as good.

He was introduced to music by his family and credits his style, influences and musical development to his family: ‚ÄúMy story with music began with my family. My mother taught me how to sing, my father taught us to listen to music in all its forms and my brother taught me to evolve with music. So any style or influence I have is constituted by parts of what I learned from my family.

He started performing live during his school days and later began publishing his work through Facebook.  Career  Vaidya's first major release was \\"Aaja Matra\\" (2014). His next single, \\"Hawaijahaj\\" (2016) was a breakthrough. The music video for the song was produced by Fuzz Factory Productions.

The screenplay features a straight couple and a gay couple, and the video depicts a gay couple kissing, which is uncommon in Nepali media. Vaidya is one of the very few Nepali artists to represent the LGBTQ community through the video's release. \\"When I wrote Hataarindai, Bataasindai, it was independent of the video concept. We decided that the under representation of the LGBTQ community in Nepal was an important issue that needed to be addressed and that is how the video came about.\\" The 2019 single has been adopted by the LGBTIQ community of Nepal as an anthem, featuring the song during the first pride parade of Nepal that took place in July 2019.  Katha  Katha is a video series started by Vaidya in 2018. The series debuted in the artist's YouTube channel. The video series features a live, acoustic rendition of a song published by the artist or other artists, and also includes a section discussing the origin and the composition process of the song. = Episodes = * I: Nothing In My Head Besides Timi * II: Mellow * III: Marijau (featuring Bikki Gurung) * IV: Purva Jaaney Panchi (featuring Joyous Gurung)  Discography  = Singles = *\\"Aaja Matra\\" (2014) *\\"Hawaijahaj\\" (2016) *\\"Mayaloo\\" (2017) *\\"Chitthi Bhitra\\" (2018) *\\"Anountho Mutu\\" (2014, re-release: 2018) *\\"Mooskaan\\" (2014, re-release: 2018) *Nothing In My Head Besides Timi (2018) *\\"Hataarindai, Bataasindai\\" (2019) * \\"Pahaar\\" (2019) *\\"Kurakaani\\" (2019) *\\"Somebody Else\\" (2020) *\\"Sukumbaasi\\" (2020) *\\"BLYHL\\" (2020) *\\"Phutki Jaaney Jovan\\" (2020)  Recognition  * Best New Artist (2018) *Artiste of the Month (March 2019)  References   External links  * *Songs of Sajjan Raj Vaidya Category:Nepalese male singers Category:Living people Category:Indie pop musicians Category:People from Kathmandu Category:People from Kathmandu District Category:Nepalese musicians Category:Nepali-language singers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Sajjan Raj Vaidya"},{"id":"59583401","text":"The list of shipwrecks in December 1821 includes ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during December 1821. 1 December 2 December 3 December 4 December 5 December 6 December 7 December 8 December 9 December 10 December 11 December 12 December 13 December 14 December 15 December 16 December 17 December 18 December 19 December 20 December 21 December 22 December 23 December 24 December 25 December 26 December 27 December 28 December 29 December 30 December 31 December Unknown date References 1821-12 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in December 1821"},{"id":"59583410","text":"Hellvi is a populated area, a socken (not to be confused with parish), on the Swedish island of Gotland.The exact extent of the socken, now district, can be obtained by clicking on Kartinst√§llningar and check the Socken box in the menu of this map from the Swedish National Heritage Board database. It comprises the same area as the administrative Hellvi District, established on 1January 2016. A Roman bronze mask from the 1st century has been found in Hellvi.  Geography  Hellvi is situated in the east coast of northern of Gotland. The socken has a long coastline with several bays and islands. It comprises most of Lake Fardume (Fardume Tr√§sk) along with Storholmen island in the middle of the lake. The St Olofsholm peninsula makes up the south tip of Hellvi. Just west of the peninsula are Ytterholmen and Hojsk√§r islands. Hellvi has seven nature reserves: L√∂rgeudd, Malms-Kyllaj, St Olofsholm, Sajgs, Ytterholmen, Storholmen and Tr√§skvidar. There are stack areas in St Olofsholm and Kyllaj. The medieval Hellvi Church is situated in the socken. On St Olofsholm peninsula is the ruin of the medieval Saint Olaf Chapel. , Hellvi Church belongs to Forsa parish in Norra Gotlands pastorat, along with the churches in L√§rbro, Hangvar, Hall and Hallshuk.  History  = Bronze mask = In the 1980s, a ceremonial bronze mask made for the Roman cavalry, was found in Hellvi with the use of a metal detector. It was kept in the finder's home until that person died, a friend inherited the mask and turned it over to the Gotland County Administrative Board in the winter of 2010. It was made in the 1st century, depicting Alexander the Great and it probably came to Gotland around 300‚Äì400. On the forehead of the mask is an image of Hercules with his club and the Nemean lion's skin. When found, the mask was missing one eye, the remaining eye was made of silver and probably added later. The following summer, 2011, an archaeological excavation was made at the site where the mask was originally found. The site was an old stone foundation of a house, abandoned sometime during the 7th century. The second eye along with some other objects, such as drinking horns were discovered during the excavation. The mask was not buried but probably kept in the house along with the drinking horns. A posthole where the mask was found and some rivet holes on the mask suggests that it may have been mounted on a pole.

The drawings were created over a period of seven years as works > of meditation. We may see \\"objects of worship\\" lined up on the altar's > shelves, including a \\"peace pipe\\"; the work represents a hierarchy of > religious conviction which was developed during a period studying Krishna > consciousness, Tibetan Buddhism, and the esoteric and mystical doctrines of > Catholicism.

Reception  John Lithgow won multiple awards for his performance as Winston Churchill. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported 89% approval for the first season based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 8.77/10. Its critical consensus reads, \\"Powerful performances and lavish cinematography make The Crown a top-notch production worthy of its grand subject.\\" On Metacritic, the series holds a score of 81 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". The Guardians TV critic Lucy Mangan praised the series and wrote that \\"Netflix can rest assured that its ¬£100m gamble has paid off. This first series, about good old British phlegm from first to last, is the service's crowning achievement so far.\\" Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Ben Lawrence said, \\"The Crown is a PR triumph for the Windsors, a compassionate piece of work that humanises them in a way that has never been seen before. It is a portrait of an extraordinary family, an intelligent comment on the effects of the constitution on their personal lives and a fascinating account of postwar Britain all rolled into one.\\" Writing for The Boston Globe, Matthew Gilbert also praised the series saying it \\"is thoroughly engaging, gorgeously shot, beautifully acted, rich in the historical events of postwar England, and designed with a sharp eye to psychological nuance\\". Vicki Hyman of The Star- Ledger described it as \\"sumptuous, stately but never dull\\". The A.V. Clubs Gwen Ihnat said it adds \\"a cinematic quality to a complex and intricate time for an intimate family. The performers and creators are seemingly up for the task\\". The Wall Street Journal critic Dorothy Rabinowitz said, \\"We're clearly meant to see the duke [of Windsor] as a wastrel with heart. It doesn't quite come off‚ÄîMr. Jennings is far too convincing as an empty-hearted scoundrel‚Äîbut it's a minor flaw in this superbly sustained work.\\" Robert Lloyd writing for the Los Angeles Times said, \\"As television it's excellent‚Äîbeautifully mounted, movingly played and only mildly melodramatic.\\" Hank Stuever of The Washington Post also reviewed the series positively: \\"Pieces of The Crown are more brilliant on their own than they are as a series, taken in as shorter, intently focused films\\". Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said, \\"This is a thoughtful series that lingers over death rather than using it for shock value; one that finds its story lines in small power struggles rather than gruesome palace coups.\\" The Hollywood Reporters Daniel Fienberg said the first season \\"remains gripping across the entirety of the 10 episodes made available to critics, finding both emotional heft in Elizabeth's youthful ascension and unexpected suspense in matters of courtly protocol and etiquette\\". Other publications such as USA Today, Indiewire, The Atlantic, CNN and Variety also reviewed the series positively. Some were more critical of the show. In a review for Time magazine, Daniel D'Addario wrote that it \\"will be compared to Downton Abbey, but that .. was able to invent ahistorical or at least unexpected notes. Foy struggles mightily, but she's given little...The Crowns Elizabeth is more than unknowable. She's a bore\\". Vultures Matt Zoller Seitz concluded, \\"The Crown never entirely figures out how to make the political and domestic drama genuinely dramatic, much less bestow complexity on characters outside England's innermost circle.\\" Verne Gay of Newsday said, \\"Sumptuously produced but glacially told, The Crown is the TV equivalent of a long drive through the English countryside. The scenery keeps changing, but remains the same.\\" Slate magazine's Willa Paskin, commented: \\"It will scratch your period drama itch‚Äîand leave you itchy for action.\\"  References  Category:2016 American television seasons Category:2016 British television seasons Category:Cultural depictions of Elizabeth II Category:Cultural depictions of Winston Churchill Category:Cultural depictions of Charles, Prince of Wales Category:Cultural depictions of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma Category:Television shows written by Peter Morgan 1 ","title":"The Crown (season 1)"},{"id":"59583664","text":"Christa Agnes Tuczay (born 7 February 1952 in Eisenstadt) is an Austrian University professor in Medieval German Language and Literature at the Institute of German Studies at the University of Vienna.

In 1887 he debuted as a soloist. Between 1892 and 1897, he led an amateur orchestra in Li√®ge. From 1894 until the end of his life, he headed the well-known string quartet in the city who performed, in particular, the premiere of the first quartet of Joseph Jongen on March 6, 1895. From 1900 to 1906, he led the choir in Malmedy and from 1910 until the end of his life headed the city symphony orchestra. From 1898 to 1932, Charlier taught at the Li√®ge Conservatory. Charlier is best known for his 1911 arrangement of the Chaconne in G minor by Tomaso Antonio Vitali. Although Charlier based his version on a previous arrangement by Ferdinand David, he significantly enhanced the technical demands of the violin part. He made changes in harmonizations of the piano part, while reordering the sequence of variations to become increasingly more complex as the piece progresses.

In the 1970s she co-founded the Maryland Women's Legislative Caucus, the first caucus of its kind in the United States; founded the Women's Network of the National Conference of State Legislatures; and was the first woman to serve on the state Judiciary Committee. Over the years she helped pass more than 2,000 bills and policy changes. She was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 2008. Early life and education She was born in New York City in 1904 and attended New York public schools. She studied business economics and geography at Hunter College, graduating with a B. A. degree in 1945. After college she moved to Washington, D.C., to take a wartime job as an economist for the Office of the Quartermaster General of the United States Army. From 1949 to 1950, she worked as a geographer for the Army Map Service. Political career = Prince George's county = Menes first became involved in politics in 1953, when she helped organize a voter registration drive in the University Hills area of Prince George's County. She remained active in county politics, and in 1962 ran for county Register of Wills, losing the election by a hundred votes. She served as County Board of Elections Chief Clerk in 1963 and Secretary for the Democratic Steering Committee in 1966. In the mid-1960s she also worked as a substitute teacher in county public high schools. = House of Delegates = She first won a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates in 1966, and was continually reelected until she retired in 2007. She represented the 21st District, a section of northern Prince George's County which included College Park, Beltsville, and Laurel. During her tenure she focused on education, healthcare, criminal justice, aging, the arts, and women's issues, helping to pass over 2,000 bills and policy changes. During her first term she was appointed to her first leadership position by Governor Spiro Agnew. As chair of the Commission on the Public Library Laws, she organized legislation to improve the state's library system. In 1971, Menes was the subject of a notorious joke by Thomas Hunter Lowe, then the Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates. At the time, she was one of only eleven female lawmakers in Maryland. The House building in Annapolis, Maryland, did not have a women's restroom; the women had to walk across a crowded concourse to use a public restroom. The delay was serious enough to cause women lawmakers to miss an occasional vote. After Menes complained, Lowe appointed her \\"chairman\\" of the women's restroom committee and, in front of all the delegates, presented her with a fur-covered toilet seat. Menes later claimed the incident as a victory of sorts, noting that it was the first time a woman had appeared on the rostrum. The following year she co-founded the Maryland women's legislative caucus, notably the first of its kind in the United States, and served as its president until 1979. The women got their own restroom in 1973. In the mid-1970s, she worked to change a state law that prohibited a woman from filing a civil lawsuit against her husband. She said at the time that the changes would \\"go a long way to helping Maryland women protect themselves...Just the threat of financial responsibility will stay many a husband's hand.\\" She successfully sponsored bills to require AIDS testing of prisoners, create needle-exchange programs, and require medical personnel, teachers, and social workers to report suspected child abuse. Menes was active in many committees and advisory boards. She founded the Women's Network of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) in 1977 and served as its president until 1979. She led the Maryland delegation to the National Women's Conference in 1977 and served as president of the National Order of Women Legislators from 1979 to 1980. In 1979 she became the first female member of the state Judiciary Committee, on which she served until the end of her career. She chaired the Special Committee on Drug and Alcohol Abuse from 1987 to 2006. At various times she was a member of the Rules and Executive Nominations Committee, the Legislative Policy Committee, the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, the Joint Oversight Committee on Corrections, the Maryland State Arts Council, the Maryland Commission on Aging, and the Prince George's County Domestic Violence Task Force, among others. During her last few years in office she served as Maryland's House parliamentarian.

Several historic examples have been recorded. = Origins = Since the 18th century, word play involving linking an actual surname (or a title) with an imaginary family name has been done: * In 1770, Marquis de Bi√®vre invented comtesse Tation and l'abb√© Quille. * In 1882, Alphonse Allais invented Jean Rougy de Ontt, Tony Truand, Tom Hatt, Sarah Vigott, Azutat Laure. * In 1893, Christophe from the comic strip La Famille Fenouillard invented Guy Mauve and Max Hillaire. = The game of in-memoriam = * In late 1964, Juliette Gr√©co and Fran√ßoise Sagan popularized a basic version of the game under the name of \\"Game of in-memoriam\\", which was widely exchanged among the circle of Parisians. * In early 1965, Paris Match, in its first issue of the year, number 823, made it widely-known across France, and published over several weeks the best \\"in-memoriam\\" from its readers.Bernard Gourbin, L'esprit des ann√©es 60. * In 1978, Georges Perec created an example in Life: A User's Manual: :: \\"M. et Mme Hocquard de Tours (I. & V.) have the joy of announcing the birth of their son Adh√©mar.\\".Georges Perec, La Vie mode d'emploi, Hachette, 1978, √©dition Le Livre de Poche, January 2000, p. 291. :::: ‚Äî (a [= elle] d√©marre au quart de tour), referring to a car that \\"starts within a quarter turn\\" (from the time cars were cranked manually). = The first Mr. and Mrs. jokes = * In 1969, during the shooting of Claude Chabrol's film This Man Must Die, Michel Duchaussoy and Jean Yanne played this game. They found: ** Judas... Nana ** Elvire... Sacuti ** Ferdinand...

It ends with the memorable lines: Am√©d√©e √©pousant un Bossac pour devenir ::Bossac de Noyau D√©p√™che ::A un fils dot√© de trois pr√©noms ::En souvenir de ses glorieux anc√™tres : ::Yvan-S√©v√®re- Aim√© Bossac de Noyau D√©p√™che :::: ‚Äî (y [= il] vend ses verres et mes beaux sacs de noyaux de p√™che), meaning \\"he sells his glasses and my beautiful bags of peach stones\\". = Comic strip = Example of a dialogue : = Theatre = In the 1972 play Le noir te va si bien, Maria Pac√¥me and Jean le Poulain play a ¬´ surname game ¬ª (with ¬´ Mr. and Mrs. have... ¬ª), with the loser having to throw him or herself off a cliff. Following the example (the daughter of Micoton (Myl√®ne)), they successively came up with: the son of Danleta (Alphonse), the son of Teuzemani (G√©d√©on), the daughter of Enfaillite (M√©lusine) and the son of Dalor (Hom√®re). = Other media = * In Les deux minutes du peuple, Fran√ßois P√©russe regularly makes such jokes. * Michel Leeb based a skit on the joke, Monsieur et Madame ont un fils, where he tries to explain the nature of the joke to a madame Menvussa. = Television series = This type of word play was also used by Bart and Lisa in their telephone gags, in the series The Simpsons.  Use in speech therapy  The joke has been employed by some speech therapists as an activity while interacting with adolescents. It may be done in the usual form, or in the reverse: the therapist gives the first name, and the adolescent needs to find the surname.

Chafin, 568 U.S. 165 (2013), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held the appeal of a district court's decision to return a child to his country of residence is not precluded by the child's departure from the United States.. It arose from the divorce proceedings of Mr. and Ms. Chafin; she wanted their daughter to live with her in Scotland, while he wanted her to remain in the United States with him. Background Sergeant First Class Jeffrey Lee Chafin, an American soldier, married Lynne Hales Chafin in Scotland in March 2006. They had a daughter together, who went to live with her mother in Scotland while her father was serving in Afghanistan. After Chafin's deployment was over, the family reunited in Alabama. There, in 2010, Jeffrey Chafin filed for divorce, as well as seeking temporary custody of his daughter after Ms. Chafin was arrested for domestic assault. After her arrest, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement learned that Ms. Chafin had overstayed her visa, and she was deported. She then sued in American court, demanding that her daughter be returned to Scotland, so that a Scottish court could decide the custody issue under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Lower courts Ms. Chafin's lawsuit was heard in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. There, following a bench trial, the district court granted her request, ordering that the daughter be returned to Scotland. Mr. Chafin announced his intention to appeal the decision, and asked that the court's order be stayed until the appeal was heard. However, the court declined to stay the ruling pending an appeal. The daughter left for Scotland the same day. The district court separately ordered Mr. Chafin to pay Ms. Chafin $100,000 to cover legal fees and travel expenses. Mr. Chafin appealed the district court's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. But the appeals court declined to hear his challenge, refusing to consider the merits of the appeal. Instead, the appeals court declared that the case was moot, given that his daughter had already returned to Scotland. As a result, it denied his appeal, instead ordering the district court to vacate the return order and dismiss the entire case. Mr. Chafin then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which accepted the case. One of the factors in the Court's decision to accept the case was that the Eleventh Circuit's decision that the case was moot did not match the views of the Fourth Circuit, which in 2003 ruled that appeals courts did retain jurisdiction in such situations. This disagreement created a circuit split, which increases the likelihood that the Supreme Court will accept a case. Supreme Court decision =Issue= The case hinged on the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Specifically, the Convention seeks \\"to establish procedures to ensure [the] prompt return [of children] to the State of their habitual residence.\\" The United States is a signatory to the Convention. The District Court, in keeping with the United States' obligation under the convention, decided that the Chafins' daughter should be returned to Scotland, which was her habitual residence. The issue on appeal, however, was whether the case was moot as a result of her departure from the United States, rather than the underlying decision on the merits of the case. However, the Convention does not address the situation that arose in this case, where one party seeks to contest a finding of the child's \\"habitual residency\\". =Ruling= The Court concluded that despite leaving the country, U.S. courts still maintained jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin. Thus, in a decision authored by John Roberts, it held that the American judicial system could still order her to return the child. Accordingly, the Supreme Court unanimously held that \\"such return does not render this case moot.\\" The Court vacated the Eleventh Circuit's decision and remanded the case back to the Eleventh Circuit to evaluate the merits of the appeal. It further noted that, even if Ms. Chafin were to ignore an adverse result, that alone did not preclude the case from being appealed, and that the Scottish courts that were simultaneously deciding the custody dispute could be influenced by the result of the case. Roberts further argued that, if such appeals were moot, parents might be inclined to immediately leave the United States after securing custody of a child, to prevent the possible loss of an appeal. Such attempts to evade American jurisdiction could prompt judges to stay their rulings as a preventative measure to retain jurisdiction, in which case \\"a child would lose precious months when she could have been readjusting to life in her country of habitual residence, even though the appeal has little chance of success.\\" The Court also concluded that the legal fees Mr. Chafin had been ordered to pay meant that the case was not mooted by the daughter's departure to Scotland, since Mr. Chafin had not yet paid the $100,000 to his ex-wife. Subsequent developments The Eleventh Circuit, hearing the case for a second time, then considered the underlying merits of the appeal. The court ruled against Mr. Chafin. In a per curiam decision, the appeals court affirmed the original judgment, deferring to the district court's decision that the child's \\"habitual residence\\" was Scotland.

Constructed as a cinema in the early 1920s during a boom in the building of picture palaces, it was closed in 1969, after which the Majestic was used as a bingo hall and later as a nightclub. The building was listed at Grade II in 1993 as the Top Rank Bingo Hall and, in 2014, was badly damaged in a fire, resulting in the loss of all original interior and roof. Subsequently, it has been redeveloped into offices by Rushbond, serving as the national headquarters of Channel 4. Architecture Moulded first floor detailing and cornice Blue plaque from Leeds Civic Trust The Majestic is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building as a nationally important example of an early twentieth-century cinema, having been designated on 14 June 1993. The Majestic is a two-storey building in the Beaux-Arts style clad in Marmo artificial marble, a glazed terracotta which was made by the Leeds Fireclay Co at Burmantofts. Until restoration, this white material was blackened for many years by the polluted environment of Leeds. It is sited on the corner of Wellington Street and Quebec Street, with a curved and decorative entrance facade facing City Square. It originally had steep slate mansard roofs with dormers and a dome, but these were lost to the fire of 2014. Though stripped in appearance relative to previous Edwardian or Victorian buildings, there are many subtle external decorative features. These principally include the Greek key patterned panels on both side elevations, the cornice with modillions, vase balustrade and two sets of triple bull's-eye windows at the attic storey. On the first floor, there are moulded faience swags above windows and detailed panels illustrating musical instruments. A further three glazed storeys were added to the building in its redevelopment by Rushbond, which follow a contemporary style, as well as a new lightwell topped by a glass dome to allow light into the offices, given its deep floor plan, and new openings on the ground floor in place of the former billboard panels. =Interior= The original interior of the Majestic was characterised by the fine decoration and embellishments of early 20th century cinemas and theatres. The generously- sized, fan-shaped auditorium could seat 2,800 (1,600 in the stalls and 1,200 in the balcony), was covered by a coffered dome with a diameter of nearly and had many decorative features, such as a circular Classical frieze of repeated groups of horses and chariots, moulded cornices and wall motifs, and fluted Ionic columns surrounding the walls. Additionally, there was a grand organ of three manuals and 33 stops built by HS Vincent of Sunderland, and space for a small orchestra to perform live alongside the silent films which were shown during the 1920s when the Majestic opened. The wedge shape of the Majestic's plot had a great influence on its interior layout; it provided an opportunity for a large curved auditorium, fanning as the building widens, facing a screen at the east of the building. Historically, the primary entrance to the cinema was therefore via the side entrances with a rear circulation space and crush hall being provided there. The interior of the building was subject to repeated intervention during the 20th century, in association with its use for a bingo hall and nightclub. This included the insertion of dropped ceilings, staircases, partitioning, the cutting back of the balcony structure, and the painting of historic features in camouflage style paint. =Basement= The building's other rooms included a restaurant and a ballroom with a sprung dancefloor, both in the basement. These could be accessed directly from City Square using the main eastern entrance and were originally decorated in a Classical style. The rear of the basement included a circular kitchen and other servicing spaces. History Quebec Street's junction with Wellington Street c.1900, showing the buildings which would eventually be replaced by the Majestic. The Leeds Recruiting Office during the First World War, demolished in 1918 =Majestic Cinema= The site of the Majestic was occupied at the end of the 19th century by a timber yard and a row of small buildings named Eye Bright Place; the western end survives as 34‚Äì38 Wellington Street. At the construction of City Square in 1896‚Äì1903, the corner site was cleared and left as an open space. It was the location of a recruitment office during the First World War, which was demolished at its conclusion in 1918. Leeds Picture Playhouses Ltd bought the land, occupying a prime position beside Leeds railway station, from Leeds City Council for ¬£80,000 () and made plans for a cinema, which were described in a Yorkshire Evening News article on 16 January 1920; it claimed \\"the decorations and appointments will be of a most sumptuous character\\". Its architect was Pascal J Stienlet of Newcastle upon Tyne, with his partner Joseph C Maxwell. Stienlet was an established cinema architect who continued to practise until the 1930s. The chosen Beaux-Arts style was characteristic of many of the large and grand \\"supercinemas\\" or picture palaces of the time, which is considered a golden age of cinema building. The Majestic Cinema was opened on 5 June 1922 by the Lord Mayor William Hodgson, the first film being Way Down East which was attended by 50,000 people in its first week. In December 1925, it was taken over by Provincial Cinematograph Theatres, who in turn were bought by Gaumont-British in February 1929, and after that by The Rank Organisation in 1941. During the Second World War, the building was used as a base for soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk and as an air raid shelter. The Sound of Music, which ran at the Majestic from April 1965 to September 1967, was the longest movie run ever in Leeds, though South Pacific had a 38-week run from September 1958. From 1961 afternoon bingo started in the basement ballroom, becoming a full-time bingo hall in 1967. The cinema closed on 10 July 1969, with the final screening being The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. =After closure= Under Majestyk branding in 2007 Immediately following closure of the cinema, it was converted into a bingo hall named Top Rank by its owner, The Rank Organisation, to go with the one in the basement ballroom. The bingo functions closed in 1996 and the building was sold to Luminar Leisure, becoming the Majestyk nightclub in 1997. This in turn closed in 2006, but a smaller live venue named Jumpin' Jacks remained open downstairs and the upper room continued to be used as a concert venue until 2008. The whole building was granted consent for a change of use to casino with function room restaurant and sports betting area in 2005. However, the licence was refused by the local magistrates and a high court appeal was dismissed, therefore the casino use was never taken up. It was at this point, after a lengthy and ultimately fruitless legal process, that Luminar Leisure decided to sell the now empty building. =Fire and redevelopment= LNER covers the facade during redevelopment in 2019 The new owner, the Leeds-based property firm Rushbond, began work with the contractor Sir Robert McAlpine from 2012 to restore and convert it into mixed leisure and retail use, including punching large new windows into the ground floor in the former billboard spaces, which was largely complete and ready for opening. However, on 30 September 2014 a large fire gutted the building, both the roof and most of the interior being destroyed. The incident closed off much of the city centre for over twelve hours. The outer walls were considered to be safe and not in danger of collapse. Arson was established as the cause of the fire by the investigation, with evidence showing a naked flame had been deliberately placed against the seats. A 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with his suspicious behaviour at the scene, but he was cleared of all charges after a three-day trial in March 2015. Work began in 2018 to convert it into office space and extend upwards, followed by the announcement in April 2019 that Channel 4 was in advanced talks to site its new national headquarters ‚Äì containing creative and digital departments, alongside new creative hubs in Glasgow and Bristol ‚Äì in the Majestic; it was confirmed in December 2019 that Channel 4 would occupy the third, fourth and fifth floors, followed by the law firm Knights plc taking the first and second floors in July 2020. This leaves only the lower ground and ground still to let. Channel 4 and Knights are expected to occupy their offices in January 2021 following the completion of all works.

After Rubie et al. (2015). Alternative model for core-mantle differentiation: I. Melted iron layer between protomantle and primordial core. II. Primordial core cracking. III. Primordial core fragments. IV. Rockbergs ascend and iron forms new core. After Stevenson (1981). Core‚Äìmantle differentiation is the set of processes that took place during the accretion stage of Earth's evolution (or more generally, of rocky planets) that results in the separation of iron-rich materials that eventually would conform a metal core, surrounded by a rocky mantle. According to the Safronov's model, protoplanets formed as the result of collisions of smaller bodies (planetesimals), which previously condensed from solid debris present in the original nebula. Planetesimals contained iron and silicates either already differentiated or mixed together. Either way, after impacting the Proto-Earth their materials very likely became homogenized. At this stage, the Proto-Earth was probably the size of Mars. Next followed the separation and stratification of the Proto-Earth's constituents, chiefly driven by their density contrasts. Factors such as pressure, temperature, and impact bodies in the primordial magma ocean were involved in the differentiation process. The differentiation process is driven by the higher density of iron compared to silicate rocks, but the lower melting point of the former constitutes an important factor. In fact, once iron has melted, differentiation can take place whether silicate rocks are completely melted or not. On the premises of these plausible scenarios, several models have been proposed to account for the core-mantle differentiation following the stage of nebular formation of the solar system. They can be summarized into three mechanisms: 1) Percolation of iron alloy through silicate crystals; 2) Separation of metal from rock in a primordial magma ocean; 3) Migration of iron diapirs or dikes through the mantle.  Percolation  Under the assumption of a solid mantle and melted iron mixture, the percolation mechanism involves metal flowing along solid mantle crystal grain boundaries towards the center of the Earth. This hypothesis assumes that rocky materials remain solid or soft, while iron is molten. The surface tension of iron drops cannot be physically larger than the dragging exerted by the comparatively more viscous mantle, hence limiting the size of the iron droplets. The percolation hypothesis assumes that crystals in the mantle have no preferred orientation. Likewise, percolation requires the dihedral angle between melt and crystals to be less than 60 degrees to maintain connectivity. However, measurements at the surface suggest that the dihedral angle is frequently greater than 60 degrees, thereby limiting the occurrence of percolation, although it is uncertain whether it may be less than 60 degrees in the lower mantle. Traces of iron have not been observed in the upper mantle, which would be expected had percolation dominated there. Another argument against percolation as a dominant mechanism of iron migration is that it requires temperature to stay within a narrow margin, above the iron solidus but below rock solidus.  Magma ocean  Energy release during the impact of large bodies could have partially or totally melted the Earth producing a magma ocean, conceivably more than once during the Earth's formation. Even if initial melting surrounds only the impact area, isostatic equilibrium would globally re-distribute magma, albeit the timescale of such redistribution in comparison to the timescale of iron-silicate differentiation remains uncertain. Once both rock and metal are melted, separation easily takes place driven by density contrast. Models suggest that melting could have occurred as soon as a planet radius becomes ~ 2000 to 3000 km. Likewise, some models predict occurrence of magma oceans at depths down to 300 km. The lower mantle may have never been completely melted because its melting temperature rises at a rate of 1 Kelvin/km. It still remains uncertain whether a single stage long- lasting magma ocean took place, or rather several episodes of rapid-cooling magma oceans during periodic impact events. Experiments suggest that viscosity of the magma ocean was low, thereby implying turbulent convective flow that rapidly dissipates heat. If true, the magma ocean can only have existed for a few thousands years. Iron droplets in the magma ocean existed in a variety of sizes depending on the size of the bodies impacting the Earth. In molten state large bodies tend to break, whereas small bodies tend to coalesce. The equilibrium is found by the Weber number that provides a mean to calculate the stabilized diameter of the liquid iron droplets, which corresponds to 10 cm. After iron droplets form they segregate from the surrounding silicates and precipitate in a \\"rain\\".  Diapirism and diking  Large iron blobs cannot be dragged by convective forces in the primordial mantle, therefore they do not have enough time to hydrodynamically equilibrate and reach the stabilized size. Hence, they deposit at a rheological boundary (such as present day lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary), forming iron ponds. Eventually, ponded iron would sink into the comparatively less dense silicates underneath them. The mechanism is thought to resemble salt diapirs. However, notwithstanding the fact that the mantle underlying the magma ocean is not brittle, according to some studies it is possible that the difference in viscosity between the iron ponds and the mantle was enough to allow the formation of dikes rather than diapirs. For today's conditions, iron diking has been devised as a viable strategy to send a probe to study the Earth's interior.  Other core-mantle differentiation models  = Elsasser's model = Temperature models predict melting of the disseminated iron alloy while silicate rocks soften at the upper level. The heat source is radioactive decay. Liquid iron migrated downward to levels where cooler temperatures kept silicates solidified, forming an iron layer on top of an undifferentiated material core, and below the primordial mantle in which impact-induced convection flow develops. From this stage on, iron aggregations triggered by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities migrated through the primordial core in a long-term process (hundreds of million of years). = Vityazev and Mayeva's model= Rather than the iron aggregations proposed by Elsasser, this model proposes that the iron shell melted at the boundary with the primordial core, and permeated through the latter in liquid state instead of aggregating into iron bulbs as proposed in the Safronov's model. The primordial core would ascend in grain-size bodies until incorporating into the mantle. The time-scale for the core formation is of the order of billion years. = Stevenson's model = One plausible scenario is that the primordial, cold silicate core fragmented in response to instabilities induced by the denser surrounding iron layer. At the end, chunks of such a fragmented core (\\"rockbergs\\") migrated upward and incorporated into the mantle, whereas the iron alloy settled at the center of the Earth. This process would take place faster than the two models mentioned above.

Baldwin was a wooden hulled steam barge built in 1871, that capsized in a storm on August 26, 1908, on Lake Michigan, off Two Rivers, Wisconsin, United States, with the loss of one life. On August 22, 2016 the remnants of S.C. Baldwin were listed in the National Register of Historic Places as reference number 16000565. History The Baldwin with two schooners S.C. Baldwin (Official number 23957) was built in 1871 by Campbell, Owen & Company of Detroit, Michigan for the Escanaba & Lake Michigan Transportation Company to carry iron ore from Escanaba, Michigan to the ports of Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She was named after an officer of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. She had a length of , her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She had a gross tonnage of 418 tons. She was powered by a high pressure steam engine that was built by the Dry Dock Engine Works, and had a cylinder with a 26 inch bore and a stroke measuring 32 inches, and \\"double crank\\". At the start of her career she had a single deck. In March of 1873 S.C. Baldwin had a second deck added in Chicago, Illinois, this increased her gross tonnage to 634 tons, and is believed to have made her the first double decked steamer on the lakes. On April 30, 1876 she went ashore at North Point Reef on Lake Huron. On June 18, 1876 S.C. Baldwin collided with the schooner Ellen Spry off Kewaunee, Wisconsin. At an unknown date in 1877, she went ashore near Alpena, Michigan, and was repaired afterwards in Detroit, Michigan. In 1879 S.C. Baldwin was sold to the Inter Ocean Transportation Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In April, 1882 she was sold to David Whitney Jr. of Detroit, Michigan, and her second deck was removed in order to refit her for the lumber trade. after the refit, S.C. Baldwin gross tonnage was reevaluated to 412.5 tons. In 1884 it was reported that she was damaged near Ashland, Wisconsin. Following engine failure, and a storm near Port Colborne, Ontario. she was rebuilt with steel arches, and her original engine was replaced with a 450-horsepower Steeple compound engine that had a cylinder with a 37 x 32 inch bore and a stroke measuring 21 inches. On September, 1886 S.C. Baldwin went aground in Lake George in the St. Marys River with the freighter R.J. Hackett; both of them were released by the tug Mystic. In 1891 she was sold to the Whitney Transportation Company of Hamtramck, Michigan. In 1892 S.C. Baldwin was sold to S.R. MacLaren of Toledo, Ohio. On November 5, 1894 S.C. Baldwin collided with the steamer Iron King off Marine City, Michigan, and sank in of water. In 1903 S.C. Baldwin was traveling from Green Bay, Wisconsin to Buffalo, New York with a cargo of lumber when she struck an ice pack and sank in Green Bay, about 10 miles north of the entrance to the Fox River, near Long Tail Point. The tugs Wright and Nelson went to try and raise S.C. Baldwin, but could only move her . This caused her cargo of lumber to roll off her deck, and break her upper cabin structure off. In April, 1904 S.C. Baldwin was raised, and purchased by Adolph Green of the Green Stone Company. Despite some damage to her rudder and her keel, her hull remained mostly intact. In July, 1904 the Green Stone Company decided to convert S.C. Baldwin to a barge, and removed her machinery in the winter of 1904. In June 1905 S.C. Baldwin started hauling limestone from Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and other ports up Lake Michigan's west coast. Final voyage On August 26, 1908 S.C. Baldwin, and scow No.37 were headed south from Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin with a cargo of stone, in tow of the tug Torrent. The three vessels encountered a storm as they were passing Kewaunee, Wisconsin, and at around midnight, S.C. Baldwin began taking on water. At around 3:00 A.M., she capsized and remained unnoticed by the crew of Torrent until sunrise. When she capsized, two of her crew members jumped off, leaving a single crewman clinging to her hull. When Torrent crew realized she had capsized, they cut the line connecting the vessel. S.C. Baldwin turned over again, and sank. After the remaining crewman was rescued, Torrent went to search for the missing crew members. After her crew didn't find S.C. Baldwin crew, they sailed to Manitowoc, Wisconsin to tell the lifesaving station. after this, Torrent and some other vessels went back to retrieve scow No.37, and search for the missing men. On august 28, Captain George Heim, the Captain of S.C. Baldwin was located by the Goodrich Transportation Company vessel Caroline. A few days later, the body of Jacob Witgen, the other crewman washed ashore near Kewaunee, Wisconsin. S.C. Baldwin today The wreck of S.C. Baldwin was discovered sometime in the mid-1970s by sport fishermen who reported her location to divers. Her wreck is a popular recreational dive site, as she lies in only of water. Her wreck sits upright, with her stempost intact. Other than her stempost, her wreck consists of her stern, her stern deck and her transom. In 2015 the Wisconsin Historical Society conducted a full archeological survey of her wreck.
