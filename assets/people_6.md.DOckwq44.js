Description Phreatia micrantha is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with a stem that gradually increases in length with between four and ten leaves in two ranks, the leaves long and wide in a fan-like arrangement sheathing the stem. A large number of white, cup-shaped, resupinate flowers long and wide are arranged along a thin, wiry flowering stem long. The sepals are about long and wide the petals slightly shorter and narrower. The labellum is about long and wide and turned downwards. Flowering occurs between October and February. Taxonomy and naming The native fan orchid was first formally described in 1834 by Achille Richard who gave it the name Oberonia micrantha and published the description in Voyage de la corvette l'Astrolabe: ex√©cut√© par ordre du roi, pendant les ann√©es 1826-1827-1828-1829. In 1859 John Lindley changed the name to Phreatia micrantha. The specific epithet (micrantha) is derived from the Ancient Greek words mikros meaning \\"small\\" or \\"little\\" and anthos meaning \\"flower\\". Distribution and habitat Phreatia micrantha usually grows on rainforest trees sometimes on rocks. It is most common on mossy branches over streams. It is found on the Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Queensland (Australia), Fiji, Niue, New Caledonia, Samoa, Santa Cruz Island, Tonga, Vanuatu, the Wallis and Futuna Islands and the Mariana Islands. In Queensland it occurs between the Iron Range and Tully River on the Cape York Peninsula.

It was created in 2004 as a way to increase supporter participation and features a giant personification of Sparky the Sun Devil, Arizona State University's mascot, crushing the bus of the opposing team underfoot.  Video  The video starts with a solar flare from the Sun that launches towards Earth and lands in Arizona. A giant Sparky emerges from that flare. Sparky then walks across Arizona, passing known state landmarks such as the Grand Canyon and Camp Tontozona before arriving in Tempe, where the university is located. The scene then cuts to a view of Sun Devil Stadium with a bus covered in the opposing team's colors and logo (which change depending on the game day opponent). The giant stomps the bus underfoot before stepping into the stadium and spiking his trident into the field.  History  The original \\"Stomp the Bus\\" video was created in 2004 by True Story Films. The video became popular with ASU students and became a tradition prior to every Sun Devils home game. In 2011, \\"Stomp the Bus\\" was not played during the Sun Devils' season, which led to fans lamenting the apparent demise of this modern tradition. However the reason for the omission was that the video was being updated to improve the quality using new editing techniques and to include the student who played Sparky at the time. The playing of \\"Stomp the Bus\\" returned to Sun Devil Stadium the season after. The updated \\"Stomp the Bus\\" was well received and was the joint winner of the 2013 Rocky Mountain Emmy Awards for Best Editor ‚Äì Short Form (Promos, PSAs, Commercials, Opens, etc.). In 2018, Sun Devils coach Rob Likens stated that he felt that seeing \\"Stomp the Bus\\" was so inspirational, he believed it might have had the effect of inspiring ASU's opposition.

Testacea species are specialist fruit flies that breed on the fruiting bodies of mushrooms. These flies will choose to breed on psychoactive mushrooms such as the Fly Agaric Amanita muscaria. Drosophila neotestacea can be found in temperate regions of North America, ranging from the north eastern United States to western Canada.  Immunity  A dissected Drosophila infected with Howardula aoronymphium nematodes Drosophila neotestacea and other mushroom-breeding Drosophila have been studied extensively for their interactions with Howardula nematode parasites, particularly Howardula aoronymphium. Unlike related species, D. neotestacea is sterilized by H. aoronymphium infection. The genetic basis of this susceptibility is unknown, and is nematode-dependent. For instance, a related Howardula species from Japan does not sterilize D. neotestacea, even though the European and North American Howardula species do. Moreover, the related Drosophila orientacea is resistant to infection by the European Howardula nematodes, but susceptible to the Japanese Howardula nematodes. Accordingly, nematode infection strongly suppresses genes involved in egg development. Comparisons between D. neotestacea and nematode-resistant members of the Testacea species group can help tease apart interactions of fly immunity genetics and nematode parasitism genetics. Initially discovered in D. neotestacea, mushroom-feeding flies are commonly infected with the trypanosomatid parasite Jaenimonas drosophilae. The major innate immunity pathways of Drosophila are found in D. neotestacea, however the antimicrobial peptide Diptericin B has been lost. This loss of Diptericin B is also common to the related Drosophila testacea and Drosophila guttifera, but not the also-related Drosophila innubila. As such, these loss events appear to have been independent, suggesting that Diptericin B is actively selected against in these species; indeed, Diptericin B is conserved in all other Drosophila species. It also seems that unrelated Tephritid fruit flies have independently derived a Diptericin gene strikingly similar to the Drosophila Diptericin B gene. Like mushroom-feeding flies, these Tephritids also have a non-frugivorous sub-lineage that has similarly lost the Tephritid Diptericin B gene. These evolutionary patterns in mushroom-breeding Drosophila and other fruit flies suggests that the immune system's effectors (like antimicrobial peptides) are directly shaped by host ecology.  Symbiosis  Mushroom sites are infested with nematodes and other natural enemies Drosophila neotestacea can harbour bacterial symbionts including Wolbachia and notably Spiroplasma poulsonii. The S. poulsonii strain of D. neotestacea has spread westward across North America due to the selective pressure imposed by the sterilizing nematode parasite Howardula aoronymphium. While S. poulsonii can be found in other Drosophila species, the D. neotestacea strain is unique in defending its host against nematode infestation. Like other S. poulsonii strains, the D. neotestacea strain also protects its host from parasitic wasp infestation. The mechanism through which S. poulsonii protects flies from nematodes and parasitic wasps relies on the presence of toxins called ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), similar to Sarcin or Ricin. These toxins cut a conserved structure in ribosomal RNA, ultimately changing the nucleotide sequence at a specific site. This leaves a signature of RIP attack in nematode and wasp RNA. Spiroplasma poulsonii likely avoids damaging its host fly by carrying parasite-specific complements of RIP toxins encoded on bacterial plasmids. This allows genes for RIP toxins to readily move between species by horizontal gene transfer, as D. neotestacea Spiroplasma RIPs are shared by Spiroplasma of other mushroom-feeding flies, such as Megaselia nigra.  Selfish genetic elements  The Testacea species group is used in population genetics to study sex-ratio distorting 'selfish' or 'driving' X chromosomes. Selfish X chromosomes bias the offspring of males such that fathers only produce daughters. This increases the spread of the selfish X chromosome, as Y chromosome-bearing sperm are never transmitted. In wild populations, up to 30% of D. neotestacea individuals can harbour a selfish X chromosome. The spread of the D. neotestacea selfish X is limited by climatic factors, predicted by the harshness of winter. Thus, its frequency in the wild may be affected by ongoing climate change. The mechanism of X chromosome drive may be related to a duplication of an importin gene, a type of nuclear transport protein. Often, selfish X chromosomes suppress genetic recombination during meiosis. This process maintains the gene clusters that promote X chromosome drive, but also can lead to an accumulation of deleterious mutations via a process known as Muller's ratchet. The D. neotestacea selfish X suppresses recombination in lab settings, but occasional recombination occurs in the wild evidenced by recombinant genetic regions in wild-caught flies. Other Testacea species harbour selfish X chromosomes, raising the question of whether X chromosome drive played a role in speciation of the Testacea group. At least one selfish X in Testacea group flies is old enough to have been present in the last-common ancestor of Drosophila testacea and Drosophila orientacea.

The peak is the highest point on Sawtooth Ridge. It is protected by the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness within the Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Oval Peak, to the north. Precipitation runoff on the south side of the mountain drains into Lake Chelan via Prince Creek, whereas the north side of the mountain drains into Buttermilk Creek which is a tributary of the Twisp River. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Star Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. With its impressive height, Star Peak can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Star Peak Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Parallels were drawn to the murders of Eurydice Dixon, Jill Meagher and Ma≈°a Vukotiƒá. Maasarwe was buried in Israel, in her hometown of Baqa al- Gharbiyye. Background Aya Maasarwe was born in 1997 in Baqa al-Gharbiyye, Israel, to a Muslim family. Her family is Palestinian. She was studying at Shanghai University, and was in Melbourne as part of a student exchange program with La Trobe University. Maasarwe was undertaking a business degree intending to work later at her father's firm in China. Death Victorian police believe Maasarwe was attacked sometime after midnight on 16 January, around 50 metres from a tram stop on the corner of Plenty Road and Main Drive in the suburb of Bundoora. She had been returning home after attending a performance at a comedy club in North Melbourne and was on a video call with her sister. Maasarwe's body was discovered around 7 am in shrubbery near the carpark of Polaris 3083 Town Centre shopping mall by maintenance workers. Items of clothing, suspected to belong to her attacker, were located within 100 metres of her body. On 18 January, 20-year-old vagrant Codey Herrmann was arrested in Pioneer Reserve, a park in the nearby suburb of Greensborough. The following day he was charged with Maasarwe's rape and murder. He appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court and was remanded in custody. On 21 January the family received the body of Maasarwe from the coroner. In the suburb of Dandenong at the Albanian Mosque, family along with supporters gathered for the Janazah (Islamic funeral rites) and prayer service for Maasarwe. The family returned to Israel on 22 January with her body. She was buried in her home town of Baqa al-Gharbiyye. Her family later created a scholarship for Palestinian doctors in her name. On 29 October 2019, Herrmann was sentenced to 36 years in prison (30 years non-parole) for the rape and murder of Maasarwe. Reactions Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, in a statement condemning the killing, said that \\"sexist attitudes in our society\\" needed to change to end the problem of violence against women in Australia. Andrews stated that \\"Victorians are united in sadness. In anger that this bright young woman‚Äôs life was taken from her. I hope we are also united in determination.

During her lifetime she led a tireless apostolate dedicated to serving the poor during her time both in Brazil (where she travelled to and once lived in) and in her native land where she set retreat centers and soup kitchens for the poor. In addition to these initiatives she used her own resources to fund a boarding school for girls but divested most of her time and effort into a hospital that she sought to improve on following its inauguration. The initial steps for her beatification process started in the 1970s but the formal introduction for the cause came in 1984 ‚Äì she became titled as a Servant of God. The cause reached a decisive point in 2013 after Pope Francis acknowledged her heroic virtue and named her as Venerable. Life S√≠lvia Cardoso Ferreira da Silva was born in 1882 in Pa√ßos de Ferreira in Porto as the first of four children to the devout Umbelino Manuel Ferreira da Silva (1851‚Äì1918) and Joaquina da Concei√ß√£o Emilia Cardoso (1847-19.7.1936). Her baptism was celebrated that 4 August in the Santa Eulalia parish church. In 1883 she moved alongside her parents to Brazil and would return to her native Portugal in 1889. Cardoso made her First Communion on 23 April 1892 in her hometown and then in 1896 enrolled in a school at Vila Nova de Gaia alongside her sister Maria Hayd√©e. But she attended private lessons under a tutor before she enrolled in that school where she studied art and was given Piano lessons; following her time at Vila Nova de Gaia she studied at a college in another area. Cardoso received her Confirmation on 23 October 1903 from the Bishop of Porto Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Sousa Barroso and later on 20 January 1911 made a private vow of service to God with the intent of evangelizing and ministering to others. The unexpected death of her fianc√©e Dr. Ac√°cio Umbelino Pereira da Silva (whom she became engaged to in 1912) on 24 November 1913 in Brazil (close to their wedding date) enabled Cardoso to go to London to take care of their affairs before returning to Brazil in 1914 following the death of her older brother √Çngelo who died in Lisbon. Her fianc√©e had been an unbeliever but was later converted to the faith and upon his death left all he had to Cardoso. In 1916 she received a prize for having won a competition for floriculture in Porto. In 1917 ‚Äì while she attended a retreat for the Spiritual Exercises ‚Äì she issued a private vow to remain chaste; Cardoso never married following the death of her fianc√©e. In 1918 her cousin and painter Amadeu Sousa Cardoso died as did her father not long after. In mid-October 1918 she contracted a flu that evolved into pneumonia as a result of the epidemic spreading across Europe though she managed to recover unlike others who succumbed to the outbreak. In 1918 she helped in the foundation of a new hospital in her hometown using her own expenses to help fund it; it was inaugurated on 14 March 1919 after which she served from 1920 until 1925 as the hospital's vice-president for the administrative commission. In 1921 she again entered a floriculture competition and received a gold medal for her contribution in the exhibition. In 1921 she set up a boarding school for girls. On 21 January 1923 she began organizing retreats for people and in 1925 travelled to Rome for the jubilee that Pope Pius XI convoked; she hired a carriage for her friends among then the poet Dr. Queiroz Ribeiro. In 1928 she helped establish a pavilion in the hospital for patients suffering from infectious-contagious diseases and had this idea since 1925. In 1940 she donated land to establish a home for old people. Cardoso also established homes for abandoned children whom she dedicated herself to helping and on one occasion learned that a child was considering the priesthood so encouraged him to pursue his vocation and paid for his education. Cardoso also established soup kitchens to serve the poor. Throughout her work she carried a bag with her most times that contained rosaries and Devotional medals that she would hand out to others; she also carried items of clothing with her for the poorer people whom she came across. In 1925 she enrolled in the League of Servants of Jesus that Bishop Jo√£o de Oliveira Matos Ferreira founded. In 1926 she undertook a pilgrimage to France to visit the cities of Lourdes (to a Marian shrine) and Lisieux. In 1939 the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon Manuel Gon√ßalves Cerejeira encouraged her to collaborate with the members of the Catholic Action movement. In 1948 doctors diagnosed her as having a stomach tumor. Throughout 1949 she became worn and thin as a result of suffering from a disease she was diagnosed with that summer; she once tried to climb a set of stairs but found that she lacked the strength to do so. Cardoso underwent a painful operation on 21 January 1950 in order to treat her condition but realized that she did not have much time left with which to live. Cardoso died during the morning on 2 November 1950 and her funeral was celebrated the following morning. In late 1951 the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon Manuel Gon√ßalves Cerejeira inaugurated a statue in her honor. Her remains were exhumed and moved to a small chapel on 3 April 2016. Beatification process In the Porto diocese its bishop Ant√≥nio Ferreira Gomes in 1977 ordered the establishment of a commission in order to explore whether or not a beatification process for Cardoso should be established; this commission helped set the groundwork and basis for the process in their initial investigation into the life and reputation for holiness of Cardoso. The cause commenced on 9 April 1984 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) decree therefore giving their assent to the cause and titling Cardoso as a Servant of God. Archbishop J√∫lio Tavares Rebimbas inaugurated the diocesan investigation on 6 June 1984 and later closed it just under a decade later on 23 June 1992. The evidence collected during this process was sent to the C.C.S. office in Rome where it validated the process on 22 October 1993 as having complied with their guidelines for conducting diocesan processes. The postulation (officials in charge of the cause) submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 2001 for additional investigation thus initiating the so-called \\"Roman Phase\\" for the beatification cause. Theologians assessed and approved the dossier on 4 October 2011 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members on 8 January 2013 (both boards are to ensure the evidence for Cardoso's saintliness is compelling). Cardoso became titled as Venerable on 27 March 2013 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged that Cardoso had practiced heroic virtue during her lifetime to a favorable degree. Her beatification depends upon the papal confirmation of a miracle ‚Äì that being often a healing that science or medicine cannot provide an explanation for. The Porto diocese investigated such a case in an investigation that concluded on 4 March 2015 with the evidence being sent to the C.C.S. in Rome for further medical evaluation. The current postulator for this cause is Monsignor Arnaldo Pinto Cardoso and the current vice-postulator is Father √Çngelo Alves.

It is 6 km from the centre of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, in the direction of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov. Modernization to the public international airport should be completed in late 2020. The company South Bohemian Airport ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice holds the license for non-public international traffic. It is authorized to receive and dispatch medium-sized aircraft up to a wingspan of 36 meters. Due to lack of equipment, the airport cannot accept flights in bad weather; aircraft can land only in daylight and in good visibility (VFR). In addition, flights requiring customs clearance and the presence of customs and immigration services must register 24 hours in advance. At present, the airport is most used for sports and limited commercial flights; regular airport clients are firms with business interests in southern Bohemia.  History  In 1932, the construction of the airport for the needs of the Aeroclub ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice and the Czechoslovak Air Force began; ceremonial commissioning was on 27 June 1937. During the Nazi occupation, the airport was a backup and training base of the German Luftwaffe. After the liberation, the Czechoslovak Army took over the airport. Between 1950 and 1952, the airport was completely modernized, after which the Aeroklub ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice was no longer permitted to operate at the airport and moved to Hos√≠n airport. Between 1952 and 31 December 1994, the 1st Air Force Regiment \\"Zvolensk√Ω\\" was based at the local airport. The presence of the Czechoslovak Air Force was gradually reduced during the 1990s, culminating in the closure of the military base in 2005.  Modernisation  The thorough modernization and reconstruction of the airport is currently under way, in several phases, to bring it to a similar standard to other regional airports in the Czech Republic. Upon completion, ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice Airport will be suitable for mid-size transportation aircraft, including charter and business flights. The investor in this project is the owner of the complex, the South Bohemian Region. The first phase was completed in June 2015, including the repair of the runway and taxiways, the reinforcement of the runway surface and the addition of new navigatation aids for conventional airplanes. In addition, an in-house communications, engineering networks and a security center were built. Phase II comprises the construction of a new terminal, expanding aircraft stands, improving access roads and car parks for passengers, and providing public lighting. Once the terminal building is completed, there will be a certification process, lasting six to twelve months, allowing international traffic. The airport will be a fully certified airport for charter, tourist, business, freight and domestic transportation, with aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 permitted to land. Construction of the new terminal started in December 2017, full operation is planned at the end of 2020.

He is principally known for his biographical anthology, the Atashkadeh-ye Azar (Azar's Fire Temple), which he dedicated to Iranian ruler Karim Khan Zand (1751‚Äì1779). Written in Persian, it is considered \\"the most important Persian anthology of the eighteenth century\\". Azar was a leading figure of the bazgasht-e adabi (\\"literary return\\") movement. Life Azar's family was descended from the Bigdeli branch of the Turkoman Shamlu tribe. His ancestors and other Shamlu- tribe members moved from Syria to Iran in the 15th century (during the last few years of Timur's reign) and settled in Isfahan, where they served the rulers of Iran. Many of Azar's relatives were prominent in the late Safavid era and during the subsequent reign of Nader Shah (1736‚Äì1747) as diplomats and bureaucrats. Azar was born in Isfahan, the Safavid royal capital, during a time of chaos and instability. In 1722 (the year of his birth), the Safavid state had entered the final stages of collapse and the rebellious Afghans had reached Isfahan. Azar and his family were forced to move to Qom, where they owned property and where he lived for fourteen years. Around 1735 or 1736, his father was appointed governor of Lar and the coastal areas of Fars Province and Azar and his family moved to Shiraz (the provincial capital of Fars). In 1737 or 1738, after the death of his father, Azar made pilgrimages to Mecca and the Shi'ite shrines in Iran and Iraq. He then moved to Mashhad, where he enlisted in Nader Shah's army and accompanied his troops to Mazandaran, Azerbaijan and Persian Iraq. After Nader's death in 1747, Azar served his nephews and successors Adel Shah (1747‚Äì1748) and Ebrahim Shah (1748) and the Safavid pretenders Ismail III and Suleiman II before retiring to his modest manor in Qom. When Karim Khan Zand (1751‚Äì1779) ascended the throne, Azar decided to devote his time to scholarly pursuits and returned to Isfahan. The city was sacked by Ali Mardan Khan Bakhtiari in 1750, and Azar reportedly lost about 7,000 written verses. In 1774 or 1775 Azar was forced to leave Isfahan again due to misrule by Zand governor Mohammad Runani, and he died in 1781. Literary work Karim Khan Zand Azar is principally known for his anthology, the Atashkadeh-ye Azar (Azar's Fire Temple), considered \\"the most important Persian anthology of the eighteenth century\\". Its chapter titles are based metaphorically on \\"fire\\". Azar dedicated the Atashkadeh-ye Azar, completed shortly before his death, to Iranian ruler Karim Khan Zand. Although the work primarily deals with poets, it also contains information on the history of Iran since the Afghan invasion of 1722, a brief autobiography and a selection of Azar's poems. When Isfahan was sacked in 1750, a number of Azar's early poems were destroyed. However, he was still a respected poet during his lifetime. Azar's teacher, Mir Sayyed Ali Moshtaq Esfahani (died 1757 or 1758), began a \\"literary return\\" movement (bazgasht-e adabi) to the stylistic standards of early Persian poetry. The Atashkadeh, like much other contemporary poetry from Isfahan and Shiraz, was an example of the bazgasht-e adabi of which Azar was a leading figure. The movement rejected what was considered excessive \\"Indian style\\" (sabk-e Hendi) in Persian poetry and sought, according to Ehsan Yarshater, \\"a return to the simpler and more robust poetry of the old masters as against the effete and artificial verse into which Safavid poetry had degenerated\\". Persian poetry which originated during the Timurid period and was perfected in the courts of Mughal India was called \\"Indian\\"; it later spread back to Safavid Iran and Ottoman Turkey, where it was prominent in the 17th and (to some degree) 18th centuries. Azar praises his teacher, Mir Sayyed Ali Moshtaq Esfahani, in the Atashkadeh: De Bruijn notes that in addition to his divan, four extant masnavis have been attributed to Azar: Yusof o Zolaykha (fragments appear in the Atashkadeh); Masnavi-e Azar, a short love poem mirroring Suz-u godaz (\\"Burning and Melting\\"), a poem by Agha Mohammad Sadeq Tafreshi which was popular in Azar's time; Saqi-nameh (\\"Book of the Cup-bearer\\"), and Moghanni-nameh (\\"Book of the Singer\\").

It survives today in around thirty fragments and is commonly known as The Vulgate, with the works based on it known as The Vulgate Tradition. These works consist primarily of that of Diodorus, the Bibliotheca historica, and Quintus Curtius Rufus, with his Historiae Alexandri Magni. Completed at some point between 309 and 301 BC, it was the most popular work depicting Alexander in its time, but is valuable today for its unique perspective on the conqueror, in particular his psychological disposition and specifics of how the soldiers under him lived. Unfortunately, it is considered an unreliable source, with modern scholars considering Cleitarchus to have been more dedicated to writing an entertaining story than a reliable historical account. This dedication was also challenged by contemporary historians such as Arrian, who wrote his The Anabasis of Alexander in what is believed to be a deliberate attempt to counter Cleitarchus' \\"Vulgate Tradition\\", and in doing so created a work regarded by modern scholars as the best source on Alexander. Origin The work is believed to have been written in Alexandria, perhaps having been started when Ptolemy ordered the body of Alexander brought to Egypt, and finished between 309 and 301 BC. This dating is backed by the writings of several ancient historians, in particular through the works of the same Ptolemy, who it appears corrected Cleitarchus and whose works have been dated to the late fourth century, but this has been disputed in recent years following research into the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, which suggests that he instead lived and wrote in the mid-third century BC. Vulgate Tradition For much of antiquity Cleitarchus' work was the main secondary source that scholars wishing to create works about the Alexandrian Period utilized, resulting in a body of works described as in the Vulgate Tradition, with the work itself being referred to as The Vulgate. These notably include the works of Diodorus in his Bibliotheca historica, and Quintus Curtius Rufus with his Historiae Alexandri Magni, but also Sisenna and Justin (historian), alongside numerous less notable or otherwise forgotten figures. The Vulgate Tradition itself is that of the popular narrative, typically critical of Alexander, in juxtaposition to the narratives presented in less critical accounts, such as those of Arrian. It has been criticized along with the History itself for dramatizing Alexander, focusing on the lurid details and negative aspects. Conversely, it has been commended for not whitewashing Alexander's life, and including these negative details that other historians have omitted. Reception =Contemporary= While the History was a popular work in its day, it was challenged several times for its overly fanciful depiction of the life of Alexander, with Roman educator Quintilian describing him as an author with \\"more ability than trustworthiness\\", while the orator Cicero claimed that Cleitarchus' depiction of the death of Themistocles was entirely fictional, and in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri he is accused of being overly sensational in his work. Arrian, meanwhile, went so far as to create his own authoritative history on Alexander, in what is believed to be an attempt to challenge the Vulgate Tradition. Despite this criticism, the work was used by other contemporary historians in the creation of their own work, including Diodorus and Curtius, but also Justin in his Historia Philippicae et Totius Mundi Origines et Terrae Situs, through the intermediator of Pompeius Trogus, and Plutarch, in his Life of Alexander. =Modern= Modern scholars tend to view the History with considerably distrust, preferring the work of Arrian, but the work of Cleitarchus is appreciated for its unique insights into certain aspects of the life of common soldiers and civilians under Alexander, as well as for a critical view that is lacking in other sources.

Biography Isaac \\"Itzy\\" Hager was born in the 1970s and belongs to the Vizhnitz Hasidic community based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The grandson of Rabbi Mordechai Hager, he was raised in the small village of Kaser, New York founded by his grandfather. In the 1990s, he moved to Willamsburg, where he worked for a packaging equipment company before partnering with diamond trader and real estate developer, Chaim Lax (father of Moshe Lax) in the 2000s. Their real estate development firm, North Development Group, built several high rises in then low-rise North Williamsburg which were very successful. After the death of Lax, Hager had difficulty obtaining financing for legacy obligations of their partnership and filed for bankruptcy in 2009 eventually selling his existing portfolio to Louis Kestenbaum's Fortis Property Group, Xinyuan Real Estate, and Joseph Chetrit's Chetrit Group. After the recession of the 1990s, Hager re- established his firm under the Cornell Realty Management name. Taking a more conservative approach to development by partnering with larger players - such as Hudson Realty Capital, Madison Realty Capital and L&L; Capital Partners - and using funds raised in the Hasidic community, he has been able to rebuild his business. Since 2017, he has faced opposition from activists when he proposed building a 565-unit apartment complex in Crown Heights, Brooklyn; in April 2019, a judge issued a restraining order against the project. His company, along with city councilwoman Laurie Cumbo, are defendants in a case about the controversial rezoning near the Brooklyn Botanical Garden that would allow for oversize towers to be built there. Along with fellow Hasidic developers Simon Dushinsky, Yoel Goldman, and Joel Schreiber, he is considered a prolific real estate developer in Brooklyn. Personal life He is married to Shifra Hager.

In 1941, she set a new speed and distance record for female pilots in light planes.  Childhood  Waldren was born Evelyn Esther Nicholas in Stockham, Nebraska. Her parents divorced when she was young, and she and her younger sister, Virginia, were raised by their mother and stepfather.Oral history interview with Evelyn Waldren, by Patricia Keith, 1980 June 5, Oregon Historical Society Research Library When she was five years old, her family moved to Lincoln, Nebraska. Her stepfather was a \\"heavy duty equipment operator\\". A self-described tomboy, Waldren grew up helping him in his garage and visiting the construction sites where he worked. She attended McKinley School and Bryant School. She was skilled at drawing and considered a career as an artist. In the summer of 1926, Waldren saw an airshow in the small southern Nebraskan town where her stepfather was working on a railroad. She wanted to go for a plane ride, but her parents were concerned about the risks. Aviation appealed to her because of the good pay, the opportunity for travel, and the chance to work outdoors. Hearing about the feats of pilots like Ruth Elder, Charles Lindbergh and Phoebe Omlie strengthened her resolve.  Flight Training  Despite Waldren's arguments, her mother and stepfather refused to let her fly. Finally, on March 1, 1928, Waldren's mother agreed to let her train at the Lincoln School of aviation and to pay for the first fifty hours of lessons. As she told the story in 1986, \\"My mother enrolled me, paid $50 and said, 'You're on your own now: probably just a whim anyhow.' Well, this whim has lasted 56 years.\\" On March 3, Waldren took her first flight in a surplus World War I biplane. She remembered it as \\"the most remarkable, wonderful feeling. I felt the rush of wind in my face, smelled the exhaust. It looked like a fairyland down there.\\" After 14 hours of practice, Nicholas flew alone for the first time on June 7 at Page Field. Later that year, she obtained her pilot's license, becoming the first female pilot in Nebraska. By then, she had spent 75 hours flying solo. For ten years, Waldren's father, Wilhelm Nicholas, had not known where she was. After he recognized her picture in the newspaper, he was reunited with his daughters in 1928.  Great Depression  After graduating flight school, Waldren moved to Rockford, Illinois, where she carried passengers and did exhibition flying. She hoped to get a transport pilot's license, but needed 200 hours of flying time to qualify. After the Great Depression began in August 1929, Waldren had difficulty finding jobs, let alone work that would allow her to fly. She worked as a clerk and a ticket salesman, saving whatever money she could spare towards her transport license. Decades later, she recalled renting a plane and flying it once around the airport for a dollar. She remarked that \\"I've got a lot of three-, four- and five-minute entries in my log book. It came very slowly.\\" Waldren also hunted coyotes for a $2.50 government bounty, shooting them from a Rearwin Sportster plane.Videotape Interview with Evelyn Nicholas Waldren, Channel 2- Faces and Places, Portland, Oregon, 1982 Ranchers' associations would sometimes give her free chicken dinners and free gas for her plane to thank her.  Jamestown Municipal Airport  In 1929, Waldren married Howard Burleson, who had been one of her instructors at the Lincoln flying school. They moved to North Dakota, where she became the first woman in the state to get a transport pilot's license in 1933. With her husband, she ran a flying service out of the Jamestown Municipal Airport from 1931 to 1937, making charter trips. She also worked as an airways observer for the weather bureau and as a station agent and traffic representative for a local firm. She recalled her time there in a 1986 interview: > \\"I used to fly barnstorming shows in North Dakota during the Depression. We > used to send an advance man to a town to pick out a field and tack up some > posters. Then we'd hit town on the weekend and put on a couple of shows for > the folks. One of our tricks was to toss rolls of toilet paper out of the > planes, so they'd unravel all the way down. Well, when we landed, we went > back to pick up the paper- but we couldn't find any. You have to remember > how poor everyone was. One lady in the audience picked it all up- a whole > month's supply.\\"  Albany Airport  Waldren and Howard Burleson managed the Albany Municipal Airport in Oregon from 1937 to 1941. Waldren also wrote a column on aviation for the Albany Democrat-Herald, called Wings Over Willamette. In 1939, she was appointed to the women's committee and the junior activities committee of the National Aeronautic Association's Willamette Valley chapter. In February 1939, Waldren was appointed an air patrolman by the Albany chief of police, making her the second female air patrolman in Oregon. Her jurisdiction extended over the airport, where she had the responsibility of enforcing aviation law and responding to any emergencies. She was recommended for the post by the Aero Policewoman's Association of America. In October 1939, Albany Municipal Airport was approved to run a training program for the Civil Aeronautics Authority. Waldren became a Civilian Aviation Authority Flight Examiner after passing her written exam with a score of 94. It was the highest score her examiner had ever given. With this achievement, Waldren became the second women to receive a pilot instructor's license in the United States. Through the program, she instructed an initial group of ten students and a second group of fifteen students. Waldren's second class included six women. The students, who came from Oregon State University, were required to have eight hours of flight instruction before flying on their own. In 1941, Oregon women reactivated their chapter of the Ninety-Nines, a professional organization for female pilots. Waldren was named vice governor of the chapter, which included Edith Foltz, Leah Hing, and Bessie Gale Halliday.  Goodwill Flight  In 1941, Waldren planned a nonstop flight from Canada to Mexico. She wanted to fly to Mexico City, where she would deliver goodwill letters from the governor of Oregon and the mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia. Waldren took off from Vancouver at 2:30 PM on October 1 in her Taylorcraft airplane, Miss Liberty. The plane held 80 gallons of gasoline. She had delayed her flight by a day due to bad weather. That night, she flew into a fog bank over the Siskiyou Mountains. She considered bailing out, but decided it was too dangerous, since she \\"was probably too low to jump anyway. Disoriented, she made a series of climbs and dives, then decided her best chance was to try and rise above the mountaintops. After an uncertain amount of time, she emerged from the fog near Mount Shasta. Waldren landed in Tijuana, Mexico on October 2 at 7:30 AM, setting a new women's record for speed and distance in a light plane. Her average speed during the flight was 103 miles per hour. Upon landing in Tijuana, she abandoned her plan to fly to Mexico City.  World War II  Waldren was recruited by Jacqueline Cochran to join the British Air Transport Auxiliary, but backed out when her mother and sister objected. Instead, she moved to the U.S. Army base in Alturas, California to train Army cadets to fly. She was one of two female instructors at the base. Waldren stayed at the base for several years, training students in \\"turns... stalls, spot landings from various altitudes, stick turns, spins, that sort of thing\\".  Marriage to Robert Whitmaker  Waldren married Robert Whitmaker in 1942. The couple had a son, Douglas Whitmaker, in 1943. They divorced in 1949. Evelyn charged her husband with \\"cruel and inhuman treatment\\" and petitioned for custody of Douglas.  Aircraft Transport  In 1946, Waldren ferried planes from the Taylorcraft Aviation Corporation in Alliance, Ohio to the Northwest Aircraft Distributing Corporation at Evergreen Field in Washington. She was paid 250 dollars for every plane she transported, but had to arrange her own return trips without compensation. Waldren delivered three to four planes a month, flying 13 to 14 hours a day. In December 1946, Waldren left this job and joined the Piercy Flying Service in Medford, Oregon as a flight instructor.  Community Involvement  Waldren served as the public relations coordinator of the Oregon State Board of Aeronautics. She planned the Central Oregon Aviation Day held in June 1949, an educational event which provided free plane rides. Waldren arranged invitations and registration to the Salem Aviation Day held on August 28, 1949, where she demonstrated pattern flying and dead-stick landings. She also helped organize an airshow in Lebanon, Oregon, and escorted former Oregon resident Kathleen \\"Klondike Kate\\" Van Duren to the event.  Marriage to Robert Waldren  Evelyn married Robert Waldren, and together, they managed the Langmack Field airport in Sweet Home, Oregon. There, Evelyn Waldren received her private examiner's rating in 1951, allowing her to give out student pilot certificates. She was the first woman in Oregon with this rating. With their business partner, Homer Moxley, the Waldrens bought the Oregon City Skypark in 1953.  Career in California  Waldren moved to Corvallis, Oregon, where her family lived, \\"to instruct students learning to fly under the GI Bill.\\" After the program lost funding, she flew for US Forest Service and the California Division of Forestry as a fire spotter. In Enterprise, California, she operated the B & E flying service with another pilot, Helen Benna. After Benna left the business, Waldren became a flight instructor with Shasta Aviation at the Redding Sky Camp in Redding, California. After a heat wave in the summer of 1971, Waldren decided to return to the Pacific Northwest.  Evergreen Airport  In 1971, Waldren began working for the Mill Plain Flying Service at Evergreen Field in Washington as a flight instructor. She remained there until she died in 1986. Six months before her death, Waldren was training nearly a dozen students. That same year, the Federal Aviation Administration named her Instructor of the Year for the Western Region.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) to develop sensor-based systems that enable predictive maintenance of industrial plants. Konux has its headquarters in Munich and is registered in Palo Alto, California, as an American public limited company.  History  Konux was founded in 2014 by Andreas Kunze, Dennis Humhal and Vlad Lata. The three students met in a scholarship program of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and developed the idea to use sensor data to increase the availability of systems. Together with analysis software based on artificial intelligence, they used sensors to create a system that can monitor equipment and predict maintenance requirements. The founders focused on railway technology and especially on switches. For their project, they received initial financing (seed phase) of US$2 million from Silicon Valley investors.Weitere Millionen f√ºr Sensorik-Start-up Konux. Richters, Kim.

Alibabas √ºberraschendes Millioneninvestment in Konux aus M√ºnchen.  Product  The Konux sensor system continuously shows railway operators the condition of their lines. Sensors are installed in the track bed or in the points. They measure and collect temperature and vibration data and provide real time updates. Thanks to artificial intelligence, deviations or failures are identified and evaluated by comparing the data with a healthy switch. In this way, possible failures can be predicted and maintenance work can be planned. This allows some failures to be prevented, saving costs and reducing system outages. Other applications include pumps and machine tools.

Portrayed by June Spencer for over 60 years, Peggy has served as the core family's, and by extension, the village's matriarch. Spencer is the only remaining member of the original cast. The Independent newspaper has called Woolley \\"a fixture in the kitchens and sitting rooms of middle England since Clement Attlee was prime minister\\" who has a voice that is the \\"epitome of reassurance'. BBC Radio 4 calls the character a \\"traditionalist\\" who makes her \\"opinions known to her children if she felt they were contravening her strict moral code\\". Other commentators have labelled her as a \\"gangsta granny\\", a \\"wealthy widow, who lives in a grand house and controls family members using her money\\". Spencer recorded episodes as Peggy at the Chelsea Flower Show. Spencer spent three years in the role until quitting the serial, being replaced by Thelma Rogers for seven years. Spencer returned in 1962 and has remained in the role ever since. The character has been a widow twice, first to Jack Archer and later Jack Woolley, suffered a stroke, raised children and running a pub. Spencer said one of her goals was to celebrate her 100th birthday in June 2019 while still performing on The Archers.  Creation and casting  = Casting and early years = Spencer got her first radio role at the age of 18 playing a child in a programme about the railways. Spencer said she did not need to audition for the role, because she was already contracted to the BBC to star in a string of other radio plays.\\"My work was well-known\\", she said. When she started on The Archers, she initially played two roles - Peggy Perkins and Rita Flynn, a local Irish baker with a thick accent. \\"When The Archers started, there were only seven of us in that pilot episode,\\" Spencer told the BBC in a 2012 interview. \\"In the very first few weeks, those of us who could were doubling parts and my other major part was as the Irish Rita Flynn and she had a very different voice\\". She says Peggy's voice was \\"very light and high in those days\\" while Rita's was \\"much darker and lower\\". The original cast were put on 13-week contracts. Spencer recalled in the same interview \\"barely having a free weekend\\" due to the demand of public appearances to promote the serial. \\"I can remember on one occasion being flown down to Cornwall in a rather ancient plane which had been very loosely adapted for civilian use,\\" she told the BBC. \\"When we got there, there was a very large gathering of the Women's Institute for women all over Cornwall. Such was the popularity of the programme, I was literally mobbed.\\" Spencer said in a 2010 interview with The Independent that it was \\"very little pay\\" in the early days of the show. \\"There was plenty of time to do other things. I was doing a lot of radio at the time. There were only about 10 or 12 of us, now there are over 60.\\" Spencer has also criticised The Archers creator Godfrey Baseley as being a \\"very abrupt man\\" who \\"could be very dictatorial\\" and \\"thought he was God\\". \\"I can‚Äôt say he was greatly loved,\\" Spencer adds. \\"He wasn‚Äôt very popular but he knew what he was doing when he invented The Archers.\\" = Characterisation = In a 2010 interview with Chris Irvine from The Daily Telegraph newspaper, Peggy is described as a \\"matriarchal figure\\". But Spencer gave a much more brutal assessment, saying her character was \\"a nice old thing\\" who didn't always \\"see the funny side of things\\". \\"Peggy's quite narrow-minded in some things,\\" Spencer says. \\"When Ambridge had a female vicar, she disapproved to such an extent she wouldn't go to church. I wouldn't say no to a woman vicar. A good woman vicar is better than a bad male one. The Archer's official website lists Peggy's 'likes' as going to Church on Sunday, cats, and her garden; but she dislikes mobile phones, loud music and \\"slack standards\\". \\"Peggy is a strong-minded woman reflecting the character of her late mother ‚ÄòMrs P‚Äô,\\" the website attributes Spencer as saying: \\"she also has a softer side, loving and loyal. She doesn‚Äôt have a great sense of humour and has very strong principles.\\" = Longevity = In many interviews given around the time of the show's 60th anniversary in 2010, Spencer admits she did not see herself playing the part of Peggy Perkins as a long-term acting job. In an interview with Radio Times journalist David Brown, she says it was a \\"tuppenny-ha'penny thing\\" and \\"very badly paid\\". \\"I want to continue for as long as I can turn in a decent performance ‚Äî I wouldn‚Äôt want to go downhill,\\" she told Brown. \\"But I‚Äôd like to turn 100 [in June 2019] and still be in The Archers. I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt wait to retire until Peggy‚Äôs 100 because she‚Äôs five years younger than me. Spencer drove to the studio in Birmingham to record her lines up \\"a couple of times a week\\" until her mid-90s but is now granted a company vehicle. \\"I have degeneration of my spine, which makes me very bent, so it‚Äôs difficult to stand at the microphone, though the studio manager really looks after me and there‚Äôs always a chair for me while we‚Äôre waiting. Sometimes, if Peggy has to stand at the end of a scene, I fake the sound of making the effort to get up.\\"  Development  = First years = Peggy Perkins is introduced as Jack's \\"Londoner\\" wife in the first episodes broadcast in 1951 at a New Year's party held at the Archer's home. That same year, Peggy would give birth to her third child, Tony. The next year, Jack threw in the towel at the small goods shop and went into business in Cornwall with wartime pal, Barney Lee. But Barney took a shine to Peggy, and they returned to Ambridge. The Bull was firmly in Jack's sights and he took over the licence. But Peggy became the publican in 1953 after authorities caught Jack serving drinks after hours. In 1959, Aunt Laura loaned the couple the money to buy The Bull. Peggy would be worried in 1961 by eldest daughter Jennifer's sudden return from a ski trip with a boyfriend called Max. Peggy and Jack extended the pub in 1964, once again with a loan from Aunt Laura, and built a new dining room and small flat for Laura. As her father's drinking worsened, Jennifer returned to work at The Bull to support Peggy. Jack would later turn a part of the pub into a \\"playbar\\", complete with jukebox and espresso machine. But soon a riot by the young people who was his target market landed Peggy with a charge of breaching the peace. = Jack's death and Grey Gables = Jack's destructive drinking eventually saw him carted off to a rehabilitation clinic in Scotland after collapsing with liver damage. In 1972, Jack died, leaving Peggy behind the taps at The Bull. As stoic as ever, she continued on until her temporary manager, Dick Corbey, stole money from her. Jack Woolley, who had just turned 100 acres near Grey Gables into a country park, offered Peggy the job as his assistant. Burglars attacked Jack a year later, leaving Peggy in-charge of the venue until he was back on his feet. Jack would late suffer a heart attack moments after his wife Valerie asked for a divorce. With the divorce out of the way the next year, he began courting Peggy. But she turned him down because she \\"wasn't ready to marry again\\". = The female vicar = In 1996, three local church parishes were merged in Ambridge. The move bought about the first female vicar in the village, Janet Fisher. Peggy disapproved, and began worshiping in Borchester. = Marrying Jack Woolley = After turning down Jack Woolley's marriage proposal in the 1970s, the businessman tried again in 1990 when he asked Peggy to the Grey Gables Valentine Ball. In the episode broadcast on 12 October, Jack hesitantly asked Peggy to marry him while she was in the kitchen at Grey Gables. The pair took a stroll through the Country Park, and Peggy accepted. The pair were married in 1991 at St Stephen's church, and honeymooned in St Lucia. The newlyweds moved from Grey Gables into The Lodge later that year. Things got a little steamy in the marriage when Peggy's wartime sweetheart, Conn Kortchmar turned up in the village in 1992 to try and woo her back, unsuccessfully. Peggy sold The Bull the following year to Sid and his business partner, Guy Pemberton. Peggy then tried to talk her husband - unsuccessfully - out of buying Daphne's Cafe in Borchester in 2003. = Jack's Alzheimer's = In the early 2000s, producers for the show approached Spencer about shining a light on Alzheimer's disease by having her on-screen husband Jack showing the symptoms and eventually being diagnosed. Spencer says - to this date - it is the best storyline she has worked on. ‚ÄúWhen they were thinking of doing the Alzheimer‚Äôs story, I was asked how I would feel, because my husband had Alzheimer‚Äôs,\\" Spencer says. \\"And I said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm all in favour of it, let‚Äôs bring it out into the open, it needs to be done.‚Äô It was a rare moment when an actor could influence a storyline.I was called to a script conference, which was unprecedented. The writers and directors sat around the big table and asked me to talk about it ‚Äì what was it like, when did you first discover it. So I just talked. When I finished, they gave me a round of applause. Prof Simon Lovestone (a specialist in the condition at King's College London) wrote that it was the truest depiction of Alzheimer's he had ever come across.‚Äù Jack would suffer from the disease for about 11 years, until his off-screen death in 2014. Then editor of the show, Vanessa Whitburn, said: \\"We felt that we could do the story properly because we can do it over such a long period in real time.\\" \\"And we've been keen to show that he has good days as well as bad.\\" The programme won a Mental Health Media award for its portrayal of the disease. Jack's first signs were picked up in 2003, when he became confused about receiving a party invitation. A year later, he was found dazed and confused in the newly-renovated Grey Gables corridors, and his memory worsened over the year. Peggy was forced to accept Jack had to see a doctor in 2005. Jack performed poorly in the memory tests at the Felpersham clinic and was given medication, leading to Peggy asking him to reduce his business interests. The family looked after Jack while Peggy was visiting a friend, and realised the extent of Jack's memory problems. They encouraged Peggy to take Enduring Power of Attorney over Jack's affairs. Jack was resistant but accepted the idea after an unhappy visit from his gold- digging daughter Hazel. In 2006, Jack sold Grey Gables. When Jack's friend Sir Sidney Goodman died he planned to speak at the funeral, but in the end Peggy had to stand in for him. Jack became occasionally aggressive towards Peggy or would wander off. The family offered more practical help and Rev Alan Franks persuaded Peggy to enlist Jack in a day centre. The cricket pavilion was named in Jack's honour. By 2008, he could not recognise Peggy. = Peggy's stroke = In 2008, Peggy suffers a stroke due to the stress of caring for an ailing Jack. The family attempted to look after Jack while Peggy was in hospital, but after weeks of frustration, her family put Jack into The Willows care home. Furious with her family, Peggy discharged Jack upon her own leaving hospital. At home, she was struggling along with some help from Grey Gables chef Ian Craig, before eventually admitting her husband needed professional care. Despite the live-in carer, Peggy still found Jack incredibly demanding. Peggy came to the reluctant and painful realisation in 2009 that she could no longer care for Jack at home. It was time to let go, and Jack went to live at The Laurels. Jack celebrated his 92nd birthday in 2011, surrounded by friends and family at the home. = Becoming a widow again = Arnold Peters who had played Jack Woolley died in May 2013 aged 88. Peters' last recording was two years earlier for the character's birthday. The actor had also been a victim of the disease. Spencer recalls his last appearance, describing it as a \\"perfect\\" performance. \\"We went to see him in his retirement home. He could still turn in a good performance. He read it perfectly. We worked together just as we‚Äôd always done, up to the last.\\" Producers decided Peters' character would die off-screen the following year. In the episode broadcast on 2 February 2014, Peggy brings Jack home to spend his final days. She puts the record player on, and plays Love Is The Sweetest Thing, sung by Al Bowlly. The song was significant because it was the same one they danced to at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool, shortly after they began dating. Jack dies, with Peggy uttering the words: \\"Goodbye, Jack. Goodbye, my darling\\". = Hilda Ogden = A few years later, Peggy comes home from a hairdressing appointment at Fabrice of Felpersham with a new cat, Hilda, to replace Bill. Bill, a greatly overweight cat, died after being run over by her son-in-law, Brian Aldridge (Charles Collingwood). Journalist Nancy Banks-Smith writes in The Guardian that \\"she has also taken against the entire cast of The Archers, like Kipling‚Äôs Himalayan she-bear who rends the peasant tooth and nail\\". \\"It is remarkable that country folk, who can browbeat a bull, seem completely at a loss with a cat. Possibly Hilda Ogden misses the bright lights of Felpersham. Perhaps she just doesn‚Äôt like peasants.\\" Christine is living with Peggy at The Lodge when Hilda gets under her feet and trips her up, leaving her in hospital and on a waiting list for a hip replacement. Terrified of going back home, Christine opts to stay at The Laurels. Peggy insists on paying for her stint in respite, but keeps on at Christine about moving back in. She even considers getting rid of Hilda, much to Christine's dismay. = The Canterbury Tales = Peggy is revealed as the mystery cast member in Lynda Snell's production of The Canterbury Tales at the end of 2018. Peggy plays a magician.  Reception  The Daily Telegraph praised Spencer's portrayal of Peggy during episodes leading up to her on-air husband's death from Alzheimer's disease in 2014. Cole Morton of the Telegraph wrote that Spencer's portrayal \\"made me cry\\" as she \\"moved around the living room, with only the cat for company\\". \\"You may not like the show ‚Äì it is a bit like marmite ‚Äì but you have to admire the longevity of a 94-year-old who has been working for the BBC since 1943 and is still playing a leading character in a flagship drama,\\" Moreton wrote.

The band's other members are Karthik Poduval, Sam Rowe and Charles Prest. Their sound blends western psychedelia with pop and Eastern musical influences, and has been described as ‚ÄòExotic Psychedelia‚Äô. History Growing up in Bahrain, Rasool traveled widely and collected rare instruments from places like Tanzania and the Amazon. When Rasool moved to London to study music, he recruited his friends from Bahrain who were also studying in the UK. During ATP festival in 2010, the band played together for the first time. In 2010 and 2011, the group released two EPs entitled Sun and Away. Flamingods' debut album, Sun, was released in 2013 by indie label Art is Hard. The album was a reimagining of their EP of the same name. The single \\"Quesso\\" featured ex-Ponytail member Dustin Wong on lead guitar. Around this time, the UK government put in place new visa laws which forced Rasool to move back to his home country of Bahrain after university. = Hyperborea (2014) = After being forced to leave the UK, Rasool moved to Dubai and worked for an independent magazine and coffee shop. However, the group continued to work on new music, and created an album despite the members not being able to play together. This became the band's second album Hyperborea, released through Shape Records. Hyperborea received positive reviews from critics, notably from NME Magazine who gave the album an 8/10, noting \\"African rhythms and soundscapes cribbed from across the world music remit‚Ä¶it‚Äôs worth a visit.\\" The band was also chosen as The Guardian‚Äôs \\"band of the week\\" describing the album as \\"otherworldly, globetrotting sound‚Ä¶impossible to pin down.\\" = Soundway Records and Majesty (2016) = During the release of Hyperborea, Prest moved to Dubai to work with Rasool. The band were influenced by 1950s/60s exotica music, citing influences from artists like Les Baxter, Tito Puente, Arthur Lyman and others. Flamingods began to work on their third record Majesty, inspired by these new influences. In 2015, the group was invited to play at the West Holts stage at Glastonbury Festival. Miles Cleret, owner of the record label Soundway Records offered to release Majesty after being \\"blown away\\" by a set the band played on HMS Sweet Charity. Majesty was released in June 2016. It is a concept album split into two parts, Side A -Morning (tracks 1-5) and Side B-evening (6-10). The album received mixed reviews, but was championed by BBC Radio 6 Music‚Äôs Gilles Peterson and Lauren Laverne who both invited the band to record live sessions on 6 Music. Other reviewers like PopMatters felt that the band's desire to be avant garde reduced the album's accessibility. With Rasool and Prest both returning to the UK, the band was able to tour extensively across the UK and Europe in support of the album, landing slots at festivals such as Green Man, End of the Road Festival and Fusion Festival in Germany. = Moshi Moshi signing = In February 2017 the group signed with indie label Moshi Moshi Records to release their EP Kewali, a followup to their album Majesty the previous year. The band toured with the EP, appearing at SXSW in Austin for the first time. In the same year the band released a remix album of Majesty, which included remixes by artists such as Ibibio Sound Machine, Meridian Brothers and ex-Oasis member Andy Bell. The band also re-recorded a live version of their track \\"Hyperborea\\" from their second album with producer Dan Carey under his Speedy Wunderground label. In January 2019, Flamingods released the track \\"Marigold\\" from upcoming album Levitation, which will be released by Moshi Moshi on 3 May 2019. The band have been announced as headliners of Are You Listening? Festival in Reading in April 2019. = Levitation (2019) = 2019's Levitation was influenced by the band's exposure to funk, Turkish psych rock and other eclectic Middle Eastern and South Asian sounds of the 1970s. Levitation has so far received significant music press coverage, being positively reviewed by Line of Best Fit, MysticSons, BackSeatMafia, Loud and Quiet, SoundBlab, Selective Memory Mag, KEXP, and with interviews in Clash AllThingsLoud and Source, as well as in international media. In print media, the album received 3/5 by Q magazine, 7/10 from Long Live Vinyl and 3/5 by DIY, and the band appeared extensively on radio including BBC Radio 6 shows with DJs Lauren Lavere, Mark Riley and Tom Ravenscroft.

Biography  Suvorov was born on 19 May 1919 in Saratov. He graduated in mathematics from the Tomsk University in 1941. From 1941 to 1946, he served in the Soviet Army. For his military service, he was awarded the medals \\"For the Defense of Moscow\\" (1944), \\"For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War of 1941‚Äì1945\\" (1946) and \\"For the Victory over Japan\\" (1946). He was demobilized with the rank of lieutenant. After demobilization, he taught for several months at the Stalin Pedagogical Institute in Donesk. He then returned to the Tomsk University to research under the supervision of Pavel Parfenevich Kufarev (1909‚Äì1968). Between 1951 and 1966, Suvorov worked as an assistant, then lecturer and finally became professor in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. Finally in 1961 he defended his D.Sc. dissertation entitled \\"Main properties of certain classes of topological mappings of plane domains with variable boundaries.\\" In 1965, he was elected to Ukrainian SSR branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. In 1966, he became the Head of the Department of the Theory of Functions at the Donetsk Computing Centre, which later became the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences. Suvorov died on 11 October 1984 in Donestk, Ukraine.  Works  Suvorov was the founder of a new branch of function theory concerned with the study of classes of plane and spatial mappings with bounded Dirichlet integral and of a new trend in mathematics at the border of the theory of functions and general topology that deals with the topological aspects of the boundary correspondence in a conformal mapping. Suvorov made major contributions on the theory of topological and metric mappings on 2-dimensional space. Later at Donetsk he extended Lavrent'ev's work on stability and differentiable function theorems, to more general classes of transformations. Suvorov introduced new methods to help in the understanding of metric properties of mappings with bounded Dirichlet integral. Suvorov and Oleg Ivanov collaborated on a number of papers culminating in a joint monograph ‚ÄúComplete lattices of conformally invariant compactifications of a domain‚Äù. Suvorov published his authoritative monograph \\"Families of plane topological mappings\\" in 1965. He published in 1981 a monograph \\"The metric theory of prime ends and boundary properties of plane mappings with bounded Dirichlet integrals. (Metricheskaya teoriya prostykh kontsov i granichnye svojstva ploskikh otobrazhenij s ogranichennymi integralami Dirikhle). (Russian)\\". Two of his monographs were posthumously published in 1984 \\"The generalized \\"length and area principle\\" in mapping theory. (Obobshchennyj ‚Äúprintsip dliny i ploshchadi‚Äù v teorii otobrazheniya). (Russian)\\" and in 1985 his monograph \\"Prime ends and sequences of plane mappings\\" develops the topics from his two earlier monographs.

He then went to work for SOM-Berthiot, and stayed there until retirement as head of that company‚Äôs main factory in Dijon.

This was a time of relative freedom, which he used to work on a problem a friend working for film industry, , had suggested: creating a single camera lens to replace the three ones used on movie cameras. Working on a device based on four lenses and two sliding tubes, Roger Cuvillier and his team developed the prototype of a zoom lens which was optically corrected, enabling its focal length to be tripled without moving the focal plane. It was patented on January 28, 1949, as French patent No.983.129. Sales started in 1950, under the name Pan Cinor, \\"Cinor\\" being the brand name of SOM-Berthiot film lenses.

Kosasih published his first comics, a five-part comic book series featuring the female superheroes Sri Asih and Siti Gahara, in 1954. It was the first popular indigenous comic book in Indonesia. Kosasih started from the wayang (Indonesian puppet theatre) stories, traditions and techniques and applied these to comics. His major works were his adaptations of the ancient Indian epics Mahabharata between 1957 and 1959 (the main series in 37 volumes, and many other comics about characters from the epic) and the Ramayana. Other comics by Kosasih include Wayang Purwa and Sri Kresna (four volumes, 1983). His Mahabharata diverged from the typical wayang Indonesian elements in the stories and turned back to the original Indian versions. Its popularity lead to a renewed interest in the wayang versions as well, and many wayang puppeteers incorporated elements from the comics into their stories.

The main services offered are intra Mediterranean, and Europe to East, South and West Africa and Middle East, plus a number of further destinations reached via transhipment. The company also owns a Container Terminal inside the port of Genoa, Italy. The company started trading in 1921 as \\"Giuseppe Messina Tabuso\\", a small shipping line specialising in the distribution of perishables, carried from Sicily to Northern Italy ports. Once the office was moved to Genoa, new trade lanes were opened, including towards Libya. In 1929 the company changed name to \\"Ignazio Messina & C.\\", and is awarded the carriage of some postal services on behalf of the Italian Post Office towards North Africa and Libya. From 1935 additional services are added, towards Red Sea, including Port Sudan, Saudi Arabia and East Africa, and later towards Algeria, Lebanon and West Africa. After the Second War World, the fleet suffered a number of losses, but was slowly rebuilt and enlarged. In February 2017, Mediterranean Shipping Company purchased a 49% stake into Ignazio Messina & C., becoming the minority owner. Since 2018 some cooperative activities in between the two companies have started, including vessel chartering. All Messina Line owned ships are named ‚ÄúJolly‚Äù and include a colour spelled in Italian, in their names.

It is part of the Baikonur cosmodrome. It sits 40 km north-north-west of Baikonur (at the site of 251 cosmodrome Baikonur) in the desert region of Ushkyzyl. The airport is leased by Russia from Kazakhstan as part of the ‚ÄúBaikonur‚Äù complex. The aerodrome operator is FSUE ‚ÄúTsENKI‚Äù. Yubileyniy airfield supports all types of aircraft, including An-225 \\"Mriya\\". The maximum take-off weight is 392 metric tons.  History  The airfield was built in the early 1980s for the development of the Buran reusable spacecraft program. The decree establishing the landing complex was adopted in October 1977. The airfield received the name \\"Jubilee,\\" in connection with the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution. NPO Molniya was appointed the lead developer of the complex. The 20th Central Design Institute of the USSR Ministry of Defense carried out the design.The reusable space system Energia-Buran. Moscow: NPP OmV-Luch, 2004. - 356 p. In 1979, crews from the 130th Engineering Department began construction on the 4500 x 84 m runway. The runway used M-600 monolithic high-strength concrete with a thickness of 26‚Äì32 cm on a sand-cement foundation with a thickness of 18 to 22 cm. The total excavation volume was about 2 million m3. The first facilities were commissioned in November 1981. The first landing was made in February 1980 by an Mi-8 helicopter from the aviation regiment of the Baikonur Cosmodrome\\". On January 29, 1982 an An-26 landed. The first transportation to Baikonur of elements of the reusable space system ‚ÄúEnergia - Buran‚Äù by plane (VM-T) took place on April 8, 1982. From 1982 to 1990, 59 VM-T flights were made to deliver large elements of the space complexes \\"Energy\\" and Buran. Buran spacecraft were transported to the Ramenskoye airfield near Moscow and the units of the Energia launch vehicle - from Izymyanka airfield in Kuibyshev (now Samara). The airfield belonged to the Ministry of Defense. After 1992, the airfield was abandoned and partially looted. In 1995, the need arose to support heavy aircraft from the United States, launching US spacecraft under international commercial programs. Yubileyny became Khrunichev Space Center, the manufacturer of Proton heavy launch vehicles. Recruitment for civil aerodrome personnel was initiated. Radio navigation, radio communications, lighting, meteorological and other equipment were updated, and the runway was overhauled. In 1997, these works were completed and the experimental airfield was put into operation. From 1997‚Äì2011, the aerodrome received passenger flights carrying administrative and technical personnel. In 2017, the airfield was transferred to the FSUE \\"TsENKI\\". A reconstruction of the airfield was planned for 2018.  Geography  The terrain is a slightly wavy plain (altitude 95‚Äì120 m). 4 km northeast of the airfield is Ushkƒ±zƒ±l mountain (altitude 135 m). Flora include wormwood- boylychy (northern) desert. The soils are brown desert-steppe. 8 km north of the airfield are sand Darbas. No permanent watercourses and reservoirs are nearby.

He was hanged in 1870 for murdering 13-year-old Louisa Fox in Kirkwood Township, Belmont County, Ohio, and shortly before his execution, he confessed to murdering 14 men, including to participating in a famous 1867 murder that occurred in West Virginia. Biography =Upbringing and military service= Thomas David Carr was born on March 6, 1846, as the fourth son in a family of five boys and three girls. His father, William Carr, had been an abusive parent who treated him harshly throughout his childhood. Three years after his birth his family began moving frequently around West Virginia, living in Woods' Run, Fulton, Centre Wheeling and settling in North Wheeling. Thomas grew up as a troublesome child, who frequently fought with other kids in the street. He formed bad associations, and when he began work, he did jobs for river men, brickyard hands and colliers. In 1854, he was sent to prison for unknown reasons. Carr claimed that he was intimate friends with a John H. Burns and his accomplice Oscar Myers, who had murdered a woman named Mary Montonie. Burns had been sentenced to death, while Myers to life imprisonment. While on a visit to the prison, Carr had slipped poison for Burns to kill himself with, but the man was \\"too cowardly to do it\\". Shortly after, his family moved again, this time to Belmont County in Ohio. Soon after, the now 16-year-old Carr was enlisted with the 16th Ohio Infantry and served 3 months in West Virginia. Following this, he enlisted for 3 years in the 18th Ohio Infantry, and when that term expired, he enlisted to another division yet again. During his military career, Carr was frequently arrested due to misconduct, and twice sentenced to be shot for violating regulations. On one such occasion, he was forced to dig his own grave. Then-president Abraham Lincoln felt pity on the boy, and pardoned his sentence. =Murders= The first murder Carr confessed to took place near Virginia's Greenleaf Mountain. He had wandered away from his regiment so he could drink. While lying about in the woods, a citizen had tried to arrest him. As the man approached, Carr took out his gun and shot him in the left breast before fleeing. The next day the man died from his injuries. Shortly after, while a prisoner in Columbia, South Carolina, Carr had learned that a man named Edward Berringer was attempting to join the Confederate States Army. Along with two comrades from the 14th Ohio Infantry, the trio strangled Berringer. After his release, he rejoined the 18th Ohio Infantry and was discharged to Mississippi, where he shot two rebel soldiers, one of them while on picket duty. When his time expired in the 18th Regulars, Carr turned towards the 4th Ohio Infantry, serving his duty without much trouble, except once, when he shot at an Annie Whalen in Clarksburg, a prostitute whom he had connections to. Enlisting afterwards in the 180th Ohio Infantry, Carr was serving in Belmont County when he was allegedly prevented from arresting a deserter by a Dr. L. Voorhees (Voorhees claimed this never happened). While fighting in the Battle of Franklin, Carr claimed that he had killed and then robbed two men. Following this, he fought in the city of Wilmington, North Carolina at a place called Wise's Forks, where he crouched behind a pine log and killed an unaware rebel sergeant, who had just passed by. He pilfered the man's clothes afterwards. His next murder was that of a soldier of the 84th Ohio Infantry, whom Carr had been placed to guard, and then killed after the man had tried to escape. Carr also claimed that he was one of a gang of 11 men who raided a sutler's shop in Petersburg, Virginia, stamping the owner to death in the process. While near Raleigh, North Carolina, a gang of 15 soldiers (including Carr) had learned that a Federal soldier had been hung by the Confederates in the cellar of the house of a prominent southener. When they arrived at the house, they found a rich planter's residence. Carr claimed that the soldiers searched all rooms of the residence, but found no men, only the women who were left by the rebels. Finally, the gang descended into the cellar, where they found a soldier hanging from the ceiling, clothed in \\"Union Blue\\". Enraged, the soldiers burned down the house, watching the women flee the burning residence. One of them, a beautiful 17-year-old girl, had her dress burning from the fire, but was extinguished by the men. However, they then gang raped and tortured the girl in a brutal way, leaving her for dead in a nearby orchard without any assistance. When he \\"learned\\" of the crime the following day, Carr said that \\"the men that done that ought to be hung.\\" After this, Carr was guarding a house in Raleigh when he shot a man who was trying to break inside. He had also thrown a colored waiter who refused to give him any food overboard while on a steamer travelling from Morehead City to Fort Monroe. While in Baltimore, Maryland, Carr attempted to ride on a street car without paying a fare. The conductor noticed this and, while trying to kick him off, had one of his ears nearly severed by the freeloader. The driver then tried to help his colleague, but was stabbed in the bowels by Carr and died soon after. The killer then mingled with the crowd and shaved his mustache afterwards, successfully escaping. In Newark, Ohio, after finishing a bottle of whisky, Carr threw it, hitting a random stranger who was standing on the platform, splitting the man's skull open. Just at that moment, a train full of soldiers was passing by and Carr jumped on, escaping justice once again. =Murder of Aloys Ulrich= After returning to Wheeling following his army service, Carr began working again, first for a man named James Sweeney in a brickyard, then for a James Bodley, whom he worked for until May 1867. One night, he escaped from work. Early the following morning, while strolling around town, Carr met a Swiss traveller by the name of Joseph Eisele (alias John Shaffer). The man had just arrived from Parkersburg on a steamboat named \\"Express\\", and had left his baggage on the boat. Eisele told Carr that he wanted him to help kill his companion, a fellow Swiss named Aloys Ulrich. While the trio were travelling along the Hempfield Railroad, Eisele got behind Ulrich and struck with a hatchet (that same hatchet Eisele would later use for murdering another man in Parkersburg). Carr, who was afraid to be the next victim, struck Ulrich with a rock, and then Eisele finished him off with the hatchet. After killing him, the duo rummaged through his pockets, finding a lot of francs and some paper money. They divided the money, with Carr getting the bigger share, and parted ways. Carr would later claim that he'd seen Eisele in Pemberton House, where he was having the time of his life. Following this murder, he felt very uneasy, even considering giving himself up, since Carr was afraid that after the coroner's inquest, Eisele would implicate him. However, that never happened, and he never saw Eisele again. Following this, Carr considered peddling the money, but this murder began haunting him and so he decided to join the Methodist Episcopal Church, headed by Reverend Ball. For some time, he felt better, with people encouraging him. Despite this, Carr soon grew restless and began talking in his sleep due to fear of being found out. He decided to leave Wheeling, and to never return. =Murder of Louisa Fox= Carr soon moved back to Belmont County, where he was to be engaged to a 13-year-old girl named Louisa Catharine Fox in Sewellsville. He initially claimed to have her parents' consent, but they later had retracted it and refused to let the girl marry him. When Louisa told him that she had to break off the marriage, this infuriated Thomas, who then decided that he'd kill her. He stole a razor from the shoe shop of an Alexander Williams, and turned towards the house of a Mrs. Hunter, for whom Fox was working for as a servant girl. He lied to the girl that he had been to her parents' house and that they wanted her to visit them to their grandparents'. He then asked Louisa one last time, and she rejected him yet again. Following this, Carr drank around four bottles of hard cider, which heavily intoxicated him. Learning that Fox was going to go to her grandparents', he got the stolen razor and went on to the road, deciding to wait by a large oak tree. He changed his mind and decided to get a gun and shoot Fox. He visited two separate houses to ask for one, but neither had a gun. After returning to the fields, Carr noticed some tracks, and immediately realised they were Louisa's. He then ran up to the hill, and waited till he saw Louisa walking along the road with her little brother, Willie. Carr hid behind a fence, before Louisa herself noticed him and began talking to him. The pair conversed for a long while, both of them eventually breaking down into tears. Louisa kept telling him that they couldn't get married due to her parents' disapproval. Carr then told Willie to go down the road and that they would follow him soon after. After arguing for a bit, both began walking down the road, with Willie being about 10 yards ahead of them. By then, Carr had decided to kill her when they reached the ravine, continuing their talk in the meantime. He asked her if it was enough for a man to commit a crime, with her crying out that she wished for death due all the problems she was facing. Upon hearing this, Carr grabbed her by the arm and began walking towards the ravine, asking her if she was ready to die. The girl pleaded for her life, but to no avail. When he reached a gutter, Carr pulled out the stolen razor and began slashing the right side of her neck, across the jugular vein, making a wound that was 10 inches long and 2 inches deep. Fox's las words were supposedly \\"Farewell, Tom! Oh! I didn't think you could serve me so.\\" He then proceeded to make between 10 or 12 more cuts on her neck, one on the hand and a final on the breast. After letting some of her blood spill in the gutter, Carr raised the now-deceased Louisa and kissed her three times. After leaving the body, Carr started going up the hill, considering cutting his throat near a white oak tree, but then deciding to go back in Sewellsville with a gun and kill Mrs. Hunter. He saw that he was being chased, due to the fact that Willie had informed his father of the deed. Carr began knocking on every door he came across, asking the owners politely if they had any guns so he could \\"kill a rabbit\\", before finally arriving at the house of a Mr. Young, whose wife finally gave Thomas a gun. After arming himself, cut through the woods and began walking on the same road on which he had followed Louisa, feeling weakened and walking slowly, as he had not eaten anything. He then saw a group of people surrounding the murder site and looking for him. Carr noticed that a lot of people were coming in and out from the Fox residence, and decided to take a look. After passing by several of the posse, cocking his gun and preparing to shoot at any time, Carr got lucky and each of them passed by him. When he finally got to the kitchen window, he saw Louisa's body being dressed up by the doctors. He immediately felt that he should go kiss her and shake her hand, but had to wait as there were still people inside. Continuing to observe the people entering and leaving, he saw Louisa's body, remarking that she was \\"looking very pale; but [he] thought her's [sic] was the most beautiful corpse [he] ever saw.\\" However, despite feeling utterly miserable, Carr decided to hide away in the nearby bank until the morning. Arrest Around dawn of the following day, Carr came out of the bank and returned to his hiding place, deciding to observe for a while. He contemplated going back to the house and seeing Louisa's body again, but was afraid that there would be too big of a crowd and that they would see him. So instead, he decided to get his handkerchief and tie up his gun, placing it on a rafter and putting the muzzle to his heart. He then arranged a string that, when pulled, would pull the gun toward him and kill him instantly. He jerked his hand and the bullet was lodged into his breast, to the left of his heart. Carr fell on his back, and began checking if the bullet had come out of him or not, which it hadn't. After this, he got up and walked over to the spring 30-40 yards from there, and had a drink. Soon after, the heard somebody (the Foxes) screaming \\"Murder! Murder! Murder!\\", and immediately upon hearing this, Carr grabbed the stolen razor and began cutting his throat, before jabbing it straight into his windpipe, almost severing it completely. Due to how fast the blood was flowing out, he fainted. He survived, however, and was immediately taken to court. Trial, sentence and death In June 1869, Carr was tried and found guilty of murdering Louisa Fox, being sentenced to death for the crime. His lawyer lodged an appeal, and during this time, Carr tried to kill himself again by cutting one of his veins open. On the day of his execution, Carr was ready to die. While waiting in his cell, he was visited by two girls who were enamored with him. He gave them a photograph and some silver rings, and asked them to remember him, which they promised would do. After being put on the scaffold, he began saying prayers and singing hymns, asking for God to receive him after he dies. He then made a long speech, telling his life story and how he was harshly disciplined as a child, and that the future generations should not be like him. He blamed most of his confessed murders on his heavy drinking, saying the following: After finishing with a short prayer for the many crimes in his life, the trap door was opened. Carr's neck wasn't immediately broken, but he slowly strangled and soon died. After physicians pronounced him dead, his body was buried in the local pauper's lot in St. Clairsville. His execution was the first legal execution ever carried out in the county. Legitimacy of confessions Some people expressed doubts about Carr's confessions about other murders prior to his execution. He declined to indicate any dates, and some of his statements had even been disproven. For instance, he claimed that he had somehow shown the police where John H. Burns was hiding after killing Montonie, but this was false, as many of Burns' workmen testified that he hadn't hid at all, and was arrested while at work. And concerning the Ulrich murder, he claimed that he had mashed the man's head with a stone, while Justice Johnson noted that the skull wasn't broken, except for the part where Eisele had struck it with the hatchet.

Portrayed by Patricia Greene since 1957, Writers for the show paired Jill with Phil Archer (Norman Painting), with their marriage lasting until Phil's death in 2010. Along with fellow cast member June Spencer who plays Peggy Woolley, Greene is one of the world's longest serving actor in a soap opera, in any medium. In 2018, Jill was featured in 38 of the show's almost 300 episodes for the year and continues to play a prominent role in the show. Jill's storylines often revolve around the core Archer's family. The official BBC calls the character a \\"loving but controlling matriarch\\" who \\"rules the roost at Brookfield\\" and a \\"tough and determined mother. In her 60 years in the role, Jill has endured the loss of her husband, raising several children, campaigning for local issues, being arrested for throwing a flapjack during a protest and fighting plans to sell Brookfield. Bosses for The Archers have described Jill as a \\"lynchpin\\" and there would \\"always be stories\\" for her in the show. Britain's The Daily Telegraph has called Jill a \\"legend to millions of listeners\\".  Creation and casting  = Casting = When Patricia Honor joined the cast of The Archers in 1957, she was hired for six weeks playing Jill Patterson. The character was written to catch the eye of local farmer, Phil Archer, a widower who lost his wife Grace Archer in a barn fire in 1955. The BBC famously killed off the character to distract from the launch of ITV (TV network) as the first television competitor to the radio station. Greene recalls the call sheet describing Jill as a \\"sexy blonde\\", so she \\"vamped it up\\" and did an imitation of actress Fenella Fielding. \\"Unfortunately, I got the job,\\" Greene joked in an interview with Radio Times. In an interview with the BBC upon her 60th anniversary with the show, Greene says she was told the character was a ‚Äúsexy, blonde in a tea tent‚Äù. Patricia Greene's first words as Jill, which appeared in the same episode, were, ‚Äúand now I‚Äôll show you the fifteenth use to which this very versatile little household gadget can be put‚Ä¶‚Äù The producers enjoyed the chemistry between Painting and Greene, and extended her contract upon Jill's final episode. Then editor, Godfrey Baseley, told Greene: \\"Congratulations! Forget the sex; you're going to marry him!\\" In 2017, Greene was paid ¬£16,000 for her work on the show. = Longevity = In the 1980s, BBC management had considered killing off large numbers of characters, or the show altogether. Greene recalls she was one of those in \\"jeopardy\\". \\"Norman Painting was writing scripts. And he used to come back from story conferences and say ‚ÄòJill and Phil are off. We‚Äôre going to farm in Guernsey.‚Äô And I thought: ‚ÄòGreat! I can get back to theatre work.‚Äô But we survived.\\" On another occasion, bosses reprimanded the actress for using profanities and acting out sex scenes in theatre productions. \\"The BBC top brass called me in and said: ‚ÄòWe hear you‚Äôre going to say the f-word and do sex scenes. Why?‚Äô Well, because I'm an actress.‚Äù Greene told the Radio Times she cannot imagine playing the role into her late 90s, like co-star June Spencer. She is driven to and from home on each recording day. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to tell you, but I am 86. And I should miss it terribly. I don‚Äôt usually get emotional about storylines but I‚Äôm a bit emotional doing this one I‚Äôm doing now.‚Äù Greene says she knows the character better than anyone else, and says \\"left to her own devices\\" she is a \\"businesswoman or some sort\\". \\"I know her better than anybody in the world,\\" she says. ‚ÄúIf she (Jill) goes into the pub she has a sherry and it‚Äôs not a sweet sherry, Peggy may have a sweet sherry, but Jill certainly has a dry sherry.‚Äù As part of her 60th anniversary, the show featured a comical storyline in which Jill is arrested for throwing a flapjack at a restaurant owner in protest over food waste.  Development  = Early years and motherhood = Jill Patterson was born on 3 October 1930. She arrived in Ambridge on 25 July 1957, when she caught the eye of Phil Archer at the local fete, opened by Humphrey Lyttelton. Phil, recently widowed, had snapped a photograph of Jill with his cine camera, and the two later dated. Initially, Jill told Phil she could never see herself marrying a farmer. But Phil persevered ‚Äì ringing her boss to ask for her address! About a month after they had met he asked her to marry him. Jill told him it was much too sudden but promised to think it over. She came back to Borchester to get to know Phil better and after some time she agreed to marry him. They would be no engagement and the wedding would be as soon as possible. Phil's mother, Doris, was rather wary of the match. Nevertheless, the couple were married in a quiet ceremony in a church in Crudley (where Jill was raised) on 16 November 1957. In 1958, the pair gave birth to twins, Shula and Kenton. The following year, Jill was pregnant again, and gave birth to a son, David Archer (Timothy Bentinck). She also would put on a brave face when a stained glass window was installed at the St Stephen's Church, in memory of Phil's late wife Grace Archer. Of her first few years on the show, Greene says she always thought of the character as being \\"damaged\\". The character at one point even told Phil: \\"The one thing I always dreamt of was a husband, a home and a family of my very own\\". \\"She was looking for roots,\\" Greene told the BBC in 2017. \\"Otherwise she surely wouldn‚Äôt have married him so quickly.\\" She also described Jill as an \\"outsider\\" upon her arrival. \\"She could ask questions about agriculture. She was really out of her element. She knew nothing of the countryside and she was suddenly thrown into this village\\". The couple later had another child, Elizabeth (Alison Dowling) in 1967, and the family moved into Brookfield Farm in 1969. Worryingly, Elizabeth is born with a narrow heart valve, but the newborn recovers after a series of operations. = Bringing up her children and opening a business = Jill supplemented the family income with a number of businesses, including a bed and breakfast, selling eggs and honey and opening a craft studio in 1978 with Jennifer Aldridge called Two Jays, built in a converted barn at Home Farm. But the business was not meant to be, and it closed within several months. Jill and Phil had to also deal with their children's respective partners. In 1984, Nigel Pargetter (Graham Seed) blundered into the couple's bedroom by accident, whispering 'tally-ho' and managed to drive off in someone's car by mistake. The couple became sole owners of Brookfield in 1986, but were forced by a capital tax bill to put some land up for sale. Jill was also uncomfortable when Elizabeth went out with Robin Fairbrother, the half-brother of Phil's first wife Grace. The relationship ended however when Elizabeth discovered Robin was married. Jill also battled with Ruth Archer (Felicity Finch) who was married to her son David. Jill's idea of a farmer's wife clashed with Ruth, after her daughter-in-law announced she was not going to be one to stay inside answering phones and baking cakes. Ruth also felt pressured to be like her mother-in-law, who fed the family with lemon drizzle cakes and large feasts. Jill was adamant it was the woman's role to be in-charge of the domestic chores. In the 1990s, Ruth offered to cook for Jill after feeling guilty she had done all of the housework. A suggestion of fish pie pleased Jill, but she turned her nose up at the idea once she found out it was store-bought. = Financial independence = Jill was also a firm believer in having her own money, that she had earned. She earned small amounts selling eggs and produce, but most of the work did outside the farm was voluntary, such as for Meals on Wheels, the WRVS and the WI. In the 1980s, Jill was only allowed an allowance from Phil, something that constantly frustrated her, especially when she had earned it herself. One scene between daughter Shula Hebden-Lloyd (Judy Bennett), Jill admitted she had already spent all of the money she earned from selling potatoes, even after Phil asked for it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing all the work,\\" she told her daughter. \\"When your father marches blithely in and announces that he‚Äôs off to the bank and can he have the potato money then I think it‚Äôs a bit thick.... Because I haven‚Äôt got it, I‚Äôve spent it, I thought it was quite legitimately my perks on top of the housekeeping.\\" = The over- sized family photo = As a golden wedding anniversary gift in 2007, Phil and Jill's children organised a family portrait photograph. It featured the couple's children (David, twins Kenton and Shula, and Elizabeth) and grandchildren (Pip, Josh, Ben, Dan, and twins Lily and Freddie). Ruth, Nigel and Alistair were also in it but Kathy, Kenton's partner at the time, was not included. Nor, was Meriel, his daughter in New Zealand. When it came to ordering the print Kenton made the error or ordering in inches when he thought it was in centimetres. As a result, the photograph was huge and its subjects almost life size. When Phil and Jill got the portrait home to Glebe Cottage, they found it was too big for above the fireplace. They decided the best place for it was by the staircase but then after a great effort to hang it, Jill decided it looked preposterous from the bottom of the stairs. It ended up on display in the conservatory. When Carol Tregorran moved into Glebe Cottage seven years later the giant photo was still there. At her request, Kenton removed it and stored it away. = Phil's death and becoming a widow = Phil's sister-in-law Peggy Woolley (June Spencer), his sister Christine Barford (Lesley Saweard) and Jill were on a jaunt together in February 2010. Upon their return home, Jill remarked about Phil having \\"his music on\\" and went to put the kettle on for the three of them. Then she stopped. And said ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Then Christine said ‚ÄúJill?‚Äù and they said ‚ÄúOh no‚Äù and ‚ÄúOh no, Phil‚Äù and Phil's quietly elegiac music played on. Painting had died the previous October, and The Times called his death \\"as gentle as the man himself\\". = Jill's mystery man revealed = In February 2019, Jill talks to her children about a man she has met at The Laurels. She has begun seeing Leonard Berry (Paul Copley), a \\"dapper man\\" who is a volunteer at the nursing home and works alongside Jill. She introduces Leonard to the children and talks about how they dance in the big room at the home. However, Jill has her doubts about the relationship, and she confides in Peggy about the fear of walking out with her new friend and introducing him to her children.

It made some short hops but was easily damaged. Design and development Mieczys≈Çaw Siegel, a schoolteacher from Skrynice near Lublin, designed and built his first aircraft in 1923. It was a simple, small and very light foot-launched glider. He made several brief lights, though contemporary reports do not make it clear if these were foot-launched or if the MS 1 was tethered like a kite. During these tests the fragile glider was often damaged and repaired but, late in 1923, Siegel's attention turned to its successor, the MS 2. The MS 1 was a wooden framed aircraft, unusually covered with a mixture of cardboard and wrapping paper. Its one piece, twin spar wing, mounted on top of the fuselage, was rectangular in plan out to a little over half span then became trapezoidal. Covered with paper stiffened with gelatin, it was wire-braced from the lower fuselage and from an inverted-V cabane strut over the fuselage. Wing warping rather than ailerons provided lateral control. The rectangular section fuselage tapered to the rear. Between the wings the upper and lower surface coverings were absent, opening a space which the pilot could sit, strapped to the glider on a bicycle seat, with his feet on the ground. He launched the MS 1 by running, taking the glider forward. The MS 1's broad chord, triangular tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and began not far aft of the wing trailing edge. It carried a single-piece elevator. Unusually, its long, rounded fin was under the fuselage and the trapezoidal rudder ran up to the fuselage top, just below the elevator. A pair of short skids, cross-braced and each mounted under the nose on a V-strut, together with the pilot's legs provided the MS 1's landing gear, assisted by the lower edge of the fin which doubled as a tailskid.

Contextual architecture contrasts modernist architecture, which value the imposition of their own characteristics and values upon the built environment. Contextual architecture is usually divided into three categories: vernacular architecture, regional architecture, and critical regionalism all of which also inform the complementary architecture movement.  Etymology  J√∏rn Utzon's Kingo Houses were modeled off of traditional Danish farmhouses The term contextualism is derived from the Latin , meaning to weave together or to join. The term was first applied to the arts and architecture by the aesthetician and philosopher Stephen C. Pepper in the 1960s, who originally coined the word as applied to philosophy.  History  The essential ideas of Contextualism in architecture long preceded the term's coinage. The Roman notion of genius loci, Renaissance decorum, and Beaux Arts tirer parti mirror modern definitions of contextualism. The 1920s development of Gestalt psychology, which investigated the ways in which independent parts could be combined to make a cohesive result, provided the intellectual foundation for the philosophy. Contextualism as applied to architecture was first championed in the 1960s by architect Colin Rowe as a reaction to modernist architecture, which valued universality and the projection of utopian ideals onto sites. Pushing back against the perceived failure of modernist buildings to adapt cohesively with their environments ‚Äì in particular with cities' historic buildings, Rowe advocated for architecture that was designed with a focus on existing in continuity with the surrounding features of the built and natural environments. Rowe notably advocated for the use of figure-ground diagrams as a method of understanding the existing features surrounding a site's surrounding environment. Contextualist philosophy experienced a revival later in the 20th century with the advent of the New Urbanism movement, which stressed \\"context-appropriate architecture\\" in urban design, particularly in the context of environmentalism.  Criticism  Contextualism, particularly in the decades following the 1980s, has faced criticism for its association with postmodernism and perceived conformism. Architectural pragmatist Rem Koolhaas' assertion \\"fuck context\\" served as an infamous rallying cry against contextualism. In 1988, while curating an exhibition on Deconstructivism at MoMA, architects Philip Johnson and Mark Wigley denounced the philosophy, stating \\"contextualism has been used as an excuse for mediocrity, for a dumb servility to the familiar.\\"  Notable examples  * Olympic Archery Range, Barcelona, Carme Pin√≥s and Enric Miralles (1992) * Water (Honpuku) Temple, Awaji, (Japanese: **E1-. *ME), Tadao Ando (1991) * City Gate (Valletta), Malta, Renzo Piano (2015) * Kingo Houses, Helsing√∏r, J√∏rn Utzon (1958)  References  Category:Architectural theory ","title":"Contextual architecture"},{"id":"59704373","text":"The Amazon () is a 1921 German silent film directed by Richard L√∂wenbein and starring Eva May, Rudolf Forster, and Olga Engl.

The theater with its Neoclassical facade, was designed by Giuseppe Lucatelli and inaugurated on 10 September 1797. Napoleon had recently visited the town in his conquest of Italy. Lucatelli painted some of the panels and medallions from the alcoves surrounding the main seating. In 1881, the theater was restored by Luigi Fontana, and rededicated to the native musician Nicola Vaccaj. The ceiling was frescoed to depict Apollo and the muses in Olympus. The former sipario or theater curtain depicted illustrious persons from Tolentino, including Francesco Filelfo and Niccol√≤ Mauruzi, burned during a fire in 2008.

It first flew in 1924 but had only a brief career. In 1925 an improved variant, the MS 3, flew briefly. Design and development Mieczys≈Çaw Siegel, a schoolteacher from Skrynice near Lublin, designed and built his first aircraft, the Speigel MS 1, in the school summer holidays of 1923. It was a simple, small and very light foot-launched glider. Over the next summer he built its improved successor, the MS 2. This retained the earlier glider's low cost paper and card covering over a simple wooden structure but was no longer foot launched, allowing a conventional cockpit. It also had a simpler wing and a more conventional, less vulnerable tail. Like its predecessor, the MS 2 had its high wing on top of the fuselage. The rectangular plan wing was built around two spars, covered with wrapping paper stiffened with gelatin. The forward spar was braced with a strut to the lower fuselage and the rear one by wire, allowing lateral control by wing warping as used on the MS 1. The cardboard covered fuselage had a rectangular section which tapered rearwards more strongly than that of the MS 1 and had an open cockpit overlooking the mid-wing. The MS 2's tail surfaces were all paper- covered, with a tailplane that was triangular as before but less broad in chord and mounted at mid-fuselage. It carried a one-piece, large area elevator. The fin was now conventionally on top of the fuselage, triangular in profile and with a rhomboidal rudder which gave the elevator clearance to move upwards. The MS 3 was a final development. It was broadly similar to the MS 2 but the wing strut was replaced by wire and the paper and card covering by fabric. There was no fin and it had new, cross-axle, wheeled landing gear. Operational history Both the MS 2 and MS 3 had short lives. At the first attempts to rope-launch the former, the wind dropped and it would not take-off with a pilot aboard. To please the crowd Siegel flew it empty, as a kite. It performed well several times, then destabilized and crashed to destruction. The MS 3's new landing gear proved a handicap, tending to sink into soft ground and making rope launches more difficult. Short hops were made with rope launches though it is not known if the rope was cleared. After its flying life ended in a crash it was repaired, then exhibited at an aeronautics show at Lublin. Variants ;MS 2: 1924 revision of MS 1. Slightly larger all round, new wing with rigid forward braces; new empennage. Rope launched so conventional cockpit. ;MS 3: 1925 revision of MS 2.

It is located in the comune of Montalcino in the province of Siena, Italy, within the Val d‚ÄôOrcia nature reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Geography  Castiglion del Bosco extends across 2,000 hectares, most of which comprises dense woodland and a wildlife hunting reserve. A portion of the property is used to grow organic crops, including 62 hectares of Sangiovese vineyards. Castiglion del Bosco contains a winery that mainly produces Brunello di Montalcino, and is one of the founding members of the Consorzio del vino Brunello di Montalcino. Massimo and Chiara Ferragamo became the owners of Castiglion del Bosco in 2003.  Production  The estate of Castiglion del Bosco extends 2000 hectares (5000 acres), of which 62 hectares (152 acres) are cultivate with Sangiovese grape to produce Brunello di Montalcino DOCG, the single vineyard \\"Campo del Drago\\" Brunello di Montalcino DOCG, the \\"Millecento\\" Brunello di Montalcino Riserva and the Rosso di Montalcino DOC..  Monuments  = San Michele Church = San Michele Church sits In the borgo of Castiglion del Bosco. It hosts the original fresco of Pietro Lorenzetti, Annunciazione dei Santi dating to 1345 AD. Pietro and his brother, Ambrogio Lorenzetti, belonged to the Sienese School that flourished during the late Middle Ages and foreshadowed the art of the Renaissance. = Medieval castle = The site also contains the ruins of the castle, which dates back to 1100 AD. Part of the tower and its walls, which were erected by the Cacciaconti di Trequanda family at the beginning of the XIII century remain visible.  History  Archaeological excavations of the estate at Castiglion del Bosco revealed that it has been occupied from as far back as 600 BC, with the Etruscans prizing its elevated position as a military outlook. In 1966 a group of archaeologists found presence of a Lombards village (6th - 8th century AD) as well as a Roman settlement from the Augustan age (tombs 1st century BC ‚Äì 1st century AD) Castiglion del Bosco‚Äôs castle was built in classic medieval style. The castle is certified for the first time in a tax document from the early 1200s as \\"Castellione Iuxta Umbronem\\". In1318AD Castiglion del Bosco was taken over by the Gallerani family‚Äì prosperous merchants who held public offices in Siena. It has been claimed that Cecilia Gallerani, was the subject of Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs painting ‚ÄúThe Lady with an Ermine‚Äù and a muse for the ‚ÄúMona Lisa‚Äù. Castiglion del Bosco also bears the imprint of other Sienese families, one of whom brought here the artistic talents of Pietro Lorenzetti, whose fresco Annunciazione ai Santi (1345 AD) still adorns the tiny church of San Michele, located in the central part of the Estate. In 1967, Consorzio del Brunello di Montalcino was established with Castiglion del Bosco as one of its founding members. The organization was created as a voluntary association of producers who regulate and control the quality of Brunello di Montalcino production. In 1966, it became one of the first Italian wines to achieve the DOC (Controlled Denomination of Origin) title and in 1980 earned the DOCG (Controlled and Guaranteed Denomination of Origin) status. Beginning in 2003, Castiglion del Bosco underwent a restoration project at the hands of new owners, Massimo and Chiara Ferragamo. Massimo Ferragamo is Chairman of Ferragamo USA and the youngest son of Wanda and Salvatore Ferragamo.

An MPA is a place where marine life can thrive under less pressure than unprotected areas, like underwater parks, and this healthy environment can benefit neighbouring areas. There are a total of 46 marine protected areas in the South African EEZ, with a total area of 5% of the waters. The target is to have 10% of the oceanic waters protected by 2020. All but one of the MPAs are in the exclusive economic zone off continental South Africa, and one is off Prince Edward Island in the Southern Ocean. People can take part in a wide range of non- consumptive activities in all of South Africa's MPAs, and some parts of some MPAs are zoned for limited consumptive activities. Some of these activities require a permit, which is a form of taxation. Definition The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) defines a marine protected area as: > A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated, and managed, > through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term > conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural > values. A marine protected area (MPA) is a protected area of sea or estuary. These areas can range from wildlife refuges to research facilities. MPAs restrict human activity for a conservation purpose, typically to protect natural or cultural resources. Such marine resources are protected by local, state, territorial, native, regional, national, or international authorities and differ substantially among and between nations. This variation includes different limitations on development, fishing practices, fishing seasons and catch limits, moorings and bans on removing or disrupting marine life. In some situations (such as with the Phoenix Islands Protected Area), MPAs also provide revenue for countries, potentially equal to the income that they would have if they were to grant companies permissions to fish.National Geographic Magazine, January 2011 As of August 2016 there are more than 13,650 MPAs, encompassing 2.07% of the world's oceans, with half of that area - encompassing 1.03% of the world's oceans - receiving complete \\"no-take\\" designation. Purpose and function If there is no defined long-term goal for conservation and ecological recovery and extraction of marine resources occurs, the IUCN does not recognise a region as a marine protected area. The purposes stated for declaring South African marine protected areas include: * Contribution towards a national and global representative system of marine protected areas by providing protection to benthic and pelagic ecosystems in various regions, including coastal habitats such as sandy beaches, rocky shores and estuaries offshore habitats such as soft sediment and reef systems, gravel, mud, sandy, and rocky habitats, shelf edge, submarine canyons and slope habitats, seamount and associated deep sea ecosystems, and open ocean pelagic habitats. * Providing protection for sites of special sensitivity and sites that are critically endangered * Providing large contiguous conservation areas, and links between inshore marine habitats with those further offshore, and providing contiguous conservation areas between marine, estuarine and terrestrial habitats. * Protecting threatened seabed ecosystems, such as mud habitats, untrawled rocky shelf habitat and untrawled shelf edge areas. * Conserving and protecting the biodiversity and ecological processes associated with these ecosystems, including threatened seabird species, threatened fish species and economically important invertebrate species. * Providing an appropriate environment for research and monitoring of ecosystem health and biodiversity * Contribute to sustainable marine and coastal ecotourism by zonation for activities which yield socio-economic benefits and protecting and promoting scenic areas and their eco-tourism opportunities * Facilitating fisheries management by protecting spawning grounds and spawning stock, nursery,foraging, aggregation and refuge areas, allowing stock recovery, and improving abundance in adjacent areas for overexploited species , linefish and sharks; * Facilitating sustainable use of linefish, rock lobster, abalone and intertidal resources * Protection the biota or specific species and the environment, biodiversity and ecosystems that support them, including vulnerable benthic habitats, tropical and cold water coral reefs, canyons which are coelacanth habitat and important migratory corridors for seabirds, turtles, sharks and other fish * Providing reference sites and environments for research and monitoring, including areas in good ecological condition and areas which may be indicators of impacts of climate change, and allowing for research on ecosystem impacts and recovery, and habitat requirements of economically important species * Protecting areas of important cultural heritage, including archeological middens and fish traps, South African National Heritage sites and World Heritage sites. * Conserving and protecting a fossilised forest. MPAs have been shown to protect biodiversity and stocks of economically important marine organisms, and are also considered to protect cultural heritage, provide educational and recreational opportunities, provide sustainable employment, and stimulate tourism, and may assist with resilience to climate change. =Planning= Planning scenarios for site selection analysis include seabed protection, pelagic biodiversity, threatened species, sustainability of small pelagic and demersal trawl fisheries, inshore, offshore and crustacean trawl bycatch management, a range of sector-specific analyses exploring areas where spawning or nursery grounds can be protected, as well as integrated analysis of all targets for all objectives including minimising and spreading impact on industry. Scenarios also considered industry targets and spreadimg the impact fairly, and the impact on rights holders who operate in fixed areas such as diamond mining and petroleum extraction. In recent planning, areas were considered in combination, with a recommendation to implement several new MPAs as a set, as this would speed up the process and allow a spatially efficient network that meets multiple combined objectives and minimises cumulative impact on industry. This plan was followed with the 2019 set of mostly offshore MPAs. History Several early MPAs were declared in terms of the Marine Living Resources Act, 18 of 1998, and they are currently declared through the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 2003 The South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) was established by marine scientists who in 1947 recognised the unique character of the northern Zululand coast, which was later described as the Delagoa inshore ecoregion. The Oceanographic Research Institute (ORI) recognised that protection was necessary for effective conservation and in collaboration with the Natal Parks Board (now Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife), established the St. Lucia Marine Reserve which was proclaimed in 1979, followed by the proclamation of the Maputaland Marine Reserve in 1986. These are now consolidated in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, which was proclaimed as South Africa‚Äôs first World Heritage Site in 1999. After nearly 20 years of work the Aliwal Shoal Marine Protected Area was proclaimed in 2004, along with the Pondoland Marine Protected Area, at the time the largest of South Africa's MPAs, and several others. By 2018, South Africa had 25 formally declared Marine Protected Areas, of which 24 are in the coastal waters of the continental territory, and one is in the waters of the Prince Edward Islands in the Southern Ocean. On 24 October 2018, 20 new MPAs were approved by Cabinet, and were proclaimed by the South African government on 24 May 2019 This increased the area of the continental protected areas to 5%. To comply with the goals of the United Nations, another 5% of South African oceanic waters must be protected by 2020. Extent The coastal MPAs constitute 0.43% of the continental EEZ, and 0.16% of the EEZ is no-take zone. Offshore ecosystems are the least protected ecosystems of territory under South African management. Legislation * Marine Living Resources Act, 18 of 1998 * National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 10 of 2004 * National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act, No. 24 of 2008 * National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 2003 =Management= The South African Constitution makes the national government responsible for protecting the environment. This is delegated to the Department of Environmental Affairs, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, such as CapeNature, City of Cape Town (CoCT), Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency (ECPTA), Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (NMBM), South African National Parks (SANParks), and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife. South African coastal MPA‚Äôs are usually attached to a terrestrial national park or nature reserve, and the management of that park or reserve also manages the MPA, funded by the national government via the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). Zonation Zonation of marine protected areas in South Africa is classified by the Marine Living Resources Act and the National Environmental Management Act. An MPA may be divided into one or more types of zonation. Restricted and controlled areas are common. ;Restricted area: :Also known as a no-take zone, is a part of a marine protected area where extraction and harvesting of any marine and plant life is prohibited. ;Controlled area: :Also known an open area, is a part of an MPA where extraction and harvesting of marine life is allowed but restricted to specific activities, species, and catch limits, and other commercial activities, subject to a specific permit, basically a form of taxation, issued for that activity for a specified time period, usually a year. These activities include spearfishing (on breathhold), angling, scuba diving, snorkelling for mollusc extraction, boating, commercial diving, salvage operations, commercial fishing, whale watching, shark cage diving or filming. ;Wilderness area: :Part of a marine protected area where no fishing may take place, but ecotourism activities that do not affect wilderness characteristics and attributes may be authorised. ;Sanctuary area: :Part of a marine protected area where no fishing or any other activity contemplated in terms of section 48A(1) of the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act, No. 57 of 2003 may take place, except for scientific research purposes. This prohibits fishing, collection or destruction of any fauna or flora, dredging or extraction of mineral materials, discharging or depositing any waste or pollutants, disturbing, altering or damaging the natural environment or water quality, removing seawater, conducting any activity which may adversely affect the ecosystem, constructing any building or other structure, marine aquaculture, bio- prospecting, sinking any platform, vessel or structure, prospecting for or extracting fossil fuels. List of MPAs The listed MPAs were individually proclaimed. Some were later consolidated with adjacent MPAs and may not still be generally referred to by the original name. * (Nelson Mandela Bay, Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, 2019) * (South of Cape Agulhas, Western Cape, 2019) * (South of Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, 2019) * (South of Cape Agulhas, Western Cape. 2019) * (KwaZulu-Natal, 2004) * (South Coast, KwaZulu-Natal, 2019) * Amathole (2001) * (East London, Eastern Cape, 2019) * (West of Saldanha Bay, Western Cape,2019) * (Western Cape, 2000) * (Eastern Cape, 2004) * (South of Cape Town, Western Cape, 2019)( * (West of Cape Columbine, Western Cape, 2019) * Castle Rock Marine Protected Area, previously known as the Millers Point Marine Reserve, now part of Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area (Western Cape, 2000) * (West of Namaqualand, Western Cape, 2019) * (Western Cape, 2000) * (Eastern Cape, 2000) * (Western Cape, 2000) * (Western Cape, 2000) * (Eastern Cape, 2000) * (KwaZulu-Natal) * (North Coast, KwaZulu-Natal, 2019) * (Western Cape, 2000) * (Western Cape, 2000) * (Western Cape, 2000) * (KwaZulu-Natal, 2000) * (Western Cape) * Mkambati (2000) * (Off Kleinzee, Namaqualand, Northern Cape, 2019) * (Off Namaqualand, Northern Cape, 2019) * (Off Port Nolloth, Northern Cape, 2019) * (Eastern Cape, 2004) * (Offshore of Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, 2019) * (Southern Ocean, 2013) * (South Coast, KwaZulu-Natal, 2019) * (Cape Town, Western Cape, 2019) * (Western Cape, 2000) * (Eastern Cape, 2000) * (Western Cape, 2000) * (South of Knysna, Western Cape, 2019) * (South of Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, 2019) * (Western Cape, 2008) * (Western Cape, 2004) * (Eastern Cape, 2000) * (Eastern Cape, 2000) * (KwaZulu-Natal, 2019) * (Western Cape, 2001, seasonal) =Proposed= * (West of Doringbaai, Western Cape) (proposed?) * (South of Struisbaai, Western Cape) (proposed?) Protection The 2019 proclamation of 20 new marine protected areas extended protection for the first time to51 previously unprotected ecosystem types. This reduced the number of unprotected ecosystem types from 47% to 13%. The quality of protection is variable. Insufficient area of some ecosystems is protected. In other cases legal and illegal fishing, waste water discharge and other pressures degrade the protection. Improvements in governance are urgently needed, including developing and implementing management plans, better financing, and improving liaison end compliance.

They encompass the body of expressive culture associated with the fields of folklore and cultural heritage. Tangible folk art includes objects which historically are crafted and used within a traditional community. Intangible folk arts include such forms as music, dance and narrative structures. Each of these arts, both tangible and intangible, was originally developed to address a real need. Once this practical purpose has been lost or forgotten, there is no reason for further transmission unless the object or action has been imbued with meaning beyond its initial practicality. These vital and constantly reinvigorated artistic traditions are shaped by values and standards of excellence that are passed from generation to generation, most often within family and community, through demonstration, conversation, and practice. It is these cultural artifacts, both tangible and intangible, that become the purview of the folklorist and cultural historian. They seek to understand the significance of these cultural forms within the community by studying their creation, transmission and performance, through which the values and structure of the community are expressed. It then becomes important to document these traditional acts and their meaning. Both community members and outsiders need to be educated as to the importance of these traditional objects and actions within the life of the community. And finally, the celebration of these arts needs to become an active demonstration and statement for the members of this community.  Performance folk arts  In addition to tangible folk art objects, there is a second broad category of which includes intangible arts forms such as folk music and folk song, folk dance and various kinds of narrative structures. This category is part of the performing arts. These intangible folk art forms only became grouped as such in the second half of the 20th century, when the two terms \\"folklore performance\\" and \\"text and context\\" dominated discussions among folklorists. Performance is frequently tied to verbal and customary lore, whereas context is used in discussions of material lore. Both formulations offer different perspectives on the same folkloric understanding, specifically that folklore artifacts need to remain embedded in their cultural environment if we are to gain insight into their meaning for the community. The concept of cultural (folklore) performance is shared with ethnography and anthropology among other social sciences. The cultural anthropologist Victor Turner identified four universal characteristics of cultural performance. These are playfulness, framing, using symbolic language and employing the subjunctive mood. In performance the audience leaves the daily reality to move into a mode of make- believe, \\"what if\\". That this fits well with all types of verbal lore, music, and movement, where reality finds little footing among the symbols, fantasies, and nonsense of traditional tales, proverbs, and jokes is self-evident. Customs and the lore of children and games also fit easily into the language of a folklore performance. * Children's folklore * Game studies * Folk dance * Folk music * Folk song * Game studies  Supporting organizations  The United Nations recognizes and supports cultural heritage around the world, in particular with the IOV International Organization of Folk Art, in partnership with UNESCO. Their declared mission is to ‚Äúfurther folk art, customs and culture around the world through the organization of festivals and other cultural events, ‚Ä¶ with emphasis on dancing, folk music, folk songs and folk art.‚ÄùUNESCO Mission Statement By supporting international exchanges of folk art groups as well as the organization of festivals and other cultural events, their goal is promote international understanding and world peace. In the United States, the National Endowment for the Arts works to promote greater understanding and sustainability of cultural heritage across the United States and around the world through research, education, and community engagement. As part of this, they identify and support NEA folk art fellows in quilting, ironwork, woodcarving, pottery, embroidery, basketry, weaving, along with other related traditional arts. The NEA guidelines define as criteria for this award a display of ‚Äúauthenticity, excellence, and significance within a particular tradition‚Äù for the artists selected. (NEA guidelines) .‚Äù In 1966, the NEA‚Äôs first year of funding, support for national and regional folk festivals was identified as a priority with the first grant made in 1967 to the National Folk Festival Association.

It lives mainly in the Atlantic Ocean, but can also be found in the Indo-Pacific ocean area. This species is an ambush predator and hunts by burrowing its whole body in soft sediment on the ocean floor and waits until nearby prey is picked up on one of its sensor antennae. It is also equipped with sharp teeth-like structures to strike prey. It displays a wide range of colors from black to purple to metallic on its shell. It lives in typically warmer waters and often hunts either burrowed in a stationary place or among coral reefs. Eunice aphroditois is also known as the bobbit worm or Bobbitt worm. The name is taken from the John and Lorena Bobbitt case. It is sometimes called the sand striker. Description Eunice aphroditois has a hard exoskeleton covering its body. The largest known specimen on record reached in length. Despite these great lengths, these worms are quite slim with width of the body only about across the back. These ambush predators have two eyes and five antennae on their head that are used to sense prey when hunting in soft sediments. The mandibles can be retracted inside of its body and are responsible for striking and stunning its prey and are capable of snapping some in half. Typically, E. aphroditois color ranges from deep purple to black along with metallic color as well. The fourth antenna is always white. Habitat This species has been found in the mainly warmer parts of select bodies of water such as Indonesian and European waters. They are often found prowling among coral reefs due to their ability to blend in and hunt in very tight places because of their slim body. This also goes along with the abundance of marine life that lives in these reefs that they prey on. They also have a relatively wide range of habitats. The species spends most of their time in sandy and muddy sediments as well as around rocks and sponges. Among the greatest depths, the bobbit worm has been recorded to live on the seas floor at ten to ninety-five meters. =Diet and foraging= By their antennae, the bobbit worm senses the passing prey and snaps down on the prey to drag them into its burrow using its mouth. Some fish exhibit mobbing behavior to reduce predation risk, in which a group of fish will direct jets of water into the bobbit worm's burrow to disorient it. However, any quick strike by the mandibles of the worm can leave the fish stunned while also injecting a certain level of toxins. Life cycle It is believed the lifespan of E. aphroditois is relatively short, ranging from three to five years in age. Their life cycle starts when conceived after spawning. Their eggs are often eaten or destroyed by other organisms. Parents take little or no responsibility for raising their offspring. Most of the class Polychaeta are benthic sexual reproductive animals and lack external reproductive organs. When mating, female polychaetes produce a pheromone that attract the males to automatically release sperm and when this takes place, in return it then also allows females to give away eggs into the water. They use a technique called \\"broadcast fertilization\\" or \\"spawning\\", which means the males and females eject their sperm and eggs into the open water to fertilize and colonize within their environments. There is no need for contact between the males and females during this action for fertilization to occur.

Retrieved January 18th, 2019. where she also serves as Pro-Director for Research and Development. She is a leading educational researcher in the UK, with her research centering on work transitions, apprenticeships, vocational education and training, and workplace learning.  Biography Before joining University College London, Alison Fuller served as Director of Research and Head of the Lifelong Work-Related Learning Research Centre at the Southampton Education School of the University of Southampton. She then joined the Institute of Education of the University College London in 2013.  Research Alison Fuller's research focuses on work transitions, apprenticeships, vocational education and training, and workplace learning. A frequent academic collaborator of hers is Lorna Unwin (University College London). Already in the 1990s, Fuller and Unwin argued in favour of a reconceptualization of apprenticeships based on a reconciliation of learner-centred and transmission approaches to pedagogy, challenging the perceived superiority of a formal education taking place only in educational institutions.Fuller, A., Unwin, L. (1998). Reconceptualising apprenticeship: exploring the relationship between work and learning. Journal of Vocational Education & Training, 50(2), pp. 153-173. Face to wide variation in UK apprentices' experiences with seemingly similar programmes, Fuller and Unwin co-operated with a range of enterprises to perform case study research on their apprenticeships. As a result, they developed the concept of expansive-restrictive continuum to characterize the differences in apprenticeship and highlight how apprenticeships' quality is mediated through participation, personal development and institutional arrangements, with important lessons for the UK's Modern Apprenticeship programme and the integration of organizational and personal development.Fuller, A., Unwin, L. (2003). Learning as apprentices in the contemporary UK workplace: creating and managing expansive and restrictive participation. Journal of Education and Work, 16(4), pp. 407-426.Unwin, L., Fuller, A. (2004). Expansive learning environments: integrating organizational and personal development. In: Fuller, A., Munro, A., Rainbird, H. (eds.). Workplace learning in Context. London: Routledge, pp. 142-160. Arguing that the Modern Apprenticeship programme was being undermined by a lack of employer demand and commitment and resulted in poor outcomes, Fuller and Unwin have moreover been critical of public plans to expand the programme as a means of social inclusion.Fuller, A., Unwin, L. (2003). Creating a 'modern apprenticeship': A critique of the UK's multi-sector social inclusion approach. Journal of Education and Work, 16(1), pp. 5-25. In research with Unwin, Phil and Heather Hodkinson, Karen Evans, Natansha Kersh and Peter Senker, Fuller highlights the significance of workers' biographies for workplace learning, arguing that the latter is framed by (i) workers' prior knowledge and skills, (ii) workers' habitus, (iii) workers' individual dispositions, and (iv) the existence of a workplace community as a locus of identity.Hodkinson, P. et al. (2004). The significance of individual biography in workplace learning. Studies in the Education of Adults, 36(1), pp. 6-24. By contrast, the concept of legitimate peripheral participation,Lave, J., Wenger, E. (1991). Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press. as developed by Lave and Wenger, is inadequate to conceptualize workplace learning in modern workplaces due to its outdated portrayal of workplaces in advanced industrial societies and of the institutional environments in which people work, which strongly influence the opportunities and barriers employees encounter with regard to workplace learning.Fuller, A. et al. (2005). Learning as peripheral participation in communities of practice: a reassessment of key concepts in workplace learning. British Educational Research Journal, 31(1), pp. 49-68. Together with Unwin, Alan Felstead, David Ashton, Peter Butler and Tracey Lee, Fuller makes the case for a conceptualization of learning as a form of participation, wherein individual performance at work can be substantially enhanced by social relationships and mutual support, a perspective ignored by the prevailing metaphor of \\"learning as acquisition\\".Felstead, A. et al. (2005). Surveying the scene: learning metaphors, survey design and the workplace context. Journal of Education and Work, 18(4), pp. 359-383. Finally, Fuller and Unwin have challenged the picture of a linear trajectory for apprenticeships wherein older employees mould novices into experts, where expertise is equated with experience.

He was a part of the Watauga Association and is most known for founding the city of Morristown, Tennessee. Biography Gideon Morris was born in Randolph County, North Carolina around 1756. Records from North Carolina state that Morris moved to the Watauga Settlement with an unspecified amount of siblings. In 1775, Morris signed the Watauga Petition to annex Watauga to North Carolina. Records also stated that Morris served in an expedition against Native Americans in the fall of 1775. In 1778 Gideon Morris appeared in court and swore an oath of allegiance. Lands were granted by the State of North Carolina to Morris in Washington, Greene and Hawkins counties. He most likely settled on parts of these grants either in 1787 or 1791, which was included in Jefferson County and now in Hamblen County. The settlement founded by Morris has, as far as is known, always been called Morristown. No known records exist demonstrating land grants in the area to anyone aside from Gideon and his extended family. Jefferson County possesses a record of the results of the execution of Morris' will, which includes property deeded to his son John Morris in 1817 for a 400-acre tract of land originally granted to Gideon by the state of North Carolina, and presumably comprising only a portion of the original grant due to the known size of the Morris family at that time. Morris lived on that tract of land until his death in 1798. Morris is buried in Morris Cemetery in Morristown, Tennessee. A Tennessee state historical marker stands near the cemetery to commemorate the founders of the town. Legacy Morris' settlement of Morristown would be included in the new state of Tennessee in 1796 and would be incorporated in 1855. The town became the county seat of the newly formed Hamblen County in 1870.

However, he praised Cage's performance, writing: \\"With him, the movie isn‚Äôt just watchable, it‚Äôs occasionally riveting. ... Cage plays even the blandest pulp material with soul and gusto, as though the pathetic grudges of a petty criminal were the stuff of epic drama\\".

A columnist for El Mundo newspaper, he was killed by ETA.  Biography  L√≥pez de Lacalle was born during the Spanish Civil War in a family living in the periphery of Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, in the Basque Country. At a young age started working in the paper industry. Despite having little formal education he became a voracious reader thanks to the company of a group of Basque intellectuals. He was a friend of Enrique M√∫gica Herzog (later Spanish Ministry of Justice), who introduced him to the Communist Party of Spain at the end of the 1950s. On 23 August 1966, during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, he was arrested with the accusation of \\"illegal association\\". He spent 5 years in the Carabanchel Prison. After the Spanish transition he was a leading negotiator for the workers' commission and the general manager of the Ugarola industrial co-operative. He left the Communist Party and approached the Socialist Party of the Basque Country. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate of Spain as an independent. He was always critical of Basque nationalism, violence and terrorism of ETA. He retired early and became a columnist for El Mundo. After ETA killed Miguel √Ångel Blanco he participated in 1998 to the creation of the civil association Foro Ermua. = Threats and killing = L√≥pez de Lacalle argued that life of citizens, politicians and journalists in the Basque County was always under the threat of terrorism. He himself was threatened many times and his house was hit by Molotov cocktails. On 7 May 2000 at 9.45 am, while he was going back home after buying newspapers and having breakfast two members of ETA who were waiting for him near his home shot him four times in the chest and at the head, killing him. Funerals were held on 9 May in the church of Saint Martin in Andoain, in the periphery of San Sebasti√°n. 2000 people participated. = Protests against ETA = After his death thousands of people protested against ETA and more that one hundreds directors of news outlets signed a manifesto called \\"No nos callar√°n\\" (They will not shut us up), condemning ETA violence. The next year Reporter Without Borders asked the European parliament to pass a resolution confirming the resolution of the European Union against terrorism in the Basque County. According to RSF more than 100 journalists were being threatened by the ETA. = Investigation and arrests = On 11 December 2002 Jos√© Ignacio Guridi Lasa was condemned to 30 years of prison as the material executor of the killing. In 2009 Javier Garc√≠a Gaztelu, alias Txapote, was condemned for having ordered the killing. The same year Asier Arzallus, who is accused of having participated in the killing, was transferred from France to Spain.

It was documented by Granville O. Haller.  Background  On August 20 1854, the Ward Massacre saw a number of settlers travelling along the Boise River killed by natives from the Shoshone tribe. 21 settlers were attacked by the Winnas (variously spelled Winass or Winnass) band, who had tried to steal their horses; after one native was shot with a revolver, the natives killed nearly all of them and captured the rest. Settlers in Western Oregon called for retribution, and Governor George Law Curry raised an army of volunteers in response; however, as winter was then setting in, the expedition was called off. That January, Isaac Stevens and Joel Palmer signed treaties with several tribes in the Willamette Valley, but the United States did not ratify them; this angered the natives further, and moreover, no treaty was obtained with the Shoshone. Haller eventually undertook the expedition to seek out the Winnas band members who were deemed murderers by the Oregon population; in addition to the 56 soldiers brought by Haller from Fort Dalles, 39 settler volunteers and a handful of Nez Perce and Umatilla people joined.

It is distributed all across the Western Atlantic.  Ecology  Living on and within the sediments of mangrove trees, this fiddler crab has an ecological importance. The fiddler crab influences the structure and biology of the sediment through foraging and by constructing burrows for defense. The fiddler crab, Uca thayeri, influence bacterial assemblages in the sediment surrounding the mangrove trees they inhabit by decreasing bacterial diversity through foraging. While foraging, these fiddler crabs divide out the individual sediment grains with their spoon-tipped setae. This division of sediment grain allows for the bioturbation of sediments which allows oxygen penetration at depth and remineralization of organic matter. Fiddler Uca vomeris, a related member to the Uca thayeri.  Reproductive behaviors  Perhaps the most widely studied aspect of the mangrove fiddler crab is its unique reproductive behavior. When studied broadly, the U. thayeri resembles a \\"broad front\\" fiddler crab, which describes the spacing of the eye stalks. This appearance, usually indicates that the individual crab would have resource-based mating system, while in fact, the mangrove fiddler crab exhibits the opposite, which is a resource-free mating system. This switch in behavior has been best described as an evolutionary convergence of reproductive behaviors between the \\"broad\\" and \\"narrow\\" front crabs. Another aspect to the reproductive behavior of U. thayeri is the hatching time of larval crabs in relation to the tide. In this species, it has been determined, regardless of whether the tides are semi-diurnal or mixed, larval crabs will be released after high tide, when the light-dark cycle and tidal amplitude are most favorable for high survivorship of the larvae. Size matters with this species. In a study by Bezzarra and authors, the relationship between size of the crab carapace and fecundity, amount of offspring produced at a potential mating season. This relationship that was analyzed, was that there was a positive correlation, meaning that the larger the carapace, the more offspring that the female fiddlers would be able to have. This idea also relates with sexual maturity. In the mangrove fiddler crab, to determine sexual maturity in both the male and female crabs, the size of the male cheliped and the female abdomen controls it.  Distribution  Globally, Uca thayeri, is distributed in the Western Atlantic around the subtropical mangroves in Ubatuba, State of S√£o Paulo, and Brazil. Within the mangrove trees themselves, Uca thayeri is euryhaline and is able to survive in a salinity from 4 to 32. This mangrove fiddler crab is also reliant on the substrate quality, such as: pebble/sand/silt/clay balance, organic matter availability, and the abundance of seagrass. Another factor that the mangrove fiddlers are dependent on in their distribution is temperature. During the warmer months of the year, the population is more pronounced and more widely distributed compared to the colder months of fall and winter.  Visual system  In the eyes of mangrove fiddlers, exist a simple system used to detect light and even decipher between different colors. The existence of two visual pigments, one that has a peak absorption at 430 nm and the second between 500 - 540 nm, is the source of their visual prowess.

It was formed in June 2006 by experts in access to information, with the aim of promoting the right of access to information in Europe. Access Info is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization. The core of Access-Info Europe raison d'√™tre is the belief that access to information is a basic human right, and the idea that this is critical for participatory government decision-making and accountability.  Issues  Primary issues include transparency in the European Union; civil liberties; leak handling; right to information; open government; and commercial transparency. EU transparency involves reform of access to EU documents, transparency in the EU legislative process, citizen participation in decision- making, and commercial transparency. Civil liberties includes the implications of anti-terror laws. Leaks involves training for investigative journalists and legal support over controversies. Commercial transparency opens access to commercial information and transparency of media ownership  Access Info Europe v. Council of the European Union  On December 3, 2008, Access Info Europe applied to the Council to request access to documents on a policy proposal concerning a regulation of the European Parliament and other documents in the European Union. Access Info applied under Regulation No 1049/2001. The Council responded by making public only part of the requested document and withheld portions that disclosed the positions expressed by Member States. The Council invoked Article 4(3) of the Regulation that governs disclosure exceptions. It explained that such disclosures would have undermined the Council's decision-making process. On February 26, 2009, the Council sent Access Info an unregistered letter stating additional reasons for its response. Access Info said that it did not receive the letter until April 3, via email. Access Info then applied to the European Court of Justice on June 3, within the 2 month time limit allowed by the Regulation. The appeal came within 2 months of the email notification, but more than 2 months after the February date. The Court decided that the time limit had not expired. The Court further decided that the exceptions provided in Article 4 of the Regulation must be applied in a restrictive way. The Court stated that the public has the right to know how decisions are taken in this field and that this should be subject to public oversight. According to Global Freedom of Expression, the Court decision established a binding/persuasive precedent within its jurisdiction. The Court reasoned that any exceptions to the public's right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents must be strictly applied, to protect the public right of access. It further ruled that the purpose of Regulation No 1049/2001 is to give the public the widest possible right of access to information.

They are also known as Hydra viridis and Chlorohydra viridissima. Green hydra are typically 10 mm long, and they have tentacles that are about half of their length. They feed on small crustaceans and are strictly carnivorous. Typically they feed on small crustaceans, insects and annelids. Hydra viridissima is often known as the green hydra, the species appears green because of the symbiotic relationship with Chlorella vulgaris, which is a green alga that lives within the organism. Hydra are normally sessile and live on aquatic vegetation. They secrete mucous to attach using their basal disc. For movement, the individual will extend and contract with a mixture of muscle movement and water (hydraulic) pressure. The hydraulic pressure is created inside the digestive cavity. Tiny cells line the digestive system that have flagella; this creates a current to draw water into the digestive cavity. This can extend the length of the body column.  Movement  Even though Hydra are sessile, they can can move in short bursts. They can detach their basal disc from the substrate and move to a new location by gliding or by \\"somersaulting\\", which they do by detaching the disc then bending over and over using the tentacles to push over when they rotate around. They will repeat attaching and detaching until they are at the desired location. They also move by floating upside down. The basal disc produces a gas bubble which carries it to the water surface to move.  Anatomy Hydra are multi-cellular organisms. They are made up of two layers of epithelial cells and have a hypostome or mouth opening. Circling the mouth are tentacles that contain nematocysts or stinging cells to help in prey capture. The mouth and tentacles are called the hydranth. The rest of the Hydra is known as the column and is divided into four sections: the gastric section (between the tentacles and first bud), budding section (which produces the buds), the peduncle (between the lowest bud and basal disc), and the basal disc (foot- like structure). Hydra are diploblastic organisms, the body is composed of two embryonic cell layers; the ectoderm and the endoderm. The endoderm lines the gastrovascular cavity, which is a water-filled sac, this acts as a hydroskeleton and site for food digestion. They also have a simple nervous system that consist of a nerve net that covers the entire body.  Symbiosis  H. viridissima is currently the only known Hydra species that has a permanent symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic unicellular Chlorella algae. These algae are located in the endodermal epithelial cells which are enclosed by an individual vacuolar membrane, which enclose inorganic and organic molecules for storage. There are many cells that make up the endodermal epithelium on each cell there is usually 20‚Äì40 individual algae organisms. The algae supply nutrients through photosynthesis to the Hydra. Because the algae live in the vacuoles of the cells, they are protected from the digestive enzymes of the Hydra. During long period of darkness, such as storms or blooms that block sunlight, algae loss starts from the tentacles, hypostome and growth region. But when light conditions return the algae undergo a rapid multiplication and can repopulate the host in approximately two days. Chlorella undergo asexual reproduction which is in correlation with the division of the host. The Hydra regulates the population of the Chlorella algae by digesting excess algae or controlling algal cell division.  Growth pattern  Hydra are capable of escaping death by renewing their body tissues. Mortality rates are extremely low and there have been no signs of decline in reproductive rate.  Toxicity  Hydra cannot be found in impaired water due to their low tolerance to pollution. They can be used to rank toxicants on level of potential hazard. The simple tubular body and diploblastic membranes, all of the epithelial cells are in constant contact with the environment, this allows for toxic substances being exposed to all body surface. Harsh metals and high levels of those metals can cause mortality. One advantage of being able to reproduce asexually is that they can still reproduce successfully during times where there are high levels of harsh metals.  Reproduction  Hydra are typically hermaphroditic or gonochoric. Uniquely to Hydra, the medusa stage is absent and only the polyps will reproduce sexually and asexually. H. viridissima will reproduce sexually when temperatures have warmed to at least 20 ¬∞C, typically this falls between May and June. Larger species will produce both ovaries and testes, while smaller individuals only develop testicles. Sexual reproduction can be seen as a strategy to survive during times of low nutrients and other unfavorable conditions. H. viridissima has three sexes: female, male, and hermaphrodite. Simultaneous hermaphrodites are dominant during the growing season. It is thought that female gonads need a longer period of inductive conditions for production, that means that there is a scarcity of females in most populations. During the summer months, specifically in Poland Lemna bloom occurs that reduces light attenuation which reduces photosynthesis efficiency of the Chlorella algae, this influences the asexual behavior. Even though during the beginning of the mating season for the Hydra, all the individuals are sexually active, asexual reproduction is the main strategy for reproduction. This behavior of interference of asexual and sexual reproduction allows population growth to continue throughout all conditions. When the Hydra reproduces asexually, buds will be produced that attach to the body wall. The buds are genetically identical clones of the parent. When they are mature they will break free. The parent can possess several buds that are at different stages of development at the same time. The bud once detached from the parent will float until they find some hard substrate to attach to.

It has been heavily exploited for agricultural use as an effective biopesticide, having been frequently cited as an alternative biological control agent in the regulation of fungi-induced plant diseases. They are endosymbionts associated with plant root tissues, exhibiting mycoparasitism and promoting plant growth due to their capacity to produce different secondary metabolites. Trichoderma koningii is a species belonging to the genus Trichoderma. Fungi in this genus are able to adapt to different ecological niches and can colonize their habitats effectively, allowing them to be powerful antagonists and biocontrol agents. Typical of Trichoderma species is having a fast growth rate and the production of green or hyaline conidia on a branched conidiophore structure. History and taxonomy Trichoderma koningii was first described by the Dutch mycologist Oudemans in 1902 as one of the species in the microbial flora he obtained from a nature preserve in The Netherlands. After the genus was erected in 1794, there was difficulty in distinguishing and identifying the different species apart due to their very similar morphological characteristics. It wasn't until 1969 that a concept of classification was proposed by Rifai to reduce confusion on the taxonomy of Trichoderma. He recognized T. koningii as one of the nine \\"aggregates\\" or groups of species in the genus. This aggregate consists of 12 species within three lineages that have similar morphology as the \\"true\\" T. koningii but can be differentiated from each other by their phenotypic characters and geographic distributions. In 1991, Bissett divided the genus into five sections to classify the species on the basis of the branching of conidiophores. He included T. koningii in Trichoderma sect. Trichoderma. In 2004, Chaverri and Samuels proposed another taxonomic classification based on molecular phylogenetic analysis. T. koningii and its aggregates were included in the T. viride clade. Growth and morphology Brown, wrinkled stromata seen in some Hypocrea species. The conidiophores of T. koningii are branched and organized in a pyramidal structure with longer branches at the base that progressively shortens as it nears the tip. Primary and secondary branches arise in a right-angle degree and are often symmetrical on either side of the node along the main axis. Phialides are usually in 3-4 whorls that arise from the tip of the main branch and from lateral branches at intercalary positions on the conidiophore. Some phialides on widely-spaced branches are flask- shaped, resembling a wine bottle, whereas some tend to have a very swollen middle when in dense clusters or \\"pseudo-whorls\\". T. koningii typically produces smooth and ellipsoidal (egg-shaped) conidia, with a mean length of 4.1-4.3 ¬µm, that aggregates in a slimy green mass at the tip of the phialides. The chlamydospores are pale brown, globe-like in shape, and are located at terminal and intercalary positions on the hyphae. In culture, colonies display rapid growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA), as cream-coloured in the beginning but later turns green because of sporulation. T. koningii grows at an optimum temperature of 25 ¬∞C in darkness, producing white mycelium with a radius of 50‚Äì60 mm. During conidial production, colouration first begins at the centre then later spreads outward in dark or dull green concentric rings that are vague to noticeable. Maximum temperature for growth is observed at 33 ¬∞C, which reduces their pathogenic potential in humans. Like most Trichoderma species, this fungus has a sexual state. The teleomorph, Hypocrea koningii, is characterized by cushion-shaped stromata (sing. stroma) that are broadly attached to the surface of a substrate but are free at the margins. The surface of the stroma appears slightly-wrinkled. Mature stromata are brown to brownish-orange, whereas the young ones have a tan color with villi sprouting from the surface. These short hairs are lost during development. Perithecia (fruiting bodies) are elliptic, 160-280 ¬µm long and 100-185 ¬µm wide. The perithecial neck has a length of 53-90 ¬µm. Asci (sing. ascus) within the fruiting bodies are typically cylindrical, with dimensions of 60-70 x 4-5.7 ¬µm and thickening at the apex. The ascospores of H. koningii are hyaline and fill up the ascus in a single row. They are initially bicellular but have become separated into part-ascospores. The proximal part of the ascospore is ellipsoidal while the distal part is globe-like and longer. Physiology Trichoderma koningii is employed as a biological control agent because of its mycoparasitic and antagonistic ability. This fungus is capable of biosynthesizing silver nanoparticles, volatile organic compounds and secondary metabolites such as trichokonins, koninginins, and pyrones. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are produced via the reduction and capping of Ag+ to Ag0 by the enzymes and proteins released by T. koningii. Koninginins are substances capable of inhibiting the process of inflammation. Koninginins isolated from T. koningii are identified to be A, E, F, L and M (KonA, KonE, KonF, KonL, KonM). Trichokonins are peptaibols that exhibit antimicrobial property. Other polyketides reportedly isolated from T. koningii are Trichodermaketones A-D, 7-O-Methylkoninginin D, and 6-pentyl alpha pyrone which can inhibit the germination of other fungal spores. T. koningii is also reported to produce calcium oxalate crystals, particularly weddellite, via biomineralization. The process occurs intracellularly and extracellularly with respect to the fungus. The intracellular process involves the vegetative growth of the mycelium. The extracellular activity occurs through the reaction between the calcium in the environment and oxalic acid secreted by the fungus, leading to the production of biomineral species. Habitat and ecology Typical of Trichoderma, T. koningii is a good colonizer of its habitat. Saprophytic growth occurs in acidified soils and soils with high water content (i.e. chernozem, podzol). It is often isolated from under pine and coniferous trees, vegetation, plantations, grasslands, marshes, swamps, and peats. T. koningii also thrives in other environments, including growing on decaying wood, in marine species, estuarine sediments, and in mines and caves. The fruiting bodies commonly grow on tree bark and stromata tend to be scattered, often solitary than in clusters. It is distributed widely in Europe, the United States, and Canada. Recent surveys have reported that some strains of T. koningii are also found to be present in New Zealand and South Africa. Applications = Agriculture = Trichoderma koningii are plant symbionts that induce resistance against fungal pathogen attack and stimulate growth. It acts as a parasite to other fungi, particularly those that cause diseases to plants, by inhibiting their growth or attacking them directly. It is antagonistic to various plant pathogens such as Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), Sclerotium rolfsii, and Sclerotium cepivorum. It inhibits the growth of Ggt by releasing its microbial compounds. It colonizes the rhizospheres to interact with the roots of seedlings and plants, preventing S. rolfsii from damping-off the seedlings before they can germinate. T. koningii antagonizes S. cepivorum by acting as a secondary colonizer of the infected plant roots and secreting enzymes that cause the degradation and lysis of the pathogen. = Medicine = Several studies have described the ability of T. koningii to produce enzymes that exhibit antifungal and antibacterial properties. Koninginins bear similar structural elements as flavonoids and vitamin E. They can inhibit the process of inflammation caused by snake bites. They can block the effects of myotoxins and induction of edema because they can inhibit phospholipase A2, one of the proteins found in venoms. AgNPs produced using T. koningii are recognized as alternatives to antibiotics and are tools for gene delivery and drug delivery. They also show antagonism against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively Candida albicans and Salmonella typhimurium.

A competent organizer and strategist, she was one of the founders and principal figures in New York's Norwegian Suffrage League. She contributed effectively to the American suffrage cause after Norwegian women were granted voting rights in 1913. As a painter, she participated in Oslo's national art exhibition in 1890. Biography Born on 5 May 1867 on an estate in the municipality of Inder√∏y, Gudrun L√∏chen was the daughter of Herman L√∏chen, a parliamentarian, (1822‚Äì1876) and Anna Margrethe Jenssen (1826‚Äì1911). The family's 10th child, she was born at a time when her parents were not as prosperous as they had been earlier. After her father died when she was nine, she lived with various relatives, receiving private tuition while living with an uncle in Trondheim until he too experienced economic difficulties. By contrast, her brothers were able to pursue their studies in Christiania (now Oslo). She also moved to the capital later, living with her mother-in-law while studying painting with Erik Werenskiold, Christian Krogh and Hans Heyerdahl. While in Christiania, she met the successful chemist Viggo Beutner Drewsen (1858‚Äì1930), whom she married in 1887. Gudrun L√∏chen Drewsen (right) leading Norwegian-born suffragettes in New York (1911) In 1894, the family moved to New York where she was initially occupied as a housewife and a mother. In 1902, the Norwegian women's rights activist Fredrikke Qvam asked Drewsen to represent Norway at the Washington Suffrage Conference. After speaking at the conference and meeting the leading figures there, she went on to become the internationally recognized coordinator of Norwegian-American interests in the women's movement. Drewsen proved to be an efficient organizer and strategist, recruiting new members, planning signature campaigns and participating in demonstrations on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. By 1911, she had founded and become president of New York's Norwegian Suffrage League which marched under the banner \\"Voters from Norway\\" as a result of the limited voting rights Norwegian women had achieved in 1907. From 1913, when Norwegian women were granted voting rights, Drewsen became even more effective. After American women obtained voting rights in 1920, she retired to Larchmont, New York. After her husband's death in 1930, she moved to live with a daughter in San Francisco where she died on 16 May 1946.

She also served as the president of the Society for Freshwater Science from 2016 to 2017.  Education and early career  Bernhardt received her Bachelor of Sciences degree in biology with a minor in chemistry from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in 1996. Her love for nature, including hiking in the Appalachian Mountains, as well as many research experiences as an undergraduate (including an REU at University of Michigan Biological Station) inspired her to become an ecologist. Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest where Bernhardt conducted her dissertation research. In her final year at UNC, Bernhardt was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to pursue a PhD at Cornell University, co-advised by Cornell faculty Bobbi Peckarsky and Institute of Ecosystem Studies director Gene Likens. Bernhardt conducted her dissertation research at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, in New Hampshire, USA, studying how headwater streams modify watershed nutrient export. Bernhardt also conducted research in Venezuela and Chile during her graduate career. While presenting a poster at the Ecological Society of America conference, Bernhardt met her future postdoctoral advisor, Bill Schlesinger, who was a professor at Duke University at the time and offered her a position on the spot. As a postdoc, Bernhardt continued to work on nitrogen cycling, however, this time focusing in the rooting zones of pine trees in poorly drained soils rather than in streams. She returned to working in aquatic systems as a postdoc in 2002, organizing the National River Restoration Science Synthesis under guidance from Margaret Palmer and Dave Allen which resulted in a highly-cited publication in the journal Science. As a postdoc in Palmer's lab, Bernhardt also organized the Ecological Society of America's \\"Visions\\" project which identified future priorities for ecological sciences in the 21st century, stating that \\"Ecological knowledge can and must play a central role in helping achieve a world in which human populations exist within sustainable ecological systems\\".  Career  Bernhardt became a professor at Duke University in 2004 in the Department of Biology, and as of 2019, has mentored 15 graduate students and 11 postdocs while at Duke. Broadly, Bernhardt and her lab members research how ecosystems retain and transform elements and energy and how these ecosystem processes may be changing as the result of human activities. The ecosystems that Bernhardt studies include both aquatic and terrestrial systems, and her lab strives to make their research applicable to \\"political, legal and regulatory discussions about the protection and management of ecosystems\\". = Stream ecosystem function = Bernhardt started studying stream ecosystem function beginning in graduate school, when she examined how headwater streams modify watershed nutrient export at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, and she has continued to work on questions related to stream ecosystem function throughout her career. Bernhardt and colleagues synthesized over 37,000 stream restoration projects across the US to identify the common elements of successful restoration projects finding that on average greater than one billion US dollars are spent on stream restoration each year since 1990. Most stream restoration projects are small in scale and cost (~$45k) but poorly reported, and collectively, these small projects' costs are greater and their impact is broader than higher-cost projects, and Bernhardt and colleagues urged for better effort to collect and disseminated data on small restoration projects. Leveraging long-term datasets at Hubbard Brook and other sites, Bernhardt and her colleagues have studied the effects of climate change and whole-ecosystem experimental treatments on watershed nitrogen export. Bernhardt and colleagues have leveraged a network of in situ sensors and created a database for hosting open-access stream sensor datasets to address questions relating to stream ecosystem function. There work has primarily focused on variation and patterns of stream metabolism across hundreds of U.S. streams, but plan to expand to measure and host data from streams globally. = Mountaintop coal mining = A mountaintop removal mining site. Funded by the National Science Foundation from 2014 to 2017 and from the Foundation for the Carolinas, Bernhardt and her colleagues have studied the impacts of mountaintop removal mining with valley fills (MTMVF) on stream ecosystems. Mountaintop removal mining uses explosives to remove up to 400 vertical feet of mountain to expose underlying coal seams for extraction and excess rock is dumped into nearby valleys where headwater streams reside. It's estimated that nearly 1,800 miles of headwater streams have been buried by mountain top mining since 1990. Bernhardt's research showed that the extent of surface mining in West Virginia catchments was highly correlated with stream sulfate concentrations and ionic strength, causing biological impairment when only 5.4% of a stream's contributing catchment is occupied by surface coal mines. In 2005, 22% of West Virginia's regional stream network length drained catchments with >5.4% of their surface area converted to mining operations. Bernhardt and colleagues have also shown that mountaintop removal mining can have significant impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, for example, they estimate that previously forested mine sites would take around 5,000 years for a hectare of reclaimed mine land to sequester the same amount of carbon that is released when the coal is extracted and burned. Bernhardt's lab has also used trace elements found in fish otoliths as biogenic tracers to track coal ash contamination in affected lakes, marking the first time that strontium isotope ratios have been used to track coal ash's impacts in living organisms. Bernhardt wrote an article for PBS in which she explained what Clean Coal is and some of the myths behind clean coal, ending with an urge to use the label 'clean energy' more sparingly. = Scientific training and culture = In addition to writing about scientific results, Bernhardt also writes about scientific career trajectories, academic training, science culture, and work- life balance in academic positions across many career stages. In an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Bernhardt and co-authors urge scientists to prioritize intellectual curiosity, societal impact, and creativity rather than focusing only on traditional academic success metrics (e.g. H-index). As president of the Society for Freshwater Science, Bernhardt wrote an essay titled \\"Being Kind\\" which was featured in the journal Nature. In this essay, Bernhardt addresses two issues surrounding the Society for Freshwater Science 2017 annual meeting, 1) concerns of the meeting being held in North Carolina after the state passed the controversial Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, and 2) reported incidents from Society for Freshwater Science members in which senior scientists said unpleasant of hurtful things to junior members at annual meetings. Bernhardt expresses her disgust of both issues and offers her thoughts on how to amend the culture within the Society for Freshwater Science, focusing on a quote that was popular on Twitter stating, \\"Everyone here is smart, distinguish yourself by being kind.\\" Bernhardt goes on to reflect on specific instances in her career when her mentors and colleagues expressed kindness to her and how those acts impacted her graduate school experience and career trajectory. She encourages everyone to counteract implicit biases by being kind to everyone with whom we interact, ending the essay with an unofficial and aspirational motto for the 2017 SFS meeting of \\"Everyone here is smart and kind\\".

Edmund Kranner died when Henry was three years old. Henry was born and raised in Vienna, where he lived with his mother and her second husband, until the family immigrated to the United States in 1939. Fiss was drafted into the United States Army on his 18th birthday, in 1944. He served with the 9th Army Air Force, landing in Europe on V-E Day, May 8, 1945. In October 1945, he was assigned to the Palace of Justice shortly before the start of the Nuremberg Trials. Fiss served as Chief of Documentation for the American prosecution, responsible for translation, analysis, and security of materials used during the course of the trials. He served as the interpreter during the interrogation in which Rudolf H√∂ss admitted to being directly responsible for the deaths of two million Jews in the Holocaust. He also translated Alfred Rosenberg's handwritten diary, which was used in evidence during the trials. He was discharged from the Army in 1946, after which he studied English at New York University‚Äôs Washington Square College. Upon his graduation in 1949, he moved to California to work as a news writer and editor for KCBS radio in San Francisco. However, his German accent prevented him from advancing in his career, and he returned to New York to work in his family‚Äôs business. Fiss received his doctorate in psychology from New York University in 1961. From 1963 to 1969, he was in charge of the sleep research lab at the Research Center for Mental Health at NYU, one of the first sleep research laboratories in the United States. During this time, he collaborated with George S. Klein on a series of experimental sleep and dream studies. A pioneer in the field, Dr. Fiss was principal investigator of one of the first government-funded grants in the field of sleep and dream studies. He was a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine and director of the Psychology Division in the Department of Psychiatry from 1973 to 1993. Fiss was also an American Board of Professional Psychology Diplomate in Clinical Psychology and a clinical psychologist, practicing individual and family therapy in West Hartford, Connecticut.

Filmography Staats engaged in filmmaking at an early age. His first production, in 6th grade, was a LEGO-mation shot on 8mm film. He made the move to digital film during collaboration with brother Jae Staats, co-founder of the Almost Famous Film Festival (A3F) which ran from 2005-2010. His work in independent and later professional filmmaking began in 2011 at Holden Village, an isolated retreat center in the Washington Cascades. From 2012-14 he produced Monitor Gray, a short science fiction film based on three short stories he wrote in high school and college. In 2013, Staats filmed and produced Chasing Asteroid 1998 QE2 for the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), documenting their observations of this near-Earth interloper. In 2017, Staats returned to SAAO, producing a short film about the first detection of merging binary neutron stars as a fully multi-messenger event. In the fall of 2013 he was awarded his first contract with LIGO, the gravitational-wave observatory. LIGO, A Passion for Understanding is a 20-minute documentary film completed in April 2014. Subsequent NSF and university funding was provided for LIGO Generations in 2015, and LIGO Detection in 2017. LIGO Detection is distributed by the National Science Foundation's educational content library Science360, and related films are available at the LIGO multimedia archive. Produced in 2015-16, I am Palestine is a short documentary that shares the stories of Palestinians who once lived side-by-side with Israeli neighbors in what is now a place with an uncertain, conflicted future. The film enjoyed screening at eight film festivals, winning awards at the NYC Indie Film Awards, Best Shorts Competition, and Best Short Documentary at the 2016 Cabo Verde International Film Festival. In collaboration with Dr. Paul M. Sutter, Staats produced Song of the Stars, a film of the one-time live performance of a modern dance that tells the story of the first stars in the universe.

An explorable explanation (often shortened to explorable) is a form of informative media where an interactive computer simulation of a given concept is presented, along with some form of guidance (usually prose) that suggests ways that the audience can learn from the simulation. Explorable explanations encourage users to discover things about the concept for themselves, and test their expectations of its behaviour against its actual behaviour, promoting a more active form of learning than reading or listening.  Definition  The term \\"explorable explanation\\" was first used in passing by Peter Brusilovsky in a 1994 paper, but did not enter into common use until 2011, when Bret Victor published an eponymous essay (the essay included an explorable explanation of a digital filter). Victor distinguishes explorable explanations from isolated interactive widgets and visualizations by the fact that they deliberately guide the attention of their audience towards particular phenomena within the simulation. In characterizing the concept, Victor explains: > Explorable Explanations is my umbrella project for ideas that enable and > encourage truly active reading. The goal is to change people's relationship > with text. People currently think of text as information to be consumed. I > want text to be used as an environment to think in. Some of the ideas Victor espoused in the essay occurred to him while during work with Al Gore on the app version of the 2009 book Our Choice. He had proposed that the app should contain interactive models, but this idea was rejected on the basis that all numerical values proposed regarding climate change needed to have a citation, and the interactive models would generate un-cited numbers. The term has since also been characterized as being about learning through play. The related term \\"active essays\\" was used by Alan Kay to refer to text-based explorable explanations, and a major goal of Squeak (the precursor to Scratch) was to allow for the creation of them. A few video games may be considered explorable explanations. For example, Sim City uses a complex city simulation that is intended to present issues that appear in real-world urban planning. Many other games in the simulation genre have a similar intention, although with many it is not a necessity that the simulation be scientifically accurate. In the puzzle genre, games such as Miegakure and Incredipede also involve interacting with systems with the intention of learning. Video games may not involve explanatory text or narration. Educational video games have an overlap with explorable explanations. They are similar in that both involve a computer simulation that is visualized, and both have the intended goal that the audience learns something. However, in an educational video game, the simulation is not necessarily a simulation of the game's intended learning content. Instead, learning content in educational video games is usually put in a non- interactive form such as text or voiceover; the educational game then usually has some schedule whereby the audience alternates between seeing the text and, separately, playing a game, usually a game with mechanics from a standard genre, such as a platformer. Explorable explanations are also distinct from gamification, which has the stated intention of improving the structure of rewards in learning. An explorable explanation may or may not involve rewards, and most involve none.  History  Board games such as The Landlord's Game (the precursor to Monopoly) involve a simulation and so can be described as analogue precursors to explorable explanations. The PLATO computer system, which predates the personal computer, was the first platform for what would now be called explorable explanations Many explorable explanations predate the popular use of the phrase. For example, the Plato system, a computer-assisted instructional system created in 1960 depicted to the right, used interactive examples to teach concepts to students. In 1996, Mitchel Resnick created an explorable explanation of emergence using Conway's Game of Life as an example. The target audience for explorable explanations has historically been limited by available software distribution platforms (although some have been made for specific museums, without any intention of wider distribution, including some created by Karl Sims). Due to the fact that explorable explanations have not previously been successfully monetized, physical media such as CD-ROMs could not be considered. Since the 2000s, explorable explanations have become more common, because of widespread internet access and increased computer graphics possibilities within web browsers, for example via SVG, WebGL, and HTML5 canvas API. This allows complex simulations to be accessed instantly and shared on social media. Wikipedia has some examples of basic explorable explanations.  Subject matter  The most prevalent examples of explorable explanations concern topics within mathematics or computer science. There are numerous explanations of concepts within statistics and machine learning as well as of specific algorithms. Explorable explanations have a bias towards focusing on these topics, and when the subject matter comes from disciplines of empirical science, there is a tendency to focus on quantitative models from within the discipline. This is true even in the case of explorable explanations about disciplines where quantitative models are less common, such as social science. The bias is due to the fact that explorable explanations involve a programmed simulation which is required to follow a consistent mathematical model or formal system. Jonathan Blow has argued that this requirement forces subject matter to be dealt with more rigorously than other mediums such as speculative fiction. Additionally, since the simulation requires a visualization, there is a certain bias towards subject matter close to geometry. For example, there are at least three explorable explanations about special relativity including A Slower Speed of Light.  Use in media  Explorable explanations are increasingly being created by journalists, sometimes by organisations that formerly focused on print news media and radio. In 2015, FiveThirtyEight collaborated with The Marshall Project to produce an article on prison parole assessment that included a explorable explanation of the effects of policy changes on prison populations. The article was cited by the Columbia Journalism Review as an example of how explorable explanations could be used to advance digital storytelling. Newsgames may be considered explorable explanations. Other newsrooms such as Bloomberg Businessweek, The New York Times, and The Guardian are also notable for their use of explorable explanations to tell stories, for example covering topics like climate change, drug overdoses, and economics. FiveThirtyEight has also used explorable explanations to cover topics such as gun violence and p hacking. Structure Screenshot of a Phet simulation, intended for use in a classroom. Since they do not involve a physically-present teacher to guide the user's interaction, most explorable explanations instead provide guidance using explanatory text. Explorable explanations can differ widely in the kind of \\"guidance\\" that they give regarding how to interact with and think about their simulations. In some cases, guidance is intended to come from teachers in a school setting; this is the approach advocated for using PhET Interactive Simulations created by Carl Wieman, and they have been found to be an effective complement to traditional chalk and talk lessons. Most explorable explanations provide guidance using prose. This is the approach used in several explorable explanation creation platforms, including Observable created by Mike Bostock. Some others use voice-over narration.

History  The station was opened in 1859 on the Deeside branch by the Aboyne Extension Railway and at first its services were operated by the Deeside Railway.Canmore - Lumphanan railway station Later it became part of the GNoSR and at grouping merged with the London and North Eastern Railway. It stood 23.75 miles (38Km) from Aberdeen and 19.5 miles (31 km) from Ballater. It was closed to passengers on 28 February 1966. The line has been lifted and sections form part of the Deeside Way long distance footpath. Infrastructure The 1966 BRB Closure notice. The 1963 timetable. The station was of a very unusual design with a passing loop lying to the west of the original single platformed station and platform as shown on the 1866 OS map. At this date an overbridge divided the station from the passing loop and provided direct access to the nearby Learney Arms Hotel.Aberdeenshire LXXXIII.6 (Kincardine O'Neil) Survey date: 1866 Publication date: 1867 A small goods station was present with a loading dock served by the only siding. Two buildings stood within the goods yard that was accessed from near the aforementioned hotel. No signal box is marked. The 1899 OS map shows considerable change with the old overbridge removed and a new one built to the west at Bridge Street with a signal box next to it and a short siding beyond. The passing loop was extended to run through the now two platformed station and a new expanded goods yard with a goods shed built. Several sidings, storage sheds and a crane are marked. The old loading dock site became the new platform. A pedestrian overbridge is shown at the east end of the down platform, a second signal box beyond and a short siding slightly further on.Aberdeenshire, 083.06, Surveyed: 1899, Published: 1900 The ticket office, toilets and waiting room were situated on the up platform, very similar to other stations on the route such as Lumphanan, consisting of a rough-cast and brick built single-storey structure, with round-headed windows at the front and a central covered area. The shelter on the down platform was a typical GNoSR design with wooden slatted sides. A building that may have been the station master's house stood just to the east of the main station building. The station was host to a LNER camping coach in 1937 and 1938. Services The line was chosen to trial the battery multiple unit and once introduced on 21 April 1958 the train service was doubled to six trains a dayRailway Magazine June 1958 p. 419 and in addition a Sunday service was reinstated.Railway Magazine June 1958 p. 382  The site today  The platform and station buildings have been demolished however the name 'Station Road' survives as does Bridge Street Bridge. The Royal Deeside Railway is located at Milton of Crathes some distance down the line towards Aberdeen.  References  Sources Johnston, James B. (1934). Place-Names of Scotland.

It is approved in the United States as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for ALL in pediatric and young adult patients aged one month to 21 years. Calaspargase pegol is an engineered protein consisting of the E. coli-derived enzyme L-asparaginase II conjugated with succinimidyl carbonate monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (pegol). The L-asparaginase portion hydrolyzes L-asparagine to L-aspartic acid depriving the tumor cell of the L-asparagine it needs for survival. The conjugation with the pegol group increases the half-life of the drug making it longer acting. The most common (incidence ‚â• 10%) grade ‚â• 3 adverse reactions are elevated transaminase, increased bilirubin, pancreatitis, and abnormal clotting studies. History In December 2018, calaspargase pegol-mknl was approved in the United States as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in pediatric and young adult patients age one month to 21 years. Approval was based on a demonstration of the achievement and maintenance of nadir serum asparaginase activity above the level of 0.1 U/mL when using calaspargase pegol-mknl, 2500 U/m2 intravenously, every three weeks. The pharmacokinetics of calaspargase pegol-mknl were studied when administered in combination with multiagent chemotherapy in 124 subjects with B-cell lineage ALL. The FDA approved calaspargase pegol-mknl based on evidence primarily from two clinical trials (Trial 1/NCT01574274 and Trial 2/AALL07P4) of 237 subjects with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The trials were conducted in the United States and Canada. Trial 1 enrolled subjects 1 to 20 years old who were recently diagnosed with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma. Subjects received calaspargase pegol-mknl or pegaspargase (a drug that helps convert asparagine to other substances) as part of a combination of drugs used for treatment of ALL. The trial had 2 phases. Subjects received calaspargase pegol-mknl or pegaspagase intravenously on Day 7 of the first phase. Subjects received either calaspargase pegol-mknl intravenously every 3 weeks for 10 doses or pegaspargase intravenously every 2 weeks for 15 doses during the second phase. The benefit of calaspargase pegol-mknl was assessed by measuring the activity level of asparginase in the blood on Days 7, 11, 18, 25, and 32 of the first phase and comparing it to pegaspargase. Trial 2 enrolled subjects 1 to 18 years old who were recently diagnosed with high-risk ALL. Subjects received one of 2 doses of calaspargase pegol-mknl or pegaspargase intravenously as part of a combination of drugs used for treatment. Subjects received calaspargase pegol-mknl or pegaspargase on Day 4 of the first phase and Days 2 and 22 of the second phase. Subjects received up to 12 doses of calaspargase pegol-mknl or pegaspargase intravenously depending on the bone marrow response. The benefit of calaspargase pegol-mknl was assessed by measuring the concentration of drug in the body over 25 days (AUC) and the maximum amount of drug in the blood after a single dose (Cmax). The AUC and Cmax of calaspargase pegol-mknl were compared to pegaspargase. Calaspargase pegol-mknl received FDA orphan drug designation. The approval was granted to Servier Pharmaceuticals LLC.

Lerio lost his first and only bout in the Olympics against Rafael Lozano of Spain. His coach was dismissed from his position due to ordering Lerio to mix it up with his opponent despite leading four points with 17 seconds left in the bout. He later turned pro and was the last Filipino who competed in the Olympics to do until Mark Anthony Barriga in the mid-2010s. As a professional boxer, he and his younger brother Roberto were handled by Todd Makelim. In May 2008, Lerio's record stood at 14-2-1 with three knock-outs following his one round knockout of Matt Meredith in New South Wales, Australia. Danilo Lerio retired from boxing in 2012.

The operation aimed at conquering several towns in Western and Central Equatoria, most importantly Yei, which served as strongholds for the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and helped the Sudanese government to supply its allies, the Ugandan insurgents of the WNBF and UNRF (II) based in Zaire. These pro-Sudanese forces were defeated and driven from Zaire by the SPLA and its allies, namely Uganda and the AFDL, in course of the First Congo War, thus allowing the SPLA launch Operation Thunderbolt from the Zairian side of the border. Covertly supported by expeditionary forces from Uganda, Ethiopia, and Eritrea, the SPLA's offensive was a major success, with several SAF garrison towns falling to the South Sudanese rebels in a matter of days. Yei was encircled and put under siege on 11 March 1997. At the same time, a large group of WNBF fighters as well as SAF, FAZ, and ex-Rwandan Armed Forces soldiers was trying to escape from Zaire to Yei. The column was ambushed and destroyed by the SPLA, allowing it to capture Yei shortly afterward. Following this victory, the South Sudanese rebels continued their offensive until 12 April, capturing several other towns in Equatoria and preparing further anti-government campaigns. The success of Operation Thunderbolt significantly strengthened the SPLA in Western Equatoria, and weakened the Sudanese government's control over its southern territories. The South Sudanese rebels were thus able to expand their operations, and raised global awareness for their cause. Furthermore, the WNBF and UNRF (II) suffered heavy losses during the offensive. Taken together with their defeats in the First Congo War, they were permanently weakened, and in case of the WNBF, effectively defeated as active fighting forces.  Background  = Civil war in Sudan = Sudan in 1994 Following its independence in 1956, Sudan had suffered from numerous internal conflicts over political, ethnic, and religious issues. In 1983, revolutionaries and separatists from the country's mostly Christian-Animistic south banded together and launched an insurgency against the government which was traditionally dominated by Muslim elites from the north. The rebels organized themselves as the \\"Sudan People's Liberation Army\\" (SPLA) under the leadership of John Garang, and the insurgency eventually escalated into a full civil war that also affected Sudan's east and west. Negotiations between the government and the SPLA almost resulted in a peaceful solution of the conflict, but ended after the 1989 coup d'√©tat which brought the National Islamic Front (NIF) under Omar al-Bashir to power. The new regime was militantly opposed to any compromise, and was determined to completely crush the SPLA and all other opposition groups. An escalation of violence followed. By 1991, the civil war had developed into a \\"network of internal wars\\" between the government and a multitude of rebel groups with widely diverging backgrounds and aims. Though the SPLA had grown in power and seized control of large parts of southern Sudan, it also suffered from internal disputes and had never enjoyed the support of the entire southern population. Many in the south had sided with the government or rebel groups that were opposed to the SPLA. The region of Equatoria, including the important town of Yei, was strongly contested between the SPLA and the SAF for several years. The SAF would control the towns, whereas the rebels held much of the countryside. In the 1990s first half, however, the government managed to regain some ground in the area, retaking several locations from the rebels. At the time, the South Sudanese separatists were weakened by internal divisions and the collapse of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, their most important foreign ally. By 1994, the SPLA main faction under Garang's leadership was on the verge of complete defeat. Parts of the rebel movement had split off, and some of these splinter groups (such as SSIM/A) had even allied themselves with the government. The SPLA did however manage to recover and regain some strength in the Equatoria area. This was also thanks to the resumption of support by Ethiopia in 1995. Though the country's old, pro-SPLA leadership had been overthrown during the Ethiopian Civil War, Ethiopia's new government under Meles Zenawi was undermined by Sudan, and consequently decided to aid the South Sudanese separatists. Bashir's regime also alienated its former ally Eritrea, so that the latter began to assist the SPLA from 1994. = The Ugandan-Sudanese conflict = Though Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni (pictured in 1987) intended to maintain regional neutrality and rebuild his war-ravaged country, his policies and reputation made him the enemy of Sudan and Zaire. The Sudanese government suspected that the survival of the South Sudanese rebels was dependent on support by the neighboring country of Uganda. This belief was not based on hard facts, but an assumed personal connection between SPLA leader John Garang and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. In truth, the two barely knew each other, and Museveni had intended to stay neutral in the Sudanese conflict. He repeatedly attempted to convince the Sudanese government of his non-involvement with the SPLA, and followed a policy of appeasement. This course yielded no results. The anti-Western, Islamist National Islamic Front government of Sudan regarded the Leftist, pro-United States government under Museveni as a natural enemy and supporter of the South Sudanese separatists. Furthermore, the Sudanese leadership intended to islamize the Great Lakes region, and in the context of this plan, mostly Christian \\"Uganda stood in the way\\". In an effort to topple Museveni's government, Sudan thus supported and even organized several Ugandan insurgent groups from 1986, though the extent to which these rebels actually followed Sudanese orders varied greatly. By 1996, the most important pro-Sudanese Ugandan rebel groups were the WNBF, the UNRF (II) (a WNBF splinter faction), the ADF, and the LRA/LSA. Though these groups were not strong enough to actually threaten the Ugandan government, they could undermine its legitimacy by attacking the Ugandan population and further damage the country's struggling economy. They were generally based in southern Sudan or eastern Zaire (present-day DR Congo), whose dictator Mobutu Sese Seko tolerated their presence out of enmity toward Museveni. The Ugandan President responded to the Sudanese and Zairean support for these rebel groups by ending his neutrality in 1993. Uganda started to aid, and then coordinate with the SPLA in their common struggle against Sudan, the Ugandan insurgents, and Zaire. Furthermore, the conflict along the Sudanese-Ugandan-Zairean border intensified, as not just the various rebel factions but even the Sudanese and Ugandan militaries launched cross- border raids and bombardments.  Prelude  Military situation in Zaire by April 1997 This volatile situation further escalated upon the outbreak of the First Congo War in 1996, as an alliance of rebel groups and states led by Rwanda invaded Zaire to topple Mobutu. Uganda joined this coalition, realizing that the war was an opportunity to eliminate Zaire as haven for Ugandan insurgents. As result, the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) invaded northeastern Zaire, and helped the SPLA and the native Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL) to clear the region of the Zairian Armed Forces (FAZ) and other pro-Sudanese forces. Sudan attempted to aid its allies, but the FAZ was in a catastrophic condition and the Ugandan insurgents demotivated. Both were easily routed by the UPDF and its allies, and surrendered, deserted or fled en masse into southern Sudan. With the pro- Sudanese forces in Zaire routed, the SPLA and its supporters occupied northeastern Zaire. The SPLA was thus in the position to launch offensive operations into Sudan from the Zairian side of the border. Two offensives were planned: \\"Operation Thunderbolt\\" which would take place west of the Nile, and \\"Operation Jungle Storm\\" east of the Nile. The South Sudanese rebels amassed a force of about 12,000 fighters, including tanks and artillery, for Operation Thunderbolt. Salva Kiir Mayardit was appointed overall commander of the SPLA troops involved in the offensive. Another important rebel commander during Operation Thunderbolt was James Hoth Mai. The SPLA enjoyed strong support by foreign states, namely Uganda, Ethiopia, and Eritrea, during the preparation and execution of Operation Thunderbolt. Each of these countries had its own goals which it hoped to achieve by aiding the SPLA in capturing Western and Central Equatoria. For Uganda, Operation Thunderbolt's main aim was to capture the entire border to block the SAF from advancing into Zaire to help its allies there. By helping the SPLA, Ethiopia intended to pressure the Sudanese government into ending its support for anti-Ethiopian militants. Eritrea hoped that its involvement in the conflict would weaken its rival Sudan, and reduce the influence of its other rival, Ethiopia, in southern Sudan. The foreign support for the SPLA during Operation Thunderbolt took several forms. First of all, the rebels were trained, provided with intelligence, and supplied with equipment by the UPDF, the Eritrean Army and the Ethiopian Army. Furthermore, many of the tanks and artillery pieces that took part in the operation were operated by crews belonging to the Ugandan, Eritrean, and Ethiopian militaries. Unidentified Ethiopian military officers even directly commanded parts of the anti-Sudanese operation.  The offensive  Zairean soldiers in the 1990s The SPLA began the offensive amid the dry season on 9 March, attacking the border town of Kaya and the road between Yei and Juba. The assault on Kaya was preceded by an artillery bombardement. Though the Ugandan government officially denied involvement in the operation, several sources confirm that the assault on Kaya was directly supported by the Uganda People's Defence Force with tanks, howitzers, mortars, and machine guns. The SAF had previously realized that the SPLA was preparing an offensive, but the rebels managed to capture Kaya on the first day of the attack nonetheless, while the UPDF seized the strategically important nearby Koboko Mountain. On 10 March, the SPLA captured Bazi and Gumuni, while the Sudanese and Ugandan militaries reportedly exchanged artillery fire across their common border. The SPLA was thus able to encircle the SAF in a \\"massive pincer movement\\", and cut off the \\"big\\" garrison at Yei from Juba on 11 March. This rapid advance was \\"facilitated primarily by an Ethiopian tank unit\\", and UPDF tanks also played a major role in clearing the way for the South Sudanese rebels. Attempts by the Sudanese Air Force to supply Yei by air failed, as the air drops were captured by the rebels. In response to the rapid SPLA advances, the Sudanese government ordered the WNBF and UNRF (II) to aid the SAF in rearguard actions; this did little to stop the South Sudanese rebels. Instead, the Ugandan insurgents suffered heavy losses. Their worst defeat came amid the siege of Yei. Over 4,000 stragglers, including women and children, had fled Zaire, crossed the border at Morobo County, and advanced toward Yei. This column included WNBF forces under Juma Oris, as well as a smaller number of FAZ, SAF, and Ex-FAR soldiers. They hoped to find refuge at Yei, and did not know of the town's encirclement by the SPLA. T-59 tanks at Yei (T-59s in Chinese service pictured) Instead of relieving Yei's garrison, the column was ambushed by the SPLA about halfway between Morobo and Yei, and suffered 3,000 casualties: 2,000 killed and 1,000 captured. The survivors were routed and fled in disarray to Juba. The column's leaders were mostly killed, wounded or captured: WNBF commander Juma Oris was badly wounded though escaped, while Ex- FAR Captain Jean-Marie Magabo was captured. Following this defeat, Yei's garrison surrendered on 12 or 13 March, though many of its fighters attempted to flee into the bush. They left behind much materiel, including at least nine 122mm howitzers, one 37mm anti-aircraft gun, and five Chinese-made T-59 tanks. Several WNBF fighters, including the militia's deputy commander Abdulatif Tiyua, were also captured in the town. The Sudanese government responded by ordering 2,000 SAF soldiers who were retreating toward Juba to instead march on Yei, officially to aid the besieged garrison, although the government knew that the town had already fallen. This counter-attack failed, and 1,000 SAF soldiers were captured or surrendered, while the rest were killed or scattered by the rebels. The SPLA further advanced after its success at Yei, capturing the garrison towns of Morobo (12 March), Loka (13 March), the \\"heavily fortified\\" base of Lainya (15 March), Kagwada (16 March), and Kulipapa (17 March) in quick succession. The important town of Kajo-Kaji was taken by the South Sudanese rebels on 24 March, and a SAF counter-attack along the Yei-Juba road was repelled two days later. The SPLA's advance was then halted by the onset of the wet season. The Kit River swell in volume and became difficult to cross, especially as one bridge had been destroyed by the SAF during its retreat. When the SPLA forces under Salva Kiir Mayardit's command managed to cross the river, however, they launched \\"lightning strikes\\" against the next Sudanese bases. The garrison towns of Lui, Amadi, the Jambo road junction, Goja, Boje, and Moga were captured by the rebels on 2‚Äì3 April, followed by Mukungu (9 April), and Kit (12 April). Along with UPDF troops, the SPLA also attacked a LRA/LSA camp at Aru on 9-10 April. The remaining SAF units in the region were mostly forced to retreat. A counter-attack by the pro-government SSIM/A militia was repelled. As result, Juba itself became threatened by the SPLA, while SAF garrisons in Eastern Equatoria were cut off and had to be supplied by air from then on. Much of Western Equatoria was left under rebel control, allowing the SPLA to launch further offensives in the north, most importantly \\"Operation Deng Nhial\\" (from mid-March) and \\"Operation Final Lap\\" (from June) during which rebel holdings in the Lakes and Warrap states were significantly expanded. The SPLA claimed to have put 8,000 enemy troops \\"out of action\\" during Operation Thunderbolt, including a large number of Sudanese senior officers. \\"Several thousand\\" SAF soldiers were captured or surrendered near Yei. Likewise, the pro-Sudanese WNBF and UNRF (II) suffered heavy losses during the fighting in Equatoria. The WNBF lost 1,800 combatants at Yei and Morobo alone, of whom 800 were killed while the rest were captured. The high commands of both WNBF and UNRF (II) were mostly killed or captured in the offensive. In comparison, the SPLA suffered much lighter casualties.  Aftermath  The town of Yei in 2012 The success of Operation Thunderbolt significantly improved the SPLA's military and political position. It had conquered numerous important towns, and was thereby more able to present itself as legitimate government of South Sudan. Much of the territory captured by the SPLA during Operation Thunderbolt remained in its hands until the civil war's end. The rebel group had also seized a large amount of small arms, ammunition, landmines, and heavier equipment such as artillery pieces, at least 60 tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and anti-tank cannons, greatly increasing its combat capabilities. Nevertheless, much of the weaponry and ammunition that fell into the hands of the SPLA was \\"degraded and of no use on the battlefield\\". The Sudanese government had had problems for years to properly supply its forces with modern arms, and the SAF was consequently forced to rely on obsolete, incompatible, or badly worn equipment. Operation Thunderbolt, along with simultaneous offensives by the SPLA and other insurgents, further worsened the Sudanese government's dire shortages in manpower and equipment. The regime was reportedly forced to resort to forcibly recruiting schoolboys, train them just 15 days, and then send them into battle with no more than a gun, a Quran page to \\"ward off infidel bullets\\", and a key to unlock Heaven's Gate if they fell in combat. The NIF leadership also increased its efforts to enlist the aid of various militias to keep the SPLA at bay. The capture of Yei was one of the most important successes for the SPLA. It provided the rebel group with an international propaganda boost, as it portrayed its own rule in the town as free and fair in contrast to the previous administration which was widely perceived as oppressive. SPLA leader John Garang even declared that with Yei in rebel hands, the SPLA had almost won the civil war in southern Sudan; this assessment proved premature. In fact, the conflict had effectively become a stalemate, as neither the government nor the insurgents were capable of completely defeating each other. The war continued until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed seven years later in 2005. The SPLA was however not very popular with the local Equatorians, and many of them opted to flee into Zaire and Uganda rather than live under SPLA rule. In turn, the SPLA settled a large number of its fighters and their families, mostly ethnic Dinka, in Yei. As Yei remained relatively stable and its security improved over the following years, the town underwent an economic upturn. Cross-border trade in the region increased, and many refugees from around Sudan and the Congo settled in Yei. The SPLA made Yei its new headquarters in summer 1997. The Ugandan rebels found refuge in the Garamba National Park (pictured) after their defeats in Operation Thunderbolt and other battles. The capture of Yei was also a major success for the SPLA's allies. Uganda did not just prevent a Sudanese incursion into Zaire, and thus fulfilled its main strategic goal during the offensive. Operation Thunderbolt also weakened the WNBF and UNRF (II) to a great extent, diminishing their ability to fight the Ugandan government and its allies. Of the two, the WNBF was in a worse situation. As it had also suffered from internal disputes, and mass desertions, the massive defeat in Sudan meant that the WNBF's \\"insurgency was essentially spent by 1997\\". Nevertheless, the Sudanese government continued to support the remaining remnants of WNBF and UNRF (II) that had fled into the Garamba National Park. UPDF soldiers thus remained stationed in and around Yei until at least 2008, securing the area against pro-Sudanese rebels. The Ugandan insurgents who were in SPLA custody following Operation Thunderbolt (including 500‚Äì1,000 WNBF fighters) were eventually expatriated to Uganda. Ethiopia also achieved what it had wanted, namely to pressure the Sudanese government into reducing its support for anti-Ethiopian militants in the Horn of Africa. By the time Ethiopia pulled all of its troops from southern Sudan in May 1998 to respond to the Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian War, the Sudanese leadership had conceded to the principal demands of Ethiopia.

Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that prison inmates have no privacy rights in their cells protected by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.. The Court also held that an intentional deprivation of property by a state employee \\"does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment if an adequate postdeprivation state remedy exists,\\" extending Parratt v. Taylor. to intentional torts.468 U.S. at 519.  Background  On September 16, 1981, Ted Hudson and a fellow officer at the Bland Correctional Center in Bland, Virginia, entered the cell of Russell Palmer, an inmate at the center, to conduct a \\"shakedown\\" search. After the search, Palmer brought a civil rights suit against Hudson under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983, claiming that Hudson had destroyed some of his personal property ‚Äî \\"including legal materials and letters\\"468 U.S. at 541. ‚Äî in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, and that the search was undertaken \\"solely to harass him\\" in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to privacy.468 U.S. at 520-23. The District Court held for Hudson on summary judgment, ruling under Parratt v. Taylor that \\"intentional destruction of a prisoner's property is not a violation of due process, when the prisoner has an adequate remedy under state law,\\" and that a non-routine search of a prison cell intended to harass the prisoner would not have \\"constitutional significance\\" under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court's due process holding but reversed its Fourth Amendment decision, concluding that Palmer \\"had a limited privacy right which may have been violated\\" if the search was undertaken because of \\"a desire to harass or humiliate him.\\"697 F.2d at 1225.  Decision  Writing for a five-justice majority, Chief Justice Burger held that summary judgment was appropriate against Palmer on both his due process and Fourth Amendment claims. In so doing, Burger affirmed the Fourth Circuit's decision that Virginia's postdeprivation remedies eliminated the due process concerns arising from the destruction of Palmer's property, but reversed its holding that Palmer had a \\"limited privacy right\\" in his cell under the Fourth Amendment. As to Palmer's Fourth Amendment claim, the Court applied the reasonable expectation of privacy test established by the landmark Katz v. United States decision in 1967, asking \\"whether a prisoner‚Äôs expectation of privacy in his prison cell is the kind of expectation that 'society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.'\\"468 U.S. at 525-26. Under that test, the Court held that prisoners have no right to privacy in their cells for two reasons: because the need for prison security requires \\"[u]nfettered access to these cells by prison officials...if drugs and contraband are to be ferreted out and sanitary surroundings are to be maintained,\\" and because \\"society would insist that the prisoner‚Äôs expectation of privacy always yield to what must be considered the paramount interest in institutional security.\\"468 U.S. at 527-28. Based on Bell v. Wolfish, where the Court had previously upheld a federal policy of conducting body-cavity searches of pretrial detainees after every visit with someone outside the facility, Burger reasoned that restricting prisoners' Fourth Amendment protections is not problematic because \\"it is clear that imprisonment carries with it the circumscription or loss of many significant rights.\\"468 U.S. at 524. The Court also held against Palmer on his due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. Palmer argued that Hudson had intentionally destroyed his property, and that this violated his due process rights. But the Court held that a \\"postdeprivation process must be constitutionally adequate\\" to address due process claims like Palmer's, ruling \\"that an unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a violation of the procedural requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available.\\" This expanded the holding of Parratt v. Taylor, in which the Court held that state tort remedies available after the fact were sufficient due process when a prison official negligently lost an inmate's hobby kit. Applying the rule of Parratt to intentional destruction of property, Chief Justice Burger held that there had been no due process violation because Virginia had an adequate process in place for addressing Palmer's claim.  Concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor  Justice O'Connor joined the majority opinion and also wrote a brief separate concurrence. O'Connor argued that the Court was correct to hold the Fourth Amendment inapplicable in prison cells because \\"prison searches are the categorically reasonable products of necessarily ad hoc judgments of prison officials maintaining prison safety.\\" She also responded directly to Justice Stevens' assertion in dissent that Fourth Amendment seizure protections were implicated by the case, arguing that Palmer had no seizure claim because \\"the exigencies of prison life authorize officials indefinitely to dispossess inmates of their possessions without specific reason.\\"468 U.S. at 539. She argued further that the destruction of Palmer's property only raised due process claims, not Fourth Amendment issues, because it \\"had no bearing on whether the search and seizure were reasonable.\\" O'Connor explained that Palmer's claim failed because he had neither taken advantage of the postdeprivation remedies for his due process concern offered by Virginia nor shown that those remedies were inadequate.468 U.S. at 540.  Concurring/dissenting opinion of Justice Stevens  Justice Stevens filed an opinion on behalf of four justices concurring in the Court's due process ruling but \\"bitterly dissent[ing]\\" from its Fourth Amendment holding. \\"[T]he dissenters found a clear fourth amendment violation in Hudson's malicious confiscation and destruction of Palmer's property.\\" Stevens argued that Hudson's actions violated both the search and seizure protections of the Fourth Amendment because \\"inmates must retain some 'slight residuum of privacy'\\" in their cells and because the Seizure Clause \\"protects prisoners' possessory interests even assuming the absence of any legitimate expectation of privacy.\\" Although Stevens agreed that the need for prison security makes it legitimate for correctional officers to randomly search inmates' cells, he argued that safety concerns don't eliminate all civil rights of prisoners and that Palmer's Fourth Amendment rights had been violated in this case because the personal materials destroyed by Hudson had been found not to be dangerous. Stevens added that allowing concerns about prison security to extinguish inmates' Fourth Amendment rights \\"is to declare that the prisoners are entitled to no measure of human dignity or individuality,\\" and that the Court's decision \\"declares prisoners to be little more than chattels.\\"468 U.S. at 554-55. Finally, the dissenters disagreed with Chief Justice Burger's assessment that society would not recognize privacy rights for prisoners as legitimate. Stevens argued that this belief about what level of privacy society would find reasonable was contradicted by the fact that lower courts were generally in agreement that prisoners retain some privacy rights, and that prison officials also shared a \\"near-universal view...that guards should neither seize nor destroy noncontraband property.\\" The dissenters \\"pointed out with some irony [that] the Court's view of 'reasonableness' is 'not based on any empirical data; rather it merely reflects the perception of the four Justices who have joined the opinion that The Chief Justice has authored.'\\"  Impact  Hudson v. Palmer reversed a trend among the lower courts of finding that \\"all prison searches are not per se reasonable and that persons incarcerated in jails and prisons are entitled to some measure of Fourth Amendment protection.\\" The case has been applied to find that cell searches in general do not violate inmates' Fourth Amendment rights, including searches \\"conducted for the purpose of extortion rather than prison security.\\" Most state courts interpreting their state constitutions have followed Hudson and found that inmates have no constitutional privacy protections in their prison cells; Vermont is the only exception. Although Hudson v. Palmer held that prisoners have no Fourth Amendment rights in their cells, it did not address whether prisoners have privacy rights in their persons. \\"Hudson merely concluded that the Fourth Amendment affords no protection for the prisoner's privacy interest in his cell or his possessory interest in his effects kept there, and thus arguably has no application to searches and seizures of the person of a prisoner.\\" Hudson also did not specify whether its holding applied to pretrial detention facilities or was limited to prisons; lower courts have disagreed on that question. In 2012, the Supreme Court cited Hudson v. Palmer in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, where it held that strip searches of pretrial detainees entering a general jail population do not violate the Fourth Amendment.. However, the Court in Florence found that the search was constitutional by \\"striking a balance between inmate privacy and the security needs of correctional institutions,\\" not by holding that pretrial detainees have no Fourth Amendment privacy rights.

It was composed in 1892, and first published by Springer in 1893. A translation into English followed in 1894. One thousand copies of the German first edition were printed. In this essay, Rudolf Diesel describes his idea of an internal combustion engine based on the Carnot cycle, transforming heat energy into kinetic energy using high pressure, with a thermal efficiency of up to 73%, outperforming any steam engine of the time. Diesel sent copies of his essay to famous German engineers and university professors for spreading and promoting his idea. He received plenty of negative feedback; many considered letting Diesel's heat engine become reality unfeasible, because of the high pressures of 200‚Äì300 atm (20.3‚Äì30.4 MPa) occurring, which they thought machines of the time could not withstand. Only few found the actual mistake in Diesel's theory: Isothermal-adiabatic compression, which the theory is based on, is impossible. Even with almost isothermal-adiabatic compression, an engine could not operate because of the lean air-fuel mixture. In other words, an engine as described in the essay would require so much compression work, that it could not perform any useful work. Yet, some scientists of the time praised Diesel's idea, which would lead into Maschinenfabrik Augsburg and Krupp Essen forming a consortium for building Diesel's engine. Diesel, who was then ordered to build his own engine, realised his mistake and considered using a modified combustion process. Key changes are the way of compression, which is only adiabatic in the modified combustion process, the pressure, which Diesel reduced significantly, and the fuel injection, where Diesel increased the fuel quantity. In 1897, after four years of work, Diesel had successfully finished his rational heat motor using his modified combustion process. This engine became known as the Diesel engine. Publicly, Diesel never admitted that he had to use a different combustion process from that one he described in his essay, because this would have rendered his heat motor patent obsolete.  Content summary  Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor has nine chapters in total. The first chapter describes the theory of combustion, and is separated into five individual combustion processes, out of which the third is the constant pressure process used for the rational heat motor. Therefore, it is described in more detail in this article. In the second chapter, Diesel describes how he intends to design and build an engine with an indicated power of 100 PS. With the third chapter, Diesel tries to address using a process with adiabatic compression only; the fourth chapter describes designing a real motor for this modified process. The fifth chapter addresses yet another modified process, with an incomplete expansion phase, but Diesel does not include a design concept. Furthermore, he considers a completely closed cycle in the sixth chapter and using his invention as a refrigerator in the seventh chapter. His theories on how to use a rational heat motor are described in the eighth chapter. The ninth chapter includes additional comments. His additional work Nachtr√§ge zur Br√∂sch√ºre is not included in the original essay, but in newer editions, it serves as a tenth chapter. *Theorie der Verbrennung (Theory of combustion) *Konstruktion des vollkommenen Motors (Construction of the ideal motor) *Erste Abweichung vom vollkommenen Process (First deviation from the ideal process) *Konstruktion des Motors f√ºr den abweichenden Process (Construction of the motor for the deviating process) *Andere Abweichungen vom vollkommenenen Process (Additional deviations from the ideal process) *Der neue Motor als geschlossene Maschine (The new motor in a closed cycle) *Der neue Motor als K√§lteerzeugungsmaschine (The new motor as a refrigerator) *Anwendungen des neuen Motors (Applications of the new motor) *Schlussbemerkungen (Conclusions) *Nachtr√§ge zur Brosch√ºre (Supplement of the brochure)  Theory of combustion and construction of the ideal motor  = The principle = Diesel's idea of a rational heat motor was designing a cycle that would allow maximum heat utilisation, based on the Carnot cycle. To overcome the low efficiency of steam and combustion engines of the time, Diesel wanted to build an entirely new type of internal combustion engine. In the 1890s, regular gas engines were capable of transforming only 6% of the fuel energy into kinetic energy; good triple expansion steam engines were slightly better than that, they could convert 7.2% of the fuel energy into kinetic energy. Diesel said that his rational heat motor has a thermal efficiency of 73%, thus being capable of converting approximately ‚Ä≥6 to 7-times as much‚Ä≥ chemical energy into kinetic energy, meaning that it has an efficiency of approximately 50%. Diesel even claimed that future versions of his motor would have an even higher efficiency. Despite relying on compression ignition, Diesel says that he never purposely designed his motor with this specific characteristic. In his patent DRP 67 207, Diesel describes that a motor with the best thermal efficiency would automatically have compression ignition. In his 1913 book Die Entstehung des Dieselmotors, he denies that compression ignition is a key feature of his motor: On page 16 of Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor, Diesel writes, that ignition in his rational heat motor takes place either by means of artificial ignition or compression ignition: = The third process = Ideal cycle The Diesel process is a hypothetical constant-pressure model, with four distinct processes, a so-called cycle, meaning that these four distinct processes can be repeated over and over again. These distinct processes are the same processes that can be found in a four-stroke engine: intake, compression, combustion, exhaust. All four strokes combined form the cycle, which is supposed to result in useful work. The Diesel process uses a special compression stroke based on the idea, that a gas can be compressed in a combined isothermal-adiabatic way. Isothermal means, that the temperature during compression does not change, thus requiring heat dissipation; adiabatic means, that the gas changes its volume, but without heat dissipation. This means that there is no waste heat. For the means of compression, Diesel intended using a notional compression cylinder. This process requires work and consists of four phases: *Intake, sucking in uncompressed air, requiring work. *Compression with an isothermal curve (or a different curve), dissipating heat and requiring work. *Compression with an adiabatic curve, requiring work. *Emitting the combustion air, requiring work. For the distinct combustion process, Diesel intended using a notional expansion cylinder. Again it consists of four phases: *Gas entering with constant pressure, requiring work. *Combustion with any curve, producing work, dissipating heat. *Expansion of the gas with an adiabatic curve until atmospheric pressure is reached, producing work. *Exhausting the gas, requiring work. Adding these phases will result in a diagram similar to a Carnot diagram as shown on the right. Because fuel will be added to the gas, the start position 1 will not be identical with the end position 1, meaning that there is always slightly more work required. However, Diesel considered using a very lean air-fuel mixture, thus resulting in the amount of extra work required being insignificant. In theory, the combustion process ends at position 4 of the diagram. But this is not the end of the work formation taking place in the two phases combustion (3‚Äì4) and expansion (4‚Äì1), as explained. Diesel considered an isothermal expansion phase unfeasible, because it would cause a gigantic expansion cylinder, resulting in a very large and unpractical engine. This is why gas expansion is adiabatic and taking place until atmospheric pressure is reached only. He considered the additional work required, resulting in overall work loss, ‚Ä≥unimportant‚Ä≥, because he considered making a real motor more reasonable than focussing on the best efficiency. This resulted in the original Diesel diagram. = Wrong conclusion = Diesel's theory had three major problems: *Isothermal-adiabatic compression, which is supposed to result in high efficiency, is not possible; hence, Diesel later revised his process. *To reach a high thermal efficiency, Diesel intended using a high compression of 200‚Äì300 atm (20.3‚Äì30.4 MPa), which would result in too much friction loss. *As thermal efficiency does not depend on the temperatures, Diesel intended reducing the combustion temperature by using a lean air-fuel mixture of 99.324:1, which would not allow combustion. In fact, a high compression ratio increases efficiency, however, only to a certain point, because, like Diesel figured, too much heat energy would have to be dissipated and too much friction would occur, which could not be compensated by the engine's work. On the other hand, a compression ratio chosen too low results in insufficient heat utilisation. When designing his theory, Diesel already considered reducing compression to 90 atm (9.1 MPa), which he thought would result in only 5% thermal efficiency loss, but in a significant increase in actual efficiency, yet he recommends increasing pressure as much as possible. His solution for the heat dissipation problem was still wrong: He decided to use more air, resulting in an air-fuel mixture which is too lean. Such an air-fuel mixture cannot provide any work, because it cannot combust, not even with artificial ignition. = Criticism = As mentioned, Diesel was mostly criticised for his idea of a heat motor, but also received positive feedback. However, most critics did not criticise the theory's flaw, but that Diesel's heat engine used very high amounts of pressure to operate. Diesel himself acknowledged the feedback: Wilhelm Z√ºblin, engineer of Sulzer, and Professor Alois Riedler came to the conclusion, that Diesel's motor could require so much compression work, that it could possibly not perform any useful work. In his 1887 work Theorie der Gasmotoren, Otto K√∂hler had already addressed that an ideal cycle is not suitable for a real motor, coming to the same conclusion as the former. He had foreseen the problem of friction loss rendering the motor work useless and, in a letter addressed to Diesel's friend Venator, he considered the pressure required too high: Other critics rather feared that the material would not withstand the enormous strain, but otherwise did not criticise the mistake of Diesel's theory: Others praised Diesel and the theory: = Diesel realising his theory‚Ä≤s flaw = Phase 2‚Äì3, reversible constant pressure heating (isotherm) is not possible. Heat motor using Diesel's modified combustion process, built by Langen & Wolf in 1898 under licence; located at the Technical Museum in Wien As Diesel considered Riedler's and Z√ºblin's reactions to his essay relevant, he tried addressing their point, that the engine would not perform any useful work. In a letter addressed to Moritz Schr√∂ter, dated 13 February 1893, Diesel describes the thermal efficiency of his rational heat motor, assuming maximum losses. He comes to the conclusion, that the absolute minimum thermal efficiency is not less than 30.4‚Äì31.6 %, which is still more than 2¬Ω times the thermal efficiency of a triple expansion steam engine and 4‚Äì5 times the thermal efficiency of a medium size compound steam engine. At this time, Diesel had not yet realised that his rational heat motor would not work: Still trying to figure how to further increase efficiency, he considered increasing the admission period's length by increasing the supposed isotherm length on his motor's ideal diagram (red line on the diagram shown on the right), which Diesel believed would result in better efficiency. What he did not understand at the time was that his diagram did not show an isotherm. With an actual isotherm, the amount of input work would have been almost greater than the output work, resulting in a narrow p-V diagram, indicating that the rational heat motor would not perform any work. It took Diesel several months to figure the problem. He started designing a new combustion process in May 1893 titled ‚ÄûSchlu√üfolgerungen √ºber die definitiv f. d. Praxis zu w√§hlende Arbeitsmethode des Motors‚Äú (conclusion of the operating principle that definitely has to be chosen for a practical engine); it took until September the same year. By 16 June 1893, before he started the experiments with his engine at the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg, he had realised that the Carnot cycle is practically not possible and that he, therefore, has to change the way his motor works: ‚Ä≥Despite my older contrary statement, the question has to be answered, whether or not combustion processes other than the isothermal process would result in a bigger diagram‚Ä≥ (=actual engine work). Thus, Diesel eventually abandoned his idea of isothermic-adiabatic compression, he later made a note in his journal: ‚Ä≥We must not compress the air in a combined isothermal-adiabatic way, instead, we must only compress it adiabatically‚Ä≥. To achieve this, Diesel now wanted to raise point 3 in his diagram instead of increasing the length of the admission period 2‚Äì3 by reducing injection time. Diesel, who had obtained a patent (DRP 67 207) for a combustion process without significant changes in either pressure or temperature, thought that this patent would also cover constant pressure combustion curves, but to ensure that the changes in his combustion process would also be covered by a patent, he applied for a new additional patent on 29 November 1893, which was later awarded to him (DRP 82 168). Yet again, Diesel made a mistake: Instead of injecting the fuel faster, injecting more fuel would have been the correct solution in this case. When making calculations for a modification of his test engine in September 1893, he compared his test engine with a regular paraffin engine: ‚Ä≥Average paraffin engines have a fuel consumption of approximately 600 g/PSh = 750 cm3/PSh paraffin, thus 7,500 cm3 for 10 PSh. We would have to assume the same quantity of fuel for our engine running at maximum load and 150√ó60=9000 injections per hour.‚Ä≥ This is how Diesel found out that he has to use an air-fuel ratio of ~14:1 rather than ~100:1 for a working engine. Furthermore, Diesel finally decided to abandon his concept of a high compression pressure in favour of a lower pressure of 30 atm (3 MPa) more suitable for 1890s machines. Correctly, he assumed that lower compression, despite causing less thermal efficiency, would result in less friction, which would allow an engine having a higher total efficiency, than an engine with a greater thermal efficiency but more friction losses: Publicly, Diesel never admitted his mistakes, despite knowing them and how to overcome them. He did so to save his patent: Publicly admitting that the rational heat motor cannot work would have rendered his patent DRP 67 207 obsolete and therefore destroyed his personal work, because it would have allowed building the Diesel engine without acquiring a licence for his patent.  Deviation from the process  Diesel feared that possible licencees could get an ‚Ä≥unfavourable impression‚Ä≥ when seeing the high compression pressure figure. Therefore, Diesel addressed several different deviations from the ideal process in chapters 3 and 5 of his essay. By gradually reducing compression temperature, he depicted a gradual reduction in compression pressure. He writes that a pressure reduction from 250 atm (25.3 MPa) to 90 atm (9.1 MPa) would only result in 5% thermal efficiency loss, but an increase in overall efficiency, which is why Diesel figured that there ‚Ä≥cannot be any doubts, that the deviating process has to be chosen for the actual motor‚Ä≥. The lowest pressure Diesel considered reasonable is 44 atm (4.5 MPa), resulting in a thermal efficiency of 60%. According to Diesel, at the time materials were already capable of withstanding such high pressure. He also admitted that a pressure of approximately 30 atm (3 MPa) may be used as a last stop-gap solution if higher compression is not possible. During his experiments in Augsburg, Diesel ended up finding out that the ideal compression for the engine is in between 30 and 35 atm (3‚Äì3.5 MPa), after he first considered slightly higher values of 30‚Äì40 atm (3‚Äì4.1 MPa) reasonable. When reducing the compression pressure, Diesel always tried keeping it above the self-ignition temperature of the fuel, which is why he eventually decided to choose 30 atm.  Applications of the motor  In the eighth chapter, Diesel gives five suggestions how his motor can be used as: *Stationary motor for large-scale industry *Stationary motor for small-scale industry *Motor for locomotives *Motor for trams and lorries *Motor for watercraft Hellmut Droscha evaluates in the 1991 book Leistung und Weg: Zur Geschichte des MAN- Nutzfahrzeugbaus that Diesel's main intention was designing a motor for small- scale industry. With a Diesel engine, according to Droscha, Diesel thought he could improve the competitiveness of small enterprises. In the 19th century, only larger firms could afford steam engines, as steam engines were economical in bigger quantities only.

In 1821, as second-in-command of the Ottoman navy, he succeeded in resupplying the isolated Ottoman fortresses in the Peloponnese, while his subordinate Ismael Gibraltar destroyed Galaxeidi. Promoted to Kapudan Pasha (commander-in-chief of the navy), and led the suppression of the revolt in Chios and the ensuing Chios massacre in April 1822. He was killed when a fireship captained by Constantine Kanaris blew up his flagship in Chios harbour on the night of 18/19 June 1822. Origin He hailed from an Albanian family in Scodra, and was much esteemed for his ability; at the time of his appointment as Kapudan Pasha, the then Austrian ambassador to the Sublime Porte qualified him as \\"the only intelligent and educated officer of the navy\\". In the Greek War of Independence =1821 expedition to the Peloponnese and Corinthian Gulf= As the Kapitan Bey, the Ottoman fleet's second-in-command, in August 1821 he led a sortie from the Dardanelles, commanding a squadron of three ships of the line, five frigates, and twenty smaller vessels (corvettes and brigs), joined by squadrons from Egypt and Algeria. The fleets of the Greek islanders that had risen in revolt had disbanded and returned home at the time, so the Ottomans were easily able to sail unopposed. The fleet ferried supplies and ammunition to the fortresses of Methoni and Koroni, thus preventing their surrender to the Greeks who were besieging them. From there the fleet moved to Patras, where it arrived on 18 September and disembarked reinforcements that allowed the local Ottoman commander, Yusuf Pasha, to break the Greek blockade of the city. On 1 October, the Egyptian squadron under Ismael Gibraltar destroyed the coastal town of Galaxeidi and burned or captured its fleet, the largest in western Greece. With the sailing season now advanced, Ali decided to return to Constantinople. At Zakynthos, which was under British control, he learned that the Greek fleet under Andreas Miaoulis, 35 vessels strong, had gathered to confront him on his return. The two fleets engaged in indecisive fighting off the western coast of the Peloponnese, but Ali, determined to avoid direct confrontation and thus risk the ships he had captured at Galaxeidi, was pushed back to Zakynthos. Only when a favourable wind blew again did he depart, and returned safely to the Ottoman capital, with 35 captured vessels in tow. As a result of this success, Sultan Mahmud II promoted Ali to Kapudan Pasha, commander-in-chief of the entire Ottoman navy. =1822 expedition to Chios and death= On 22 March 1822, the revolutionary leader of Samos Island, Lykourgos Logothetis, landed at Chios, a wealthy island whose production of mastic gave it a privileged place as the supplier of the Ottoman court. The Greek expeditionary force on the island was not well organized, nor did it enjoy significant naval support. As a result, the Sultan mobilized his forces against the island, with Ali leading the naval arm of the operation. The Ottoman fleet of 46 ships arrived at the island on 11 April, and on the next day landed 7,000 men on the island. after a brief resistance, Logothetis and his Samiots embarked on their ships and fled, leaving the Chiots behind to suffer the consequences: although the populace was generally unarmed and had been very reluctant to join the Samiots, they were treated as rebels, with many thousands executed and most of the rest carted off to slave markets. Ali tried to intervene and spare the rural population from destruction, and particularly the valuable mastic villages, as their survival was the foundation of the island's continued prosperity (and the tax proceeds it remitted to Constantinople). On 17 April, he called on the foreign consuls to announce an amnesty to the inhabitants of the island, and on 22 April the elders of the mastic villages appeared before him in submission, accompanied by the French and Austrian consuls. The mastic villages were thus spared destruction, but much of the rest of the island was not; even in cases where villages submitted and handed over their weapons, they were then subject to looting and destruction. Vehid Pasha, the commander of the Chios garrison, then suggested to Ali to use the opportunity to attack the Greek strongholds at Samos and the nearby island of Psara, but Ali refused, saying that these were well fortified, and that once the weather improved he had orders to sail for the Peloponnese. The two commanders became increasingly hostile to one another, as Vehid put his support behind continued reprisals and massacres on the island, while Ali was eager to see order restored. Vehid and his soldiers began suspecting Ali of being sympathetic to the Greeks, while Ali sent repeated dispatches criticising Vehid's conduct to Constantinople, and is even reported to have tried to recruit some of his crews to assassinate his rival. At long last, Ali's protestations, along with those of the European consuls and the Sultan's sister Esma Sultan, led to the dismissal and banishment of Vehid. While the Greek fleet under Miaoulis belatedly set sail for Chios, the Ottoman fleet under Ali remained at the island to spend Ramadan. An indecisive combat between the two fleets ensued on 12 May, 19 May, and the night of 31 May. The Greeks unsuccessfully attempted to use fireships against the Ottoman ships of the line, while the latter, despite being much heavier and powerful than the Greek vessels, avoided combat. On 18 June, Ali held a great feast on his 80-gun flagship to celebrate Eid al-Fitr and the end of Ramadan. The entire fleet was illuminated in celebration, allowing two Greek vessels to approach them under cover of night. One of them, commanded by Constantine Kanaris, made for the flagship, while the other, under Andreas Pipinos, headed for the ship of the second-in-command. Unlike his colleague, Kanaris managed to latch his fireship firmly onto the Ottoman vessel, which was quickly engulfed by flame. Chaos broke out on its deck. According to contemporary European reports, Ali's officers led him to board a boat, but at that moment he was struck by a falling spar and died soon after he was brought ashore. However, the eyewitness Vehid Pasha claims in his memoirs that he was killed when the ship's gunpowder magazine exploded, and that his blackened corpse was thrown to the beach, where it was found. Ali's second-in-command brought the fleet back to the Dardanelles, while Chios, including the mastic villages, was ravaged anew by the Ottoman soldiery in revenge. Ali's corpse was washed and buried in the Chios Castle, where his tomb survives to this day.

In the game, players take the role of forest animals building a city over four seasons by collecting resources, recruiting workers, and constructing buildings. The game has been well regarded by reviewers, with its art and components receiving strong praise. Gameplay Over four seasons, players place their forest animal meeples to get resources to buy cards into a personal tableau, which give points towards winning the game or special abilities to help them build further. The game starts simply, with the complexity increasing as a player's cards gain synergies from newly acquired cards. In addition to the points they get from acquiring cards, players score by triggering events, from collecting certain combinations of card types, and from end game bonuses given by cards for acquiring certain other cards in their city. Reception Keith Law of Paste Magazine and Vulture dubbed Everdell one of the best new board games of 2018, praising its gameplay, forest animal theme, and \\"gorgeous\\" art and components. Smithsonian also called it one of the best games of 2018, lavishing praise on the tactile components, such as the hefty coins, squishy berries, and three dimensional tree which holds the cards available for purchase.

The film stars John Cena, John Leguizamo, Keegan-Michael Key, Brianna Hildebrand, Dennis Haysbert, and Judy Greer, and follows a group of smokejumpers who must watch over three children who have been separated from their parents following an accident. The film was theatrically released by Paramount Pictures on November 8, 2019, in the United States. It is the third Walden Media film from Nickelodeon Movies, after Charlotte's Web and Dora and the Lost City of Gold (the latter was also released in 2019). Despite receiving generally negative reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, grossing $68 million worldwide with production budget of $29 million. Plot Superintendent Jake Carson is the commanding officer of a group of smokejumpers in remote California woodlands. Carson is capable in a crisis and takes tremendous pride in his work, diving into dangerous situations to rescue civilians alongside his team - overtly loyal Mark Rogers, nervy and neurotic Rodrigo Torres and \\"Axe\\", a huge mute who carries his fireman's axe everywhere. After rescuing three children from a burning cabin, Carson is contacted by the universally admired division commander Richards. Richards praises Carson's work and shortlists Carson for his replacement, Carson's dream job. Rogers advises Carson that they are responsible for the welfare of the children Brynn, Will, and Zoey under the \\"SafeHaven Laws\\", which require law enforcement and first responders to care for children until they are released to a parent or guardian. Carson leaves a voicemail for the children's mother who texts back saying that they are on their way. Carson's attempts to complete his application for division commander are undermined by the children running haywire around the station, and the arrival of Carson's ex-girlfriend, environmental Doctor Amy Hicks, a local who protests the smokejumpers taking water from endangered toad habitats to fight fires. Carson tries to offload the children onto Hicks, who refuses. Despite the mayhem, the rest of the smokejumpers begin to bond with the children, with toddler Zoey warming up the brutish Axe and Torres teaching Will how to navigate dangerous situations. Brynn pays lip service to Rogers' admiration of Carson, but then stages an escape on the station's ATV, spilling oil and slashing tires to prevent chase. Carson catches them by off-roading on a little girl's bike and corners the children on a dirt road. At Will's prompting, Brynn admits that they are orphans on the run from foster care, fearing that they will be separated. The text messages were from Brynn herself. The group camp out overnight and Carson promises to hold off calling Child Services until after Zoey's birthday in two days. The group go all out in preparing for Zoey's birthday, and the four smokejumpers buy presents for Brynn and Will as well. Carson then tells Will a bedtime story about a yeti who was married to his job, had a son, and then died on the job because he was distracted by having a family. Brynn and Hicks are both touched by the story, which fits in with the circumstances of Carson's father's death and Carson's inability to form relationships. The overboard birthday party is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Richards and Child Services. The children flee in Richards' car and run off the road right on a cliff. While driving, Brynn gets trapped in her seat belt. Carson parachutes down to rescue them and with Will's help, he frees Brynn before the car can roll off the cliff. Back at the station, Hicks and the other smokejumpers bid an emotional farewell to the children. Richards tells Carson that family can be a source of support and that there is more to life than working. Inspired, Carson refuses to release the children to Child Services under the Safe Haven laws and proposes a plan to adopt all three of them. Some time later, Carson and Hicks get married with the smokejumpers and their adopted children in attendance.

Vidal (known at lower courts as Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen), , was a U.S. Supreme Court cases that was filed to challenge the Trump Administration's rescission of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Plaintiffs in the case are DACA recipients who argue that the rescission decision is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. On February 13, 2018, Judge Garaufis in the Eastern District of New York addressed the question of whether the government offered a legally adequate reason for ending the DACA program. The court found that Defendants did not provide a legally adequate reason for ending the DACA program and that the decision to end DACA was arbitrary and capricious. Defendants have appealed the decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  Background  = Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals = On June 15, 2012, the Department of Homeland Security established the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. DACA provides young immigrants who meet specific criteria with protection from deportation and eligibility for work authorization for two years. Since 2012, about 800,000 people have been granted DACA. On September 5, 2017, President Trump ordered an end to the DACA program and established a phasing out plan for DACA. The termination of the DACA program resulted in various lawsuits challenging the termination. = Case background = Prior to the Trump administration's rescinding of DACA, the constitutionality of a similar program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) and a work-permit extension of DACA made alongside it, had been challenged by a collation of 26 states led by Texas in the case United States v. Texas, 579 U.S. ___ (2016). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had upheld the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas's 2015 injunction preventing the government from enforcing the DAPA and extension of the DACA program. The federal government had challenged this to the Supreme Court, but due to the recent death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court was deadlocked, and left the injunction in place based on the Fifth Circuit's ruling. Mart√≠n Batalla Vidal was the son of undocumented immigrants who had lived in New York City who only learned of his \\"dreamer\\" status in 2008. After the original DACA program was offered, Vidal applied in 2014 and had been approved in early 2015 for a three-year work permit. With the Texas District Court's injunction on DAPA and the DACA expansion, Vidal was told by the government that his approval had to be reduced to a two-year work permit, despite the injunction only affirmed to cover the Fifth Circuit states (Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi). The injunction also affected the ability for his parents to received deferred action for work permits under DAPA. Vidal gained the help from Make the Road New York, the National Immigration Law Center, and the Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic at the Yale Law School to obtain legal council and file suit against the United States Department of Homeland Security, the agency overseeing the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services which handled the DACA system, around 2016 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to challenge the agency's nationwide policy based on the circuit injunction. While Vidal's case was being prosecuted, the Trump administration announced its plan to rescind the DACA entirely in September 2017. Vidal amended his case to assert that this action violated federal law. The amended complaint stated that the government failed to provide an explanation for the reversal of DACA, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the Trump Administration's reversal is \\"unconstitutionally motivated by anti-Mexican and anti-Latino animus, in violation of equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\\"  District court  Vidal's case at the District Court was heard under Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who after the case was amended to include the new claims related to the Trump's administration's decision to rescind DACA, became a noted figure in the DACA debate as he had been found to be harshly critical of the responses the government had made in why they opted to terminate the DACA during questioning. On February 13, 2018, Garaufis granted Vidal's motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the government from rescinding the DACA. Garaufis did assert that the government had the authority to end the DACA program. However, he stated that the reasoning provided failed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as it was arbitrary and capricious, based on a \\"plainly incorrect factual premise\\" that the DACA program was illegal simply because the DAPA had been found illegal via United States v. Texas. Further, Garaufis asserted that there was an internal inconsistency with the Customs office's handling of the DACA, as it was continuing to adjudicate DACA renewal applications at the same time it claimed it was winding down the program.  Supreme Court  Garaufis' injunction came about a month following a similar injunction preventing the government from rescinding the DACA from California in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California] (DHS). In April 2018, Judge John D. Bates of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also issued a similar injunction against the rescinding in the case Trump v. NAACP (NAACP). As such, these injunctions were considered to have nationwide basis preventing the government from rescinding the program. The government had begun the appeals process for each of these cases, with Vidal's case appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. However, by November 2018, the government opted to bypass the Circuit Courts and petitioned the Supreme Court on all three cases. The Supreme Court accepted the petition on June 28, 2019, consolidating Vidal and NAACP under DHS. Oral hearings were on November 12, 2019. The Supreme Court issued its decision on June 18, 2020. In the 5-4 majority, the court found that the government's reasons to rescind the DACA program to arbitrary and capricious against the APA, and reversed the order, leaving the DACA program active. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, stated that they made no evaluation on the legality of the DACA program itself and that the government was free to submit a new regulation to rescind the DACA with better reasoning to fit the APA. Among dissents, Judge Clarence Thomas was critical of the majority for not taking the opportunity for reviewing the constitutionality of the DACA as well.

Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209 (D.D.C. 2018), adhered to on denial of reconsideration, 315 F. Supp. 3d 457 (D.D.C. 2018): On August 17, 2018, the court partially stayed its order in ordering USCIS to accept to initial applications and advance parole. Now, USCIS only needs to accept renewal applications. = _Texas_ = State of Texas, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Kirstjen M. Nielsen, et al., Defendants., (S.D.Tex. 2018): The court denied plaintiff states' motion for a preliminary injunction because of the harm it would cause to DACA recipients. = Subsequent Treatment by Courts = In Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., the Ninth Circuit distinguished Batalla Vidal where the district court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's substantive APA claim that alleged that Defendants arbitrary and capriciously changed DHSs's information-use policy. In Batalla Vidal, the court found that Plaintiffs' had relied on a document that contradicted \\"their otherwise-unsupported allegation of a change to DHS's information-use policy.\\" The Ninth Circuit found that Regents of the Univ. of Cal. is different from Batalla Vidal because in Regents, the most recent FAQs [document] were not attached to or referenced in any of the complaints. . . \\"therefore. . . materials outside the complaint cannot be considered on a motion to dismiss.\\"Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476 (9th Cir. Nov. 8, 2018) In Gondal v, United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., the Eastern District of New York found that plaintiffs do \\"not possess a liberty or property interest in a particular decision under DACA nor an employment authorization card.\\" The court cited Batalla Vidal to explain that because the decision to grant deferred action and work authorization is discretionary, plaintiffs are not entitled to any additional interests that are contingent on that discretionary decision.Gondal v. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., 343 F. Supp. 3d 83 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 2018) In Saget v. Trump, the Eastern District of New York cited Batalla Vidal to support their finding that plaintiffs have plausible alleged that a discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor behind the decision to terminate TPS for Haiti. The court cited language in Batalla Vidal, where Judge Garaufis noted that \\"liability for discrimination will lie when a biased individual manipulates a non-biased decision-maker into taking discriminatory action.\\"Saget v. Trump, 345 F. Supp. 3d 287 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 14, 2018) In 2019, the Southern District of New York held that Batalla Vidal \\"does not stand for the sweeping proposition that any organization with immigrant clients has standing to sue for violations of the [Immigration National Act] INA.\\" The court found that in De Dandrade v. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., the organizational plaintiffs do not have a cause of action under the APA or under the Constitution because organizational plaintiffs' interests are \\"so marginally related\\" to the purposes of the INA.De Dandrade v. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. 17-cv-9604 (PKC), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25249 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2019)  Further reading  * Kurzban, Ira J.

The office was formally established in 1933, but older offices with similar functions date back to the early nineteenth century. History After 1824, the Home Office employed parliamentary draftsmen, but not in a formal position, to prepare and improve criminal law. William Gregson was employed continuously between 1826 and 1833 in this capacity and received annual payments. His employment ended in 1833 and two years later the Treasury agreed to find funds for a permanent Parliamentary Counsel, whose office had a salary fixed at ¬£1,200; this was incorporated into the Home Office in 1837. However the office was abolished in 1869 and its incumbent, Henry Thring, was appointed First Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury.J. C. Sainty, Office-Holders in Modern Britain: Volume 5, Home Office Officials 1782‚Äì1870 (University of London, 1975), pp. 11‚Äì44.Gregson's eventual replacement, but on a permanent and official footing, was John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune in 1835; he was succeeded in 1848 by Walter Coulson, and he in 1861 by Henry Thring. The counsel had a clerk after 1836, and there was also a Solicitor to the Home Office (William Vizard), appointed briefly between February and September 1841 and not replaced, the functions going to the Treasury Solicitor.

He was among many such American patriots living in British Colonial America on the eve of the Revolutionary War, who found themselves in circumstances which compelled them to make a personal contribution to the unfolding drama of one of history's most momentous events.  Early Life, education, and career path  Bartlett was born in North Guilford, New Haven County, Connecticut, the son of Daniel Jr. (1688‚Äì1769) and Ann (Collins) (1692‚Äì1745) Bartlett. He attended Yale and studied theology, graduating with an M.A. Degree in the Class of 1749. He became a Congregational minister, and soon after he was licensed to preach, the Hartford South Association recommended him to the Kensington Society ‚Äì the Congregational Church in Farmington, Connecticut ‚Äì as a pastoral candidate. The church at Farmington declined to offer him the pastorate, but from January to April of 1753, he preached on a trial basis at the Congregational Church of Redding, Fairfield County, Connecticut, to allow the congregation to evaluate his suitability for a position there. Between 1750 and 1753, the Redding church had taken four preachers under consideration as pastoral candidates. The first three were rejected, and they finally settled on Bartlett, being favorably disposed to his installation as their minister. In April of 1753, the Redding church called him to fill the opening for the full time pastoral position they had available. He was subsequently ordained by the Fairfield East Consociation on May 23, 1753. Per the Redding Church Records of that date, the pastors who assisted in his ordination were as follows: \\"The Rev. Mr. (Eben) White of Danbury gave the opening prayer ‚Äì the Rev. Mr. (Jonathan) Todd of East Guilford preached the sermon ‚Äì the Rev. Mr. (Elisha) Kent (unchurched at that time) gave the ordaining prayer ‚Äì the Rev. Mr. (Jedediah) Mills of Ripston gave the charge ‚Äì the Rev. Mr. (David) Judson of Newtown gave the right hand of fellowship ‚Äì the Rev. Mr. (Jonathan) Ingersoll of Ridgefield gave the closing prayer\\". Bartlett served at Redding for the next 57 years ‚Äì i.e. until near his death in 1810 ‚Äì thought to be the longest continuous pastorate in the history of the early New England churches up to that time. (The record was eventually lost, however, to the Rev. Samuel Nott, who served at Franklin, Connecticut 1782‚Äì1852, an unbelievable 70 years). Bartlett succeeded the first minister at Redding, Rev. Nathaniel Hunn ‚Äì and was in turn succeeded by the Rev. Daniel Crocker. Bartlett's youngest son, Rev. Jonathan Bartlett (1764‚Äì1858) served as co-pastor with his father for a few years, but resigned due to ill health prior to his father's death. The Rev. Daniel Crocker likewise served as co-pastor for a few months, following Bartlett's March 22, 1809 petition to the church board, that he be released from active service due to old age and infirmity.  The Revolutionary War  During the Revolutionary War, Bartlett was consistently a firebrand for the Colonial American cause, as were many Congregational ministers who thundered anti- British tirades from their pulpits week after week during the conflict. The British referred to pro-independence pastors as the ‚ÄúBlack Robed Regiment‚Äù, because of the black robes they wore in the pulpit, in conjunction with their propaganda campaign which made a significant contribution to the American war effort. So outspoken was Bartlett in his views, that the local Tories (loyalists) who were numerous in western Connecticut threatened to hang him if they could catch him. Due to these frequent and credible threats to his life, Bartlett was obligated to make his parochial rounds with a loaded musket in hand, as well as his Bible. He allowed war provisions to be stored in his home, including gunpowder in a bin which he constructed in the garret (attic) of his house, (discovered years later by his son the Rev. Jonathan Bartlett), which was quite dangerous ‚Äì both politically and otherwise. The atmosphere in Redding must have been very volatile throughout the war, as the local Episcopalians with their rector the Rev. John Beach were generally loyalists while the Congregationalists with their pastor Bartlett were generally rebels. Those of the Tory persuasion were sufficient in numbers to form themselves into the \\"Redding Loyalist Association\\", to which the Rev. John Beach lent his continuing support from the pulpit. The \\"Redding Loyalist Association\\" published a list of resolutions in support of the British Government, a document which was signed by 141 male residents (some of whom were minors), of whom 73 were from Redding with the rest being from outlying areas. With the village of Redding being thus split along political and religious denominational lines, there must have been considerable animosity between neighbors in so small a community, and no doubt many families experienced divided loyalties as well. The Bartlett family, however, was firmly united in support of the American cause. In addition to verbal assaults on the enemy, Bartlett supported the war effort by officiating as Military Chaplain to Continental Army General Israel Putnam's Division during their encampment in Redding the winter of 1778/79. Bartlett‚Äôs two oldest sons served in the Continental Army: Russell Bartlett (1754‚Äì1828) who enlisted in Danbury, Connecticut in the 6th Company of the 5th Regiment of the Connecticut Line, Capt. Noble Benedict's Company, and Daniel Collins Bartlett (1757‚Äì1837) who enlisted in Redding, Connecticut in the 10th Company of the 5th Regiment of the Connecticut Line, Capt. Zalmon Read's Company. One anecdote told about Bartlett, was that on a Sunday morning at the outbreak of the Revolution, he brought his own sword, newly ground, and presented it to his second son Daniel Collins Bartlett, instructing him to go and defend his country.  Domestic life  The year 1753 was an important one for the Bartlett family. In addition to becoming pastor at Redding, shortly thereafter on June 13 Bartlett married Eunice Russell (1725‚Äì1810), eldest daughter of Jonathan (1700‚Äì1774) and Eunice (Barker) (1703‚Äì1786) Russell of Branford, New Haven County Connecticut. Eunice (Russell) Bartlett's uncle, the Rev. Samuel Russell Jr., was pastor at the Congregational Church of North Guilford during the time Bartlett was growing up there. Her first cousin, Thomas Russell, was born the same year as Bartlett and also graduated from Yale in the Class of 1749. It is assumed therefore, that Nathaniel and Eunice became acquainted through the intermediary of these close relatives of hers in North Guilford. To the union of Nathaniel and Eunice (Russell) Bartlett, were born six known children: Russell b 1754, Daniel Collins b 1757, Anne b 1759, Eunice b 1761, Jonathan b 1764, and Lucretia b 1768, all born in Redding. Also in the busy year 1753, Nathaniel and Eunice began construction of a New England salt-box style house in Redding, on 20 acres of land donated by the church as part of the settlement arrangements for his pastorate, being a common practice of the era. Per the Redding Church Records, the property was deeded over to Bartlett on June 08, 1753, by Deacon Lemuel Sanford. \\"June 8, 1753, was the date of Mr. Bartlett's receipt of a deed of twenty acres of land to his ‚Äúexceptance and full satisfaction‚Äù, quoted from the church records\\". Now identified as the Jonathan B. Sanford House in the Survey of Historic Buildings in the Library of Congress, it is still in use today as a single family residence. (The original land holding is intact as well, as the Internet currently shows the property lot size as 21.59 acres). In its external appearance, it remains virtually unchanged from how it must originally have looked, except for a wing added on to the east in 1847, and a patio out back. It is located on 10 Cross Highway, just off Route # 107 in Redding Center, directly across from the \\"Heritage House\\" senior center- near the site of the original Congregational Church, which burned down on May 04, 1942. After the deaths of Nathaniel and Eunice in 1810, the house was inherited by their youngest son, the Rev. Jonathan Bartlett, the only son who remained in Connecticut. (Russell Bartlett was living in Cooperstown, Otsego County, New York, and Daniel Collins Bartlett was living in Amenia, Dutchess County, New York at the time of their parents‚Äô deaths). Upon his death in 1858, the Rev. Jonathan Bartlett who died childless, in turn passed the house down to his nephew by marriage and second cousin on the maternal side, Lemuel Sanford IV. The Bartlett / Sanford House remained in the Sanford family until finally being sold out of the family on May 21, 1969.  Dual career  Bartlett was a teacher as well as a minister, which was a common practice in that era, preparing many young men for higher education. \\"In addition to his pastoral duties he instructed many of the youth of the town in academic studies\\". His most noted pupil was the poet Joel Barlow, one of the \\"Hartford Wits\\". While attending the village school which Bartlett taught in Redding, Joel Barlow composed poetry in his free time. Recognizing his talent, Bartlett showed the boy's poems to Joel's father, recommending that a youth with such promise should be prepared for college. Joel's father agreed, and Joel was tutored by Bartlett 1772‚Äì1773. Joel Barlow went on to write numerous poems, which were famous in their day. Joel went to France during the French Revolution, and died during Napoleon's disastrous retreat from Russia while serving with the French Army as a special envoy from President James Madison.  Death  Bartlett died in Redding, Connecticut on January 11, 1810. His widow survived him by only a few months, passing away on August 2nd of that same year. Bartlett was said to be a fine scholar and an eloquent preacher, who tended to the spiritual and temporal needs of his flock until very near the end of his long productive life. Upon his death, an inventory of his estate revealed assets of around $5,000.00 in value, including a small library of some 24 volumes and 85 pamphlets.

James is variously described as an American outlaw, bank and train robber, guerrilla, and leader of the James‚ÄìYounger Gang. After the American civil war, as members of various gangs of outlaws, Jesse and Frank James robbed banks, stagecoaches, and trains across the Midwest, gaining national fame and even sympathy despite their crimes. James became an iconic figure from the era, and his life has been dramatized and memorialized numerous times. Literature The James brothers became a staple in dime novels of the era, peaking in the 1880s following Jesse's death. James has often been used as a fictional character in many Western novels, including some published while he was alive. For instance, in Willa Cather's My √Åntonia, the narrator reads a book entitled 'Life of Jesse James' ‚Äì probably referring to a dime novel. In Charles Portis's 1968 novel True Grit, U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn describes fighting with Cole Younger and Frank James for the Confederacy during the Civil War. Long after his adventure with Mattie Ross, Cogburn ends his days in a traveling road show with the aged Cole Younger and Frank James. During his travel to the \\"Wilde West\\", Oscar Wilde visited Jesse James' hometown in Missouri. Learning that James had been assassinated by his own gang member, \\"an event that sent the town into mourning and scrambling to buy Jesse's artifacts\\", and heightened the \\"romantic appeal of the social outcast\\" in his mind, Wilde wrote in a letter home that: \\"Americans are certainly great hero- worshippers, and always take [their] heroes from the criminal classes.\\" Video game In Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure, the characters must give an Uzi to Jesse James. Jesse James has been playable in two games Gunfighter: The Legend of Jesse James for PlayStation and Gunfighter II: Revenge of Jesse James for PlayStation 2. He appears as an antagonist in Call of Juarez: Gunslinger (2013), where he is faced down against Silas Greaves in a duel. Jesse James' severed hand (or \\"shooting hand\\") makes various appearances throughout the Sam & Max point-and-click adventure game adaptations, often used as a solution to in-game puzzles. Comics In 1969, artist Morris and writer Ren√© Goscinny (co-creator of Asterix) had Lucky Luke confronting Jesse James, his brother Frank, and Cole Younger. The adventure poked fun at the image of Jesse as a new Robin Hood. Although he passes himself off as such and does indeed steal from the rich (who are, logically, the only ones worth stealing from), he and his gang take turns being \\"poor,\\" thus keeping the loot for themselves. Frank quotes from Shakespeare, and Younger is portrayed as a fun-loving joker, full of good humor. One critic has likened this version of the James brothers as \\"intellectuals bandits, who won't stop theorizing their outlaw activities and hear themselves talk.\\"Fans de Lucky Luke website.\\" fandeluckyluke.com. (in French) In the end, the at- first-cowed people of a town fight back against the James gang and send them packing in tar and feathers. Music Stage productions The musical melodrama \\"Jesse,\\" written by Bob and Marion Moulton with lyrics by Prairie Home Companion writer/performer Vern Sutton and music by William Huckaby and Donna Paulsen, has since 1976 (the centennial of the James-Younger gang's Northfield bank raid) traditionally been performed in Northfield, Minnesota, during the town's annual Defeat of Jesse James Days.

Common names include the unstable limpet, the unstable seaweed limpet and the rocking chair limpet. It is native to the northern Pacific Ocean where it feeds on kelp in the intertidal zone and the shallow sub-littoral zone. Description The shell of Lottia instabilis is specially adapted by the shape of its rim to adhere to the holdfasts and stipes of kelp. The sides of the rim are elongated and nearly parallel, but both anterior and posterior end are raised up; this means it cannot lie flat and seal itself to a level surface but it can seal to a curved surface. The shell is smooth with an even margin. It is often mainly brownish, and may be paler near the apex, which is somewhat towards the anterior end of the shell. The interior of the shell is bluish-white, sometimes with a dark margin and a dark blotch near the apex. Individuals in the northern part of the range tend to have solid shell colors and be larger than those in the south, which tend to have tesselated patterns of brown and gray on their shells. Distribution and habitat Native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean, L. instabilis is present from Kodiak Island, off the coast of Alaska, to San Diego, California. It is often found on the holdfasts and stipes of kelp, at depths ranging from the intertidal zone down to about . It also occurs on bare rock and sometimes on the shells of gastropod mollusks, including those occupied by hermit crabs. Ecology L. instabilis is a herbivore and feeds directly on kelps such as Saccharina dentigera and Pterygophora californica. Being such a specialised feeder, it can essentially be considered to be a parasite of the kelp host. It is part of a genus whose rock-associated members are distributed widely in the Pacific Ocean and this species probably evolved in the Pacific, alongside its kelp hosts. The purple seastar (Pisaster ochraceus) is a predator of this limpet, and when the seastar approaches, the limpet flees.

Bureau of Labor and Industries, 859 P.2d 1143 (Or. 1993) was a case in which the Oregon Supreme Court established a binding methodological regime for conducting statutory interpretation. The case was unique in its application of stare decisis principles to interpretive methodology, mandating a specific interpretive approach to statutes in a way that the federal courts have not. The judicial \\"experiment\\" enjoyed sixteen years of consistent application before a case in 2009 undermined the interpretive framework.  Background  The case was brought by Portland General Electric Co. (PGE) to review an order of the Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) that had determined PGE had engaged in an unlawful employment practice. Specifically, the issue was PGE had denied a request by an employee to use paid sick leave during parental leave. The legal issue for the courts revolved around the rules of statutory interpretation. A frequent criticism of statutory interpretation, particularly at the federal level, is the wide range of discretion left to judges to apply varying interpretive rules, in varying ways, in order to construe statutes. Notable interpretive theories are textualism, intentionalism, and purposivism. Even within such theories, individual judges may differ as to the order and weight they give to particular rules of construction. Professor Abbe Gluck writes that states have led the way in attempting to bring more consistency to statutory interpretation, most notably the Oregon Supreme Court in the PGE case and its progeny.  The PGE Framework  The case, which concerned whether an Oregon statute allowed an employee to receive paid parental sick leave even when they had not met certain conditions agreed to in collective bargaining, established a hierarchical, three-tier framework of statutory interpretation. = Step 1 = Under PGE, Oregon courts had to first look to the text of the statute, including relevant context such as similar statutes and other provisions within the same statute. If the text and context made the intent of the legislature clear with respect to the statutory provision, the inquiry ended. Only if legislative intent remained ambiguous after this first step could the court move on to the second step. = Step 2 = Next, the court would look at legislative history for clues as to the statute's meaning. Again, if this step made the meaning clear, the court's analysis would end; if not, it would continue to step three. = Step 3 = Finally, if the first two levels left the question unresolved, the court would use \\"general maxims of statutory construction\\" to reach a conclusion.  Aftermath of PGE  Oregon courts uniformly followed the PGE framework as binding precedent for sixteen years, from 1993 to 2009, with no member of the Oregon Supreme Court second-guessing the methodological mandate during that time. This consistent application of the methodology occurred despite the legislature's enactment of a 2001 statute that may have ambiguously sought to limit it.Or. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 174.020(3). The PGE framework had several observable impacts on the way Oregon courts resolved statutory questions. It greatly cut down on consideration of legislative history, with the Supreme Court reaching the second step of the framework only 9 times out of 150 cases that cited PGE between 1999 and 2006. In that time, it reached the third step just once. Because post-PGE cases so rarely went beyond the textual/contextual first step, especially when compared to pre-PGE trends, Professor Gluck termed the framework \\"modified textualism.\\" Additionally, the framework may have contributed to more consistent and predictable interpretive conclusions, with the Supreme Court resolving 53 of 59 statutory cases unanimously between 2005 and 2009. The methodological consensus appeared to end in 2009, when State v. Gaines, 206 P.3d 1042 (Or. 2009) suggested that the court could consider legislative history with or without ambiguity at Step 1, even as it professed continued adherence to PGE.

It belongs to the family Microcotylidae.Goto, S. (1899). Notes on some exotic species of ectoparasitic trematodes (Vol. 12). Imperial University of Tokyo. Taxonomy Microcotyle pomatomi was described by Goto in 1899 from the gills of the bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix (Pomatomidae) collected at Newport off Rhode Island, United States. It was redescribed by Lebedev et al., (1969) from Pomatomus saltatrix off south- western Africa and by Williams (1991) on the base of 7 specimens from the gills of Pomatomus saltatrix off western Australia. Williams (1991) compared Microcotyle collected from Pomatomus saltatrix off Western Australia with M. pomotomi, M. australiensis, M. temnodontis and M. debueni from the same host and noted important problems with the parasite taxonomy. The only significant morphological difference detected in the material examined by William was the distribution of spines of the genital atrium in specimens from Western Australia vs specimens from South Africa . However, this differences was considered insufficient to separate these specimens as different species. William (1991) concluded that M. australiensis, M. temnodontis, and M. debueni were erroneously described as distinct species, and considered all of them junior synonyms of M. pomatomi due to the overall similarity in morphology and overlap in measurements, not to mention that those species were described from the same host without any comparison with M. pomatomi. In 1972, Caballero y Caballero and Bravo-Hollis erected the genus Paramicrocotyle to describe Paramicrocotyle tampicensis and Paramicrocotyle atriobursata off Mexico; they placed within this genus 16 species previously assigned to the genus Microcotyle. including M. temnodontis and M. pomatomi.Caballero y Caballero, E., & Bravo-Hollis, M.

Unnithan (1971) placed M. pomatomi in the nominal subgenus Microcotyle as Microcotyle (Microcotyle) pomatomi and M. australiensis in the new genus and subgenus Caenomicrocotyle and Notaster as Caenomicrocotyle (Notaster) australiensis.Unnithan, R.

American Midland Naturalist, 366‚Äì398. However, these two species were returned to the genus Microcotyle by Mamaev who considered Paramicrocotyle a junior subjective synonym of Microcotyle.Mamaev, Y. L. (1986). The taxonomical composition of the family Microcotylidae Taschenberg, 1879 (Monogenea). Folia Parasitologica, 33, 199‚Äì206. Due to the confusion of the nomenclature surrounding the validity of Caenomicrocotyle-Notasterand Paramicrocotyle, these species were also synonymised with M. pomatomi and retained in the genus Microcotyle until a detailed revision of the Microcotylidae. The specific epithet pomatomi is derived from the generic name of the type host Pomatomus saltatrix (Pomatomidae). Description Microcotyle pomatomi has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a flat syn1metrical elongated body comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is symmetrical and bears 70 pairs of clamps, arranged as two rows, one on each side. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two small buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a muscular pharynx, a moderate length oesophagus ending a little behind the genital atriuml pore,and a posterior intestine with two branches provided with numerous lateral diverticula on the inner and outer sides except for the terminal portion of the branche. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium opening a little in front of the hind end of the oesophagus and armed with slightly recurved conical spines, a dorsal vagina opening much behind the posterior end of the oesophagus as the common genital opening is before it, a single irregularly S-shaped ovary, and 50 small testeswhich are posterior to the ovary, extending from the hind end of the ovary to near the hind end of the body proper. The sequence of the species' ITS2 rDNA gene has been published. =Pathology= The species has been reported as causing mortality in the bluefish and the striped bass.

Early life  Sebastian Lane was born to his father, the American blues artist, Jimmy D. Lane and French mother, Isabelle. He is the grandson of Blues Hall of Fame inductee Jimmy Rogers, who gained prominence as the guitarist for the Muddy Waters Band. Lane began playing guitar at age three. Growing up, he found influence and drew inspiration from his father and grandfather, as well as musicians such as Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Doyle Bramhall II, The Rolling Stones, Gary Clark Jr and Freddie King. Lane never took guitar lessons. He learned by ear, teaching himself by listening to various songs repetitively. After the passing of his grandfather in 1997, the Lane family left Chicago, Illinois and moved to Salina, Kansas, where Sebastian's father was hired by Chad Kassem to work at Blue Heaven Studios and APO Records. Blue Heaven Studios and Kassem hosted a yearly festival known as \\"Blues Masters at the Crossroads\\". This festival was geared towards bringing in blues musicians from the south and around the country who did not have much longer to live and share their art. Surrounded by this atmosphere further attracted Lane to blues culture and inevitably led him to pursue a similar path. Since childhood, Lane has split his interests between music and following his passions for science and medicine. His interest in medicine arose after the passing of his grandfather, secondary to colon cancer. His family moved several more times before settling in Vancouver, Canada after his father remarried. Lane attended four high schools before graduating from Sullivan Heights Secondary School in the spring of 2011. He enrolled at Hastings College, where he graduated with his Bachelor's degree in biology. He was then accepted at University of Nebraska Medical Center for medical school He released his debut album Walkin' By Myself in July 2018 while on a rotation in Pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Omaha.  Career  Lane has worked for other artists as a studio guitarist and ghost writer. = Sebastian Lane Band = In 2018 he decided to focus on his own music and developed the Sebastian Lane Band. This group is a modern age rock band with influences from Lane's blues heritage. The group features Lane on vocals and lead guitar, Ben Curran on guitar, Dain Armbrust on bass guitar, Kevin Fries on drums and Mitch Towne on keyboards. Occasionally, Grace Calderon, joins the ensemble. Several of these musicians started with the Omaha Blues Society and their program called Blues Ed. Curran was accepted into Berklee College of Music. Lane released his debut album, Walkin' By Myself in July 2018. The album featured Eric Gales on the song \\"Jezebel\\" and Christone \\"Kingfish\\" Ingram on a cover of blues standard \\"Catfish Blues\\". The album, and their growing support in the midwest landed them opening spots with Jimmie Vaughan, Robert Randolph, Marcus King Band, Eric Gales, Joanne Shaw Taylor, Indigenous, Anthony Gomes, Albert Castiglia and others. Lane was nominated as both \\"Artist of the Year\\" and \\"Best Blues Artist\\" in the Omaha Entertainment and Arts Awards. Their album accumulated over a quarter million streams on Apple Music and Spotify across over 30 different countries.

She commenced work with the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1941 and her voice is preserved on the earliest surviving news item contained in the broadcaster's archive, which is a 1941 radio story on protecting active servicemen in World War II from creditors. Radio career Doyle had previously worked as a librarian and hostess at the Pickwick Book Club in Sydney before responding to an advertisement for radio announcers. Following an audition which included reading a weather report and a paragraph of news, she was appointed from a pool of 500 applicants. The choice of a female radio announcer was a deliberate wartime measure to enable men to leave employment and participate in World War II and had already been enacted by the British Broadcasting Commission. Personal life Doyle was the eldest daughter of Trevor Mervyn Doyle (26 April 1883 ‚Äì ) of Tamworth and Winifred Amy Doyle (n√©e Szchille) ( ‚Äì 11 February 1957) of Sydney. She married the pastoralist George Wallace Henderson ( ‚Äì 2002) on 8 April 1941 and they lived on their property 'Rannoch', near Blayney. They did not have children. Philanthropic work The Hendersons were generous philanthropists and patrons of the arts, especially opera and music. They were involved in numerous scholarships and donations. In 1993, the Margaret Henderson Scholarship was established at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music from personal donations made by Doyle and, in 1996, she founded the Margaret Henderson Music Trust in Orange. Prior to her death in 2002, music students from the conservatorium would regularly visit to perform for Doyle in her nursing home in Kings Cross. The couple bequeathed sixteen million dollars to the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. It was the largest donation ever made to an Australian performing arts institution.

The revenue source of a traditional publisher is through the sale of books (and other related materials) that they publish, while the revenue of hybrid publishers comes from both book sales and fees charged for the execution of their publishing services. To be a hybrid publisher, a company must uphold longstanding publishing industry standards and best practices.  Business model  The traditional publishing model assumes no financial risk for the author. The publisher pays an advance to the author to publish their work, then proceeds to prepare that work for publishing. The publisher pays for all the editorial including the authors advance, production, marketing, sales, distribution, and wholesale costs and does not begin to recoup their investment in the book until the book is on the market and begins to sell. The hybrid publisher follows this same model except the author is the one to assume the financial risk for their book. Rather than paying an author an advance, the hybrid publisher charges the author a fee for their publishing services. The author stills receives royalties on their book sales, as with the traditional method, but they must pay the fee for publishers services to get their book to market. Another qualification of the hybrid model is that the royalties for authors who elect to publish with the hybrid method should be higher than with the traditional publishing standard. In some cases the publisher also bears a portion of the cost for production, printing, or other publishing-related services‚Äîsuch as marketing or sales, since both the author and publisher share in the profits. All the functions of a traditional press including evaluating submissions, editorial reviews (including substantive, developmental and stylistic editing), copywriting, design, proofreading, and print production are all part of the services that a hybrid publisher must also offer. As hybrid publishing has become more popular over the years, the definition has become more clear, especially with standards put forward by the Independent Book Publishers Association (IBPA) in 2018 for hybrid publishers to follow. The IBPA lists the following nine standards that should be followed by hybrid publishers: * Hybrid publishers must set forth a vision to follow for their company. * Submissions must be reviewed and vetted to not be classified as a vanity press. * The publisher must publish as its own defined imprint and request its own ISBNs. * Hybrid publishers must meet the standards and best practices set out by the publishing industry. * The quality of the production (design and printing) and editorial services must be up to industry standards. * The hybrid publisher must manage the rights of the works they publish as well as any subsequent rights that are acquired and work to find additional rights to sell for their authors. * Hybrid publishers must manage distribution services or hire a distributor for their authors' works. * Hybrid publishers need to report reputable sales on the titles they publish. * Authors who sign with hybrid publishers must be paid a higher royalty than that of standard traditional publisher rates (see Royalty payment). Hybrid publishers often have their own specialties, such as Page Two Strategies, which is a publisher that primarily focuses on non-fiction books in the business category. Hybrid publishers also often find success working with authors who have established audience bases such as an author who has become an expert in their field and wants to publish a book about their practice, garnering them more credibility.  History  Hybrid publishers are not a new phenomenon and have developed alongside the traditional publishing model. As traditional publishers face higher competition than ever with more difficulty determining which books will sell and which won't, some have turned to creative ways of publishing to subsidize their business models. Experimenting with author funded projects has been around for as long as modern publishing has, with books from the 19th century using the vanity press model. Hybrid publishing has also evolved with the introduction of print on demand (POD) services, allowing publishers to produce smaller print runs, and get creative with how they produce and distribute their books. Subcategories of the hybrid model continue to emerge as the industry evolves. One such subcategory is the crowdfunding model used by publishers like Unbound who, after a book is acquired, help their authors to crowdfund their books to cover costs, while still maintaining their role as hybrid publisher, supplying quality publishing services to their authors.  Publishing variations  = Vanity presses vs. the hybrid model = A key differentiating factor between the hybrid model and vanity presses is that hybrid publishers usually still curate the books that they publish to particular categories, genres or quality standards. Vanity presses on the other hand are typically less selective. This can make it easier for authors to get published through a vanity press but they may also be associated with less credibility than publishing with a hybrid publisher who is required to adhere to the standards listed above. The hybrid model is a more credible model than vanity presses‚Äînot only because of the curatorial function, but because the publisher has a stake in the book's success. They share in the profit, so it is in their interest to sell, distribute, and market it effectively. Vanity presses are more closely related to the self publishing model since they do not take a cut of the books sales. Once publishing services are completed, they are usually no longer involved in the process. The hybrid model has ties to both traditional publishing and self publishing, but uses the best practices of both models. = Self publishing vs. the hybrid model = Hybrid publishing is an alternative to self publishing where authors publish their book on their own without any help or contract out specific services such as editing or cover design. Hybrid publishing allows authors to find high quality publishing services within one company so they don't have to act as general contractors, hiring all the services they need separately. Though as with traditional publishers, not every publisher is the same. Some offer full service marketing capabilities while other do not market an authors book. It is up to the author to look at each publisher before deciding which method to use. As mentioned above, the hybrid model is more than just the publishing services offered by the vanity model. Unlike both vanity presses and self publishing methods, they should be involved throughout the whole publishing process. Self publishing affords the author freedom in exactly how they decide to get their book to market. Hybrid publishing may restrict some of this creative freedom in the same way that traditional publishers operate, doing what they believe is best for the book and the market rather than the author leading the editorial and design decisions. Each hybrid publisher is different and vary by how much creative freedom they give authors, and other criteria. = Academic hybrid publishing = Hybrid models can be applied to more specific areas of publishing such as academic publishing. Traditional academic publishing is funded by the readers of the journal that publish the work, through reader and institution subscriptions and payments‚Äîwhereas in open access journals, the author usually pays. For journals to attract both authors who can and cannot pay to make their work public, some adopt a hybrid model to use both payments from readers and authors to fund the publishing of scholarly works. These hybrid academic publishers let authors who have been acquired, choose whether to go with the reader funded, or author funded model. If reader funded, the scholarly work is available to only readers willing to pay; if author funded, the work is available openly for free.

Upon its completion in late 2010, it was one of the largest CPV facilities in the world, and the first utility- scale installation of Concentrix Solar technology in the United States. Annual electricity production is expected to average about 2.1 GW¬∑h, and is being sold to the Kit Carson Electric Cooperative under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA). Facility details The facility was built by Chevron Technology Ventures on a reclaimed site previously used for the collection and storage of molybdenum mine tailings. It consists of 173 dual-axis-tracking CX-P6 systems, each of which supports 90 CX-75 CPV modules. Each module contains 200 fresnel lens to concentrate sunlight 500 times onto multijunction photovoltaic cells. These features enable higher efficiencies - about 40% for cells and 27% for modules - than other photovoltaic technologies. Each of the 173 trackers has its own grid-connected inverter, which also serves as the control system of the mechanical tracking and as the communication port with its own IP address. The inverter technology was developed by Fraunhofer ISE in cooperation with Concentrix Solar and has an efficiency of 96%.

It belongs to the family Microcotylidae. Machida, M. & Azaki, J., 1977, Monogenetic and digenetic trematodes of the sweeper, Pempheris xanthoptera. Bulletin of the National Science Museum, Tokyo, s. A, Zoology, v. 3 (1), 1-7 PDF Taxonomy Microcotyle pempheri was first described by Machida & Azaki in 1977, from the gills of Pempheris xanthoptera (Pempheridae) off southern Japan. The specific epithet pempheri is not explained in the original description but obviously derives from the generic name of the type host Pempheris xanthoptera. Description Microcotyle pempheri has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with an elongate body, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is in form of an inverse triangle and bears 75-103 clamps, arranged as two rows, one on each side. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a globular to oval pharynx, a simple oesophagus bifurcating posteriorly to the genital pore and a posterior intestine with two branches provided with short lateral branches. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior large cup-shaped muscular genital atrium, densely armed with thorn-like spines, a dorsal vagina opening some distance posteriorly to the genital pore, a single tubular ovary shaped like a question mark, vitellaria and 11-21 testes oval or irregular in shape. Eggs are fusiform, with a very long anterior filament and much shorter posterior filament. The species can be distinguished from the most closely related species Microcotyle emmelichthyops Yamaguti, 1968Yamaguti, S. (1968). Monogenetic trematodes of Hawaiian fishes. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. by the absence of a posterior chamber in the genital atrium, a smaller number of testes and the structure of the middle spring of the clamp.

In October 2018, Netflix acquired international broadcasting rights to the series. Keshet has commissioned a second season. The series will also be adapted into an English version for the United States market.

He joined the Royal Navy at the age of 10, initially serving under the command of his uncle, Admiral William Hotham, GCB. From 1805 to 1814 he served on the Mediterranean Station and was present at the capture of Capri and the Siege of Gaeta in 1806. He was then involved in the disastrous Walcheren Campaign of 1809 and the Siege of C√°diz in 1810, taking part in the defence of the nearby Fort Matagorda. In 1811 he was posted to the Adriatic and promoted lieutenant the following year. There he took part in the capture of Fiume on 3 July 1813, the storming and capture of the fortress of Farasina, and the capture of the arsenal at Trieste. For the next year he commanded a small fleet which operated on the River Po assisting the Austrian Army and was promoted commander in 1814. In January 1836 Hotham was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order (KH) and retired in October 1846.

Brown was a steam tanker built in 1920‚Äì1921 by Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation of Chester for Tide Water Oil Co., a subsidiary of Standard Oil, with intention of operating between New York and oil-producing ports of the southern United States and Mexico. The ship was named after Samuel Queen Brown, one of the founders of Tide Water Pipe Co. and former president of the Chester Oil Company. Design and Construction Early in 1920 Tide Water Oil Co. decided to add several modern tankers to expand their fleet of four vessels operating between the southern oil ports and New York and New Jersey. A contract for two of them, of approximately 10,000 deadweight, was awarded to the Merchant Shipbuilding Corp. and the ship was laid down at the shipbuilder's yard in Chester (yard number 384) on 1 October 1920, and launched on 15 October 1921, with Miss Louise Van Voorhees of New York, granddaughter of late Samuel Q. Brown, serving as the sponsor. The ship was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel, had two main decks and a shelter deck. Samuel Q. Brown had electric lights installed along the decks, and was also equipped with wireless of De Forest type. Following the delivery of the vessel on 5 November 1921, the tanker immediately departed for her six-hour long trial trip, during which the steamer performed satisfactorily. Upon completion, she immediately sailed out on her maiden voyage to Palo Blanco to load a cargo of oil. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Samuel Q. Brown was assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 11,260. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom, and a single 584 Nhp oil-burning triple expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . Operational history After completion of sea trials the tanker was transferred to her owners and departed for her maiden trip on the same day to Palo Blanco, one of a few large oil storage facility on the Mexican Gulf coast, near Tamiahua. Samuel Q. Brown continued carrying crude oil between the Mexican ports of Puerto Lobos, Tuxpan and Tampico and New York through the end of September 1922. Following a decline in the production of Mexican oilfields around that time, the tanker along with many other vessels, was rerouted to carry oil from Californian oilfields instead. The tanker passed through the Panama Canal on November 8 on her first trip to San Pedro and again on her return journey on December 3 with 10,000 tons of oil destined for New York. The tanker continued sailing on the California to New York route through mid 1928. For example, she made eight round-trip journeys between August 1924 and July 1925 season each time carrying approximately 10,000 tons of crude oil on her eastward trips. From July 1928 through October 1929 she was put on the Gulf coast to New York route, carrying oil from Humble Oil and Magnolia Petroleum Company facilities at Beaumont to New York and New Jersey. During the rest of 1929 the tanker made two trips from the West coast transporting gasoline from California to New York and Baltimore, before returning to carrying oil from the Gulf ports in early April 1930. From April 1930 and onward Samuel Q. Brown was mainly involved in transportation of crude oil from the terminals of Magnolia Petroleum Company in Beaumont and Sinclair Oil Corporation and Texas Company in Port Arthur to the refineries in the Northeast ports of New York and Philadelphia, including Tidewater Oil own refinery in Bayonne. The vessel continued serving that route, as well as transporting crude and fuel oil from Houston to the ports of the Northeast through the end of 1936. Starting with late 1936 the tanker shifted her operations and started carrying oil from the Magnolia Petroleum Company terminal at the Louisiana port of Lake Charles in addition to occasional trips to Beaumont and Port Arthur facilities. During her career the vessel came to the rescue on several occasions. In April 1931 the tanker saved three passengers from a disabled motorboat who were drifting for 13 days without much food or water after their vessel broke down on their trip from Bimini to Miami. On 28 September 1940 Samuel Q. Brown came to the aid of sinking schooner Alice Tebb after her seams came undone in rough weather off Georgia coast, about 100 miles northeast of Jacksonville. The tanker was joined in the rescue operation by cutter who gave medical aid to schooner's chief engineer who suffered broken leg and internal injuries during the rescue. The entire 33-men crew was safely landed at Bayonne on October 3 after battling through heavy seas on their way north. =Sinking= Samuel Q. Brown left New Orleans for Honolulu in the morning of May 20, 1942 transporting approximately 80,000 barrels of Navy No.6 fuel oil. The vessel was under command of captain Aksel Andersen and had a crew of eight officers and thirty one men in addition to sixteen Naval guards. During the day of May 22 the tanker, while travelling through the Yucat√°n Channel, maintained a zigzagging course but with the onset of darkness discontinued her evasive maneuvers. At approximately 01:39 on May 23 the ship was spotted by who started shadowing the ship until 04:02 when a spread of two torpedoes was fired by the submarine with both of them missing the ship. U-103 continued following the tanker, and launched another attack at 09:26, about 100 miles south of Cape Corrientes. Samuel Q. Brown was hit by a single torpedo on her port side, between the #9 main hold and the after fuel tanks. The resulting explosion killed two crew members, and set the vessel on fire immediately, destroying the main mast and the antenna, preventing her radio operator from sending a distress call. The engines were reversed but the fire spread very quickly, forcing the captain to order everyone to abandon ship. Two lifeboats and two rafts were launched but due to the speed with which the fire spread, the entire crew was forced to jump overboard. The U-boat surfaced about twenty minutes later and questioned the crew before delivering a coup de gr√¢ce to the ship at 10:35 and leaving the area. Later in the day on May 23 the two lifeboats were spotted by a patrol plane from the Upham Naval Air Station, who took five injured men on board and brought them to a hospital at Key West. The next day, the remainder of the crew was picked up by destroyer and transported to Crist√≥bal. Despite two torpedo hits, Samuel Q. Brown continued floating and burning until she was scuttled by gun fire from Goff at 21:20 on May 24.

It was the eighth of LaRue's films for Ormond's Western Adventures Productions Inc.p. 190 Drew, Bernard A. Motion Picture Series and Sequels: A Reference Guide Routledge, 4 Dec 2013 The film was the second to be released by Howco, Ron Ormond's new film company composed of Ormond and drive-in movie owners Joy N. Houck and J. Francis White, and Ormond's first film as director. The screenplay is co- written by Jack Lewis and Associate Producer Ira S. Webb. Jack Holt and Tom Neal return from the previous film but in different roles. The film was shot at the Iverson Movie Ranch. Plot US Marshal Lash and Deputy Marshal Fuzzy are sent to the stop a gang led by a bullwhip wielding masked bandit called El Azote who are terrorising the area through murder and armed robbery. Ambushed by a group of seven riders, Lash and Fuzzy evade them and make their way to Tioga City. Upon arrival in town Lash notices the local newspaper informed the town of the arrival of a marshal and deputy. This leads Lash to believe that someone at the newspaper let the news out as opposed to their usual clandestine arrival in order to kill them. After a fight in a saloon where Lash uses his whip on a thug, he meets Benson, the owner of the saloon. Lash informs Benson that they were waylaid by a gang of men. Lash decides to allay suspicion of their true identities by telling Benson they saw the bodies of a Marshal and his deputy that they buried. Benson notices Lash's prowess with a bullwhip in the fight and schemes to dress Lash as El Azote to reap profits and give El Azote the blame. Lash agrees as he feel this will get him closer to the identity of El Azote. Eventually Lash and Fuzzy's true identities as lawmen are discovered; they are captured, disarmed and tied up. Escaping their bonds by using their spurs, Lash and Fuzzy bring El Azote and his outlaw gang to justice; Lash using his whip, Fuzzy using his slingshot. The film features two climaxes. Lash and El Azote have a bullwhip fight to the finish whilst Fuzzy, who constantly regales all and sundry of his imaginary friendship and adventures with Buffalo Bill comes to face with the real Bill Cody... Production US Marine, Western movie fan and aspiring screenwriter Jack Lewis had met Lash Larue and suggested he had an idea for a screenplay for him. Larue told Lewis he had a new producer, Ron Ormond and to contact him. By chance Lewis had also met Al St. John when his motorcycle needed repair outside his farm. Ormond agreed to use the screenplay but advised Lewis to not give Larue any lines over ten words and to let St. John write his own comedy.Lewis, Jack C. White Horse, Black Hat: A Quarter Century on Hollywood's Poverty Row Scarecrow Press, 16 Oct 2002 The film was shot in five days for $40,000 with the climatic bullwhip duel filmed in one afternoon. King of the Bullwhip also used several sequences of action and chase footage from previous Ormond Larue films. By the time the film was released Lewis was back in the Marine Corps en route to the Korean War. Ormond offered Lewis screenplay credits on other of their films to keep his name active whilst he was in Korea, but Lewis turned the offer down. In addition to Ormond's father in law Cliff Taylor appearing in the film, Joy Houck's son Willis and Ira Webb's daughter Mary Lou make appearances.

The database contains over 773 million unique email addresses and 21 million unique passwords, resulting in more than 2.7 billion email/password pairs. The list, reviewed by computer security experts, contains exposed addresses and passwords from over 2000 previous data breaches as well as an estimated 140 million new email addresses and 10 million new passwords from previously unknown sources, and collectively makes it the largest data breach on the Internet. Collection #1 was discovered by security researcher Troy Hunt, founder of \\"Have I Been Pwned?,\\" a website that allows users to search their email addresses and passwords to know if either has appeared in a known data breach. The database had been briefly posted to Mega in January 2019, and links to the database posted in a popular hacker forum. Hunt discovered that the offering contained 87 gigabytes of data across 12,000 files. Not only was this discovery of concern to Hunt, but he further found that the passwords were available in plaintext format rather than in their hashed version. This implied that the creators of this database had been able to successfully de-hash these passwords from weak or compromised encryption schemes. Security researchers noted that unlike other username/password lists which are usually sold on the dark web, Collection #1 was temporarily available at no cost, and could potentially be used by a larger number of malicious agents, primarily for credential stuffing. Within a day, Brian Krebs, a cybersecurity journalist, had been in contact with one of those selling Collection #1, and learned there were seven additional collections of similar username/password combinations, with the total contents of the collections being more than 500 GB, compared to the 87 GB from Collection #1. The additional contents of these additional collections is not yet known. By January 30, 2019, security researchers observed that similar sets of data, named Collections #2 through #5, have been seen for sale on the dark web. Collections #2-5 included over 845 gigabytes of data, with a total of 25 billion email/password records. Security researchers at Hasso Plattner Institute estimated that Collections #2-5, after removing duplicates, has about three times as much data as Collection #1. Many of the email/password pairs in the collection were found to be from previous breaches including the Yahoo! data breaches, and breaches from LinkedIn and Dropbox. Arrests According to threat intelligence firm IntSights, Collection #1 through #5 had been compiled by a hacker known as Sanix; however, the data was leaked online by a rival data broker known as Azatej. Both hackers were arrested in May 2020. Azatej was arrested in Poland, and Sanix in Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by IRA volunteers from the Provisional IRA's East Tyrone Brigade on 16 December 1979, along the Ballygawley Road, just outside Dungannon in County Tyrone. Four British soldiers who were on mobile patrol were killed in the ambush. Background After decreasing violence in 1977 and 1978, there was an upsurge of armed incidents in 1979 in Northern Ireland, with the Provisional IRA beginning its \\"Long War\\" offensive. 1979 became the worst year for British Army and RUC killings in Ireland since 1974. On 27 August the IRA carried out the Warrenpoint ambush in south County Down near the border, the roadside bomb attack killed 18 British soldiers and injured six others, it was the heaviest loss the British Army suffered at the hands of the IRA during the whole conflict.Peter Taylor - Behind The Mask: The IRA & Sinn Fein pp.266 Attack On 16 December 1979 an IRA active service unit from the East Tyrone brigade set up a landmine under a culvert along the Ballygawley Road, just outside Dungannon. The land mine was detonated by the IRA unit using a wireless remote controlled device to activate the detonator as a British Army mobile patrol passed in a landrover, the hidden land mine under the culvert blew the landrover the soldiers were travelling in into the air. The landrover was the second in a patrol of two landrovers with four soldiers in each vehicle. Shots were fired by the IRA at the first landrover and the landrover returned fire, there was no hits on either side. Four British soldiers, William Beck (23), Keith Richards (22), Simon Evans (19) and Allan Ayrton (23) were all killed instantly. They had only been serving with the 16th Regiment Royal Artillery in Northern Ireland for two weeks. The land mine was estimated to have contained between 800‚Äì1,000 lbs of explosives in it. Aftermath On the same day as the Dungannon attack the IRA's South Armagh Brigade killed another British soldier in a booby-trap bomb attack in Forkhill, County Armagh. They also shot dead a former UDR soldier in Omagh Bringing the total dead to six British soldiers on the day. In the following years, the area around Ballygawley became a death trap for British forces. On 13 July 1983 four UDR soldiers were killed in the Ballygawley land mine attack, at the time it was the worst attack the UDR suffered. On 20 August 1988, eight more British soldiers were killed and 28 others badly wounded in an IRA bombing of a British military bus on the same road.

The organization was founded in May 2018 by autism advocates, which include Jill Escher, Feda Almaliti, Amy Lutz, and Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. The NCSA is the first group to advocate exclusively for the needs of autistic individuals needing high levels of support. The organization is already controversial concerning its views on low-functioning autism, with some supporting its goals of medical treatment and additional support, and others believing that the organization detracts from autistic people. The NCSA has claimed that in their first year, they \\"changed the conversation about autism: severe autism is no longer in the closet and our growing national crisis is gaining the attention it clearly deserves.\\"  Formation  The purpose of this organization is to promote the needs of those affected by autism, who, by virtue of any combination of cognitive and functional impairments, require continuous or near-continuous, lifelong services, supports, and supervision. Topics to be addressed include housing arrangements, adequate developmental services, and scientific research. The National Council on Severe Autism has issued position statements on hot-button issues such as guardianship, crisis care, employment and what qualifies as a community-based setting. The NCSA supports the option of appointing a guardian to make decisions for severely autistic individuals when necessary. Additionally, they note that the number of studies that focus on severe autism have declined dramatically. Kimberlee McCafferty, an autism parent and writer, wrote that as a parent of a severely autistic child, she supports the organization because it gives her the opportunity to discuss the challenges of severe autism. She claimed that those challenges are not adequately portrayed in the media, as the media tends to mainly focus on successful autistic individuals. Many parents have expressed support for the organization's existence, noting that severe autism can often be dangerous. Matthew Siegel, a professor of psychiatry who is on the board of directors, commended the group for providing appropriate support for severely autistic individuals.  Advocacy  The NCSA attended a housing workshop sponsored by the IACC where they discussed the need for more housing support for severely autistic individuals. They state that many of those individuals will live with their parents for the rest of their life. Alison Singer has also attended the 2019 INSAR conference to talk about the NCSA's goals. The website also publishes articles from professionals and parents of autistic children that discusses the issues associated with severe autism. As of January 2019, some 1,500 people had signed up for its newsletter, and more than 2,000 people follow the group's Facebook page. As of April 18, 2019, the group had more than 4,500 Facebook followers. In January 2020, NCSA has almost 7,000 Facebook followers. The NCSA has created a series of webinars in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to provide advice and answer questions about the effects of the pandemic on autistic children.  Criticism  Shannon Des Roches Rosa, the senior editor for the news site Thinking Person's Guide to Autism, claims that the organization will take away autonomy from autistic people. She claims that the organization wants parents or guardians to make decisions for autistic individuals, and that there are no autistic people on the board of directors. Amy Lutz, the organization's secretary, stated in response that most autistic individuals served by the organization cannot advocate for themselves, saying ‚ÄúWe fully support self-advocates pursuing the support that they need, but this is completely separate.‚Äù The Maine Autism Collective wrote an open letter to the NCSA saying that they disagree with their view that autism is a medical condition.

It is native to Thailand and Vietnam. Suzanne Jovet-Ast, the French botanist who first formally described the species, named it after its elegant ( in Latin) thin, flexible leaves. Description It is a tree reaching 2 meters in height. Its branches are black or gray. Its petioles are 5 millimeters long with a channel, and either hairless or with fine yellows hairs. Its long, narrow leaves are 7-10.5 by 1.2-1.8 centimeters and come to a tapering point. The leaves have sparse fine hairs on their upper surface and are smooth on their lower surface. The leaves have 10-12 pairs of secondary veins emanating from the midrib. Its solitary flowers are in axillary positions on 3-4 millimeter long pedicels. Its 3 oval sepals have blunt tips and their outer surfaces are covered in short red hairs while their inner surfaces are hairless. Its flowers have 6 petals in two rows of 3. Its outer, oblong petals are 12 millimeters long. Its inner petals are narrower and shorter and united at their top. The flowers have numerous wedge-shaped stamen about 1.5 millimeters long. Its gynoecium have multiple hairless carpels with oval ovaries and slightly narrower styles topped by wider stigma that together are longer than the ovaries. =Reproductive biology= The pollen of G. elegans is shed as permanent tetrads. =Uses= Bioactive molecules extracted from its bark have been reported to be cytotoxic in tests with cultured human cancer cells, and to have antiplasmodial activity. =Distribution and Habitat= It has been observed growing in deciduous forests at elevations of 300 to 600 meters.

It is protected by the Lake Chelan- Sawtooth Wilderness within the Okanogan National Forest. The highest point of Raven Ridge is Corax Peak on the east end. Libby Peak (8555 ft) is the high point on the west end of Raven Ridge. The nearest higher peak is Star Peak, to the west. Hoodoo Peak lies one mile to the north. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Methow River, which is a tributary of the Columbia River. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Raven Ridge is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. With its impressive height, it can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

She is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association and was one of Barack Obama's Champions of Change.  Early life and education  Byars-Winston earned her bachelor's (1991) and master's (1992) degree at San Diego State University. She completed a predoctoral clinical fellowship at the University of Maryland, College Park. She attended graduate school at Arizona State University, specialising in counseling psychology. Her 1996 dissertation placed her on the national policy-making stage. She was one of only two black PhD students in the School of Education at Arizona State University in the fall of 1992.  Career  Byars-Winston joined the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison as a KL2 scholar in 1997. She joined the School of Medicine in 2011 and became interested in whether people bring their identity to the foreground of their college experience. She was awarded a $1.4 million R01 National Institutes of Health grant to investigate how mentors define diversity and developing ways to measure the impact of mentored research experiences on career outcomes. She is part of a $19 million National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN). She has investigated how to measure mentoring interventions. She has conducted a longitudinal study that monitored how the relationships between undergraduate mentees and their mentors in the biological sciences impact their academic outcomes. One of the approaches to meet the skills gap in the United States is to engage African Americans, Latino/as, South East Asians, and Native Americans ('ALANA') with science and engineering subjects. Byars-Winston used social cognitive career theory to examine how ethnicity influenced academic self-efficacy and outcomes. She has identified several barriers to the progression of ALANA investigators, including the marginalisation of interests, apartheid within academia and microaggressions. Byars-Winston demonstrated that race and ethnicity impact career expectations more than aspirations. She launched the Training and Education to Advance Minority Scholars in Science program (TEAM-Science) and Culturally Aware Mentoring (CAM) programs, which look to embed self-reflective dialogue about race and ethnicity in science. She is working with the National Academy to examine the effectiveness of programs that look engage individuals marginalised in STEM fields. Barack Obama named Byars-Winston as one of the United States' Champions of Change in 2011. The Presidency of Barack Obama established a Educate to Innovate campaign, which looked to improve the engagement of young people with science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). She is a member of the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity STEM Equity Pipeline National Advisory Board and Wisconsin Career Development Association Executive Committee. She won the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Outstanding Woman of Color Award in 2014. In 2016 Byars-Winston was a Visiting Professor at Purdue University, where she ran a series of mentoring workshops.

Plot The White Rose (Kalle, Anders, Eva-Lotta) and the Red Rose (Sixten, Benka, Jonte) are fighting for a magical stone, called the Stormumriken. One day Kalle and Sixten test their strengths and fight against each other, while Anders, Eva- Lotta, Benka and Jonte are watching and cheering. Policeman Rudolf Rask comes by and interrupts the fight. He tells the teenagers to stop fighting and the friends disappear. Later, Rask talks to Kalle's rich aunts Hilda and Hulda Krikonblad. He promises to make sure the sisters are safe. When the sisters are looking at a shop window, Kalle pranks them by knotting their ropes together. Hulda laughs when she realizes what the teenagers have done. Hilda, however reacts differently, she calls for the police officer Rask. After unsuccessfully trying to catch Kalle, Rask brings Hilda back home. A short time later, the musicians Vicke and Nisse sing in front of the house of the sisters. Nisse plays the guitar while Vicke plays the accordion. Hulda wants to give some money to the musicians, but Hilda is annoyed by the sound of the music. She yells at Vicke and Nisse and tells them to stop immediately. The White Rose and the Red Rose observe the whole thing and laugh with the musicians about Hilda's behavior. Then the teenagers say goodbye. The musicians, however are out of money, and they do not know where to get any new money. Suddenly Nisse has an idea. He wants to kidnap Hulda and extort a lot of money for her release. It should happen that night. The two musicians sneak into the apartment of the sisters and break in. But instead of kidnapping the kind Hulda they kidnap the tough Hilda. They wrap her into a blanket and carry her out. However, they are observed by Kalle. The next day not only Hilda is gone, but Kalle is missing as well. Hulda receives a blackmailer letter. She is asked to pay a lot for the release of her sister. She reads the letter to the White and Red Rose. The teenagers try to help Hulda with their own pocket money. Meanwhile, Hilda and Kalle are locked up in a small house by the criminals.

Career A native of Berkeley County, South Carolina he was First Honor Graduate of the Class of 1851 at the Citadel Academy in Charleston and upon graduation became a Professor of English and History at the Arsenal Academy in Columbia, the second of the two schools that made up the SCMA. In 1861, he became Superintendent of The Arsenal and also served as Commander of Company B of the Battalion of State Cadets, the military unit that comprised all of the cadets of the SCMA, who fought in eight engagements during the American Civil War. Thomas was in command of the Arsenal cadet company when the entire 343 man Corps of Cadets from the SCMA joined a Confederate States Army force of 550 at the Battle of Tulifinny in December 1864; they successfully defended a section of the Savannah to Charleston rail line against a Union force of 5,000 allowing more than 100,000 Confederate troops to escape the advancing army of General William T. Sherman. This battle is the only time the entire student body of a United States college fought in combat. Thomas led Arsenal cadets when they fired what may have been the last shots of the American Civil War east of the Mississippi in a skirmish with Union troops at Williamston, South Carolina on May 1, 1865; the Battalion of State Cadets was the last armed Confederate force in South Carolina when it was disbanded by Thomas at Newberry, South Carolina on May 9. With the SCMA closed and occupied by Federal troops at the end of the conflict, Thomas studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1871; in 1873, he established the Carolina Military Institute in Charlotte, North Carolina and served as Superintendent for nine years. In 1882 by act of the South Carolina legislature the SCMA was reopened with a single campus at the site of the former Citadel Academy on Marion Square in Charleston with Thomas as Superintendent; he resigned in 1885 but continued as a member of the Board of Visitors. From 1886‚Äì87, Thomas served in the South Carolina State Legislature then was appointed State Historian, he authored numerous books among them being The History of the South Carolina Military Academy published in 1893 which covered the first 50 years of the school's existence.Thomas, John Peyre (1893).

D. pulicaria are filter-feeders with a diet primarily consisting of algae, including Ankistrodesmus falcatus, and they can be found in deep lakes located in temperate climates. Furthermore, D. pulicaria are ecologically important herbivorous zooplankton, which help control algal populations and are a source of food for some fish. D. pulicaria are closely related to Daphnia pulex, and numerous studies have investigated the nature and strength of this relationship because these species can produce Daphnia pulex-pulicaria hybrids. In recent years, D. pulicaria along with other Daphnia species have been negatively affected by invasive predators, such as Bythotrephes longimanus.  Habitat and life history  Daphnia pulicaria generally live in deep, permanent lakes. These lakes provide a more stable environment than temporary ponds, which eventually dry up, so populations of D. pulicaria tend to have lower mortality rates than D. pulex populations living in ponds. Furthermore, D. pulicaria have a relatively long lifespan of 60-65 days. The populations of D. pulicaria in the Great Lakes in the United States have been negatively affected by the invasive species Bythotrephes longimanus. This invasive predator of D. pulicaria has also contributed to a decline of other zooplankton species in the Great Lakes.  Reproduction  Cyclic parthenogenesis is the primary mode of reproduction in D. pulicaria and other species within the genus Daphnia. Therefore, D. pulicaria are capable of switching between sexual and asexual reproduction based on environmental conditions. Typically, Daphnia undergo asexual reproduction when living in favorable conditions, such as in environments with abundant food or with negligible crowding. In contrast, they produce ephippia, which are dormant eggs, and reproduce sexually if environmental conditions worsen. Some studies suggest that populations of D. pulicaria in lakes in North America reproduce using the expected pattern of cyclic parthenogenesis while other populations in smaller ponds have shifted toward obligate parthenogenesis. The number of offspring produced through asexual reproduction is heavily influenced by the environmental conditions experienced by an individual. For instance, females in a high-food environment with a longer photoperiod tend to have more offspring. Environmental cues, such as food level, photoperiod, and temperature, significantly influence the reproduction of D. pulicaria.  Morphology  Daphnia pulicaria have a translucent carapace and two prominent second antennae, which they use to move. The carapace, composed primarily of chitin, helps protect the feeding apparatus, and it is periodically shed during an individual's life. Daphnia have a compound eye, and they are known to have an optomotor response. D. pulicaria generally have a body length less than 3mm. Because of the clear carapace of Daphnia, it is possible to see the heart and digestive tract, which often appears to be green due to the consumption of algae. The abdominal claw is also visible toward the end of the abdomen, and it can be used to dislodge any algae from the feeding apparatus if some begins to stick.  Closely related species  D. pulicaria are considered to be part of the Daphnia pulex species complex and can produce hybrids with D. pulex. While it is difficult to distinguish between these two species using morphological traits, D. pulicaria and D. pulex have significant genomic differences. Phylogenetic studies, using mitochondrial DNA analysis, have identified genetic divergence between D. pulicaria and D. pulex. For instance, variations in the Lactate dehydrogenase gene can help identify D. pulicaria from others in the D. pulex species complex.  Model organisms  Species of Daphnia, including D. pulicaria, are commonly used as model organisms for studying life-history traits and phenotypic plasticity. For example, D. pulicaria can detect and respond to kairomones produced by predatory fish. Their sensitivity to environmental cues contributes to the observed seasonal trends in population sizes of D. pulicaria. Moreover, because D. pulicaria reproduce using cyclic parthenogenesis, they are ideal models for genetic studies, including ones concerning spontaneous mutations.

Its unique trumpet shape gives it its common name and it can grow to be 12 cm, having a column between 3 and 6 cm in size. Like many cnidarians, they rely on nematocysts for protection and to capture prey. They are not difficult to care for, and can be kept in a home aquarium, although due to their speed of reproduction, can quickly become overpopulated.  Description  = Anatomy and morphology = Aiptasia mutabilis is typically trumpet shaped. It can grow to be 12 cm tall, and the column can have a diameter of 3 cm near the base and 6 cm at the mouth of the organism. The tall column is not segmented, and flares outward to a broad oral disc. The tentacles of A. mutabilis are shorter in length at the base, and they grow to be finer as you travel towards the end. The inner tentacles tend to be longer than the ones found towards the outside, and each organism can have up to 100 tentacles. A. mutabilis, like other members of the genus Aiptasia, have specialized stinging cells called nematocysts on their tentacles. When the column of the organism is extended, small perforations, called cinclides, can be observed, while the lower half of the column has numerous warts, which act as adhesive spots to help secure the organism to the substrate. Typically, A. mutabilis is a brownish color with areas that are opaque white. The tentacles are usually brown towards the bottom and turn lighter towards the tips. They can also have blue or green colors radiating throughout their body. = Nematocysts = Like most nematocysts found in cnidarians, the nematocysts of A. mutabilis injects a tubule of venomous substances as a respose to a stimulus. This is typically used to capture prey, and the tubule will either adhere to or inject the prey. The nematocysts of A. mutabilis, like other nematocysts, have an inner organoid that takes up about 80% of the interior. It consists of a three layer capsule that contains a long thread that is coiled in capsule fluid. When there is as stimulus, a rapid eversion of the tubule occurs that penetrates the target's tissue and the toxins of the capsule fluid is injected into the tissue . Volume regulatory methods are important in most cells to keep them functioning, including nematocysts. A. mutabilis is able to regulate cell volume in both hypoosmotic and hypertonic conditions, which is crucial to their survival in changing environments. The presence of Ca2+ ions in seawater is needed for proper nemoatocyst discharge in A. mutabilis. Without Ca2+, the ability of the organism to feed and protect itself is compromised. The nematocyte venom of A. mutabilis contains at least one or more toxins with powerful cytolytic activity. However, conditions of the habitat A. mutabilis lives in impact the cytotoxicity of the venom. A strong cytotoxicity is seen at a pH of 7.5, and at a pH of 4.5 or 9.5, the cytotoxicity was lost entirely. An environment that had a pH that is too low or to high can greatly impact the effect nematocysts have on helping A. mutabilis capture prey and defend itself.  Predation  There are multiple organisms that prey on Aiptasia mutabilis, including various species of butterflyfish, filefish, pufferfish, nudibranchs, some shrimp species, and hermit crabs. These and other organisms prey on Aiptasia mutabilis in the wild and can be put into an aquarium system to keep their numbers down when they become invasive and overpopulate tanks.  Distribution and habitat  Aiptasia mutabilis is usually seen in colder waters. It is typically found adhered to substrates, beneath overhangs, on walls, or on rocks deep under the sea surface. The greatest depth A. mutabilis has been found adhered to substrate was 100m below sea level. This species typically stays in shallower waters, usually at a depth of up to 50 below the surface. It has been found in the Atlantic Ocean, from Ireland to the Canary Islands, along with being found in the Adriatic, Aegean, and Mediterranean seas.  Reproduction  Aiptasia mutabilis has been known to reproduce both asexually and sexually. Although both methods are used, asexual reproduction has been most commonly seen in this species. To reproduce asexually, the anemone splits the column and separates. These two separate parts will adhere to a substrate and individuals will begin to develop from these smaller amounts of tissue from the original individual. This species can be infective, due to the speed at which they can reproduce, and for this reason they are not very popular aquarium anemones. Any tissue could potentially turn into an individual, making them quite prominent in the areas where they are found. To get from zygote to its adult life stage, A mutabilis will undergo metamorphosis. This beings with the morphogenesis of tentacles, septa, and pharynx. From here the larva settles and develops into its adult form.  Symbiotic relationships  Aiptasia mutabilis acts as a host to many different organisms. Algae, rich in fucoxanthin, contribute to its dark brown coloring, and when these algae are not present, the organisms becomes a lighter, white color. A mutabilis will often turn white after an extended period of time in darkness, which is a condition in which this algae cannot survive. Dinoflagellates have also been known to have a symbiotic relationship with many different cnidarians within the genus Aiptasia, including A. mutabilis.

Precipitation runoff on the west side of the mountain drains into Buttermilk Creek, whereas the east side of the mountain drains into Libby Creek. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Hoodoo Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. With its impressive height, Hoodoo Peak can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Hoodoo Peak approach The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

On April 1, 1852 the Scott family, along with several others, started for the Oregon Territory, taking the Oregon Trail with a caravan of ox teams. The journey took six months. Ann died on June 20, 1852 when they were in the Black Hills, at a point in the trail about north of the present city of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She had been sick for only a few hours with what was known as 'plains cholera.' Her husband and nine children, aged from three years and six months to nineteen years, were with her in a shelter tent when she died. Amanda's brother \\"Willie\\" also died on the Oregon Trail.). Abigail, then seventeen years old, kept a journal during the family's trip west. In later years, Abigail, Harvey, and Kate would go on to share an affinity for the newspaper trade. In 1857, Catherine married John Read Coburn (1830‚Äì1868). The two built a house in Canemah and had four daughters: Agnes, Ada, Camilla, and Kate. Upon John's death in 1868, Catherine became a schoolteacher at Canemah. According to her later account, she was denied her requested salary of 50 per month, on the basis that the school could \\"get a man\\" to teach for that amount. She accepted a salary of $40 per month, continuing in the position for four years, but carried a \\"rankling sense of injustice.\\" She described the incident as her \\"first lesson in equal rights.\\" She then became principal of the Forest Grove school, a position she held for two years. Career in journalism In 1874 and for the next five years, Coburn began her career in journalism as associate editor with her sister, Abigail Scott Duniway, editor and publisher of the New Northwest. Coburn evinced a rare degree of journalistic ability. Beginning in 1879, she served for five years as editor in chief of the Portland Daily Bee. In the 1880s, Coburn served as associate editor of the Evening Telegram for at least five years, through a period of numerous changes in leadership. In 1888, she transferred to the editorial staff of the Oregonian, which owned the Telegram. She contributed over the ensuing quarter-century to the daily, weekly, and Sunday editions of the newspaper. Her ability to cover local incidents and interests in editorial comment was credited to her personal connection with the pioneer experience. She remained with the Oregonian as an associate editor until her death in 1913. Among her accomplishments as an editorial writer, she was known for \\"tender tributes to pioneer builders of the Pacific Northwest.\\" Coburn in later years  Later years  Coburn was active in civic affairs, especially later in life. She was president of the Allen Preparatory School in Portland, founded in 1901 and incorporated in 1905. She was a member of the Oregon Pioneer Association and a charter member of the Portland Woman's Union, which she represented in bringing a complaint about a Portland schoolteacher. Coburn was elected president of the Woman's Union in 1906. When her sister Abigail brought national woman suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony to Portland's Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, Catherine was among those in the receiving line at her speech. Coburn disavowed the term \\"suffragette,\\" but supported women's suffrage. She died, following a long illness, in Portland, on May 27, 1913, Leslie M. Scott, her nephew and fellow journalist, praised her career in an obituary; she was buried in that city's River View Cemetery. She left an estate valued at 14,000 to her daughter Ada and to the children of Agnes and Camilla. George Turnbull, historian of Oregon newspapers, described Catherine and Abigail in 1939 as \\"probably Oregon's two greatest women journalists.

The Seekers met in a nondenominational church, the group originally organized in 1953 by Charles Laughead, a staff member at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. They were led by Dorothy Martin from the Chicago area (also called Sister Thedra), who believed a UFO would take them on December 21, 1954. They are believed to be the first such group to exist. They were the subject of the book When Prophecy Fails by Leon Festinger; Laughead was given the pseudonym Dr. Armstrong and Martin given the name Marian Keech. Leon Festinger infiltrated the Seekers with the goal of studying their cognitions and reactions when their beliefs failed, hence the name of his book When Prophecy Fails. He focused on them primarily to study a thought- process known as cognitive dissonance. Festinger and his colleagues essentially wanted to study cult members reactions and coping mechanisms when the UFO did not come to get them on December 21st, 1954. When the UFO didn't come, a majority of the members became convinced that the UFO would come on Christmas Eve. It was the second time around that the members experienced the greatest amount of dissonance. In the book, Festinger and his colleagues write \\"The experiences of this observer well characterize the state of affairs following the Christmas caroling episode‚Äîa persistent, frustrating search for orders.\\" After this incident, many of the members returned home and abandoned their initial belief. Those who did not claimed that their group's belief and faith had saved the rest of the world from the disaster the aliens had warned them of. From this study, Festinger and his colleagues developed the Cognitive Dissonance Theory. Cognitive dissonance is when two cognitions contradict each other, creating psychological discomfort. People are motivated to maintain consistent cognitions and will do what they can to relieve the discomfort. There are four main principles on which cognitive dissonance is based. The most important is whether any two cognitions are relevant or not. If they are relevant, then they're either dissonant or consonant - if dissonant, psychological discomfort arises. People are ultimately motivated to diffuse this arousal. There are a few ways to reduce dissonance. For starters, one can change their behavior to bring it in line with dissonant cognitions. Alternatively, one can change the dissonant cognition. One can also add new consonant cognitions, or subtract dissonant cognitions, thus either reducing the perception of choice or the importance of the conflict. We saw this in The Seekers, where members changed their dissonant cognition the first time the UFO didn't come, and reduced the importance of the conflict by going home the second time that the UFO didn't come.

Early life Michael Chen, a Cantonese, was born in the Canton region of China in 1950. During this period of time in Hong Kong, there was tension and conflict between the communists and the British government along with corruption in the Hong Kong police force. This, along with other economic and social problems, led Chen's father to immigrate to the United States when Chen's mother was still pregnant. When he was 13 years old, in 1963 he emigrated to the New York City from Hong Kong, with his mother and sister, where they joined his father, who worked as a taxi driver. Chen worked as a delivery boy for a Chinese restaurant in Upper Manhattan while attending Seward Park High School near Chinatown. He graduated from high school in 1968, and briefly attended college. Criminal history Chen's criminal career began in the mid-1970s and not long after he became the leader ('Dragon Head') of the Flying Dragons. He was arrested in Queens for homicide in 1976, but the charges were later dismissed. The following year, he was indicted in the slayings of two members of the rival Ghost Shadows during a brazen shoot-out in the crowded Pagoda Theater on East Broadway in Manhattan's Chinatown. However, he was acquitted of these crimes at trial. In a separate incident, he was arrested while carrying 12-gauge shotgun, and had 150 rounds of ammunition hidden in the ceiling of his apartment. In August 1976, Chen conspired with Nicky Louie of the Ghost Shadows and Paul Ma of the White Eagles, along with the Tongs, to fake a peace between themselves so that they would be able to win a Federal Grant from the government who had, that same year, promised the youth gangs of Harlem a substantial amount of money to reform the children. The deal, however, fell apart due to the deep animosity between the gang leaders, opposition from the Tongs and reluctance from the lower members of the gangs led the peace process to unravel. The truce lasted one month until September 10, 1976, when an attack left five people injured. In 1983, Chen ordered the murder of Chi-ho Lau, who had convinced three members of the Flying Dragons to quit the gang. The three members changed their minds and wanted to return to the gang, but Chen would only let them return if they took out a contract on him. On March 5, 1983, Lau was murdered by Tat Li at the Riviera Diner on Astor Place after being shot three times in the back. Personality Chen was nicknamed \\"The Scientist\\" because of his patience, cool, calm demeanor and patient ways. He had a reputation for being polite and never seemed outrageous or rude; he did not drink, smoke, or gamble, and he was generous toward others. He did, however, have a weakness for women. He was considered to be extremely good to his parents and affectionate toward his grandmother. He owned three expensive sports cars and dressed only in designer clothes. Chen thought of himself as a businessman and had invested in nightclubs in a Flushing, Queens, a meat market and in a Manhattan paper supply house. Before his death, he allegedly told his friends he was contemplating completely disassociating himself from the gangland of Chinatown and conducting himself as a legitimate businessperson. Death On March 13, 1983, Chen was woken in the middle of the night by a phone call, left his apartment (which was above the Hip Sing Tong Credit Union), and went to a coffee shop adjacent to the credit union. There, he was shot with a handgun fourteen times - four of which went through his eyes. The NYPD Spokesman Sgt. Edwin LeSchack identified Chen's body, which was found at 12:30 pm by an officer of the Hip Sing Association. Although Michael Chen's murder has never been solved, initial speculation by police Captain Robert Larkin was that it was a revenge killing by the Freemasons Gang who accused the Flying Dragons of killing three of their members in a restaurant in Chinatown the previous December. However, after conducting further investigation, police theorized that the killing was carried out by people whom Chen knew, as he would not have gotten out of bed so late in the night to meet strangers. In the early 1980s, there was a fight for the control of the Flying Dragons, with Chen holding the position that the gang should stick to traditional racketeering with the crimes of extortion and gambling. On the other side was Chen's underlying Johnny \\"Machine Gun\\" Eng. Eng wanted to expand into more lucrative crimes such as heroin trafficking. This led to division. A deeper investigation uncovered that Chen's murder was a power grab by Johnny Eng to take full control of the Flying Dragons. It was also thought that since the Flying Dragons were associated with the Hip Sing Tong and that the shooting happened across the street, that the assassination could not have occurred without the blessing of the leader of the Hip Sing Tong, Benny Ong. He was considered the Godfather of Chinatown and therefore must have sanctioned the murder. Chen's death was a clear message that there was new leadership and that Johnny Eng was now the undisputed leader of the Flying Dragons. Murder case reopened On May 8, 1998, Fun Biu Tok was extradited from Los Angeles to New York City to stand trial for Michael Chen's murder. At the time, Fun Biu Tok was a Lieutenant in the Flying Dragons and was instructed to kill Michael Chen by two other gangsters. The reason for the killing was believed to be that the Chen was suspected of skimming money from the gang's receipts.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 A 200-year-old growth forest, in the center of the area, has trees 20 to 40 inches in diameter. The area contains several intact watersheds that maintain water quality downstream. This wildland is part of the Clinch Ranger District Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Cumberland Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 6.8 miles south of Big Stone Gap, Virginia and 20 miles north of Kingsport, Tennessee. It is southeast of US 23. There are no maintained trails in the area, however there are several roads, closed to motor vehicles, that are popular with horseback riders. Boundary of the Laurel Fork wilderness area as identified by the Wilderness Society.The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 789 (Clinch Ranger District). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wildland's gps coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Cumberland Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Laurel Fork wilderness area is covered by USGS topographic maps East Stone Gap and Big Stone Gap. Natural history The area contains the Pick Breeches and Flannery Ridges special biological area. The Cliff Mountain special biological area is on the northern border of the area. The center of the area contains a 900 acres of old growth forest, saved because of its inaccessibility due to rocky outcrops. Topography The area is part of the Pine and Cumberland Mountains Subsection of the Southern Cumberland Mountain Section of the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. It contains the watersheds for Laurel Fork, Dry Fork and Wolf Creek, tributaries of Stock Creek and the Clinch River. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Laurel Fork was not inventoried as part of RARE II, an inventory conducted in the late 1970s and therefore is not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. In 1993 there were two logging projects in the area, the Stock Creek helicopter salvage project and the Elisha Lick helicopter salvage project. The Stock Creek project was just outside of the Laurel Fork area, across the road from Stock Creek and the area's boundary on Rt. 710. The Elisha Lick project included a unit south of Rt. 2940 and to the west of the Wrights pasture inholding. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. The area includes land designated as ‚ÄúOld Growth with Disturbance‚Äù along Flannery Ridge on the east, and ‚ÄúMix of Successional Habitats‚Äù on the west.

The collapse of the exchange sparked a series of nationwide protests against the involvement of Chinese local governments in supporting fraudulent fundraising schemes. The exchange was established in 2011 as a global trading platform for rare metals and promoted by Yunnan government officials. It advertised returns as high as 13.7% and zero risk for investors. In the three years after it was set up, the exchange raised up to $6.4 billion from 220,000 investors across the country. In 2015, the exchange blocked the withdrawal of funds and froze its accounts, triggering large-scale protests by defrauded creditors in Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. Victims gathered outside the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to accuse the Fanya exchange and CSRC government officials of supporting financial fraud. Twenty-one Yunnan executives, including the founder, Shan Jiuliang, were charged with embezzlement and of sabotaging financial markets in the Kunming Intermediate People's Court in 2018. The company was fined 1 billion yuan ($149.04 million) for illegal fundraising, and Shan was sentenced to 18 years in jail.  Background  The Fanya Metal Exchange was a state-backed exchange that claimed to be the world's largest trading platform of rare metals, located in Kunming, Yunnan Province. The exchange focused on metals used in technologies promoted in the official Chinese strategic plan, including liquid crystal display (LCD) screens and solar panels. Its goal was to emulate the success of the London Metal Exchange and create an exchange dedicated solely to trading rare earths and other minor metals. It dealt in 14 rare nonferrous metals including indium, bismuth, antimony, and terbium, purchasing and storing them for resale. The exchange promised investors a fixed return of up to 13.7% per annum with the right to withdraw the principal at any time without penalty. At its launch, Fanya was designated a \\"cooperation enterprise\\" of the National Bureau of Statistics of China. It was advertised on television as a government-endorsed and regulated safe investment product. A key product called \\"ri jin bao\\" (daily golden jewel) collected investors' money to be loaned to a third-party agency and invested in other rare metal products. The company's brochures claimed that major state-owned banks served as custodians for these investments. Because of ri jin bao's high returns and seemingly low risks, it rapidly became popular especially among middle-class investors. Some investors took out loans or ran up credit card debt to invest in ri jin bao.  Business model and collapse  The exchange announced early on that it held the world's largest stores of bismuth, iridium, and rare earth metals. However, demand for these metals is low, making the funds invested in the stores illiquid. For example, by 2014 the exchange held more than 3,400 tonnes of indium and 19,000 tonnes of bismuth, in each case enough to meet global annual demand for several years. Since only small amounts of the stockpiles could be sold in a short period, Fanya would inevitably face a liquidity crisis if any sizeable request for cash withdrawal was made. In addition, the promise of a 13.7% interest rate could only be met with rapidly increasing rare metal prices. The exchange inevitably started to cover the interest and principal owed to existing investors using funds from new investors, the definition of a Ponzi scheme. When global rare metal prices declined the exchange started to collapse. In April 2015, Fanya stopped withdrawals and froze assets nominally worth approximately 43 billion yuan ($6.7 billion) belonging to 220,000 creditors across the country. In July 2015 all assets were frozen. A complaint filed with the Yunnan financial authorities was rebuffed. In September 2015 it was reported that the exchange had not passed its most recent CSRC inspection, but had been allowed to continue to operate because of the support of the local government. In late 2015, the exchange ceased operations.  Aftermath  The collapse of the Fanya Metal Exchange sparked months of nationwide protests, including protests in front of the Beijing and Shanghai offices of the CSRC that accused the regulator of \\"ignoring Fanya fraud\\". Hundreds of furious investors gathered outside the exchange in Kunming. On July 15, 2015, Fanya announced that it would buy back 5 billion yuan's worth of metals from investors with funds from its partners. Investors remained irate. On August 22, 2015, a group of investors organized using social media and gathered in Shanghai to catch and confront Shan Jiuliang, the founder of the exchange. Shan was turned over to the police, and later released. On September 24, 2015, the exchange claimed that its liquidity problem was due to fluctuations in stock and commodity markets, as well as regulatory changes. It also attempted to blame the media for spreading \\"malicious rumors\\" and \\"deliberately inciting panic\\" in investors. The exchange proposed to sell its stocks of 6 rare metals and undergo extensive debt restructuring to resolve the crisis. In October 2015 it was revealed that the \\"ri jin bao\\" financing scheme was never approved by the government. Fanya issued a statement claiming that ri jin bao was merely an internally circulated sales strategy. Late in 2015 the exchange ceased operations and its building was taken over by \\"dozens\\" of investigators, following months of protests by investors outside government buildings in Kunming, Shanghai and Beijing. Early in 2016 Shan was arrested with 15 other suspects, and in March 2016 Kunming police announced that they had determined that the exchange acted illegally in its use of investors' funds. Investigators blamed regulatory failures for allowing the exchange to operate without proper supervision, but local authorities insisted they had done their job well. In June 2016 police announced that they had impounded more than 70,000 tonnes of rare metals and other assets of the exchange. In August 2016, after a 7-month long investigation, the Kunming government announced 21 Fanya executives would be prosecuted for \\"illegal fundraising\\". Investors continued to seek to increase the visibility of the case, crowdfunding funds to support civil prosecution. A group of Fanya investors sent an open letter with 300 signatures and fingerprints to Cao Jianming, China's top prosecutor. Fanya investors organized to break out from behind the \\"Great Firewall\\" to protest on Twitter and press for attention from foreign media. In July 2018, 21 executives involved in the exchange were charged in the Kunming Intermediate People's Court with embezzlement and sabotaging financial markets. Investors were not allowed to attend the trial, and some investors were asked to leave town before the trial began. The company was fined 1 billion yuan ($149.04 million) for illegal fundraising, and Shan was sentenced to 18 years in jail for crimes including embezzlement. Shan was also fined 500,000 yuan and had 50 million yuan of his personal property confiscated. Other executives charged included Yang Guohong, the former vice president of the exchange, who was accused of illegally appropriating property. The Kunming Intermediate People‚Äôs Court began selling off Fanya's assets in 2019. After initially attracting no bids on Fanya's indium stockpile, the sellers were forced to lower prices to complete the sale.  Analysis  = Regulatory failings = The lack of effective regulation of the Fanya Metal Exchange has been blamed on a \\"regulatory black hole\\" between the Ministry of Commerce and the CSRC, exacerbated by the involvement of local governments. Both the Kunming and the Yunnan local governments approved the establishment of the exchange in 2011, although they had no right to do so, in a bid to draw investment to the province. In July 2015, as the exchange was collapsing, the director of Yunnan Province‚Äôs finance office, Liu Guangxi, praised Fanya for its contributions to the economy through taxes, saying \\"We will support Fanya as always\\". Experts have argued that unless China undertakes sweeping regulatory reform, scams of this type are almost certain to occur. It has been estimated that around 400 similar exchanges exist around the country, with assets of approximately 1 trillion yuan ($157 billion). = Allegations of corruption = Analysts have suggested that Fanya was designed to swindle investors from its inception. At the time of Shan's arrest, he was reported to have given investigators a list of 400 individuals and companies who had \\"borrowed\\" from Fanya's funds. Defrauded investors have alleged that these individuals include government officials or people with ties to the government, and that the list has disappeared. It has also been alleged that the investigation of Fanya's collapse was delayed because local government officials who were members of the ruling Chinese Communist Party were involved in a \\"Promotional Work Leadership Group\\" that popularized Fanya as an investment vehicle. = Protests = The scale and scope of protests against the government resulting from Fanya's collapse have been unusual, fueled both by the scale of the losses suffered by investors and by outrage at the apparent support of a financial scam by local governments. Protestors are consciously risking jail to draw attention to their losses, and thousands of petitioners have been detained by the Chinese government. Many of Fanya's creditors came from the well-educated middle class. They have used social media extensively to organize their protests, and have collaborated to break through China's \\"Great Firewall\\" to flood Twitter with protest messages. More than 300 Fanya investors have become active Twitter users.

Current hypotheses have trouble explaining how particles can grow larger than a few centimeters. This is called the meter size barrier. This mission was selected in 2015 as part of NASA's ELaNa program, and it is scheduled for launch in July 2020. Overview Artist's impression of a protoplanetary disk Q-PACE is led by Joshua Colwell at the University of Central Florida and was selected NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative which placed it on ELaNa XX. The development of the mission was funded through NASA's Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program. Observations of the collisional evolution and accretion of particles in a microgravity environment are necessary to elucidate the processes that lead to the formation of planetesimals (the building blocks of planets), km-size, and larger bodies, within the protoplanetary disk. The current hypotheses of planetesimal formation have difficulties in explaining how particles grow beyond one centimeter in size, so repeated experimentation in relevant conditions is necessary.CubeSat Particle Aggregation Collision Experiment (Q-PACE): Design of a 3U CubeSat mission to investigate planetesimal formation. Stephanie Jarmak, Julie Brisset, Joshua Colwell, Adrienne Dove, etal. Acta Astronautica, Volume 155, February 2019, Pages 131-142. Q-PACE will explore the fundamental properties of low‚Äêvelocity (< 10 cm/s) particle collisions in a microgravity environment in an effort to better understand accretion in the protoplanetary disk.Q‚ÄêPACE: the CubeSat Particle Aggregation and Collision Experiment. (PDF) Josh Colwell, Julie Brisset, Addie Dove, Larry Roe. January 2016. Several precursor tests and flight missions were performed in suborbital flights as well as in the International Space Station.Planetesimal Formation . Center for Microgravity Research, University of Central Florida. Accessed on 2019. The small spacecraft does not need accurate pointing or propulsion, which simplified the design. An air launch to orbit from Virgin Galactic's Cosmic Girl airplane above the Mojave desert in California will send Q-PACE into space in July 2020. Objectives The main objective of Q-PACE is to understand protoplanetary growth from pebbles to boulders by performing long-duration microgravity collision experiments. The specific goals are: *Quantify the energy damping in multi-particle systems at low collision speeds (< to ) *Identify the influence of a size distribution on the collision outcome. *Observe the influence of dust on a multi-particle system. *Quantify statistically rare events: observe a large number of similar collisions to arrive at a probabilistic description of collisional outcomes. Method Q-PACE is a 3U CubeSat with a collision test chamber and several particle reservoirs that contain meteoritic chondrules, dust particles, dust aggregates, and larger spherical particles. Particles will be introduced into the test chamber for a series of separate experimental runs. The scientists designed a series of experiments involving a broad range of particle size, density, surface properties, and collision velocities to observe collisional outcomes from bouncing to sticking as well as aggregate disruption in tens of thousands of collisions. The test chamber will be mechanically agitated to induce collisions that will be recorded by on‚Äêboard video for downlink and analysis. Long duration microgravity allows a very large number of collisions to be studied and produce statistically significant data.Q-PACE: the CubeSat Particle Aggregation and Collision Experiment .

The by-election was caused by the resignation of the incumbent MP William Reeves on 2 May 1868. Reeves had been elected in the 11 March 1867 Avon by-election and after attending the 1867 parliamentary session, he resigned as his business partner had died in late 1867. Reeves' notice of resignation, dated 2 May, first appeared in newspapers on 5 May. On that same day, the local newspapers The Press and the Lyttelton Times published a requisition signed by 362 electors addressed to William Rolleston, urging him to stand, as well as his lengthy response acceding to that request. In his response, Rolleston outlined his political views: in contrast to the outgoing Superintendent of Canterbury, William Sefton Moorhouse, Rolleston wanted to be prudent with his capital programme and cut back public debts; he favoured the careful and deliberate abolition of provincial governments but saw no haste to action this measure; he advocated a better system of distribution of the provincial revenues handed to the central government (as Canterbury paid more than its fair share). The by-election unfolded during the upcoming election for the superintendency of the Canterbury Province. Moorhouse, whose popularity had sunk to a low, had resigned in early April 1868 over personal financial difficulties. Moorhouse was encouraged by some voters to make himself available for the Avon by- election but he stated that he was not prepared to stand; his financial difficulties were not public knowledge at the time. On 22 May 1868, Rolleston was elected unopposed to the highest political office in Canterbury. Rolleston had since 1865 been a public servant, appointed by Premier Frederick Weld as the Under Secretary in the Native Department. Rolleston needed to wind up his role in Wellington and left for the capital after he announced his candidacy for both the Superintendency and the Avon electorate. Rolleston's resignation from the Native Department was gazetted later in May. On 19 May, Rolleston arrived back at Lyttelton from Wellington. The nomination meeting was set for Tuesday, 8 June 1868 at the Papanui school, with an election (if necessary) to be held the following day. Thomas Maude (the father of Nurse Maude) acted as the returning officer. The Papanui land owner Henry Matson proposed Rolleston and William Lane‚Äîbest known for his ownership of Mill Island in the Avon River‚Äîseconded the nomination. As there were no other nominations, Rolleston won the Avon by-election unopposed. The by-election success was the beginning of Rolleston's long parliamentary career. He remained a member of parliament until 1899, with two three-year breaks. In total, he spent 25 years in Parliament.

While at the University of Illinois he became a member of Omega Psi Phi. Buckner also has a J.D. degree from the DePaul University College of Law. After college, Buckner worked for Senator Dick Durbin in Washington D.C. and Mayor Mitch Landrieu in New Orleans. He then worked in community relations for the Chicago Cubs. In 2015, he was appointed Executive Director of World Sport Chicago; a nonprofit that grew from the Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. On January 8, 2017, Bruce Rauner appointed Buckner to the Board of Trustees of Chicago State University for a term expiring January 15, 2023. He was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives on January 18, 2019 to succeed Christian Mitchell who was hired as a Deputy Governor in the J. B. Pritzker administration. Buckner has taught at University of Chicago and has been a contributor for The Hill and Crain's Chicago Business.  Policy Positions  =Education= In his time in the Illinois General Assembly Buckner has constantly advocated for equitable funding of public schools across Illinois. Buckner authored HB 3917 to ensure that Chicago Public Schools receive the proper amount of funding based on the need of the students in the district. The legislation amends the evidence-based funding provisions of the School Code and provides that funds received by the Chicago school district for low- income, English learner, and special education resources must be distributed to every school of the district in the appropriate amount specified under the Essential Elements component of the funding formula. He has been a proponent of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education in low-income neighborhoods and co-sponsored legislation to create an elected representative school board in Chicago. =Consumer Protection= Buckner is the primary sponsor of House Bill 3920 that would make it illegal in Illinois for financial institutions to mail unsolicited, predatory, high-interest loan checks to consumers. This legislation is similar to the Unsolicited Loan Act of 2018, introduced in the U.S. Senate by Senators Doug Jones (D-AL), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR). =Civil Liberties= In July 2019, it came to light that the Chicago Police Department had been running secret background checks on members of the public who signed up to give comments at meetings of the Chicago Police Board. Police scoured lists of public speakers at board meetings and ran their names through department databases to look for arrest records, prison records, outstanding warrants, or sex offender registrations. In some cases, police even look at voter registration records and websites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or YouTube where speakers had profiles. Police compiled this data into profiles on each speaker, many of whom were openly critical of the CPD. One woman profiled by the CPD had alleged to the Police Board that she had been sexually assaulted by a CPD officer years previously. Others were relatives of individuals who had been killed in shootings involving CPD officers. Records compiled by the Chicago Tribune show that this practice dated back to 2006 and led to secret background checks of more than 300 citizens‚Äîall without the knowledge or consent of those individuals. In October 2019, Buckner filed HB 3925 that would make it illegal for law enforcement departments throughout the state to conduct background checks on citizens giving public comment at open meetings. The legislation would amend the Illinois Open Meetings Act to render such background checks a felony act. Buckner was the House sponsor of Senate Bill 1599 which was sponsored by Elgie Sims in the Illinois Senate. It amended the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act in relation to the dissemination of criminal record information. It made it an unlawful practice for a person or entity that publishes for profit a person's criminal record information to fail to correct an error in the individual's criminal record information. Governor J.B. Pritzker signed it into law on August 20, 2019, making it Public Act 101-0431. Buckner has also been an outspoken opponent of Red Light and speed cameras, saying that they fundamentally run afoul of due process, the right to face one's accuser and privacy. He has also spoken out about the influx of these cameras in minority and poverty stricken neighborhoods and House Bill 3927, introduced by Buckner, amends the Illinois Vehicle Code and makes these automated traffic law enforcement systems illegal. Buckner introduced House Bill 3584 in January 2019. It provides that victim impact statements received by Parole Boards shall be confidential and shall not be discoverable in litigation. It also amended the Open Parole Hearings Act to prevent the release of any material to the inmate, the inmate's attorney, any third party, or any other person that contains any information from the victim who has provided a victim impact statement, including the name and or address of the victim. Governor J.B. Pritzker signed it into law August 9, 2019, making it Public Act 101-0288. =Gun Control= Buckner has been a vocal advocate for comprehensive gun control. He has used his personal history of experiencing and witnessing gun violence from a very young age to demand that mental health, quality of life, education and economic development be factors in any public policy efforts to eradicate gun violence. =Environment= In 2019 Buckner was rated a 100% by the Illinois Environmental Council. =Missing & Murdered Chicago Women & Girls= In 2019 a Chicago Tribune special report revealed 55 unsolved killings of women in the Chicago area and a great number of missing women. The Illinois State Police came under fire for the massive backlog in processing DNA in murder cases and the FBI was asked to investigate any correlation between the reported occurrences. Buckner took to the floor of the Illinois General Assembly in May of 2019 to address the disappearance of 3 Chicago women, 2 of whom were pregnant and later found murdered. In October of 2019, Buckner authored and introduced House Bill 3932 which would create the Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women Act.

Development In 1927, some Polish Americans conceived the idea of organizing a Polish flight across the Atlantic. Only two years later, Stanley Adamkevich from Chicago was able to organize this enterprise. He was supported by the pilot of the 3rd Aviation Regiment, Captain Adam Kovalchyk, and the former PLL LOT pilot, Vlodzimierz Clich. Caproni personally handed them one Caproni Ca.73ter night bomber, on the basis of which they built the Ca.87 record attempt aircraft. First of all, the aircraft was altered for a possible landing on the water. Work was moving fast and in early May 1929 the aircraft was ready and flew for the first time on 15 June 1929. The Ca.87 was christened Polonia. The Ca.87's flight was scheduled for 4 July 1929, on Independence Day. The Ca.87 was delivereded from the Italian Medionali airfield to the Baldonnell airfield in Ireland, waiting for a fair wind. The route was laid to the Canadian airport of Terranova, from there they intended to fly to Chicago. However, the new Isotta Fraschini engines worked intermittently and immediately after take-off they refused to continue their journey. The aircraft was returned to Caproni, where it was converted into a bomber.

The law is a response to the BDS movement's call for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel which is gaining ground in the US. Lawmakers hope to curb the growth of BDS which they consider to be anti-Semitic by making it difficult to participate in anti-Israel boycotts. As of 2020, 32 state legislatures have already passed bills similar to IABA. If the law was passed in the federal legislature, it would be easier to enforce. Critics of the law and supporters of BDS claims that it is unconstitutional. They claim that participation in politically motivated boycotts is a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment and that anti-BDS laws are a form of lawfare. IABA was drafted by Senators Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and introduced to the 115th session of Congress in 2018. It had 58 cosponsors in the Senate, and 292 cosponsors in the House (216 Republicans, 76 Democrats). The act consisted of House and Senate bills HR 1697 and S 720 and died in Congress. However, there is strong opposition to BDS in American politics and the act is expected to make a resurgence in the federal legislature in the future. In the 115th session of Congress it had 58 cosponsors in the Senate (42 Republicans, 15 Democrats, 1 Independent),  Legislative history  The bill was introduced by the identical House and Senate bills HR 1697 and S 720 on March 23, 2017 by Republican Representative Peter Roskam and Democrat Senator Benjamin Cardin respectively. The purpose of the bill was to amend the Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Export- Import Bank Act of 1945 to bar US citizens from supporting boycotts against Israel, including its settlements. Violations would be subject to minimum civil penalty of $250,000 and a maximum criminal penalty of $1 million and 20 years in prison. The bill cited the United Nations Human Rights Council's (UNHRC) March 2016 resolution calling for the creation of a database of companies operating in the occupied Palestinian territories as an example of a boycott supposedly covered by the law. Anyone choosing to not buy from companies listed in the database could, according to the bill's critics, be in violation and risk facing penalties or even jail time. The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed an amended version of the bill on June 28, 2018 and on March 3, 2018, Cardin released an amended version in the Senate. The amended bill removed the jail time provisions, but knowing violations of the bill could still lead to criminal financial penalties of up to $1 million. All three version of the bill were unconstitutional, according to those critics who criticized it on First Amendment grounds. The amended versions of the bill were also criticized by proponents of anti-BDS laws. Republicans Alan Clemmons and Joseph Sabag of the Israeli American Council wrote in an op-ed in The Hill: In late 2018, attempts were made from both sides of the aisle to include the bill in the Appropriations bill. The attempts were criticized by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Dianne Feinstein (D-California) who stated: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand who originally co-sponsored the bill withdrew her support from it in 2017, citing concerns over free speech. She remains opposed to the BDS movement. The pro-Israeli lobby group AIPAC criticized her change of heart. Combating BDS Act In 2019, Senator Marco Rubio, who cosponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, introduced the Combating BDS Act, cosponsored by Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colorado), Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), and Senator Roy Blunt (R-Missouri). The bill is meant to enable states to pass anti-boycott legislation with federal blessing. It has received reception similar to IABA. On February 5, 2019, the Senate passed the bill and other Middle East policy bills. it seems as though the House will not be taking up the bill in the foreseeable future.  Support and opposition  Supporters of the bill argue that it does not stymie free speech. The bills co-sponsor Senator Marco Rubio (R-Florida) tweeted: \\"Opposition to our bill isn‚Äôt about free speech. Companies are FREE to boycott Israel. But local and state governments should be free to end contracts with companies that do\\". Eugene Kontorovich who has helped states draft anti-BDS laws has argued that they aren't about free speech, but that those wishing to boycott Israel should not benefit from government contracts or taxpayer money. AIPAC continues to support the IABA and similar legislation, saying that, \\"(the legislation) protects the First Amendment rights of those who choose to boycott Israel in their personal capacity.\\" However, organizations like the ACLU disagree and have sought lawsuits on those grounds.

The nearest higher peak is Campbell Mountain, to the north.. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Olson Creek before it empties to Waterton Lake. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Olsen Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and short, cool to mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí10¬∞ F with wind chill factors below ‚àí30¬∞ F. Geology Like other mountains in Glacier National Park, Olson Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was initially uplifted beginning 170 million years ago when the Lewis Overthrust fault pushed an enormous slab of precambrian rocks thick, wide and long over younger rock of the cretaceous period.

In 1922, a letter to the editor of a newspaper noted that the closest railway station to the Islington Methodist Cemetery was the Dudley Park railway station, not the Islington railway station further north.

The circles k_1 and k_2 intersect in the points P and Q. Z_1 is an arbitrary point on k_1 being different from P and Q. The lines Z_1P and Z_1Q intersect the circle k_2 in P_1 and Q_1. The constant chord theorem then states that the length of the chord P_1Q_1 in k_2 does not depend on the location of Z_1 on k_1, in other words the length is constant. The theorem stays valid when Z_1 coincides with P or Q, provided one replaces the then undefined line Z_1P or Z_1Q by the tangent on k_1 at Z_1. A similar theorem exists in three dimensions for the intersection of two spheres. The spheres k_1 and k_2 intersect in the circle k_s. Z_1 is arbitrary point on the surface of the first sphere k_1, that is not on the intersection circle k_s. The extended cone created by k_s and Z_1 intersects the second sphere k_2 in a circle. The length of the diameter of this circle is constant, that is it does not depend on the location of Z_1 on k_1. Nathan Altshiller Court described the constant chord theorem 1925 in the article sur deux cercles secants for the Belgian math journal Mathesis. Eight years later he published On Two Intersecting Spheres in the American Mathematical Monthly, which contained the 3-dimensional version. Later it was included in several textbooks, such as Ross Honsberger's Mathematical Morsels and Roger B.

The blast killed at least 137 people and injured dozens more. Mexican authorities blamed fuel thieves, who had illegally tapped the pipeline. The explosion was particularly deadly because large crowds of people had gathered at the scene to steal fuel. Security forces tried to persuade people to move away from the scene, but they were outnumbered and asked not to engage with civilians for fear of causing a violent confrontation. The leak was reported at 17:04 CST (11:04 UTC), and the explosion occurred two hours later at 19:10. It took about four hours for responders to extinguish the fire.  Background  Fuel theft from pipelines owned by Pemex, the state oil company, has been a long-term problem in Mexico. The problem worsened in the 2010s as organized crime groups in Mexico began including gasoline theft as part of their main streams of revenue. With the international soaring of fuel prices, this criminal activity became a lucrative business for thieves. Gasoline theft crime groups used bribery and violence to corrupt government officials. Investigators suspect that several officials within Pemex are involved in facilitating the operations of these criminal groups. Complicity includes activities such as employees sharing the exact time when the fuel will flow through the pipelines, the maps of the pipelines, and how to successfully perforate them. Illegally extracting, possessing, or safeguarding petrochemicals from pipelines, vehicles, equipment, or installations is a federal crime in Mexico and is punishable with up to 20 years in prison. The gasoline thieves are known in Mexico as huachicoleros, a name derived from the slang term huachicol, or poor-quality alcohol. The gasoline they steal is often sold in public at a discounted price. These groups have gained support from impoverished communities because they provide low-cost gasoline and give some locals a venue for employment as fuel carriers and lookouts. Their supply of illegal fuel is believed to sustain entire communities in some parts of the states of Veracruz, Puebla and Hidalgo, where the explosion occurred. By mid-2018, the rate of pipeline perforations had risen considerably to slightly over 40 perforations per day, compared to 28 perforations a day in 2017. In the first 10 months of 2018, 12,581 illegal perforations were reported across pipelines in Mexico. The states in Mexico with the highest illegal perforations reported between 2016 and 2018 were Hidalgo, Puebla, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Veracruz, State of Mexico, and Tamaulipas. In 2018, Hidalgo was the state with the most illegal perforations reported with 2,121. In Tlahuelilpan alone, at least 70 illegal perforations were reported from 2016 to the day of the explosion. However, Tula headed the count in the state of Hidalgo with 500 perforations reported in 2018 alone. As a result of the increase of fuel theft, the federal government has spent approximately US$3 billion a year on pipeline repairs and maintenance, as well as compensation to buyers for whom the product was intended. When President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador took office in December 2018, he launched a campaign against gasoline theft gangs, and dispatched close to 5,000 troops from the Mexican Armed Forces and the Federal Police to guard pipelines across Mexico. Part of his strategy was to divert the flow of fuel from pipelines, detect leaks when they occurred, and transport the fuel by trucks. Most of the thieves operate in remote areas, and drill at the pipelines during the night to avoid detection. These measures were intended to stop the thieves from illegally tapping fuel pipes. When implemented, however, the measures led to logistical problems, resulting in fuel shortages and long lines at gas stations nationwide in January 2019.  Incident  Tlahuelilpan is crossed by one of the country's main fuel pipelines, connecting the port of Tuxpan, Veracruz, with the Pemex complex at Tula, Hidalgo, some to the southwest of the town. Reports of residents collecting what appeared to be fuel in the San Primitivo district of the town started circulating on social media during the afternoon of 18 January 2019. A video shot earlier and later uploaded to YouTube showed local residents with buckets, jerrycans and water bottles swarming around a large petrol fountain coming from a rupture in the pipeline; witnesses interviewed later on local television spoke of a crowd numbering in the hundreds, \\"or perhaps even a thousand\\". Other accounts stated that some residents, including children, were jokingly throwing gasoline at each other and horseplaying near the breach zone. A 911 call to local police reported the leak at 17:04 hours, and the explosion occurred at 19:10 hours. When first informed of the leak, Pemex did not initially close the valve because they did not consider the leak \\"important\\". It took four hours to extinguish the explosion's fire. Residents from the surrounding areas were evacuated. It is believed that the fountain caused fumes of the fuel to fill the air which later ignited in a huge fireball that consumed the surrounding fields which had been soaked with fuel. The pipeline at the rupture point was estimated to carry around 10,000 barrels of gasoline at . The exact cause of the fire that ignited the spill is not yet known. Investigators' first hypothesis was that the gases produced by the leak and the electricity sparks caused by the friction of people's synthetic clothes may have caused the explosion. The explosion was particularly deadly because the free gasoline attracted large numbers of people to the breach zone. Residents also stated that the shortage of gasoline in the area may have prompted many to attend the scene when they heard of the breach. There were about 25 troops at the site, but Secretary of Defense Luis Cresencio Sandoval stated that there were not enough personnel to turn back the 600‚Äì800 residents who had reached the site in search of fuel. He stated that the Army tried to persuade villagers to not get near the breach zone, and that some became aggressive when asked to turn back. None of the residents were carrying firearms, but some were armed with sticks and stones. The soldiers did not intervene with civilians as they were outnumbered. They were also asked by their leadership not to engage with potential fuel thieves at the scene when residents started flocking to the breach, because they feared a shootout would break out and unarmed civilians would be hurt or that soldiers would be killed by an angry mob.  Reactions  The military's DN-III Plan for civilian assistance and disaster relief was activated in the evening of 18 January. Several of the wounded victims were transported via helicopter to hospitals in Hidalgo, State of Mexico, and Mexico City. Some of the minors were expected to be sent to Shriners Hospitals for Children in the U.S. state of Texas. Hidalgo Governor Omar Fayad said that the government would take care of the medical and funeral expenses. He stated that the government would not pursue legal action against the civilians who were taking the stolen gasoline from the pipeline that exploded. Fayad confirmed that the government had information booths at the cultural center in Tlahuelilpan with the lists of the victims and the hospitals where they were to receive treatment. The list was also available at the government's website. Investigators helped recover the corpses and ordered the bodies to be sent to morgues in Tula and Mixquiahuala for their official identification. They stated that the bodies would take several months to be fully identified. Given the fact that many bodies experienced high degree burns, face-to-face recognition was deemed nearly impossible. Families were asked to identify the bodies by the belongings found at the scene. Mexican authorities asked the victim's family members to complete a DNA test to assist in the identification process. Investigators stated they would likely take the remains to institutions in the U.S. or Europe to facilitate the process. The victims' family members, however, confronted the investigators at the breach scene and asked them to not take the bodies. They criticized the investigators for wanting to take the bodies to morgues under the assumption that they were doing it for monetary gains. The families stated that traveling outside of Tlahuelilpan to recover the bodies would be difficult for them due to the shortage in gasoline and because it would prove expensive for them. President L√≥pez Obrador canceled meetings he had in Jalisco and Guanajuato upon hearing about the explosion. He visited Tlahuelilpan on the morning of 19 January, to oversee relief operations. He also promised to step up efforts to counter cartels running fuel theft. Part of his promise included a commitment to continue to crack down on petrochemical theft groups, as well as finding alternatives for citizens so that they do not depend on illegal fuel. He asked the residents of Tlahuelilpan to give their testimonies of the events, and also to provide information to law enforcement on the black market in the region, including the names of those involved in the gasoline theft gangs and details of their operations. Pemex chief executive stated that pipelines in the central Mexico area had been subject to at least 10 breaches in the past three months. One of those perforations caused a fire, which took 12 hours to extinguish on 12 December 2018. Following these incidents, the pipeline was put under repair on 23 December and remained suspended until 15 January, the official confirmed. During its suspension, Romero Oropeza said that the pipeline was breached four times. It resumed operations on 17 January, a day before the explosion. The mayor of Tlahuelilpan, Juan Pedro Cruz Fr√≠as, asked residents to take precautionary measures after a toxic smog was present in the town's air after the explosion. When asked about his thoughts on the incident, the mayor stated that the victims acted out of \\"necessity\\" when they learned about the fuel leak. He stated that fuel leaks were common in the area, but also said that \\"irresponsibility\\" played a role in this incident.  Investigation  Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero said there were indications that the incident was \\"deliberate\\". His position rested on the fact that the first incident, the leak, was intentional; however it was yet to be confirmed whether or not the explosion was deliberate. He stated that the investigation would be difficult because those involved in the incident died during the explosion. President L√≥pez Obrador stated that all possibilities were being considered for the investigation, and did not discard the involvement of major criminal groups that operate in Hidalgo, like Los Zetas or the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, as well as local gasoline thieves not involved with major drug cartels. The first hypothesis proposed by Gertz Manero's investigatory team was that the fire may have been caused by a static electricity spark product of the friction of people's synthetic clothes and the gases produced by the leak. The gasoline that was tapped into was a premium one with high octane levels, which produces lethal gases when exposed to the air. He stated that this hypothesis was not conclusive. To facilitate their investigations, the authorities stated they would step up legal proceedings to seize property involved in fuel thefts, including the land where the explosion occurred. The owners of the land said this measure was unfair and criticized the government's inability to stop fuel thieves. On 21 January, Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) received a complaint about the \\"inaction\\" of the Army during the events leading to the explosion. President L√≥pez Obrador did not give more details to the press as to what the complaint consisted of and only confirmed it was issued. The CNDH confirmed the request and stated that they were going to question several personnel who were present during the explosion to gather more details on what exactly occurred. They clarified that this investigation did not mean the Army was at fault, and that that decision would be made after the investigation concluded and when more details on the causes of the explosion became known.

Early years and career  Legaspi was born in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, and attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. He subsequently opened his own studio and boutique, Moonstone, where he sold his Art Deco-inspired futuristic styles in a space decorated with a moon and stars motif. By 1972, he had started designing costumes for the members of Labelle, whom he had met after one of their concerts in New York. He created distinct variations of what he described as his \\"futuristic concept\\" for each singer, replete with metallic designs expressing his belief that 1970s fashion would soon embrace a \\"Space Deco\\" style resonant with 1930s motifs. LeGaspi's designs would go on to have an extensive influence on 1970s music industry costume design and popular culture, most notably in his creation of the costumes worn by the band Kiss. Within the fashion industry, the mass market popularity of futuristic designs following Star Wars and the rise of disco was seen as a fulfillment of LeGaspi's vision earlier in the decade. LeGaspi also created costume designs for theater and club performances, such as the costumes for Divine's play Pork and Grace Jones' designs in her 1970s nightclub act. LeGaspi's work on the stage was seen by Afro-futurist musician George Clinton, who recounted to Vogue that \\"I watched a lot of these plays, and when we first did the Mothership Connection album in 1975, I knew that I had to get the costuming from Larry LeGaspi, who was a famous costume designer for Broadway and bands like Kiss and Labelle.‚Äù Together with his iconic designs for Labelle, Kiss, and Clinton, his work for the stage and social events embodied a range of elements that presaged later developments in mainstream fashion design, including a blend of metallic futurism with black-leather primalism, the integration of electronic technology, designs that could transform into different looks, the use of flamboyant costume elements in personal dress, and stylized androgyny.  Influence  Fashion designer Rick Owens attributes LeGaspi's work as the inspiration for his own career and celebrated LeGaspi in his Fall/Winter 2019 \\"Larry\\" menswear collection, shown in February 2019. According to Owens, LeGaspi's importance in fashion and culture stems from his creation of the silver-and-black 1970s style combining Art Deco, sci-fi, black soul culture, and sexuality, a subversive sensibility that LeGaspi's work for musicians such as LaBelle and Kiss took to mainstream middle America. In addition to his LeGaspi-inspired collection, Owens has also written a book on LeGaspi published by Rizzoli in September 2019 titled LeGaspi: Larry LeGaspi, the '70s, and the Future of Fashion.  Personal life  LeGaspi was married to Valerie Arnoff. He was friends with Divine and part of the group of friends known as Divine's \\"New York family\\". LeGaspi died of AIDS in 2001. In reviewing Owens' Larry collection, the New York Times' culture and style critic Guy Trebay described the homage to LeGaspi, who \\"exercised an outsize influence on pop culture\\" but was unduly overlooked in recent years as a powerful reminder of the entire generation of designers lost due to the disease but deserving of contemporary recognition.

Auguste Alfred Rub√© (20 June 1817 ‚Äì 13 April 1899) was a French painter.  Biography  Born in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, Rub√© was an innovator in the field of theatrical set design. This \\"decorator of rare ingenuity\\", focused on a local color search corresponding to the Romantic mouvement.Before him, under Louis XIII, each site was simply indicated on a background. Corneille's adoption of the unity of place in his tragedies led to a single set. Despite attempts, during the 18th century, to fight against this theatrical conception which restricted action, it was not until the dramatic revolution of Victor Hugo, Dumas and Vigny that living dramas were conceived and reality reproduced on stage. He had been at a good school with his master Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri, the designer of the Op√©ra-Comique, whose daughter he had just married. Ciceri had the confidence of Alexandre Dumas, who reported to him and his students, Rub√©, Charles S√©chan, Jules Di√©terle, √âdouard Desplechin, but Rub√© wanted to do even better: not only did he try to reproduce the landscapes accurately, he made them picturesque. The setting of the 2nd act of √Çme en peine, by Friedrich von Flotow to a libretto by Jules- Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges, made for the Paris Opera, served him, in a way, as a premiere. The operas for which he then brushed the sets are masterpieces: in 1846, he created the set for the 2nd act of Donizetti's Betly. His fame dates back to that moment: the 1st act of Auber's Zerline; the 1st act of Hal√©vy's Juif errant; the 4th act of la Fronde, by Louis Niedermeyer; the 1st act of J√≥zef Micha≈Ç Poniatowski's Pierre de M√©dicis; the 3rd act of Gounod's The Queen of Sheba; the 1st and 2nd acts of Meyerbeer's L'Africaine; the 1st act of Auguste Mermet's Roland √† Roncesvaux; the 4th act of Verdi's Don Carlos; the 1st and 5th acts of Thomas's Hamlet; the 4th act of Gounod's Faust; the 1st act of Coupe du roi de Thul√©,Coupe du roi de Thul√© on BnF by ; the 3rd act of Joan of Arc, by Mermet; the 3rd act of Delibes' Sylvia (ballet); the 1st and 5th acts of Massenet's The King of Lahore; the 3rd act of Gounod's Polyeucte; the 2nd scene and the 4th act of Verdi's Aida; the 2nd act of Charles-Marie Widor's La Korrigane;La Korrigane on BnF the 1st and 4th acts of Gounod's Le tribut de Zamora; the 1st act of Delibes' Namouna; the 1st act of Gounod's Sapho; the 1st and 4th act of Reyer's Sigurd; the 1st act of Messager's Les Deux pigeons; The 3rd act of Patrie, by √âmile Paladilhe; the 2nd and 5th acts of Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette; the 3rd scene of Saint-Saens's Ascanio. He also created the set representing the Roman Forum in Louis Bouilhet's Faustine at the Th√©√¢tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin, the set of the Montmartre Cemetery in Edmond de Goncourt's Germinie Lacerteux at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on, the setting of the mysterious park in Jos√©phin P√©ladan's Sphynx, at the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais, a night effect of the banks of the Seine near the Institut de France in Jean de ThommerayJean de Thommeray on Gallica by √âmile Augier and Jules Sandeau, in the same theatre. In 1858, he had painted a superb ceiling for the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais, depicting Apollo riding on Pegasus among the characters who inspired the masterpieces of the tragic and comic French actors, which, consumed by gas, was repainted in 1879 by Alexis-Joseph Mazerolle. The last composition he worked on was the curtain of the new Op√©ra- Comique. The one of the Opera was also his. By the time he died, at the age of eighty, Rub√© had become the dean of painters and decorators. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour, on 14 August 1869. To those who regretted that his painting skills were limited to decoration, he replied with a good smile: \\"What do you want, I have theatre in my blood\\"! Rub√© died on April 13, 1899 in the 10th arrondissement of Paris.

According to one of their surveys in 2006, the number of people suffering from endometriosis in India is 25 million. In 2008, Endometriosis Society of India in collaboration with Department of Physiology, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata published a paper on 'Role of melatonin in regulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 via tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase -1 during protection against endometriosis.'

At the time Cambrai, located in the Nord department of the Hauts- de-France region in France, was not part of France but a Free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1339, Cambrai became the centre of a struggle between supporters of the Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and William II, Count of Hainaut, on the one hand, and those of king Philip VI of France on the other. Among Philip VI's allies were counts John I of Bohemia, Philip III of Navarre, Aymon, Count of Savoy, Humbert II of Viennois and vassals of King Alfonso XI of Castile and Leon. Cambrai had allowed the French to garrison the city with 300 men-at-arms. Meanwhile, Edward III left Flanders in August 1339, where he had been on the continent since July 1338. Edward had asserted his rights to the throne of France, openly defying the authority of Philip VI. Wanting to satisfy his Bavarian allies, he decided to seize Cambrai. Edward asked the bishop of Cambrai, Guillaume d'Auxonne, a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire, to let him in, however the bishop also had instructions from Philip VI informing him to hold on for a few days until he arrived with a French army. Guillaume proclaimed his allegiance to France and prepared to resist a siege. The defence of Cambrai was provided by the governor √âtienne de la Baume, grand master of the crossbowmen of France. The French garrison had artillery comprising 10 guns, five of iron and five of other metals. This is one of the earliest instances to the use of cannon in siege warfare. Edward launched several attacks from 26 September, with Cambrai resisting every assault for five weeks. When Edward learned on the 6 October that Philip was approaching with a large army, he abandoned the siege on 8 October. He retreated across Picardy, devastating the plains of Cambresis along the way. A strong English garrison was left in the castle of Thun-l'Eveque. Edward then proceeded to Saint-Quentin. On 23 October, the armies of England and France faced each other across the plain between La Capelle and Buironfosse. They separated without engaging in battle.  Bibliography  * J. Aicard, F.
