The population was 1,139 at the 2010 census. History 1883 illustration of Clark A post office was established at Clark in 1880. Clark was platted in 1882. The city took its name from Clark County. An early variant name was Clark Center. City of Clark Water Tower In 1882, railroad tracks were first built through the middle of Clark. The Burlington Northern railroad and County Highway 212 ran parallel to one another and divided Clark into halves - the north half and the south half. Highway 212 similarly runs through the middle of Clark, and provides a direct travel route starting in Minneapolis, Minnesota, into Clark, then went to the Black Hills and to Yellowstone National Park. Clark was officially founded in 1886, three years before South Dakota became a state. Not long after in June 1899, the local government took action, and the Clark City Council passed Ordinance No. 26. Serving as one of the first regulations enacted in Clark, Ordinance No. 26 made it unlawful for a person to ride a horse or bicycle, faster than eight miles an hour down Commercial Street. Eighteen years later, in 1917, residents from Elrod, a small town east of Clark, made a failed effort to move the county seat from Clark to Elrod. As of 2019, Clark still serves as the county seat and houses the modest Clark County Courthouse and a public library. As for Clark's population, the highest number of residents was during the 1950s and early 1960s, which peaked at nearly 1,500 residents. In 1970, the numbers decreased to approximately 1,356 residents, and has decreased each decade thereafter. In 2016, the estimated population of Clark was 1,050 residents, or nearly a 30% population drop from the 1960s. In the 1960s, when the town reached its peak population, residents from surrounding municipalities commonly traveled to Clark for work, entertainment, and to attend school with the Clark Public School System. Neighboring Townships, including Thorpe, Carpenter, and Garfield, bused their students to attend school at one of the three school buildings which offered a K through 12 education. Many residents who called Clark home lived on family farms on the outskirts of town. And those living in town mostly resided in relatively modest homes, and often worked in the retail stores on Commercial Street. Through the 1960s, the Clark community was able to support a variety of small businesses, including two hardware stores, two banks, two grain elevators, two clothing stores, a jewelry store, a movie theater, a bakery, a restaurant, and a dry cleaners. As the years passed and the economy of Clark changed, various stores on Commercial Street came and went. The Burlington Northern Railroad stopped servicing Clark. However, the Clark water tower, the oft used grain elevators, and County Highway 212 remained in full use. In the spring of 2018, only 12 students graduated from Clark High School, which is significantly less than the 66 students who graduated from Clark High School near its peak in 1968. However, recent numbers show that enrollment in the Clark Elementary School kindergarten class is at 28 students for the 2017‚Äì2018 school year.

The population was 2,067 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Custer County. History Oxen-drawn freight team entering Custer in 1876 Custer is generally considered to be the oldest town established by European Americans in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. Gold was found there during the 1874 Black Hills Expedition, conducted by the 7th Cavalry led by Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer, a discovery which initiated the Black Hills Gold Rush. For thousands of years, the Black Hills had been part of the territory of varying tribes of indigenous peoples. They were within historical territory of the Oglala Sioux at the time of United States encounter, and within the Great Sioux Reservation established by the US Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). Having established dominance in the area by the eighteenth century, the Oglala Sioux had long considered the Black Hills as sacred land. After increasing encroachment by Americans and violent confrontations, the U.S. government forced the Sioux to cede much of the Black Hills in 1877, and opened the land for individual purchase and settlement. In 1875 trespassing gold-boomers named their settlement Stonewall (after the Confederate general, Stonewall Jackson), but it was renamed for Custer. Almost abandoned in 1876 after word of the much larger gold strikes in Deadwood Gulch spread, Custer later became an established city. Custer has had a smaller population and been less wealthy than the Northern Hills cities of Deadwood and Lead. In addition to gold, Custer and other cities based their economies on the extraction of industrial minerals, which are still important to the regional economy. Custer annually observes a \\"Gold Discovery Days\\" celebration and festivities over the last full weekend of July. This heritage tourism event celebrates the discovery of gold by the Custer expedition in nearby French Creek and the subsequent founding of the town.

Tourism Hosmer sees little tourism throughout the majority of the year; however, because the surrounding area is home to an abundant population of pheasant, throughout the fall season the town does see an influx of people who arrive from all areas of the country for the pheasant hunting season. The increase in traffic brings business to the local grocery, gas station, bar, and caf√©. Many visitors stay with families within or near the town, bringing excitement and company to the residents. A well-maintained city park offers tourist families a place to play tennis on a provided court, allow children to play on playground equipment, and relax under a large shelter. Outside of town is the Hosmer State Public Shooting Area and a park for baseball.

History The Sioux and Cheyenne people had long frequented the area, appreciating its warm springs. According to several accounts, including a ledger art piece by the Oglala Lakota artist Amos Bad Heart Bull, Native Americans considered the springs sacred. European settlers arrived in the second half of the 19th century. They first named the city \\"Minnekahta\\" after its Lakota name. It was renamed Hot Springs in 1882, which is a translation of the Native American name. A variety of health resorts were built on the tourism offered by the springs. Tourism The Evans Plunge in Hot Springs, South Dakota, c. 1900 The Evans Plunge in 2007 Some of the attractions in the Hot Springs area are the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs and Evans Plunge, built in 1890, with its naturally warm spring water.

In the early 21st century, it offers extensive outpatient treatment, acute hospital care, PTSD treatment, and an alcohol and drug treatment facility. The Battle Mountain Sanitarium was declared a National Treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation following a December 2011 proposal announced by the Department of Veterans Affairs to close the facility.

A concerned group of veterans and citizens organized a \\"Save the VA\\" Campaign; they have countered the VA's proposal based on the results of multiple Freedom of Information Act requests, getting as far as meeting with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki to show how they believe VA leadership manipulated data to justify the proposed closure of the Landmark. After the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014, Hot Springs was visited by members of the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for a Congressional field hearing regarding the proposed closure and the committee heard testimony from members of the Save the VA Committee and others opposed to the closure, as well as two VA administrators in favor of the closure.

History  Cresbard celebrated its centennial in 2006. The town was founded in 1906 when the Minneapolis & St Louis Railway completed a line from Watertown, South Dakota, to LeBeau, South Dakota on the east bank of the Missouri River. It was incorporated in 1909. The name is an amalgam of Cressey and Bard, the names of two local families. In its early years, it served as a grain and livestock center for the northern tier of Faulk County, South Dakota. Cresbard became a well known consolidated school district by the 1920s serving at least seven smaller communities in the surrounding area. The school's marching and concert band won national recognition in the 1950s and boys basketball and cross country teams won state titles. The railway was abandoned by 1940 and State Highway 20 served as the town's main link to the outside world. Following a nationwide population upswing after World War II the agriculture-based economy of the area began to show a decreasing population. The population of the school fell from a high of 350 in the 60s and 70s to less than 100 students by the late 1990s. Because of dwindling high school population (16 at last count ) citizens of Cresbard spent several years exploring their options. In 2004 the town's total population fell to 121 and the decision was made to redistrict the schools. The high school closed and was offered for sale on the internet the following year at a price calculated to attract outside business. It was purchased to serve as the corporate headquarters of Keenspot Entertainment by Chris Crosby and Chris's mother Terri, Keenspot's co-owner. Keenspot Entertainment is a growing publisher of more than 50 online comics and related materials including a number of Crosby's own projects such as the pseudo- autobiographical Superosity which briefly was set in a fictionalized Cresbard during the story arcs \\"Back in the Green\\" and \\"South Dakotan Christmas\\" in which the high school was parodied as an abandoned mental hospital. In keeping with his wacky, satirical style, Crosby's comic characters fled from South Dakota following a fictionalized version of the Blizzard of November 28‚Äì29, 2005 . As of 2007, the primary non-agricultural commercial venture in the town of Cresbard and surrounding areas is services related to the recreational hunting of pheasant, ducks, geese, deer, and buffalo . Cresbard is also the home of an hotel and restaurant, museum, auto shop, oil supply company, insurance agency, a branch of Dacotah Bank, Senior Citizens center, two churches (one Lutheran Church‚ÄîMissouri Synod and one Methodist), and a local fire and rescue. It is surrounded by farmland. Among the businesses that closed due to the decrease in population were a grocery store, drug store, hardware store, small movie theater, laundromat, and farm implement dealership. The town no longer operates the grain elevator or lumberyard . The services these businesses represent can now be found in neighboring towns, such as Aberdeen, South Dakota which is 40 miles away. Ruth Wood, a retired school teacher and farm wife characterizes Cresbard as \\"a place where we cannot lie about our age, our background or our school pranks. There will always be someone around who remembers all of the facts (or will supply them anyway). There is no need to put on airs or pretense.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Town website * City Data on City-Data.com Category:Towns in Faulk County, South Dakota Category:Towns in South Dakota ","title":"Cresbard, South Dakota"},{"id":"134844","text":"Faulkton is a city in and county seat of Faulk County, South Dakota, United States.

Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, its hub was in Wilmington, Ohio. Airborne was founded as the Airborne Flower Traffic Association of California in 1946 to fly flowers from Hawaii to the US Mainland. Airborne Express Inc. was acquired by DHL in 2003. Prior to the acquisition, it rose to be the third largest private express delivery company in the United States, behind Federal Express (FedEx Express) and United Parcel Service (UPS). History Growth during Airborne's first 22 years was slow. Progress came slowly and competition was stiff. But in 1968, the airline known as Airbourne Freight Company, started going through some changes. The company Air Cargo Equipment Corporation developed and patented a special narrow container, known in the industry later as the \\"C\\" container (referring to its C shape), which allowed the more efficient use of space within large jet aircraft. The containers also eliminated the need to modify the cargo doors, thus saving any air-freight company that used them substantial sums of money. It does appear that around this time, early on, that Airborne began using the more efficient containers. Known at that time as Airborne of California, the company merged with Pacific Air Freight of Seattle. The newly formed airline moved its headquarters north to Seattle and changed its name to Airborne Freight Corporation. This was the name they kept until 1980. Growth from 1980-2008 * 1980: The airline changed its name to Airborne Express Inc. after buying Midwest Air Charter. Airborne Express made history by buying the Clinton County Air Force Base in Wilmington, and became the first airline in history to own and operate an airport. A number of NAMC YS-11 twin-engined turboprop freight conversions were also purchased. From that point on, Wilmington, Ohio became the company's main freight-sorting hub. * 1988: Airborne started offering same day delivery after buying Sky Courier (now DHL SameDay) as well as forming contracts with other private logistical contractors, in every city where they operated an office. The vehicles (mostly vans), and the drivers employed by these contracted companies, were all outfitted with the colors and uniforms of the rapidly recognizable Airborne colors: gray, red and black. Around this time, Airborne Express offered a less expensive second-day package service, which was modeled after Federal Express' second-day, or \\"P2\\" (priority two) parcel service. * 1991: Airborne received awards from three major companies, including Volvo, and in 1992, the airline introduced Flight-Ready SM, a prepaid express letters and Express Pack system. * 1993: Airborne introduced the Airborne Logistics System (ALS), which provided Airborne with warehousing and distribution services. * 1994: Airborne opened the Ocean Services Division, and along with ALS, helped establish the first new film distribution program for Technicolor labs since 1944. In addition, relations were established with Vietnam. * 1995: Airborne opened a second runway at Wilmington, and Boeing 767 jets were added to the fleet. The Airborne Alliance Group took care of many departments for the company. * 1996: Airborne's stock tripled, which would later lead into a two for one stock split in February 1998. Formed that year was Airborne Brokerage Services. * 1998: Airborne entered the Fortune 500 list for the first time. Airborne's first of 30 total Boeing 767s arrived at Wilmington, and the airline won an award by The Business Consumer Guide. * 1999: Airborne@Home, an alliance with the United States Postal Service, was formed. * 2000: Carl Donaway became the company's new president, which led to many managerial changes. Also that year, Airborne started a ground service for the first time in its history. * 2001: Airborne Express launched Ground Delivery Service and 10:30 AM Delivery Service. Airborne.com launched some services of its own, including the Small Business Center and Airborne eCourier. * August 14, 2003: Airborne shareholders approved the acquisition of Airborne Inc. by DHL of Brussels, Belgium. DHL is 100% owned by Deutsche Post World Net. The acquisition became effective the next day. DHL retained ownership of Airborne's ground operations and spun off its air operations as ABX Air, Inc. * November 10, 2008: Global delivery company DHL announced that it is cutting 9,500 jobs as it discontinues air and ground operations within the United States. DHL said its DHL Express will continue to operate between the United States and other nations. But the company said it was dropping \\"domestic-only\\" air and ground services within the United States by Jan. 30 \\"to minimize future uncertainties\\". DHL's 9,500 job cuts are on top of 5,400 job reductions announced earlier this year. After these job losses, between 3,000 and 4,000 employees will remain at DHL's U.S. operations, the company said. The company also said it was shutting down all ground hubs and reducing its number of stations to 103 from 412.  Incidents and accidents  Airborne Express has experienced seven accidents, with six of them being hull losses, and two resulting in fatalities. * On June 11, 1979, a de Havilland Dove operated by Midwest Air Charter on behalf on Airborne Express made a belly landing at St. Louis Lambert International Airport. Both crew members survived, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off. * On June 19, 1980, a Sud Aviation Caravelle VI-R made a hard landing at Atlanta Municipal Airport (now Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport), causing its left main landing gear to collapse. The aircraft was caught in wake turbulence from a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. The four occupants (three crew members and one passenger) on board survived. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off. * On February 5, 1985, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 crashed after takeoff from Philadelphia International Airport. Both pilots on board survived, but the aircraft was substantially damaged and written off. * On August 20, 1987, Airborne Express Flight 124, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31, was back taxiing on Runway 09/27 at Stewart International Airport during deteriorating weather condition, when an Emery Worldwide (operating as Rosenbalm Aviation Flight 74) Douglas DC-8-63F, landed on the same runway without clearance, The DC-9's tail was struck by the DC-8's wing. There were no fatalities and both aircraft were repaired and returned to service. * On January 29, 1990, a Cessna 208 Caravan crashed after takeoff from Burlington International Airport. The pilot and the passenger, the aircraft's only occupants, were both killed. This was the first fatal accident for Airborne Express. The accident was caused by overloading of the aircraft and pilot error due to the aircraft not being de-iced before departure. * On March 6, 1992, a NAMC YS-11A operating a training flight was damaged beyond repair and written off when it made a belly landing at the Wilmington-Airborne Airpark after the crew accidentally forgot to lower the landing gear. All three crew members on board survived. * On December 22, 1996, Flight 827, a Douglas DC-8-63F, crashed in Narrows, Virginia while performing a flight test. All six people on board were killed. This is the airline's deadliest accident.

His father, a merchant and farmer known as Major Timothy Dwight, was born 27 May 1726, graduated from Yale in 1744, served in the American Revolutionary War, and died 10 June 1777. His mother Mary Edwards (1734‚Äì1807) was the third daughter of theologian Jonathan Edwards. Dwight was said to have learned the alphabet at a single lesson, and to have been able to read the Bible before he was four years old. He had 12 younger siblings, including journalist Theodore Dwight (1764‚Äì1846). Dwight graduated from Yale in 1769 (when he was only 17 years old). For two years, he was rector of the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut. Dwight was a tutor at Yale College from 1771 to 1777. Licensed to preach in 1777, he was appointed by Congress chaplain in General Samuel Holden Parsons's Connecticut Continental Brigade. Dwight served with distinction, inspiring the troops with his sermons and the stirring war songs he composed, the most famous of which is \\"Columbia\\". On 3 March 1777, Dwight married Mary Woolsey (1754‚Äì1854), the daughter of New York merchant and banker Benjamin Woolsey (1720‚Äì1771). This marriage connected him to some of New York's wealthiest and most influential families. Woolsey had been Dwight's father's Yale classmate, roommate, and intimate friend. On news of his father's death in the fall of 1778, Dwight resigned his commission and returned to take charge of his family in Northampton. Besides managing the family's farms, he preached and taught, establishing a school for both sexes. During this period, he served two terms in the Massachusetts legislature. Career Dwight first came to public attention with his Yale College \\"Valedictory Address\\" of 1776, in which he described Americans as having a unique national identity as a new \\"people, who have the same religion, the same manners, the same interests, the same language, and the same essential forms and principles of civic government.\\"as cited in The Quest for Nationality: An American Literary Campaign, Spencer, Benjamin T., Syracuse University Press, 1957, p. 3 Declining calls from churches in Beverly and Charlestown, Dwight chose instead to settle from 1783 until 1795 as minister in \\"Greenfield Hill,\\" a congregational church in Fairfield, Connecticut. There he established an academy, which at once acquired a high reputation, and attracted pupils from all parts of the Union. Dwight was an innovative and inspiring teacher, preferring moral suasion over the corporal punishment favored by most schoolmasters of the day. In 1788, Dwight purchased a slave, a woman named Naomi. He stated that his intention was for her to 'purchase' her freedom for an unspecified number of years of faithful servitude. It is unknown whether she was successful in obtaining her freedom. It is also unknown whether Dwight held her in slavery while serving as the President of Yale. In 1793, Dwight preached a sermon to the General Association of Connecticut entitled a \\"Discourse on the Genuineness and Authenticity of the New Testament\\" which when printed the next year became an important tract defending the orthodox faith against Deists and other skeptics. Presidency of Yale College (1795‚Äì1817) Engraving of Timothy Dwight IV with signature Dwight was the leader of the evangelical New Divinity faction of Congregationalism‚Äîa group closely identified with Connecticut's emerging commercial elite. Although fiercely opposed by religious moderates, most notably Yale President Ezra Stiles, he was elected to the presidency of Yale on Stiles's death in 1795. Shortly afterwards, Dwight was elected an honorary member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati. His ability as a teacher and his talents as a religious and political leader soon made the college the largest institution of higher education in North America. Dwight had a genius for recognizing able prot√©g√© such as Lyman Beecher, Nathaniel W. Taylor, and Leonard Bacon, all of whom would become major religious leaders and theological innovators in the antebellum decades. During troubled times at Yale College, President Timothy Dwight saw his students drawn to the radical republicanism and \\"infidel philosophy\\" of the French Revolution, including the philosophies of Hume, Hobbes, Tindal, and Lords Shaftesbury and Bolingbroke. Between 1797 and 1800, Dwight frequently warned audiences against the threats of this \\"infidel philosophy\\" in America. An address to the candidates for the baccalaureate in Yale College called \\"The Nature and Danger of Infidel Philosophy, Exhibited in Two Discourses, Addressed to the Candidates for the Baccalaureate, In Yale College\\" was delivered on 9 September 1797. It was published by George Bunce in 1798. This book is credited as one of the embers of the Second Great Awakening. Yale's faculty, still small and theological at the end of its first century, significantly transformed when Dwight hired three new professors between 1801 and 1803: Jeremiah Day, professor of mathematics; James Luce Kingsley, professor of classical languages; and Benjamin Silliman, professor of chemistry and geology. Silliman, Yale's first chemist, introduced science education at Yale became the \\"patriarch\\" of American science. Day, a minister as well as a mathematician, succeeded Dwight as Yale College president upon his death. Religious leadership Dwight was as notable for his political leadership as for his religious and educational eminence. Known by his enemies as \\"Pope\\" Dwight, he wielded both the temporal sword (as head of Connecticut's Federalist Party), and spiritual sword (as nominal head of the state's Congregational Church). He led the effort to prevent the disestablishment of the church in Connecticut‚Äîand, when its disestablishment appeared inevitable, encouraged efforts by prot√©g√©s like Beecher and Bacon to organize voluntary associations to maintain the influence of religion in public life. Fearing that the failure of states to establish schools and the rise of \\"infidelity\\" would bring about the destruction of republican institutions, Dwight helped to create a national evangelical movement‚Äîthe second \\"Great Awakening\\"‚Äîintended to \\"re-church\\" America. In 1809, Dwight was introduced to the Hawaiian-born Henry  ª≈åp≈´kaha ªia by his relative Edwin W. Dwight, a student at Yale.  ª≈åp≈´kaha ªia, a 17-year-old boy orphaned at the age of 10, had arrived in New Haven after being given passage from Hawaii by New Haven resident Captain Caleb Britnell. Dwight agreed to tutor  ª≈åp≈´kaha ªia, who later became instrumental in establishing Christian missions to Hawaii. In 1810, Dwight became a founder of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, which launched its first mission to Hawaii in 1819 under Hiram Bingham. Scholarly accomplishments Dwight was a founder of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences and Andover Theological Seminary. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1797, and was also an early member of the American Antiquarian Society, elected in 1813.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory He received honorary degrees from the College of New Jersey in 1787 and Harvard College in 1810. Dwight was well known as an author, preacher, and theologian. He and his brother, Theodore, were members of a group of writers centered around Yale known as the \\"Hartford Wits\\" In verse, Dwight wrote an ambitious epic in eleven books, The Conquest of Canaan, finished in 1774 but not published until 1785, a somewhat ponderous and solemn satire, The Triumph of Infidelity (1788), directed against David Hume, Voltaire and others; Greenfield Hill (1794), the suggestion for which seems to have been derived from John Denham's Coopers Hill; and a number of minor poems and hymns, the best known of which is that beginning \\"I love thy kingdom, Lord\\". Many of Dwight's sermons were published posthumously under the titles Theology Explained and Defended (5 vols., 1818‚Äì1819), to which a memoir of the author by two of his sons, W. T. and Sereno E. Dwight, is prefixed, and Sermons by Timothy Dwight (2 vols., 1828), which had a large circulation both in the United States and in England. Probably his most important work, published posthumously, is his Travels in New England and New York (4 vols., 1821‚Äì1822). The work contains much material of value concerning social and economic New England and New York during the period 1796‚Äì1817. (The term \\"Cape Cod House\\" makes its first appearance in this work.) The work also contains the correspondence between Dwight and the theologian Gideon Hawley, following Dwight's visit to the elder preacher who was a very close friend of Dwight's parents. Personal life Dwight married Mary Woolsey. They had eight sons: Timothy Dwight (1778‚Äì1844), a New Haven merchant and philanthropist; Benjamin Woolsey Dwight (1780‚Äì1850), a New York physician; educator and theologian; twins James Dwight (1784‚Äì1863) and John Dwight (1784‚Äì1803); Sereno Edwards Dwight (1786‚Äì1850), who served as the third president of Hamilton College; clergyman William Theodore Dwight (1795‚Äì1865); Henry Edwin Dwight (1797‚Äì1832),:de:Henry Edwin Dwight an educator and author; and one who died young. Dwight's grandson and namesake, \\"Timothy Dwight the Younger\\" (1828‚Äì1916), served as Yale's president, 1886‚Äì1899. His nephew, Theodore Dwight Woolsey (1801‚Äì1889), served as Yale's president between 1846 and 1871. Another nephew was Theodore Dwight (1796‚Äì1866), an author and journalist. Dwight died of prostate cancer in 1817, and was buried in New Haven's Grove Street Cemetery. Mary Woolsey Dwight, died 5 October 1845.

Its function is to transmit sound from the air to the ossicles inside the middle ear, and then to the oval window in the fluid-filled cochlea. Hence, it ultimately converts and amplifies vibration in air to vibration in fluid. The malleus bone bridges the gap between the eardrum and the other ossicles. Rupture or perforation of the eardrum can lead to conductive hearing loss. Collapse or retraction of the eardrum can cause conductive hearing loss or cholesteatoma. Structure=Orientation and relations The tympanic membrane is oriented obliquely in the anteroposterior, mediolateral, and superoinferior planes. Consequently, its superoposterior end lies lateral to its anteroinferior end. Anatomically, it relates superiorly to the middle cranial fossa, posteriorly to the ossicles and facial nerve, inferiorly to the parotid gland, and anteriorly to the temporomandibular joint. Regions The eardrum is divided into two general regions: the pars flaccida and the pars tensa.Gilberto, N., Santos, R., Sousa, P. et al. Pars tensa and tympanicomalleal joint: proposal for a new anatomic classification. European Archives of Oto-rhino-laryngology. (2019) 276: 2141. The relatively fragile pars flaccida lies above the lateral process of the malleus between the notch of Rivinus and the anterior and posterior malleal folds. Consisting of two layers and appearing slightly pinkish in hue, it is associated with Eustachian tube dysfunction and cholesteatomas. The larger pars tensa consists of three layers: skin, fibrous tissue, and mucosa. Its thick periphery forms a fibrocartilaginous ring called the annulus tympanicus or Gerlach's ligament. while the central umbo tents inward at the level of the tip of malleus. The middle fibrous layer, containing radial, circular, and parabolic fibers, encloses the handle of malleus. Though comparatively robust, the pars tensa is the region more commonly associated with perforations. Umbo The manubrium () of the malleus is firmly attached to the medial surface of the membrane as far as its center, drawing it toward the tympanic cavity. The lateral surface of the membrane is thus concave. The most depressed aspect of this concavity is termed the umbo ().Gray's Anatomy (1918) Nerve supply Sensation of the outer surface of the tympanic membrane is supplied mainly by the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (cranial nerve V3), with contributions from the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), and possibly the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). The inner surface of the tympanic membrane is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve.Drake, Richard L., A. Wade Vogl, and Adam Mithcell. Gray's Anatomy For Students. 3rd ed. Philadelphia: Churchill Livingstone, 2015. Print. pg. 969 Clinical significance=Examination When the eardrum is illuminated during a medical examination, a cone of light radiates from the tip of the malleus to the periphery in the anteroinferior quadrant, this is what is known clinically as 5 o'clock. Rupture Unintentional perforation (rupture) has been described in blast injuries and air travel, typically in patients experiencing upper respiratory congestion that prevents equalization of pressure in the middle ear. It is also known to occur in swimming, diving (including scuba diving), and martial arts. Patients suffering from tympanic membrane rupture may experience bleeding, tinnitus, hearing loss, or disequilibrium (vertigo). However, they rarely require medical intervention, as between 80 and 95 percent of ruptures recover completely within two to four weeks. The prognosis becomes more guarded as the force of injury increases. Surgical puncture for treatment of middle ear infections The pressure of fluid in an infected middle ear onto the eardrum may cause it to rupture. Usually, this consists of a small hole (perforation), which allows fluid to drain out. If this does not occur naturally, a myringotomy (tympanotomy, tympanostomy) can be performed. A myringotomy is a surgical procedure in which a tiny incision is created in the eardrum to relieve pressure caused by excessive buildup of fluid, or to drain pus from the middle ear. The fluid or pus comes from a middle ear infection (otitis media), which is a common problem in children. A tympanostomy tube is inserted into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged time and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. Without the insertion of a tube, the incision usually heals spontaneously in two to three weeks. Depending on the type, the tube is either naturally extruded in 6 to 12 months or removed during a minor procedure. Those requiring myringotomy usually have an obstructed or dysfunctional eustachian tube that is unable to perform drainage or ventilation in its usual fashion. Before the invention of antibiotics, myringotomy without tube placement was also used as a major treatment of severe acute otitis media. In some cases, the pressure of fluid in an infected middle ear is great enough to cause the eardrum to rupture naturally. Usually, this consists of a small hole (perforation), from which fluid can drain. Society and culture The Bajau people of the Pacific intentionally rupture their eardrums at an early age to facilitate diving and hunting at sea. Many older Bajau therefore have difficulties hearing.

The population was 94 at the 2010 census. Interior got its start in 1907 when the Milwaukee Railroad was extended to that point. History Norwegian immigrants George and Louis Johnson moved from Chamberlain, South Dakota to the banks of the White River just north of the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1883 to establish a way-station for freighting between Chamberlain and the Black Hills. In 1886, the area was connected by rail to Gordon, Nebraska. In 1891, the former way-station was called Black with Mary Johnson as its first postmaster. In 1893, the town was renamed \\"Interior\\" by George Johnson because he did not think the name \\"Black\\" fit the description of the White River that surrounded the town. In 1907 and 1908, the town was moved two miles and half northwest along the White River to meet the Milwaukee Railroad. The former location of the town became known as \\"old Interior\\". The town went through major developments in the 1910s: in 1910, an efficient water system transporting water directly from the White River to Interior was installed and an electric grid was installed in 1912. Now with unlimited freshwater combined with being situated along the Milwaukee Railroad and near the Badlands, local committees seized the opportunity to use the town's advantage. In 1919, 21 and 22, the town hosted roundups that tourists traveled by train as far from Minneapolis to see. The events hosted cowboys from across the country and Native Americans in traditional clothing also participating.

Their travels and pioneer life in Minnesota, Kansas, Dakota Territory, and Iowa would be later chronicled in the Little House series of books written by the Ingallses' second oldest daughter, Laura Elizabeth - later known as Laura Ingalls Wilder. Laura Ingalls and her husband Almanzo Wilder would first settle in De Smet along with Wilder's parents and brother. There the Wilders lived just outside of De Smet on farmland, while the Ingallses stayed in the town of De Smet. After building a home and starting a business there, Charles Ingalls helped to found the First Congregational Church of De Smet, later helping to build the church building, with the first service being held there on August 30, 1882.

Attractions Surveyors' House, first home in Dakota Territory of the Charles Ingalls family Since 1971, De Smet has hosted a pageant, held over several weekends in July, to honor Laura Ingalls Wilder. Five of her classic Little House books were based on her experiences in and around the community. The books were popularized anew in the 1970s and early 1980s, from the long-running TV series Little House on the Prairie, which was loosely based on them. Carrie Ingalls The story of how Charles Ingalls and his wife Caroline arrived in De Smet in 1879 by covered wagon from Walnut Grove, Minnesota, is told by a cast of thirty in an open-air theater near the old Ingalls homestead and the Surveyors' House. Nearby are Silver Lake and the Big Slough, locales mentioned in her books. Reminders of De Smet's pioneer past are evident throughout the town, including the First Congregational Church, where the Ingalls family worshipped. In 1894, Laura and her husband Almanzo Wilder, with their daughter Rose, left De Smet to live on a farm in the Ozarks near Mansfield, Missouri. There, Laura Ingalls Wilder chronicled her South Dakota memories in such works as The Long Winter, Little Town on the Prairie, and These Happy Golden Years. Many residents in De Smet have made a special effort to learn the Ingalls' stories in hopes of assisting inquiring tourists each summer.Chuck Cecil, \\"Little Town on the Prairie,\\" American Profile, June 2006. Transportation * De Smet stands at the intersection of the east‚Äìwest U.S. Route 14 (5th Street) and South Dakota Highway 25 (Poinsett Avenue), which runs north‚Äìsouth. * The municipally owned Wilder Field airport is situated some north of the town. * The Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad's freight-only line between Tracy, Minnesota, and Rapid City passes through the town. Notable people \\"The House That Pa Built\\", located at 210 3rd Street SW in De Smet Former site of Ingalls Store, downtown De Smet De Smet was the childhood home of children's book author Laura Ingalls Wilder and is the birthplace of her daughter, author and activist Rose Wilder Lane. Ingalls Wilder's father, Charles Ingalls, emigrated to De Smet in 1879 with his wife, Caroline, and their children Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace. There, after first living in the Surveyor House and a couple of other locations in De Smet, Ingalls built their permanent home that became known via Wilder's writings as \\"The House That Pa Built\\". Construction on the house began in 1887 and was completed in 1889. After settling in De Smet, Charles Ingalls owned and operated the Ingalls Store from 1880‚Äì1881, a small general-type store that sold various goods for the home. While the store building no longer exists, the location is noted in De Smet's downtown area with a marker on what's currently on the site, a former bank building that now houses Gass Law Firm. De Smet was also the childhood home of supercentenarian Walter Breuning. Artist-illustrator Harvey Dunn was born in 1884 approximately eight miles from De Smet near Manchester, and painted scenes of frontier life in his later years. Harry George Armstrong, a major general in the United States Air Force, a physician, and an airman, was born in De Smet in 1899.

In the media Lake Preston is mentioned in the historical novel The Long Winter by American novelist Laura Ingalls Wilder.

Though the distance was only about 12 miles, the trip was dangerous because of blizzards coming up very quickly throughout that winter, and a person caught on the prairie during a blizzard had almost no chance of survival.

Grabill Deadwood circa 1890s Deadwood (Lakota: Ow√°yasuta; \\"To approve or confirm things\\") is a city in and county seat of Lawrence County, South Dakota, United States. It was named by early settlers after the dead trees found in its gulch. The city had its heyday from 1876 to 1879, after gold deposits had been discovered there, leading to the Black Hills Gold Rush. At its height, the city had a population of 25,000, and attracted larger-than-life Old West figures including Wyatt Earp, Calamity Jane, and Wild Bill Hickok (who was killed there). According to the 2010 census, the population was 1,270. The entire city has been designated as a National Historic Landmark District, for its well-preserved Gold Rush-era architecture. Deadwood's proximity to Lead often leads to the two cities' being collectively named \\"Lead-Deadwood\\". History=19th century The settlement of Deadwood began illegally in the 1870s, on land which had been granted to the Lakota people in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. The treaty had guaranteed ownership of the Black Hills to the Lakota people, who considered this area to be sacred. The settlers' squatting led to numerous land disputes, several of which reached the United States Supreme Court. Everything changed after Colonel George Armstrong Custer led an expedition into the Black Hills and announced the discovery of gold in 1874, on French Creek near present-day Custer, South Dakota. This announcement was a catalyst for the Black Hills Gold Rush, and miners and entrepreneurs swept into the area. They created the new and lawless town of Deadwood, which quickly reached a population of approximately 5,000. By 1876, over 25,000 people settled in Deadwood. In early 1876, frontiersman Charlie Utter and his brother Steve led to Deadwood a wagon train containing what they believed were needed commodities, to bolster business. The town's numerous gamblers and prostitutes staffed several profitable ventures. Madame Mustache and Dirty Em were on the wagon train, and set up shop in what was referred to as Deadwood Gulch. Women were in high demand by the miners, and the business of prostitution proved to have a good market. Madam Dora DuFran eventually became the most profitable brothel owner in Deadwood, closely followed by Madam Mollie Johnson. 3D laser scan image of the Bullock-Clark Building, 616‚Äì618 Main Street (1894) Deadwood became known for its lawlessness; murders were common, and justice for murders not always fair and impartial. The town attained further notoriety when gunman Wild Bill Hickok was killed on August 2, 1876. Both he and Calamity Jane were buried at Mount Moriah Cemetery, as well as other notable figures such as Seth Bullock. Hickok's murderer, Jack McCall, was prosecuted twice, despite the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against double jeopardy. Because Deadwood was an illegal town in Indian Territory, non-native civil authorities lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute McCall. McCall's trial was moved to a Dakota Territory court, where he was found guilty of murder and hanged. Beginning August 12, 1876, a smallpox epidemic swept through. So many people fell ill that tents were erected to quarantine the stricken. In 1876, General George Crook pursued the Sioux Indians from the Battle of Little Big Horn, on an expedition that ended in Deadwood in early September, known as the Horsemeat March. The same month, businessman Tom Miller opened the Bella Union Saloon. On April 7, 1877, Al Swearengen, who controlled Deadwood's opium trade, also opened a saloon; his was called the Gem Variety Theater. The saloon burned down and was rebuilt in 1879. When it burned down again in 1899, Swearengen left town. As the economy changed from gold panning to deep mining, the individual miners went elsewhere or began to work in other fields; thusly, Deadwood lost some of its rough and rowdy character, and began to develop into a prosperous town. The Homestake Mine in nearby Lead was established in October 1877. It operated for more than a century, becoming the longest continuously operating gold mine in the United States. Gold mining operations did not cease until 2002. The mine has been open for visiting by tourists. On September 26, 1879, a fire devastated Deadwood, destroying more than 300 buildings and consuming the belongings of many inhabitants. Many of the newly impoverished left town to start again elsewhere. In 1879, Thomas Edison demonstrated the incandescent lamp in New Jersey, and on September 17, 1883, Judge Squire P. Romans took a gamble and founded the \\"Pilcher Electric Light Company of Deadwood\\". He ordered an Edison dynamo, wiring, and 15 incandescent lights with globes. After delays, the equipment arrived without the globes. Romans had been advertising an event to show off the new lights and decided to continue with the lighting, which was a success. His company grew. Deadwood had electricity service fewer than four years after Edison invented it, less than a year after commercial service was started in Roselle, New Jersey, and around the same time that many larger cities around the country established the service. In 1888, J.K.P. Miller and his associates founded a narrow-gauge railroad, the Deadwood Central Railroad, to serve their mining interests. In 1893, Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad purchased the railroad. In 1902, a portion of the railroad between Deadwood and Lead was electrified for operation as an interurban passenger system, which operated until 1924. In 1930, the railroad was abandoned, apart from a portion from Kirk to Fantail Junction, which was converted to standard gauge. In 1984, Burlington Northern Railroad abandoned the remaining section. Some of the other early town residents and frequent visitors included Martha Bullock, Aaron Dunn, E. B. Farnum, Samuel Fields, A. W. Merrick, Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy, Reverend Henry Weston Smith, Sol Star, and Charlie and Steve Utter. Chinatown The gold rush attracted Chinese immigrants to the area; their population peaked at 250. A few engaged in mining; most worked in service enterprises. A Chinese quarter arose on Main Street, as there were no restrictions on foreign property ownership in Dakota Territory, and a relatively high level of tolerance of different peoples existed in the frontier town. Wong Fee Lee arrived in Deadwood in 1876 and became a leading merchant. He was a community leader among the Chinese Americans until his death in 1921. The quarter's residents also included African Americans and European Americans. During the 2000s, the state sponsored an archeological dig in the area, to study the history of this community of diverse residents. 20th and 21st centuries Another major fire in September 1959 came close to destroying the town again. About were burned and an evacuation order was issued. Nearly 3,600 volunteer and professional firefighters, including personnel from the Homestake Mine, Ellsworth Air Force Base, and the South Dakota National Guard's 109th Engineer Battalion, worked to contain the fire. The property losses resulted in a major regional economic downturn. In 1961, the entire town was designated a National Historic Landmark, for its well-preserved collection of late 19th-century frontier architecture. Most of the town's buildings were built before 1900, with only modest development after that. The town's population continued to decline through the 1960s and 1970s. Interstate 90 bypassed Deadwood in 1964, diverting travelers and businesses elsewhere. On May 21, 1980, a raid by county, state, and federal agents on the town's three remaining brothels ‚Äî \\"The White Door\\", \\"Pam's Purple Door\\" and \\"Dixie's Green Door\\" ‚Äî accomplished, as one reporter put it, \\"what Marshal Hickok never would have done,\\" \\"Reformers Stir Up an Old West Town\\", by William C. Rempel, Los Angeles Times, July 20, 1980, p4 and the houses of prostitution were padlocked. A fire in December 1987 destroyed the historic Syndicate Building and a neighboring structure. The fire prompted new interest in the area and hopes to redevelop it. Organizers planned the \\"Deadwood Experiment,\\" in which gambling was tested as a means of stimulating growth in the city center. At the time, gambling was legal only in the state of Nevada and in Atlantic City. Deadwood was the first small community in the U.S. to seek legal gambling revenues in order to maintain local historic assets. The state legislature legalized gambling in Deadwood in 1989, which rapidly generated significant new revenues and development. The pressure of development since then may have an effect on the historical integrity of the landmark district. Heritage tourism is important for Deadwood and the state. Geography Deadwood is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Deadwood has been assigned the ZIP code 57732 and the FIPS place code 15700. Recreation In the summer, there are numerous trails for hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking. The northern end of the George S. Mickelson Trail starts in Deadwood and runs south through the Black Hills to Edgemont. Several man made lakes, including Sheridan Lake, provide fishing and swimming. Spearfish Canyon to the north has many places to rock climb. In early June, the Mickelson Trail Marathon and 5K, as well as accompanying races for children, are held. During the winter, two ski areas operate just a few miles outside of nearby Lead, South Dakota: Terry Peak and Deer Mountain. The Midnight Star was a casino in Deadwood owned by American film actor Kevin Costner. The casino opened in the spring of 1991, after Costner had directed and starred in the Academy Award-winning film Dances With Wolves (1990), which was filmed mainly in South Dakota. The Midnight Star was a saloon which featured prominently in the previous western Costner had acted in, Silverado (1985), one of his first major roles. International versions of many of his films' posters lined the walls. The casino closed in August 2017.

Phoebe Hearst and Thomas Grier, the Homestake Mine superintendent, worked together to create the Homestake Opera House and Recreation Center for the benefit of miner workers and their families. Phoebe Hearst donated regularly to Lead's churches, and provided college scholarships from Lead‚ÄìDeadwood school which holds a staff of over 130 to the children of mine and mill workers.Smith, Duane A. - \\"Here's to low-grade ore and plenty of it, the Hearsts and the Homestake mine\\". - Mining Engineering. - September 2003. - p.23-27.

History Before the Black Hills Gold Rush of 1876, the area was used by Native Americans (primarily bands of Sioux but others also ranged through the area). Once the gold rush started, the city was founded in 1876 at the mouth of Spearfish Canyon, and was originally called Queen City. Spearfish grew as a supplier of foodstuffs to the mining camps in the hills. Even today, a significant amount of truck farming and market gardening still occurs in the vicinity. In 1887, the accepted history of gold mining in the Black Hills was thrown into question by the discovery of what has become known as the Thoen Stone.\\"The Thoen Stone\\". ‚Äì Black Hills Visitor Magazine. Discovered by Louis Thoen on the slopes of Lookout Mountain, the stone purports to be the last testament of Ezra Kind who, along with six others, entered the Black Hills in 1833 (at a time when whites were forbidden by law and treaty from entering the area), \\"got all the gold we could carry\\" in June 1834, and were subsequently \\"killed by Indians beyond the high hill.\\" While it may seem unlikely that someone who has \\"lost my gun and nothing to eat and Indians hunting me\\" would take the time to carve his story in sandstone, there is corroborating historical evidence for the Ezra Kind party.Tallent, Annie D., (1899). ‚Äì The Black Hills, Or, The Last Hunting Ground of the Dakotahs. ‚Äì St. Louis, Missouri: Nixon-Jones. ‚Äì pp.10‚Äì11. . ‚ÄîPeattie, Roderick (1952). ‚Äì The Black Hills. ‚Äì New York, New York: Vanguard Press. ‚Äì p.58. ‚Äì . In the 20th century, the history of Spearfish was tied very closely to mining and tourism. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who visited Spearfish Canyon in 1935, later called the area \\"unique and unparalleled elsewhere in our country,\\" and wondered, \\"How is it that I've heard so little of this miracle and we, toward the Atlantic, have heard so much of the Grand Canyon when this is even more miraculous?\\"\\"Vegetation-Wright Chronicles\\" . ‚Äì Spearfish Canyon Foundation. The Homestake Sawmill (previously part of Pope and Talbot, now owned by Neimen Forest Products) was built to supply timbers for the Homestake Mine in Lead (closed January 2002).

Spearfish Creek is a fast-moving creek that emerges from Spearfish Canyon at Spearfish. It runs roughly south to north through the center of town (parallel to Canyon Street), year round. The creek freezes from the bottom up instead of icing over. This unusual phenomenon occurs due to the very fast rate at which the creek flows. This speed prevents ice from forming except along the bottom of the creek bed where friction and turbulence allow the water to slow down long enough to freeze. Since the creek continues to flow atop this ice, the water level of the creek gradually rises as more ice accumulates on the bottom, in some cases causing flooding on the north side of town where the channel is not as deep. Spearfish has been assigned the ZIP code 57783 and the FIPS place code 60020. Black Hills State University has its own ZIP code, 57799. Climate Given its location at the base of the Black Hills and its proximity to the High Plains, the climate in Spearfish is highly variable at any time of the year, a phenomenon especially apparent in the winter months. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification, Spearfish is in a transition zone between subtropical (Cfa) and continental (Dfa). Due to January being just above the isotherm for continental (according to NOAA figures) it slightly leans towards subtropical, in spite of the cold winter nights. According to Weatherbase's figures, the climate is instead firmly within the continental zone. Snow depth is limited: even in winter half of all days have no snow on the ground, although on average of fresh snow falls.

The gender makeup of the city was 48.5% male and 51.5% female. Augustana College In 1884, Augustana College moved from Beloit, Iowa, to Canton. An elementary through high school was also built as part of Augustana's relocation, and educated the internationally known physicist Merle Tuve, and brothers John Lawrence and Ernest Lawrence. Old Main Augustana struggled in Canton until Anthony G. Tuve became president in 1890. Attendance doubled, but a series of crop failures soon followed. As a result, in 1894, the Church Synod withheld appropriations. President Tuve assumed all financial obligations in order to keep the school open. After the crisis, Augustana prospered and soon outgrew its building. The building was moved in 1901. Then, in 1902, the college added to the campus on the east side of town. A four and ¬Ω story brick building was erected to house classrooms, a gymnasium, and chapel. The new structure was dedicated in 1903. The college continued to grow. Enrollment increased to 330 by 1918. The school became widely known for its excellence in academics and for the many scholars came for speaking engagements. The United Norwegian Lutheran Synod had its headquarters on campus. An event in 1917 took place that changed the college and community. That year, the Norwegian Lutheran Synods merged to become the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America. The new synod considered it inadvisable to maintain Augustana College and Lutheran Normal School in Sioux Falls, barely 25 miles apart. A vigorous campaign to keep the college in Canton began. But, the advantages of locating the school in a larger community prevailed, and Canton lost their college. The bitterness was great, and was intensified when President Tuve died suddenly. The area pastors in the South Dakota district realized something needed to be done. An agreement was proposed and accepted that Canton would put up an endowment of $200,000 and turn it over to Augustana College. Then, the Normal School division would move to Canton. A fund drive was successful and the Canton Lutheran Normal School opened in the fall of 1920. The gradual transfer of the Academy division to the Canton campus was made between 1920 and 1932. The school was known as Augustana Academy in 1932 and was no longer a division of the college. Capital improvements were made to the campus through the next several years including a new gymnasium and dormitory. The history of Augustana Academy came to an end in 1971. The campus was closed and was sold to Keystone Treatment Center. The ‚ÄúOld Main‚Äù building has been converted into apartments. National Ski Tournament Site and Sioux Valley Ski Club A young man named Ludwig Hoiby, a student at Augustana and originally from Norway, gave a skiing exhibition to a group of Canton students in 1911. This exhibition began the quest to clear the hill at the Thorson farm located on the Iowa side of the Sioux River east of Canton. In 1923 the first meet sponsored by the Sioux Valley Ski Club was held at a new location several hundred yards east of the original hill. A 250-foot scaffold and an improved takeoff were built and the Central U.S. Tournament was held the following year. On February 11 and 12, 1925, the National Tournament was held and Canton was host to over 10,000 fans. World-renowned singer, Eric Bye, presented the awards to the winners of several divisions. The winner of the \\"A\\" Division was awarded The Sioux Valley loving cup, a silver traveling trophy. Many notables were present that day including a member of the Olympic team, former national champions, and the international winner and the winner of the world distance title. Tournaments were held annually at the site and in 1930 the Club hosted the U.S. National Tournament a second time. In 1932 the U.S. Olympic Ski Jumping trials were held at the hill with Casper Oimoen winning the \\"A\\" Division. Three of the four qualifiers to the Olympics were members of the Sioux Valley Ski Club. Later that winter Oimoen would place 4th in the Olympics at Lake Placid, NY behind three Norwegian skiers. Snow was scarce in 1933 so it was trucked in 90 miles from Spirit Lake and Lake Okoboji, Iowa. By the time the snow was in place, it had turned into slush. Winds changed and brought bitter temperatures causing the slush to turn to ice so the tournament had to be cancelled. The largest crowd on record at the hill was in 1935 when the club hosted its third and final National Tournament. 15,000‚Äì20,000 people attended and out of town spectators stayed in Canton or Sioux Falls, SD hotels and in Pullman cars brought in by the railroad. The Sioux Valley Ski Club hosted its final Central U.S. Tournament in 1936. Poor attendance in 1936, cost increases and uncooperative weather prompted the club to fold the following year. Wind blew down the scaffolding in the 1940s, and in the 1960s the hill was used as a motorcycle climb. Today the site can be seen south of a South Dakota historic marker on U.S. Highway 18 two miles east of Canton.The Sioux Valley News, Canton, SDThe Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, SDU.S. Ski Hall of Fame, Ishpeming, MI Hiawatha Insane Asylum The first and only institution for insane Indians in the United States was Hiawatha Asylum for Insane Indians. It was placed in Canton because of the central location among the Western states with a large Indian populations and because of the influence of South Dakota's Representative O.S. Gifford and Senator R. F. Pettigrew. In 1898, Congress passed a bill creating the institution. The bill establishing the Hiawatha Asylum for Insane Indians passed in 1899, and the Indian Appropriation Act for 1900 set aside $3,000 for land purchase and $42,000 for building construction. One hundred acres were purchased a mile east of Canton on the hills overlooking the Sioux River. The asylum was closed in 1934. The asylum grounds and buildings were used for a short time by South Dakota as a penitentiary for first time offenders. In 1946, in what Cantonites refer to as the \\"second Manhattan Purchase,\\" the city purchased for $1.00 the 337 acres and buildings of the old institution. The only stipulation of the purchases was that it be used for the welfare of the community. For a time, the asylum hospital was used for the Canton-Inwood Hospital, but today the old asylum buildings are gone. The land is now home to Sanford Hospital Canton-Inwood, Three Rivers Gun Club, the 4-H fairground and Hiawatha Country Club and Golf Course. Today, a cemetery for 121 patients of the asylum is located on the original grounds of the asylum. The National Park Service added the cemetery to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\\"Canton Indian Historical Society\\" , National Park Service. Retrieved July 2, 2011.

Transportation Faith is accessed from U.S. Route 212 and South Dakota Highway 73. The nearest commercial airports are located at Pierre, the state capital, and Rapid City, the major market city of the region, located to the southwest. The railroad was constructed in 1910 and abandoned in the 1960s; there is presently no scheduled passenger bus service or freight service to the city. Region Faith is located in the West River region of South Dakota, that section of the state located west of the Missouri River, and in the Northern Great Plains, on a ridge dividing the Cheyenne River to the south and the Grand River and its major tributary, the Moreau River to the north (both are tributaries of the Missouri). Faith is the center of a vast cattle and sheep ranching area, and is the community center for hundreds of scattered ranchsteads. It is located in the extreme northeast corner of Meade County, South Dakota's largest: it is approximately 100 miles (160 km) to Sturgis, the county seat. It is also located immediately west of the boundary of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, home to several Lakota bands organized into the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe or CRST. The region is well known for deer hunting and also offers pheasant, elk, and recently, prairie mountain lion hunting. A small reservoir, Durkee Lake, is approximately three miles south and offers a local recreation venue, with its boating, fishing, golf course, beach, and camping. Past and future Founded as the town at the end of the railroad, Faith was originally the hub of a homestead boom in the period 1910‚Äì1920; but the drought conditions of the 1920s that led to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s quickly replaced abnormally wet conditions of the early 20th century, and the harsh winters of the northern plains quickly drove many sodbusters to more hospitable regions. The town's location allows for ranch families in the area to have schools and stores closer than Sturgis, Fort Pierre, or other regional market towns, but early expectations of steady growth were never realized. Faith is still well known for its rodeos and livestock sales. The town's location made it a necessary stop on the Sunset Trail, also known as the Yellowstone Trail.

In fall of 2015, the Brandon Valley School District added an intermediate school. The school is adjacent to Robert Bennis Elementary School and will educate fifth and sixth grade students. Because the city's population had been increasing exponentially, district officials were concerned that Brandon Valley Middle School, which serves grades 6‚Äì8, was reaching capacity. Voters living within the district voted to fund $5.95 million of the estimated $14 million required to build the school by way of property tax.

It is a spiral-shaped cavity in the bony labyrinth, in humans making 2.75 turns around its axis, the modiolus. A core component of the cochlea is the Organ of Corti, the sensory organ of hearing, which is distributed along the partition separating the fluid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea. The name cochlea derives . Structure 400x400px The cochlea (plural is cochleae) is a spiraled, hollow, conical chamber of bone, in which waves propagate from the base (near the middle ear and the oval window) to the apex (the top or center of the spiral). The spiral canal of the cochlea is a section of the bony labyrinth of the inner ear that is approximately 30 mm long and makes 2¬æ turns about the modiolus. The cochlear structures include: * Three scalae or chambers: ** the vestibular duct or scala vestibuli (containing perilymph), which lies superior to the cochlear duct and abuts the oval window ** the tympanic duct or scala tympani (containing perilymph), which lies inferior to the cochlear duct and terminates at the round window ** the cochlear duct or scala media (containing endolymph) a region of high potassium ion concentration that the stereocilia of the hair cells project into * The helicotrema, the location where the tympanic duct and the vestibular duct merge, at the apex of the cochlea * Reissner's membrane, which separates the vestibular duct from the cochlear duct * The basilar membrane, a main structural element that separates the cochlear duct from the tympanic duct and determines the mechanical wave propagation properties of the cochlear partition * The Organ of Corti, the sensory epithelium, a cellular layer on the basilar membrane, in which sensory hair cells are powered by the potential difference between the perilymph and the endolymph * hair cells, sensory cells in the Organ of Corti, topped with hair-like structures called stereocilia. The cochlea is a portion of the inner ear that looks like a snail shell (cochlea is Greek for snail.) The cochlea receives sound in the form of vibrations, which cause the stereocilia to move. The stereocilia then convert these vibrations into nerve impulses which are taken up to the brain to be interpreted. Two of the three fluid sections are canals and the third is a sensitive 'organ of Corti' which detects pressure impulses that travel along the auditory nerve to the brain. The two canals are called the vestibular canal and the tympanic canal.  Microanatomy  The walls of the hollow cochlea are made of bone, with a thin, delicate lining of epithelial tissue. This coiled tube is divided through most of its length by an inner membranous partition. Two fluid-filled outer spaces (ducts or scalae) are formed by this dividing membrane. At the top of the snailshell-like coiling tubes, there is a reversal of the direction of the fluid, thus changing the vestibular duct to the tympanic duct. This area is called the helicotrema. This continuation at the helicotrema allows fluid being pushed into the vestibular duct by the oval window to move back out via movement in the tympanic duct and deflection of the round window; since the fluid is nearly incompressible and the bony walls are rigid, it is essential for the conserved fluid volume to exit somewhere. The lengthwise partition that divides most of the cochlea is itself a fluid-filled tube, the third duct. This central column is called the cochlear duct. Its fluid, endolymph, also contains electrolytes and proteins, but is chemically quite different from perilymph. Whereas the perilymph is rich in sodium ions, the endolymph is rich in potassium ions, which produces an ionic, electrical potential. The hair cells are arranged in four rows in the organ of Corti along the entire length of the cochlear coil. Three rows consist of outer hair cells (OHCs) and one row consists of inner hair cells (IHCs). The inner hair cells provide the main neural output of the cochlea. The outer hair cells, instead, mainly receive neural input from the brain, which influences their motility as part of the cochlea's mechanical pre-amplifier. The input to the OHC is from the olivary body via the medial olivocochlear bundle. The cochlear duct is almost as complex on its own as the ear itself. The cochlear duct is bounded on three sides by the basilar membrane, the stria vascularis, and Reissner's membrane. Stria vascularis is a rich bed of capillaries and secretory cells; Reissner's membrane is a thin membrane that separates endolymph from perilymph; and the basilar membrane is a mechanically somewhat stiff membrane, supporting the receptor organ for hearing, the organ of Corti, and determines the mechanical wave propagation properties of the cochlear system. Function 400x400px The cochlea is filled with a watery liquid, the endolymph, which moves in response to the vibrations coming from the middle ear via the oval window. As the fluid moves, the cochlear partition (basilar membrane and organ of Corti) moves; thousands of hair cells sense the motion via their stereocilia, and convert that motion to electrical signals that are communicated via neurotransmitters to many thousands of nerve cells. These primary auditory neurons transform the signals into electrochemical impulses known as action potentials, which travel along the auditory nerve to structures in the brainstem for further processing. Hearing The stapes (stirrup) ossicle bone of the middle ear transmits vibrations to the fenestra ovalis (oval window) on the outside of the cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid‚Äìmembrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid‚Äìmembrane waves than it does through air; a pressure increase is achieved by the area ratio of the tympanic membrane to the oval window, resulting in a pressure gain of about 20√ó from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching ‚Äì to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid‚Äìmembrane system. At the base of the cochlea, each duct ends in a membranous portal that faces the middle ear cavity: The vestibular duct ends at the oval window, where the footplate of the stapes sits. The footplate vibrates when the pressure is transmitted via the ossicular chain. The wave in the perilymph moves away from the footplate and towards the helicotrema. Since those fluid waves move the cochlear partition that separates the ducts up and down, the waves have a corresponding symmetric part in perilymph of the tympanic duct, which ends at the round window, bulging out when the oval window bulges in. The perilymph in the vestibular duct and the endolymph in the cochlear duct act mechanically as a single duct, being kept apart only by the very thin Reissner's membrane. The vibrations of the endolymph in the cochlear duct displace the basilar membrane in a pattern that peaks a distance from the oval window depending upon the soundwave frequency. The organ of Corti vibrates due to outer hair cells further amplifying these vibrations. Inner hair cells are then displaced by the vibrations in the fluid, and depolarise by an influx of K+ via their tip- link-connected channels, and send their signals via neurotransmitter to the primary auditory neurons of the spiral ganglion. The hair cells in the organ of Corti are tuned to certain sound frequencies by way of their location in the cochlea, due to the degree of stiffness in the basilar membrane. This stiffness is due to, among other things, the thickness and width of the basilar membrane,Camhi, J. Neuroethology: nerve cells and the natural behavior of animals. Sinauer Associates, 1984. which along the length of the cochlea is stiffest nearest its beginning at the oval window, where the stapes introduces the vibrations coming from the eardrum. Since its stiffness is high there, it allows only high-frequency vibrations to move the basilar membrane, and thus the hair cells. The farther a wave travels towards the cochlea's apex (the helicotrema), the less stiff the basilar membrane is; thus lower frequencies travel down the tube, and the less-stiff membrane is moved most easily by them where the reduced stiffness allows: that is, as the basilar membrane gets less and less stiff, waves slow down and it responds better to lower frequencies. In addition, in mammals, the cochlea is coiled, which has been shown to enhance low-frequency vibrations as they travel through the fluid-filled coil. This spatial arrangement of sound reception is referred to as tonotopy. For very low frequencies (below 20 Hz), the waves propagate along the complete route of the cochlea ‚Äì differentially up vestibular duct and tympanic duct all the way to the helicotrema. Frequencies this low still activate the organ of Corti to some extent but are too low to elicit the perception of a pitch. Higher frequencies do not propagate to the helicotrema, due to the stiffness- mediated tonotopy. A very strong movement of the basilar membrane due to very loud noise may cause hair cells to die. This is a common cause of partial hearing loss and is the reason why users of firearms or heavy machinery often wear earmuffs or earplugs. Hair cell amplification Not only does the cochlea \\"receive\\" sound, a healthy cochlea generates and amplifies sound when necessary. Where the organism needs a mechanism to hear very faint sounds, the cochlea amplifies by the reverse transduction of the OHCs, converting electrical signals back to mechanical in a positive-feedback configuration. The OHCs have a protein motor called prestin on their outer membranes; it generates additional movement that couples back to the fluid‚Äìmembrane wave. This \\"active amplifier\\" is essential in the ear's ability to amplify weak sounds. The active amplifier also leads to the phenomenon of soundwave vibrations being emitted from the cochlea back into the ear canal through the middle ear (otoacoustic emissions). Otoacoustic emissions Otoacoustic emissions are due to a wave exiting the cochlea via the oval window, and propagating back through the middle ear to the eardrum, and out the ear canal, where it can be picked up by a microphone. Otoacoustic emissions are important in some types of tests for hearing impairment, since they are present when the cochlea is working well, and less so when it is suffering from loss of OHC activity. Role of gap junctions Gap-junction proteins, called connexins, expressed in the cochlea play an important role in auditory functioning. Mutations in gap-junction genes have been found to cause syndromic and nonsyndromic deafness. Certain connexins, including connexin 30 and connexin 26, are prevalent in the two distinct gap-junction systems found in the cochlea. The epithelial-cell gap-junction network couples non-sensory epithelial cells, while the connective-tissue gap-junction network couples connective-tissue cells. Gap-junction channels recycle potassium ions back to the endolymph after mechanotransduction in hair cells. Importantly, gap junction channels are found between cochlear supporting cells, but not auditory hair cells. Clinical significance= Hearing loss Bionics In 2009, engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created an electronic chip that can quickly analyze a very large range of radio frequencies while using only a fraction of the power needed for existing technologies; its design specifically mimics a cochlea. Other animals The coiled form of cochlea is unique to mammals. In birds and in other non- mammalian vertebrates, the compartment containing the sensory cells for hearing is occasionally also called \\"cochlea,\\" despite not being coiled up. Instead, it forms a blind-ended tube, also called the cochlear duct. This difference apparently evolved in parallel with the differences in frequency range of hearing between mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. The superior frequency range in mammals is partly due to their unique mechanism of pre- amplification of sound by active cell-body vibrations of outer hair cells. Frequency resolution is, however, not better in mammals than in most lizards and birds, but the upper frequency limit is ‚Äì sometimes much ‚Äì higher. Most bird species do not hear above 4-5 kHz, the currently known maximum being ~ 11 kHz in the barn owl. Some marine mammals hear up to 200 kHz. A long coiled compartment, rather than a short and straight one, provides more space for additional octaves of hearing range, and has made possible some of the highly derived behaviors involving mammalian hearing.Vater M, Meng J, Fox RC. Hearing organ evolution and specialization: Early and later mammals. In: GA Manley, AN Popper, RR Fay (Eds). Evolution of the Vertebrate Auditory System, Springer- Verlag, New York 2004, pp 256‚Äì288. As the study of the cochlea should fundamentally be focused at the level of hair cells, it is important to note the anatomical and physiological differences between the hair cells of various species. In birds, for instance, instead of outer and inner hair cells, there are tall and short hair cells. There are several similarities of note in regard to this comparative data. For one, the tall hair cell is very similar in function to that of the inner hair cell, and the short hair cell, lacking afferent auditory-nerve fiber innervation, resembles the outer hair cell. One unavoidable difference, however, is that while all hair cells are attached to a tectorial membrane in birds, only the outer hair cells are attached to the tectorial membrane in mammals. History The name cochlea is derived from the Latin word for snail shell, which in turn is from the Greek Œ∫ŒøœáŒªŒØŒ±œÇ kokhlias (\\"snail, screw\\"), from Œ∫œåœáŒªŒøœÇ kokhlos (\\"spiral shell\\")etymology of \\"cochle„Ñ∑a\\", in reference to its coiled shape; the cochlea is coiled in mammals with the exception of monotremes.

Early history 1883 illustration of Flandreau The British established a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in 1763 near present-day Flandreau. The town of Flandreau, or possibly Flandreau, was originally settled in 1857, and named for U.S Indian Agent Charles E. Flandrau. The settlement, like others in the region was abandoned within a year, as a result of threatening activities of the Yankton Sioux. In 1869, the town was resettled by twenty-five families of Christianized Sioux from the Santee reservation. White settlement resumed in 1872. When Moody County was organized in 1873, Flandreau was made the county seat. Richard F. Pettigrew of Sioux Falls, a relative of Pettigrew settlers in Flandreau, made the establishment of an Indian School at Flandreau part of his successful 1889 campaign for the U.S. Senate; the Riggs Institute was opened in 1892 and is today known as the Flandreau Indian School.

The population was 948 at the 2010 census. Hill City is located southwest of Rapid City on U.S. Highway 16 and on U.S. Route 385 that connects Deadwood to Hot Springs. Hill City is known as the \\"Heart of the Hills\\", a distinction derived from its proximity to both the geographical center of the Black Hills, and the local tourist destinations. The city has its roots in the Black Hills mining rush of the late 19th century. Tin mining was dominant in the 1880s and led to an influx of capital and people into the area. As the mining industry waned, tourism and timber became increasingly important industries to the area. With the establishment of Mount Rushmore in the 1940s, Custer State Park and the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, the Black Hills became known as a tourist destination, from which Hill City benefited. In recent years, the city has diversified to become a center for the arts in the area, featuring several art studios and festivals. History Human history in the area that became Hill City, and the greater Black Hills in particular, started by at least 7000 BC. The Arikara arrived by 1500 AD, followed by the Cheyenne, Crow, Kiowa and Pawnee. In the 19th century, the Lakota Sioux claimed the land, calling it Paha Sapa. In 1874, Major General George Armstrong Custer led an expedition into the Black Hills, during which gold was discovered in French Creek, south of Hill City. The discovery of gold opened the Black Hills, and the Hill City area, to mining. Hill City was first settled by miners in 1876, who referred to the area as Hillyo. This was the second American settlement in the Black Hills. Hill City is the oldest city still in existence in Pennington County. A post office was constructed and opened on November 26, 1877.http://www.sdhistory.org/arc/sdtowns.htm Retrieved on May 26, 2007 The city almost became a ghost town when miners relocated to the northern Black Hills after the discovery of gold there. In 1883, tin was discovered near Hill City, and the population rebounded. The Harney Peak Tin Mining, Milling, and Manufacturing Company made its headquarters on Main Street. The company was backed by English financiers and bought 1,100 prospecting sites around the area. As mining grew, the city became known for its wild living and was once referred to as \\"a town with a church on each end and a mile of Hell in between.\\" At one time, 15 saloons were located on Main Street. The company built the Harney Peak Hotel on Main Street to entertain its management and executives. Upon realizing the tin market was unsustainable, the company ceased operation in 1902. Although a small school building was established previously, a main school building was constructed on Main Street in 1921. This school building was replaced in 2001 with the current high school. On July 10, 1939, a fire started outside of Hill City. Among those who battled the blaze was Hill City High School's entire basketball squad, as well as several teachers and administrators. The United States Forest Service named the school boys one of the best crews who fought the fire. The school team name thus became the Hill City Rangers and was privileged as the only school district in the United States allowed to use Smokey Bear as its official mascot.The Story of the Hill City School Mascot, Retrieved on June 8, 2007 Hill City was incorporated on March 21, 1945. The Harney Peak Hotel remained in operation until 1934. The building has been restored and is the current location of the Alpine Inn. This building is on the List of Registered Historic Places in South Dakota. The Black Hills Institute of Geological Research opened in 1973 and is involved in the excavation and display of dinosaur and other fossils. In 1992, the institute was engaged in a legal battle over ownership of the Tyrannosaurus rex fossil named \\"Sue\\". This city was one of the filming locations for TNT's 1994 film Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee. Railroad The State Railroad Museum in Hill City The main railroad lines that intersected Hill City were the Burlington Northern Line (also called the High Line), previously the Grand Island and Wyoming Central, operated by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company; and the Black Hills Central Line, a spur that extended from Hill City to Keystone. The High Line extended from Edgemont north through Hill City and terminated in Deadwood. This line reached Hill City in 1893, and the Black Hills Central Line was extended and reached Keystone on January 20, 1900. Narrow gauge trolley cars were operated at 45-minute intervals during the day on the High Line. The High Line discontinued its passenger service in 1949 and was fully abandoned in 1983. It is now the George S. Mickelson Trail, after being converted to a bike trail during the 1990s. \\"1880 Train\\" in Hill City In 1957, the Black Hills Central Railroad, also known locally as the 1880 Train, opened a tourist passenger train on the Black Hills Central Line. In 1972, a flood destroyed the last mile of the Burlington Northern and Black Hills Central Lines that extended from Hill City to Keystone. This final mile was restored in 2001. The Black Hills Central Railroad restores era-style locomotives and train cars. It has been featured on television shows such as the Gunsmoke episode \\"Snow Train\\", General Hospital, and the TNT mini-series Into the West. The railroad also made an appearance in the movie Orphan Train. Sue controversy The Black Hills Museum of Natural History On August 12, 1990, Sue Hendrickson, an American paleontologist working for the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research discovered the fossil of what would become the most complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex ever discovered. The fossil was named \\"Sue\\" after the woman who discovered it. After discovery, excavation, and transport to the institute's facilities in Hill City, controversy arose as to who the rightful owners of the fossil were. The parties in dispute were the land owner, Maurice Williams; the tribe, and thus the federal government; and the Black Hills Institute. On May 12, 1992, FBI agents seized Sue from the institute over the course of three days. The fossil was shipped to South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Through the ongoing court battle, it was finally decided that Maurice Williams was the owner of the fossil. The federal government later brought a 39-count, 153-charge indictment against the institute and several of its members, which was related to this case and other fossils. This case turned into the longest criminal trial in South Dakota state history. Peter Larson, the president of the institute, was convicted on two counts of customs violations, for which he served two years in federal prison. Sue was finally auctioned off by Sotheby's auction house and sold by Maurice Williams to the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois for $8.36 million.

It is part of the Pierre, South Dakota micropolitan area and the county seat of Stanley County. The population was 2,078 at the 2010 census. The settlement of Fort Pierre developed around an 1832 trading post and fort situated on the west bank of the Missouri River, near the confluence with its tributary Bad River. But another American-owned trading post had been operating nearby since 1817, and in 2017 the city celebrated its bicentennial of continuous permanent settlement. History On March 30, 1743, Francois and Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V√©rendrye reached the area of present-day Fort Pierre during an expedition west from Quebec, a French colony in present-day Canada. They left a lead plate buried in a hill to claim the land for the King of France. In the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States acquired this area and the remainder of France's vast territory west of the Mississippi River. President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery Expedition in 1804 to explore the territory, especially by traveling west to the Upper Missouri and Platte rivers, in the hope of finding a water route to the Pacific Ocean. They met with the Teton Sioux on the south side of the mouth of the Bad River on 24‚Äì28 September 1804. In 1817 fur trader Joseph La Framboise, Jr., an agent for the American Fur Company, established Fort Tecumseh a mile to the north, on what is now La Framboise Island in the Missouri River. The fur trade was highly lucrative and attracted competitors. In 1832, Pierre Chouteau, Jr., a major fur trader from St Louis, replaced that early facility with Fort Pierre Chouteau, a trading post and fort on the west side of the Missouri and north side of the Bad River's mouth. The city of Fort Pierre gradually developed around the trading post. Fort Pierre celebrated its Bicentennial in 2017, marking 200 years of continuous permanent settlement at the confluence of the Missouri and Bad rivers. In 1880, the settlement of Pierre was founded on the east side of the Missouri River in Hughes. Because it was centrally located and reached first by the railroad, it was designated by the state legislature as the state capital when South Dakota was admitted as a state. Geography Fort Pierre is located at (44.358941, -100.375742). Across the Missouri River from Fort Pierre is the state capital of South Dakota, Pierre.

The population was 129 at the 2010 census. Java derives its name from Java coffee, and Coffee Town was an early variant name. Java received its name from railroad crews on the Chicago, Mailwaukee & St. Paul Railway Line who would stop for coffee in the town prior to the railroad's relocation in 1908.  History  Main Street, Java in 2018. Java was founded in 1900, shortly after the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Line was extended from Bowdle to the Missouri River. The village was incorporated into a town by election in 1903 after survey of the townsite by Surveyor George Merriman of Bowdle on September 5 of that year. Many of the first homesteaders were of German, Russian, Dutch, English, and Hungarian ancestry. The Java Herald, the first newspaper serving the town, was established in 1903 by Carl F. Clement, and was printed in both English and German. In 1904, the first municipal building, a jail, was erected, in addition to gravel streets and an engine house equipped with a fire engine, hoses, and other related items. Additionally, the Dakota Central Telephone Company installed a telephone booth and switchboard at The Java House, Java's first hotel, founded in 1900 by H. A. Taylor. Later, wooden sidewalks, a water reservoir, a town hall, a town well, and a windmill (to grind grain) were added. These additions were paid by warrants issued by the town, and in 1906 a $2,000 bond issue was passed to remove the debt. In 1905, the Kupp Brothers, J. C. and George, supervised the installation of a more permanent telephone system in the town for the Dakota Telephone Co. By 1907, the town possessed fire protection, a cemetery association, water supply, municipal buildings, and improved telephone facilities. Another addition to the town was made when the Milwaukee Land Company had their property north of the railroad track surveyed and added. From 1908-1909, the railroad company rerouted its track, passing north of the town by one-half mile. The citizens received a proposal from railroad officials to move the town north, however, this proposal was refused, and the town was served thereafter by a spur line constructed by the company. By 1913, the town had a Catholic, a Presbyterian, a German Lutheran, and a German Congregational Church. In 1915, the wooden sidewalks along Main street were removed and replaced with cement sidewalks. Later that year, the town hall was remodeled, the jail was moved, a bell tower was constructed. In 1916, a municipal light plant was constructed. In 1921, a schoolhouse was constructed, and at this time Java was incorporated from a town into a city, and adopted the Mayor-Alderman form of government, the first mayor under this new system being Carl F. Clement. In 1939, a Public Works Administration project was begun, creating a waterworks system to include both commercial and private users. In 1947, the city saw the creation of a park board that established a city park just west of the school house. The old blacksmith shop in Java, in 2018, opened by John Banik in 1901.  Java High School  Grain elevators in Java, in 2018.In 1901, the first term of school was help in a building that had been relocated into town, serving twenty-three students, ranging in age from five to eighteen years.

The Melton Hill excavations uncovered two substantial Woodland period villages along the Clinch at Bull Bluff and Freels Bend, both approximately downstream from Clinton.Glyn DuVall, \\"A Phase I Archaeological Survey of Proposed Potable Water Storage and Force Main Facilities, Y-12 National Security Complex Site, Anderson County, Tennessee.\\" August 2005.

View of Clinton in 1938 By the time Euro-American explorers and long hunters arrived in the Clinch valley in the mid-18th century, what is now Anderson County was part of a vast stretch of land claimed by the Cherokee.Snyder Roberts, \\"Historical Background of Anderson County, TN ,\\" originally published in History of Clinton Senior High School, 1971. Retrieved: 21 February 2008. Although the Treaty of Holston, signed in 1791, was intended as a negotiation with the Cherokee to prohibit Euro- American settlement of the area including what is today Anderson County, the treaty became ineffective as more settlers moved through the Appalachian Mountains from Virginia and North Carolina into Tennessee. The earliest settlers in Anderson County included the Wallace, Gibbs, Freels, Frost and Tunnell families. The flooding of white settlers into the Indian domain was cause for several skirmishes, which eased after the Treaty of Tellico in 1798 (including an origination point for the land to be relinquished from the Cherokee being the Tellico Blockhouse) allowed for greater ease in settling the area. Founded in 1801, the town of Burrville was named in honor of Aaron Burr, first-term Vice President under Thomas Jefferson. Land was selected and partitioned for a courthouse, and Burrville was designated as the county seat for the newly formed Anderson County. The county was partitioned from portions of Grainger County and Knox County in 1801; neighboring Roane County was also formed from a portion of Knox County in 1801, making Anderson and Roane counties effectively \\"sister counties\\". On November 8, 1809, by act of Tennessee State Legislature, the town of Burrville was renamed because of the disgrace felt when Burr was charged with treason for conspiring with the Governor of the Louisiana Purchase, to form another country from part of the Louisiana Purchase and part of Mexico. The selection of the name \\"Clinton\\" was most likely to honor George Clinton or his nephew, DeWitt Clinton.Tara Mitchell Mielnik, Anderson County.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 11 February 2013. George Clinton was one of Burr's New York political rivals who, along with Alexander Hamilton, destroyed Burr's bid for the governorship of the state of New York after his single-term Vice Presidency. George Clinton succeeded Burr as the second-term Vice President for Thomas Jefferson in 1805 (and also served as James Madison's Vice President, making Clinton the first Vice President to serve under two presidents and the first Vice President to die in office). Because of the political position of George Clinton as Vice President at the time of Burrville's name change, compared to DeWitt Clinton's position as the mayor of New York City, most likely the residents of the town of Burrville would have been more readily identifiable and more honorable toward George Clinton than DeWitt; therefore, it is most likely Clinton was named after George Clinton, barring historical proof. World War II The Clinton Engineer Works, named after Clinton, was the official name for the Manhattan Project site in Tennessee which produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. The site was also known by the name of its largest township, Oak Ridge. The works were located starting about southwest of Clinton, continued for towards Kingston and contained roughly . Clinton High School desegregation controversy African-American students entering Clinton High School, December 1956 In 1956, Clinton gained national attention when segregationists opposed the desegregation of Clinton High School. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of Brown v. Board of Education, a court order required the desegregation of the high school. Twelve African-American students enrolled in the high school in the fall of 1956. On August 27, 1956, the Clinton Twelve attended classes at Clinton High School for the first time, becoming the first African-Americans to desegregate a state-supported public school in the Southeast. While the first day of classes occurred without incident, pro-segregation forces led by John Kasper and Asa Carter arrived in Clinton the following week and rallied the city's white citizens. Riots broke out in early September, forcing Governor Frank G. Clement to station National Guard units in Clinton throughout September. Sporadic violence and threats continued for the next two years, culminating in the bombing of Clinton High School on October 5, 1958. With an influx of outside aid, however, the school was quickly rebuilt.Carroll Van West, \\"Clinton Desegregation Crisis.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009.

Rogers Group quarry pushback In the 1990s, the Rogers Group, a firm specializing in road paving, began a campaign to reactivate an abandoned quarry and build an asphalt plant just east of Clinton near the community of Bethel. The initiative met with opposition from local and environmental groups, who were concerned that the plant would release cancer-causing toxins into nearby residential neighborhoods. Others were concerned about plummeting property values, noise pollution, damage from rock blasting, and environmental damage to Buffalo Creek. The company argued that it would follow stringent environmental and pollution guidelines, retention ponds would limit runoff, and that the site would be surrounded by vegetation. Nevertheless, Anderson County refused to rezone the quarry property for industrial uses, and Rogers Group sued the county in 1995.Leean Tupper, \\"Citizens Sue Clinton and Rogers Group ,\\" 19 September 2007.

In response, a local advocacy group known as Citizens for Safety and Clean Air filed a lawsuit on behalf of several Bethel residents in Anderson County Chancery Court contending that the council's rezoning was unconstitutional and seeking an injunction preventing the council from rezoning the property as an industrial zone.Bob Fowler, \\"Group Files Lawsuit Over Council's Rezoning.\\" 19 September 2007.

Modern day Magnet Mills factory site and water tower in 2016 In 2018, urban developers and city officials met with the proposal to redevelop the downtown and waterfront area of Clinton after the Tennessee Department of Transportation began construction on a new bridge to carry US 25W-SR 9 across the Clinch River. The highlight of the project is the 7 acre site of the former Magnet Mills complex, having 1,400 feet of Clinch River frontage. Proposed additions to the site include improved commercial development and pedestrian access in the downtown area, and a waterfront esplanade and multi-story mixed-use buildings with upper-level residential space and ground level retail and restaurant space. Since 2018, an unknown developer based out of Knoxville has planned, under contract, the purchase of the Magnet Mills site along with a nearby plot of land with the intention of converting the area into a mix of residential and retail use. The City of Clinton has also applied for grants towards the improvement of the streets and sidewalks in the city's downtown area. In July 2019, the remaining structures of Magnet Mills site, excluding the water tower, were demolished as the developer closed the sale on mill site. In early 2019, Aspire, a 450 acre multi-amenity park, was planned for development south of Clinton's downtown area. The park, proposed by the local non-profit organization, the Hollingsworth Foundation, which owns land for the site along with the Tennessee Valley Authority, plans for the park to give visitors access to hiking and mountain biking trails, event venues, kayak ports, and flower gardens. In October 2019, construction work began on the site of the park.

It is named in honor of Nebraska Senator George W. Norris, a long-term supporter of the TVA.

Winding roads followed the contour of the terrain. Houses did not always face the street. A central common green and a belt of rural land around the town were reserved for use by residents. The houses, which were some of the first all-electric homes, were built using local wood and stone, according to twelve basic house designs that each included a porch and fireplace. Different exterior materials were used for visual variety.History and Facts on Norris Dam, Tennessee GenWeb Project (accessed November 11, 2007) Hydraulics laboratory building in the 1930s Norris represents the first use of greenbelt design principles in a self- contained town in the United States. The town was the first in Tennessee to have a complete system of dial telephones. Norris Creamery was the first milk- producing plant in the world to be powered solely by electricity. During the 1930s, TVA officials excluded black families from the city, effectively making it a sundown town, purportedly to conform to the customs and traditions of the area. However, black leaders said that poor whites and blacks had lived and worked together in the area long before the TVA came into existence. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) complained repeatedly (in 1934, 1935 and 1938) about racial discrimination by the TVA in the hiring, housing and training of blacks.New Deal Network, The Planned Community of Norris, Tennessee In 1948 the U.S. Congress directed that the city be sold at public auction. It was purchased for 2.1 million by a Philadelphia investment group headed by Henry D. Epstein, which then sold individual homes to their residents. The city was officially incorporated in 1949. In 1953 the Epstein group sold its remaining Norris real estate to a corporation formed by Norris residents and known as the Norris Corporation.

Its population was estimated to be 10,499 in 2017. It is part of the Knoxville, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area. As its name suggests, Alcoa is the site of a large aluminum smelting plant owned and operated by the Alcoa corporation (Aluminum Company of America). Formerly known as North Maryville, the town was incorporated under its present name in 1919. History=Early company town Shortly after the Pittsburgh Reduction Company changed its name to the Aluminum Company of America in 1907, the company began investigating the possibility of establishing a large smelting operation in East Tennessee. The hydroelectric potential of the Little Tennessee River, which exits the mountains about southwest of Alcoa, was one of the primary incentives, as the company's aluminum smelting operation would require massive amounts of electricity. In 1910, the company established a base camp at what is now known as Calderwood, initially known as \\"Alcoa\\", and was known as such until the name was reapplied to the company's operations in North Maryville a few years later.Russell Parker, \\"Alcoa, Tennessee: The Early Years, 1919‚àí1939.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications Vol. 48 (1976), pp. 84-100. The company considered several potential plant sites in Knoxville, Etowah, and Monroe County, but chose North Maryville due in part to the influence of Maryville mayor Samuel Everett (1864‚àí1941). By 1914, the company had completed the initial purchase of in North Maryville, and had initiated construction of the smelting plant and 150 houses for company employees. ALCOA's chief engineer Edwin Fickes and hydraulic engineer Robert Ewald drew up plans for the town to house the plant's workers. The town design initially called for the acquisition of , and included four sections-- Vose and Springbrook in the north (around what is now Springbrook Park) and Bassel and Hall in the south (around what is now the South Plant). Hall, named for the inventor of the aluminum electrolytic process, was originally a segregated community for the plant's African-American workers. Oldfield, a small community between the planned town and Maryville, would later be annexed by the city of Alcoa. World War I brought about a spike in the demand for aluminum, and the company quickly expanded its North Maryville operations. In 1919, a rolling mill (now West Plant) was completed, and the company purchased the Knoxville Power Company for its Little Tennessee Valley holdings. That same year, the company's town officially incorporated as \\"Alcoa\\". C.L. Babcock was the town's first mayor, and Victor Hultquist was the first city manager. Hultquist, who was also ALCOA's superintendent of construction, remained city manager until 1948, and oversaw much of the town's early development. In 1920, Alcoa had a population of 3,358 people living in 700 houses. The Great Depression and World War II Early Alcoa was a classic \\"company town\\", with the company maintaining a paternalistic relationship with the city. The city's welfare was almost wholly dependent upon the company's fortunes. This presented a problem for the company, which feared that its workforce would leave to look for jobs elsewhere during times of low production. Thus, during the Great Depression, the company maintained steady production levels in spite of the lack of demand for aluminum. Managers sought to cut workers' hours-- which at one point dropped to 30 hours per week-- rather than slash jobs. By the end of the decade, the company had stockpiled 42,000 tons of aluminum. The Depression (and accompanying New Deal legislation) also brought about increased labor union activity in Alcoa. A strike in 1934 was forcibly ended when Hultquist deployed a large police force. A second strike in 1937 was broken in a similar fashion, with two striking workers shot and killed and the National Guard forced to intervene. World War II proved immensely profitable for ALCOA, as aluminum was needed for aircraft construction. Production increased 600% during the war, and the company's Alcoa operations workforce swelled to 12,000. In the early 1940s, the company built its North Plant, which at the time of its completion was the world's largest plant under a single roof.Russell Parker, \\"Alcoa, Tennessee: The Years of Change, 1940‚àí1960.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications Vol. 49 (1977), pp. 99-117. Modern Alcoa After World War II, the city of Alcoa became less and less dependent upon its parent company. ALCOA's public image had suffered due to its hardline stance toward labor unions, and in response, it launched a series of public relations initiatives, including the donation of land for schools, parks, and airport construction. The company also desegregated its facilities during this period. In the early 1950s, the company began selling off company housing to employees.Tara Mitchel Mielnik, \\"ALCOA, Inc..\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 23 April 2008. In 1956, Ross Walker became the first city manager who was not employed by the company, and toward the end of the decade, the company had relinquished ownership of city utilities. The completion of the Hall Road Viaduct in the 1940s and the continued development of McGhee Tyson Airport over subsequent decades led to commercial expansion and helped the city diversify its economy.City of Alcoa, Public Works and Street Development ‚àí History .

The raid was thwarted when a Cherokee conjurer named Deadwood Lighter envisioned the position of the Shawano ambush. The Cherokee surprised the raiders from the rear, killing many of them and chasing the rest back over the crest of the Smokies.Mooney, page 374.

Logging industry In the 1880s, the lumber industry experienced a boom, aided by two key innovations ‚Äì the bandsaw and the logging railroad. Flatland forest resources in the Ohio Valley and along the Mississippi Delta were quickly exhausted by the high demand for wood for fuel for steamboats. Logging firms began turning to the untapped resources of more mountainous areas.Michael Frome, Strangers in High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 165‚Äì166. 70-ton Shay engine at the Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum In 1900, hoping to capitalize on the thick virgin forests of the Smokies, Colonel W.B. Townsend of Pennsylvania purchased of land along the Little River, stretching from Tuckaleechee Cove all the way to Clingmans Dome. The following year, Townsend received a charter for his new firm, the Little River Lumber Company. He had a bandsaw mill erected in Tuckaleechee, and the community that developed around the mill was named after him. The Little River Railroad was constructed shortly thereafter, connecting the sawmill with Walland to the west, and following the Little River upstream to Elkmont to the southeast. Townsend quickly profited from the forests of the Little River bottomlands. In 1916, he reported that Little River Lumber's consistently high rate of planks per acre was showing no sign of decline. A single giant chestnut tree in the Smokies could yield 18,000 planks of lumber. Townsend's success led to a rapid expansion of logging operations throughout the Smokies. By the time the park was formed in the 1930s, nearly two-thirds of area forests had been cut down, and park managers have worked to restore the forests.\\"History\\", Smoky Mountains Visitors Guide The rapid destruction of the forests of southern Appalachia led to increased efforts by conservationists to slow or halt logging operations. Col. Townsend initially opposed the effort, but after some wavering, sold at base price of his Little River Lumber tract in 1926 to what would eventually become the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.Carlos Campbell, Birth of a National Park in the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), 33‚Äì35. Although some predicted that the loss of the lumber industry would doom Tuckaleechee, the explosion in tourism as a result of the park's founding has contributed to the area economy, keeping it relatively healthy.Frome, page 192.

These windows form when erosional forces carry away the older rocks (mostly sandstone), exposing the younger rock below (i.e., limestone).Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville, Tennessee: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 33. Limestone windows are normally flatter than other mountainous valleys, and are typically coated with rich, fertile soil. Other limestone windows in the area include Cades Cove, Wear Cove, and Jones Cove. Tuckaleechee Cove is situated between Bates Mountain to the north and Rich Mountain to the south, with the cove's greater population estimated at around 1,500.

History The land now occupied by Charleston and Bradley County was home to the Cherokee long before European settlers arrived. In the 1820s and 1830s, many white settlers began to move into the area anticipating a future forced removal of the Cherokee by the Federal Government. At times, these settlers came into conflict with the Cherokee, who resisted settlers who tried to take over their territory.\\" Goodspeed's History of Bradley County, Tennessee\\", published in 1887.

After the Hiwassee Purchase of 1819, the Cherokee Agency-- the official liaison between the U.S. government and the Cherokee Nation-- was moved to the location of present-day Charleston 1821. The agent to the Cherokees was Colonel Return J. Meigs Sr., who had served in the American Revolutionary War. That same year a trading post and store were established nearby. Fort Cass was constructed in Charleston as the headquarters of the Cherokee Removal, which was initiated by the Treaty of New Echota in December 1835. During the summer of 1838, thousands of Cherokees from various locations were held in internment camps at the fort under the supervision of federal troops before starting their journey westward, which became known as the Trail of Tears. Several other internment camps were located in the valleys between Charleston and present-day Cleveland, Tennessee over a distance of , including one at nearby Rattlesnake Springs.

Howard, Marcus J. Wright, and Samuel Bolivar Buckner. The Charleston Cumberland Presbyterian Church building was used as a hospital by Confederate Forces in 1863. The railroad bridge over the Hiwassee River in Charleston was destroyed as part of the East Tennessee bridge burnings in November 1861. Charleston was incorporated on November 11, 1956. Several areas in and around Charleston were used as the primary filming locations for the 1960 Elia Kazan film Wild River. The city's business district served as the fictional Garthville in the film.

The population was 2,355 at the 2010 census. History The name \\"Jellico\\" is a local alteration of \\"angelica\\", the name of an herb that grows in abundance in the surrounding mountains. The name was first applied to the mountains to the west and to the mountains' main drainage, Jellico Creek, which passes west of the city of Jellico and empties into the Cumberland River near Williamsburg, Kentucky. A child laborer at Proctor Coal near Jellico, 1910. Photo by Lewis Hine. In the early 1880s, a high quality bituminous coal was discovered in the Jellico Mountains, and with the completion of railroad tracks to the area in 1883, coal mines quickly sprang up throughout the area. The city of Jellico was initially founded as \\"Smithburg\\" in 1878 but changed its name to \\"Jellico\\" in 1883 to capitalize on the growing popularity of Jellico coal. The city was incorporated on March 7, 1883.James Hayden Siler, \\"The History of Jellico.\\" Unpublished manuscript, c. 1938. Retrieved: 6 October 2008. Throughout the 1890s and early 1900s, Jellico was one of the most productive coal fields in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1906, a railroad car packed with dynamite exploded in Jellico, killing eight and destroying part of the town. The town quickly recovered, however, and many of the buildings in the Main Street area date from this period. On July 6, 1944, at High Cliff (3 miles east of Jellico), a troop train carrying new recruits on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad derailed, causing the locomotive and 4 leading cars to fall 50 feet into Clear Fork; 35 people were killed and 100 more injured.

The town is located in the West Carroll School District, and is home to a school for grades K through 3rd. History McLemoresville was once, briefly in the 19th century, the county seat for Carroll County, and was the largest town in the county. Bethel College, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church's only four-year liberal arts college, began in McLemoresville, as did the denomination's theological school. Both later relocated to McKenzie, after the railroad companies laid down tracks in the mid-19th century and did not include McLemoresville. The town then started its decline. Later, in the 1950s, the Theological School moved to Memphis, where it was renamed Memphis Theological Seminary. The town once had, in the mid-19th century, over 11 saloons, and several schools with boarding facilities, including the McLemoresville Collegiate Institute, the McLemoresville Women's Collegiate Institute, and others. It had several inns and restaurants. The town's high school burned in the 1940s or 1950s and was not replaced. The school continued to educate children through the eighth grade. A new building was erected around 1958, and this building, with additions and modifications, now houses the grades K-2 for West Carroll School District. The old McLemoresville Elementary School, which included a junior high school, participated in basketball and band. It was particularly successful in band and boys' basketball in the mid-to-late 1960s, winning county tournaments and band competitions around West Tennessee and the state. The school held annual beauty pageants for girls, had a very active Parents-Teachers Association, and the school partially integrated in 1965 and fully in 1966 (both without event) with the closure of the old MTA School for African-American students. It was also known as Carrollton. The town is called ‚ÄúMcLee‚Äù (pronounced ‚ÄúMACK Lee‚Äù) by local residents. McLemoresville,\\"MacLee\\" was the beloved home of Dixie Carter from her earliest memories until her final rest. Working with noted architect Hoyte Johnson, she helped to evolve her home-place into a comfortable venue to share with her family, her friends, and nearby Huntingdon College. Her husband, Hal Holbrook referred to the home as having \\"feel\\" of the Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut, and that there is no other place to which he feels so ideally suited. Besides the grand \\"Music Room\\" addition, the house is surrounded with the talented works of her mother, Virginia (Ginna) who built the expert masonry fireplaces and mantels in the older parts of the house, as well as the wooden guest house beneath the ancient Catalpa trees in the back yard. Her father, Halbert Carter (Hal) remains forever present in the books that line the back room walls and the tapestry of tales told by a once great haberdasher.

The Doe River forms in Carter County, Tennessee, near the North Carolina line, just south of Roan Mountain State Park. The river initially flows north and is first paralleled by State Route 143; at the community of Roan Mountain, Tennessee, it then turns west and is at this point paralleled by U.S. Route 19E. The Doe River flows to the east of Fork Mountain; the Little Doe River flows by Fork Mountain to the west. Below the confluence of the Doe River and the Little Doe River at Hampton, the Doe River then travels roughly in a northern downstream direction through the Valley Forge community, and is rejoined by U.S. Route 19E. Pushing through a mountain gap just north of Hampton, the volume of the river is amplified by the waters flowing from McCathern Spring. Broad Street Bridge Further downstream, the Doe River flows by the East Side neighborhood parallel with Tennessee State Route 67 and then underneath the historic Elizabethton Covered Bridge, built in 1882 and located within the Elizabethton downtown business district. Connecting 3rd Street and Hattie Avenue, the covered bridge is adjacent to a city park and spans the Doe River. The covered bridge, although now closed to motor traffic, is still open for bicycles and pedestrians. Most of Elizabethton's downtown is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its historical and architectural merits. The Elizabethton Historic District contains a variety of properties ranging in age from the late 18th century through the 1930s. The Elizabethton Covered Bridge is an important focal point and a well-known landmark in the state. In addition to the covered bridge, the downtown historic district contains the 1928 Elk Avenue concrete arch bridge, and just a little further downstream on the Doe River, Tennessee State Route 67 passes another similar concrete arch bridge locally known as the Broad Street Bridge.

The downtown business district is located approximately one-quarter mile upstream of the confluence of the Doe River and the Watauga River. The Doe River flows underneath the historic wooden covered bridge that is located within the Elizabethton downtown business district. The city of Elizabethton was at one time promoted as \\"The City of Power\\", as the town is located just southeast of the Wilbur Dam hydrogeneration site spanning the Watauga River. Construction of Wilbur Dam first began during 1909, and two hydroelectric generating units were online with power production at Wilbur Dam when it was completed in 1912. A third generating unit was added to Wilbur Dam in 1926, and a fourth hydrogeneration unit was added to Wilbur Dam after the Tennessee Valley Authority acquired the power production facility in 1945.

Holston Mountain communication towers  The main waterfall at Blue Hole Falls northeast of Elizabethton on Holston MountainElizabethton lies within a river valley basin mostly surrounded by mountain ridges and significant hills, such as Holston Mountain, the southern end of which lies just to the northeast. Panhandle Road is located off State Highway 91 in Carter County and ascends Holston Mountain for from the eastern side and ends along the ridge southwest of Holston High Point. During periods of heavy snow and ice, the National Forest Service closes Panhandle Road. Located near the Cherokee National Forest boundary and to the left of Panhandle Road is a parking area and foot trail that leads down the slope to the Blue Hole Falls (approximately high). The last of Panhandle Road are filled with washouts, steep drop-offs, and no turnarounds. Vehicle travel on this last section is at the driver's risk. Holston High Point as seen from Holston High Knob Early broadcasters in the 1950s and 1960s quickly realized Holston Mountain would be a prime radio-television transmission location because it is the highest visible point that faces most of the major cities in Northeast Tennessee. As a result, the Holston Mountain ridge is the transmitter site for three television stations in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee Television Designated Market Area. The broadcasting antenna for WCYB-TV, Channel 5, Bristol, Virginia, is on Rye Patch Knob, with the top of the antenna above ground, above the surrounding valley floor, and above sea level. The single tower the antenna sits on is the highest and tallest man-made structure on the mountain. The television towers for WJHL-TV, Channel 11, Johnson City, and WKPT-TV, Channel 19, Kingsport, are standing side by side in a common broadcasting antenna farm on the southwest slope of Holston High Point, southwest of Rye Patch Knob. The antenna for WJHL-TV stands above ground, above the surrounding valley floor, and above sea level. The antenna for WKPT-TV next door stands above ground, also above the valley floor, and above sea level. The stations' digital antennas are also on their respective Holston Mountain is also the transmitting site for three FM Class C radio stations: WTFM-FM 98.5, Kingsport, Tennessee; WXBQ-FM 96.9, Bristol, Virginia, and WETS-FM 89.5, Johnson City, Tennessee. All three antennas and the backup antennas are located at the antenna farm on the southwest slope of Holston High Point. Also located on the ridge are the antenna for one FM Class C1 radio station, WHCB-FM 91.5, Bristol, Tennessee, located at Rye Patch Knob; one FM Class C2 antenna for radio station WCQR-FM 88.3, Kingsport, Tennessee, and one FM Class D antenna for radio station W214AP-FM 90.7, Johnson City, Tennessee, both transmitting from the antenna farm on the southwest slope of Holston High Point. Various U.S. federal, Tennessee state, Sullivan, Washington and Carter County governmental agencies, along with utility microwave relay stations, also transmit base-to-mobile communications from the Holston High Point antenna farm and Rye Patch Knob. The Federal Aviation Administration maintains a navigational beacon at the Holston Mountain summit. East Tennessee PBS (or \\"ETPtv\\"), while not having a television repeater station serving the immediate are, broadcasts programming on two different over-the-air digital channels that can be received and viewed at higher hilltop elevations in Elizabethton. In early 2009, ETPtv became one of the first stations in East Tennessee to broadcast a digital high definition signal 24 hours a day.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 20.5% under the age of 18, 10.8% from 18 to 24, 24.5% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 21.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 82.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 76.8 males. The median income for a household in the city was $25,909, and the median income for a family was $33,333. Males had a median income of $26,890 versus $20,190 for females. The per capita income for the city was $14,578. About 15.2% of families and 19.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.8% of those under age 18 and 16.1% of those age 65 or over.  History = Native American inhabitants  The area that is now Tennessee was first settled by Paleo-Indians nearly 11,000 years ago. The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between first settlement and the time of European contact are unknown, but several distinct cultural phases have been named by archaeologists, including Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian, whose chiefdoms were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee people who inhabited the Tennessee River Valley prior to Cherokee migration into the river's headwaters. When Spanish explorers first visited Tennessee, led by Hernando de Soto in 1539‚Äì43, it was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi people. Possibly because of European diseases devastating the Native tribes, which would have left a population vacuum, and also from expanding European settlement in the north, the Cherokee moved south from the area that is now Virginia. As British American colonists spread into the Province of Carolina, the native populations were forcibly displaced over time to the south and west, including all Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw, and Choctaw. From 1838 to 1839, nearly 17,000 Cherokees were forced to march from \\"emigration depots\\" in Eastern Tennessee, such as Fort Cass, to Indian Territory west of Arkansas. This came to be known as the Trail of Tears, as an estimated 4,000 Cherokees died along the way.Satz, Ronald. Tennessee's Indian Peoples. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1979.  Colonial settlement  Transylvania Purchase at Sycamore Shoals in Elizabethton and the Wilderness Road into Kentucky In 1769, a young James Robertson accompanied explorer Daniel Boone on his third expedition to lands beyond the Allegheny Mountains. The party discovered the \\"Watauga Old Fields\\" (lands previously cultivated by generations of Native Americans) along the Watauga River valley at present-day Elizabethton, which Robertson planted with corn while Boone continued on to Kentucky. By 1769 Boone had formed an association with North Carolina promoter and judge Richard Henderson with a goal to purchase and settle a vast tract of Cherokee lands in present-day Middle Tennessee and Kentucky, and Boone later relocated his family to the Watauga Settlement sometime during the spring of 1771.\\"Daniel Boone\\", The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. The University of Tennessee Press After the Battle of Alamance in 1771, many North Carolinians refused to take the new oath of allegiance to the Royal Crown and withdrew from the province. Instead of taking their new oath of allegiance, James Robertson led a group of some twelve or thirteen families involved with the Regulator movement from near where present-day Raleigh, North Carolina, now stands. In 1772, Robertson and the pioneers who had settled in Northeast Tennessee (along the Watauga River, the Doe River, the Holston River, and the Nolichucky River) met at Sycamore Shoals to establish an independent regional government known as the Watauga Association. John Sevier, the future first governor of the State of Tennessee, first visited the Holston settlement and surrounding areas in present-day northeast Tennessee during 1771, bringing items to trade with settlers from his merchandising business in Middletown, Virginia. Sevier later returned to the area in 1772, where he witnessed a horse race at \\"the Watauga Old Fields, on Doe River; near its junction with the Watauga.\\"King's Mountain and Its Heroes: History of the Battle King's Mountain October 7th, 1780, and the Events Which Led to It, by Lyman C. Draper, 1881. Reprinted, The Overmountain Press, 1996. p.419. However, in 1772, surveyors placed the land officially within the domain of the Cherokee tribe, who required negotiation of a lease with the settlers. Tragedy struck as the lease was being celebrated, when a Cherokee warrior was murdered by a white man. James Robertson's skillful diplomacy made peace with the irate Native Americans, who threatened to expel the settlers by force if necessary. All of present-day Tennessee was once recognized as one single North Carolina county: Washington County, North Carolina. Created in 1777 from the western areas of Burke and Wilkes counties in North Carolina, Washington County had as its precursor the Washington District of 1775‚Äì76, which was the first political entity named for the Commander-in-Chief of American forces in the Revolution. \\"Lost Counties of Tennessee.  American Revolutionary War Transylvania Purchase at Sycamore Shoals= Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap (George Caleb Bingham, oil on canvas, 1851‚Äì52) Elizabethton (at Sycamore Shoals) was the Fort Watauga site of the Transylvania Purchase. In March 1775, land speculator and North Carolina judge Richard Henderson met with more than 1,200 Cherokees at Sycamore Shoals, including Cherokee leaders such as Attacullaculla, Oconostota, and Dragging Canoe. In the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals (also known as the Treaty of Watauga), Henderson purchased all the land lying between the Cumberland River, the Cumberland Mountains, and the Kentucky River, and situated south of the Ohio River. The land thus delineated, 20 million acres (81,000 km2), encompassed an area half as large as the present state of Kentucky. Henderson's purchase was in violation of North Carolina and Virginia law, as well as the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited private purchase of American Indian land. Henderson may have mistakenly believed that a newer British legal opinion had made such land purchases legal. Before the Sycamore Shoals treaty, Henderson had hired Daniel Boone, an experienced hunter who had explored Kentucky, to travel to the Cherokee towns and inform them of the upcoming negotiations. Afterwards, Boone was hired to blaze what became known as the Wilderness Road, which went through the Cumberland Gap and into central Kentucky. Along with a party of about thirty workers, Boone marked a path to the Kentucky River, where he established Boonesborough (near present-day Lexington, Kentucky), which was intended to be the capital of Transylvania. Other settlements, notably Harrodsburg, were also established at this time. Many of these settlers had come to Kentucky on their own initiative, and did not recognize Transylvania's authority. A Daniel Boone Trail historical marker is found just outside the downtown Elizabethton business district. =July 1776 Dragging Canoe Attacks= Early during the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycamore Shoals was attacked in 1776 by Dragging Canoe and his warring faction of Cherokees opposed to the Transylvania Purchase (warring Cherokees also referred to by settlers as the Chickamauga), Cols. John Sevier and James Robertson are named as being among the defenders of the stockade fort along the Watauga River. =Wataugans' Settlement of Middle Tennessee= During the spring of 1779, James Robertson and a small group of Watauga settlers, acting upon the survey of Henderson's Transylvania Purchase, traveled west overland to select a site for a new settlement along the Cumberland River known as the French Lick (at present day Nashville). Later that same year, Robertson would return to the French Lick with a group of men to construct temporary shelters for their friends and relatives from the Watauga Settlement, who would eventually arrive at their new French Lick settlement on Christmas Day and drive their cattle across a frozen Cumberland River. A fort built by James Robertson and other settlers from the Watauga Settlement atop a bluff along the Cumberland River was named Fort Nashborough in honor of Francis Nash, who had fought alongside Robertson during the 1771 Battle of Alamance. =Overmountain Men Muster for the Battle of Kings Mountain= The Overmountain Men serving under Col. Isaac Shelby (who years earlier had worked as a surveyor for the Transylvania Company) and other patriot forces engaged and defeated a larger force of British Loyalists on August 19, 1780 at the Battle of Musgrove Mill near present-day Clinton, South Carolina. Fort Watauga later served as the September 26, 1780,U.S. National Park Service. staging area for a much larger contingent of some 1,100 Overmountain Men who were preparing to trek over the Blue Ridge Mountains at Roan Mountain to engage, and subsequently defeat, the British Army Loyalist forces at the Battle of Kings Mountain in rural York County, South Carolina, south of the present-day town of Kings Mountain, North Carolina. Prior to the American Revolutionary War very little gunpowder had been made in the colonies, and most was imported from Britain.Brown, The Big Bang: A History of Explosives, p? In October 1777, the British Parliament banned the importation of gunpowder into the American colonies. In preparation for the overmountain march, five hundred pounds of black powder was manufactured for the Overmountain Men by Mary Patton and her husband at their Gap Creek powder mill. The Overmountain Men stored the Patton black powder on the rainy first night of their march in a dry cave known as the Shelving Rock that is located near Roan Mountain State Park at present-day Roan Mountain, Tennessee. During January 1781, the Overmountain Men also fought the British at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina. =John Carter, Landon Carter, and the Carter Mansion= Landon Carter was the son of early Carter County settler John Carter. John Carter's circa 1780 white frame home, known as the Carter Mansion, now serves as a tourist attraction and is part of Sycamore Shoals State Park, although it is not at the park's main location. The oldest frame house in Tennessee, this former frontier plantation home is located on Broad Street Extension on the eastern side of town above the banks of the Watauga River. The property also contains a small Carter family cemetery. A landscape painting of a Virginia plantation that was discovered beneath layers of ancient paint covering the wall surface above a fireplace mantle suggests that John Carter may have been an illegitimate son of the wealthy Virginia plantation owner Robert \\"King\\" Carter and half-brother to Virginia plantation owner Landon Carter.  Tiptonville and the Battle of Franklin feud Gravestone of Samuel Tipton, \\"Founder of Elizabethton\\", located at the Green Hill Cemetery (West Mill Street). Tipton donated the land for the town that would initially be known as Tiptonville within the State of Franklin, and later as Elizabethton after Tennessee was admitted into the United States of America.Carter County was previously named \\"Wayne County\\" while briefly within the defeated State of Franklin (along with present-day Johnson County, Tennessee, 1784‚Äì88). Samuel Tipton (1752‚àí1833), a son of frontiersman and later State of Franklin independence opponent Colonel John Tipton, had deeded the land on which the town Tiptonville was established on the banks of the Doe River near its confluence with the Watauga River then within Wayne County.Historical marker in downtown Elizabethton. Accessed: 26 January 2013. The February 1788 Battle of Franklin was fought between those aligned with Col. John Tipton and loyal to the area remaining within the authority of the State of North Carolina and the United States and the opposition aligned with Col. John Sevier who were seeking secession from the State of North Carolina as an independent State of Franklin under Spanish rule. The Battle of Franklin took place on a farm owned by Col. John Tipton (now known as the Tipton-Haynes State Historic Site) within the southern section of present-day Johnson City, Tennessee. Col. John Tipton would also later help to lead the effort of toward having Tennessee being admitted as the sixteenth state into the United States of America during 1796.Tipton-Haynes Historic Area - Home\\". Following the 1796 admittance of the State of Tennessee into the United States of America, Wayne County was renamed named as Carter County by the losers of the Battle of Franklin in honor of Landon Carter, who served both as Chairman of the Court of the Watauga Settlement (as defined by the articles of the Watauga Petition) and as Speaker of the defunct State of Franklin Senate. Previously named \\"Tiptonville\\" in honor of Samuel Tipton while within the State of Franklin, the town was as the county seat of the newly minted Tennessee county of Carter was, likewise, renamed as \\"Elizabethton\\" by Landon Carter and David McNabb (who were members of a state committee to officially name the area that was appointed by the Tennessee General Assembly in 1796 to locate and name the county seat of Carter County) after their wives, Elizabeth MacLin Carter and Elizabeth McNabb.

Carter On the recommendation of Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson, U.S. naval officer Samuel Powhattan (S.P.) Carter was promoted to the brevet rank of brigadier general and assigned by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to engage cavalry based in Kentucky against Confederate-held railroad lines and bridges in East Tennessee during the Civil War. In early 1861, after receiving a letter from Carter assuring his loyalty to the Union should a civil war break out, Tennessee Governor Andrew Johnson used his influence in the United States Department of War for Carter to organize and train militia within East Tennessee. After leading successful cavalry operations at the Battle of Mill Springs on January 19, 1862, Carter accepted a commission as Brigadier General of volunteers in May and later continued leading operations at the Battle of Cumberland Gap in June as well as raids against Holston, Carter's Station, and Jonesville in December, in support of General William S. Rosecrans' attack on Murfreesboro. Carter's younger brother, William B. Carter (1820‚àí1902), planned and coordinated the so-called East Tennessee bridge burnings in 1861. On the night of November 8 of that year, Carter's pro-Union conspirators destroyed five railroad bridges across Confederate-occupied East Tennessee. Daniel Stover, a son-in-law of Andrew Johnson who lived near Elizabethton in the Siam community, led the party that destroyed the bridge at Union Depot (modern Bluff City). Confederate authorities placed much of East Tennessee under martial law as a result of the bridge-burning incident. In July 1863, Carter was placed in command of the XXIII Corps cavalry division and would continue campaigning across Tennessee throughout the year. By 1865, Carter was in North Carolina and commanding the left wing of the Union forces at the Battle of Kingston. He was promoted to Brevet Major General of Volunteers, briefly commanding the XXIII Corps before being mustered out of volunteer service in January 1866. While Carter was serving in the Union Army, the U.S. Navy promoted him to lieutenant commander in 1863, then to commander in 1865. A Tennessee Historical Marker located on West Elk Avenue in front of the S.P. Carter Mansion in downtown Elizabethton commemorates his life and naval career. The Veterans' Monument in downtown Elizabethton was originally constructed and dedicated in 1912 to \\"the memory of the old soldiers of Carter County since the days of the Revolution.\\"Merritt, Frank.

It is in the form of an obelisk, constructed primarily from river rock collected from the nearby Doe River, guarded by two short Civil War field cannon.  Railroad history  During the early 20th century, Elizabethton became a rail hub, served by three different railroad companies. Beginning in the 1880s, the narrow-gauge engine known as the \\"Tweetsie\\" ran on the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (ET&WNC;) from Johnson City, passing through Elizabethton before climbing into the Blue Ridge Mountains, eventually connecting to Boone, North Carolina, in 1916. In 1927, the portion of the ET&WNC; railroad from Johnson City to Elizabethton was converted to standard gauge in order to more efficiently serve the NARC and Bemberg Rayon Plants. The narrow-gauge portion of the ET&WNC; ceased operations in 1950 and was subsequently abandoned, though the standard-gauge portion of the line from Johnson City to Elizabethton continued to operate until 2003 as the East Tennessee Railway. The railroad's dormant track has been removed, pending negotiations between Elizabethton and Johnson City to establish a walking and bike path. One of the ET&WNC;'s narrow-gauge steam locomotives (Engine #12) is still in existence, operating at the \\"Tweetsie Railroad\\" theme park at nearby Blowing Rock, North Carolina. The Southern Railway operated a branch line into Elizabethton until the flood of 1940. It connected with the ET&WNC; at a small railroad yard near the confluence of the Watauga River and the Doe River.http://www.johnsonsdepot.com/ Johnson's Depot - The Online History of Johnson City, Tennessee In the 1910s and 1920s, another small railroad, the Laurel Fork Railway, operated out of Elizabethton paralleling the ET&WNC; and Doe River to Hampton, where the line split off and ran to a sawmill near present-day Watauga Lake.  North American Rayon Corp., American Bemberg Corp., and the 1929 Rayon Plants strikes Beginning in the late 1920s, German and Dutch business investors established two major rayon manufacturing plants (Bemberg and the North American Rayon Corporation) in Elizabethton along the banks of the Watauga River, producing rayon material for both U.S. domestic and export markets. The Rayon factories were controlled by the German-Dutch Algemene Kunstzijde Unie (AKU). During World War II the U.S. government seized managerial control of these critical rayon plants in Elizabethton. A post-war hiring apex of the Elizabethton rayon industry occurred in 1949 when over 6,100 employees were working at both of the Elizabethton rayon mills. A specialized fiber utilized by NASA within the Space Shuttle program was manufactured at the Elizabethton plants during the 1980s, and after many years of a declining U.S. rayon market and increased foreign competition following the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and North American Free Trade Agreement, the remaining rayon mill (owned by the North American Rayon Corporation) closed down during the late 1990s after a fire burned down most of the factory buildings.  The City of Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority  Elizabethton was first served by relatively inexpensive hydroelectric power during the early 1910s, leading to the popular \\"The City of Power\\" moniker. The Horseshoe section of the Watauga River (within the Tennessee Valley Authority reservation behind the TVA Wilbur Dam) is the site of the first hydroelectric dam constructed in Tennessee (beginning in 1909), going online with power production and distribution in 1912. U.S. President Herbert C. Hoover The 1928 Republican U.S. presidential candidate Herbert C. Hoover made his only southern campaign stop at Elizabethton and delivered his nationally broadcast October 6, 1928, election \\"stump speech\\" before 50,000 people gathered at the base of Lynn Mountain in Harmon Field (now at the mini- park and the Elizabethton/Carter County Chamber of Commerce building location on U.S. 321) during Elizabethton's Second Annual Industrial Celebration.\\"Hoover Day in Dixie: Elizabethton's Second Annual Industrial Celebration October 6th, 1928\\". Dan W. Crowe, 1979. During the Elizabethton speech, Hoover \\"...alluded to a matter of growing concern, the status of the Federal Government's involvement in the [hydrogeneration] production of [electric] power, specifically the Muscle Shoals (Alabama) issue: \\"There are local instances where the Government must enter the business field as a by- product to some great major purpose such as an improvement in navigation, flood control, irrigation, scientific research or national defense.\\" It was the succession of Republican presidents in the White House at the time leading up to the Great Depression‚Äîfirst President Coolidge in 1928, followed by President Hoover later in 1931‚Äîchoosing to veto the federal legislation passed by the U.S. Congress that would have created a water power development agency of the federal government. It was U.S. Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska who sponsored the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, water power development legislation which was finally enacted during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt that created the Tennessee Valley Authority. Norris was later an important proponent of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. Following the end of World War II, the TVA Watauga Dam and Reservoir were completed upstream of the Wilbur Dam in 1948. The TVA Wilbur Dam has four hydroelectric generating turbines with a production capacity of 10,700 kilowatts of electricityElizabethton.org.

U.S. Bicentennial ‚Äì Overmountain Victory Trail  Hikers, military reenactors, and scouts have followed segments of the famous Overmountain Victory Trail, and in 1975, three Elizabethton Boy Scouts were among those who completed the re-enactment of the overmountain route (approximately in one direction) by hiking from Elizabethton at Sycamore Shoals to the Kings Mountain National Military Park. Liberty: The Saga of Sycamore Shoals (formerly known as The Wataugans) is the official outdoor historical drama of the state of Tennessee. It is presented by the Watauga Historical Association and the Sycamore Shoals Historic Area in Elizabethton every July on the last three Thursday‚ÄìFriday‚ÄìSaturday weekends of the month. Employing a mixed cast of volunteer professional and amateur local actors and re-enactors engaged through an open casting call, Liberty: The Saga of Sycamore Shoals depicts the early history of the area that is now Northeast Tennessee. Based on a bill introduced by North Carolina Congressman James T. Broyhill before the final NPS report was issued, Congress passed an amendment to Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act to establish the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail. U.S. President Jimmy Carter, recognizing the historical significance of the frontier patriots marching over the Appalachian Mountains to fight the British Loyalists at the Battle of King's Mountain, signed the bill (P.L. 96 344) into law on September 8, 1980, designating the historical overmountain route as the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail, the first National Historic Trail established within the eastern United States.http://www.ovta.org/ Home Page Education Public Schools in Elizabethton are operated by Elizabethton City Schools. www.ecschools.net Colleges Satellite campuses of Northeast State Community College and Tennessee College of Applied Technology are located in the eastern part of the city off Tennessee State Route 91.

The cost of constructing the newly resurfaced, 10-mile compacted crushed stone gravel Tweetsie Trail rails-to-trails project was financed with private and local government contributions. Section 1 between Johnson City and Sycamore Shoals State Park in Elizabethton was completed in the summer of 2014 and opened on August 30 with the inaugural Tweetsie Trail Trek. Section II of the trail will begin at Sycamore Shoals State Park, proceed to downtown Elizabethton and continue to the end of the line, near the Betsytowne Shopping Center. Section II opened during August 2015, making a total length of 10 miles. The Carter County Commission has discussed plans to further extend the trail into Roan Mountain, Tennessee. Sports Several Minor League Baseball teams have been based in Elizabethton. Professional baseball was first played in the city by the Elizabethton Betsy Red Sox in the Appalachian League in 1937. They remained in the league through 1942 and won the Appalachian League championship in 1939 and 1941. Subsequent entries in the league were the Elizabethton Betsy Cubs (1945‚Äì1948), Elizabethton Betsy Local (1949‚Äì1950), Elizabethton Phils (1951), and Elizabethton Twins (1974‚Äì2020). The Twins won the league championship 12 times, more than any other team in the circuit's history. In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball beginning with the 2021 season, the Appalachian League was reorganized as a collegiate summer baseball league, and the Twins were replaced by a new franchise in the revamped league designed for rising college freshman and sophomores.

History In September 1780, the Overmountain Men-- a group of American soldiers from the trans-Appalachian frontier who fought during the American Revolution-- passed through Roan Mountain en route to North Carolina, where they would engage and defeat a group of British loyalists at the Battle of Kings Mountain. On the night of September 26, this force camped at Shelving Rock, between what is now the Roan Mountain CDP and Roan Mountain State Park, where a rocky outcropping provided a convenient place for the soldiers to store their weapons and gunpowder. The site is now part of the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail, and the field where the soldiers camped is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Thomas Burleson, , 23 February 2009. During the 1870s, John T. Wilder, an industrialist and former Union general, began purchasing large tracts of iron ore-rich lands in the Roan Mountain area, and established several mining operations in the region. In the early 1880s, he established the Roan Mountain community, originally known as Roan Mountain Station, as a stop along the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (\\"Tweetsie\\"). He laid out streets, planted trees, and built a hotel, the Roan Mountain Inn, as well as a house for his family (the house still stands at the corner of Main and Stratton). In 1885, he established a resort atop the mountain, the Cloudland Hotel, which catered to people seeking relief from hay fever and other seasonal allergies.Carolyn Sakowski, Touring the East Tennessee Backroads (John F.

History In 1888, a work camp was established at Cumberland Gap by Scottish-born entrepreneur Alexander Arthur (1846-1912) to house workers needed to build a tunnel for the Knoxville, Cumberland Gap & Louisville Railroad. Arthur, who was attempting to establish a large-scale iron production operation in the Cumberland Gap region, founded the nearby cities of Middlesboro, Kentucky, and Harrogate, Tennessee, and the nearby community of Arthur.Carolyn Sakowski, Touring the East Tennessee Backroads (Winston- Salem: J.F.

History When the railroad line was built from Knoxville through Cumberland Gap in the late 1880s, it bypassed the city of Tazewell. It is uncertain whether the railroad was unable to obtain right of way, or whether the decision was made because of topography, but the railroad depot was built about two miles to the west of Tazewell. A new community sprang up around the depot, called Cowan City on old survey maps. The city was incorporated as New Tazewell in the 1920s, but the charter was voted down about fifteen years later. It was reincorporated in 1954. The city of New Tazewell was soon a thriving commercial location. Entrepreneur John L. Buis built a two-story brick building across from the train depot where he opened the Cherokee Hotel. The building also housed the first post office and a general store, and was served by a livery stable just down the street. Buis also bought farms in the area and opened a cannery in Tazewell where he produced canned goods to ship north by railroad. Claiborne Junior High School in New Tazewell, 1938, with Soldier's Memorial Elementary School to the leftBurley tobacco production in the area provided a cash crop, and warehouses were built in the town for tobacco auctions in the late fall and early winter. Tobacco buyers came in by train and stayed at the hotel, with easy access to the warehouses by walking or by horse and buggy from the livery stable. As burley tobacco production declined in the United States, the warehouses were abandoned, and the city's economy shifted from farming to manufacturing. Today, the rail-line carries freight from New Tazewell, consisting mostly of timber. Government=Board of Mayor and Aldermen New Tazewell uses the mayor-board-of- aldermen system, which was established in 1954 when the city was incorporated. It is composed of the mayor, and six aldermen. The citizens elect the mayor and four aldermen to four-year terms. The board elects a vice mayor from among the six aldermen. State government New Tazewell is represented in the 35th District of the Tennessee House of Representatives by Jerry Sexton, a Republican. It is represented in the 8th District of the Tennessee Senate by Frank Niceley, also a Republican. Education New Tazewell is home to a satellite campus of Walters State Community College.

The Graham-Kivett House, built c. 1810 Among the earliest settlers in the Tazewell area was John Hunt (1750‚Äì1822), a militia captain who would later be instrumental in the founding of Huntsville, Alabama. In 1804, three years after the creation of Claiborne County, Tazewell was chosen as the county seat due in part to Hunt's influence (although a local legend states that the residents of Tazewell's rival for the seat, Springdale, were too intoxicated to vote on the day of selection). Hunt was named the county's first sheriff, and the government met at his house until a courthouse was constructed.Holt, Claiborne County, 10-12. The original courthouse was a wooden structure which had hitching posts for horses in front. In 1862, at the height of the Civil War, Confederate troops occupied Tazewell as part of the greater struggle for the strategic Cumberland Gap.

In 1890, plans developed for a railroad through the town, connecting nearby Cumberland Gap to Knoxville Residents protested the construction of a train depot, which led to the re-routing of the railroad and establishment of a depot several miles west, still bearing the name of the town. The area around the depot saw the birth of a new town, with businesses and homes propping in its vicinity. This town would later incorporate into what is now the city of New Tazewell. In the early years of its incorporation, a rivalry began between the two communities, often over development projects choosing to start up in the area. In the 2000s, the rivalry subsided, and efforts to merge the two communities into one municipality were proposed, but were rejected.

September 4, 2007. The first European traders to the area, arriving in the mid-18th century, called this point along the Pigeon River the \\"War Ford\\". Historical marker along US-321 in Newport, recalling the site of War Ford During the American Revolution, the Cherokee aligned themselves with the British, and launched sporadic attacks against early Euro-American settlers in the Holston valley. In the waning months of the conflict in 1782, a detachment led by Gen. Charles McDowell of North Carolina crossed the mountains into what is now Tennessee to join up with Col. John Sevier's local forces and initiate an aggressive campaign against the hostile Cherokee. In August of that year, Sevier crossed the Pigeon at War Ford, attacking and killing several Cherokee camped along the river's banks. This assault was one of the final engagements of the Revolution.J.G.M. Ramsey, Annals of Tennessee (Johnson City: Tennessee Overmountain Press, 1999), 279. At the close of the Revolution, the first Euro-American settlers arrived in the Newport area, ensconcing themselves in the vicinity of the strategic river fords. Peter Fine established a ferry on the north bank of the French Broad in the early 1780s, and in 1783 John Gilliland settled opposite Fine's Ferry in what is now Oldtown. Shortly thereafter, Emanuel Sandusky, a Polish immigrant, established a farm on the land where the Cocke County Memorial Building now stands, and Samuel O'Dell settled at the junction of the Pigeon River and Cosby Creek. Sometime in the 1790s, the Gilliland family donated of land for a town square and courthouse to be situated opposite Fine's Ferry on the banks of the French Broad, and the town of New Port was born.Evelyn Parrott Graham, Rolfe Godshalk (editor), Newport (Newport, Tennessee: Clifton Club, 1970), 35.Carolyn Sakowski, Touring the East Tennessee Backroads (Winston-Salem: J.F. Blair, 1993), 234-240. For nearly a quarter-century, the residents of the Newport area lived under constant threat of attack from Cherokee crossing the mountains from North Carolina. Shortly after the arrival of the first Euro-American settlers, Peter Fine sought to quell this threat by leading a punitive expedition against the Cherokee town of Cowee in North Carolina, which Fine captured and burned. The Cherokee responded by stealing Fine's livestock and attempting to herd them back to North Carolina. Fine gave chase and managed to retrieve the livestock, but on the return march he was ambushed and his brother, Vinet, was killed. The Cherokee were in pursuit, and Vinet's body was hidden in a hole in a frozen creek for later retrieval. The creek melted and the body was lost. The creek was named Fines Creek. Shortly thereafter, two O'Dells were killed, one of Sandusky's daughters was kidnapped, and several others settlers were killed or scalped.Evelyn Parrott Graham, Rolfe Godshalk (editor), Newport (Newport, Tennessee: Clifton Club, 1970), 35-36. To provide defense against these sporadic attacks, the early settlers erected a series of forts in the area. Wood's Fort guarded the Forks-of-the-River just downstream from Newport, and McCoy's Fort and Whitson's Fort defended the area to the south. Other installations included Huff's Fort at what is now Del Rio. With Sevier's victory at the Battle of Boyds Creek and the ensuing Treaty of Dumplin in 1785, Cherokee influence in the area began to wane. In the 1790s, the Cherokee signed a series of treaties which essentially ceded most of the land on the Tennessee side of the Great Smokies to the U.S. government. By 1800, Cherokee attacks in the Newport area had been drastically reduced. Flatboat period The French Broad River in the vicinity of Fine's Ferry at Newport's northern border The French Broad River passes north of the current city limits. As the French Broad empties into the Tennessee River, towns along its banks are connected via waterway to New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. In the early 19th century, William Faubion, who lived just northeast of New Port, managed to reach New Orleans with a flatboat shipment and return safely.Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 17. In early 19th- century East Tennessee, which was riddled with poor roads and hilly terrain, river travel was a relatively convenient mode of transportation. \\"New Port\\", situated on the French Broad near Forks-of-the-River, quickly developed into a flatboat trading hub. William Garrett (1774‚Äì1853) arrived in New Port in the late 1790s and built a plantation, known as Beechwood Hall, just south of Fine's Ferry. Many early travelers, including several circuit riders and religious leaders, were entertained at Garrett's mansion. During the War of 1812, Garrett shipped eight large flatboats stocked with food and whiskey to the U.S. Navy in New Orleans.Nancy O'Neil, \\"Beechwood Hall -- Through Sunlight and Shadows,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 12, no. 2 (Summer of 1986), 37-38. Among those entertained at Beechwood Hall in the early 19th century was Bishop Francis Asbury, a circuit rider credited with spreading Methodism to the Southern Appalachian region. Asbury wrote in his journal: > We rode through New-Port, the capital of Cocke County, forded French Broad > at Shine's Ferry, and came cold and without food for man or beast to John > O'Haver's but oh, the kindness of our open-hearted friends.Evelyn Parrott > Graham, Rolfe Godshalk (editor), Newport (Newport, Tennessee: Clifton Club, > 1970), 47. In 1812, a large Methodist revival was held at New Port's crude log courthouse, and the Zion Methodist Church was established that same year. The Presbyterians erected a church on Graveyard Hill (above the modern junction of US-321 and US-70) in the 1820s. The residents of New Port established one of the first schools in the area, Anderson Academy, in 1820. New Port was officially incorporated on October 19, 1812.Evelyn Parrott Graham, Rolfe Godshalk (editor), Newport (Newport, Tennessee: Clifton Club, 1970), 36, 40-45. While New Port had strong religious beginnings, its situation as a river trading hub on the edge of the Appalachian frontier inevitably led to a certain lawlessness. Saloons were a mainstay in the town throughout the 19th century. Henry Ker, a traveler who visited New Port in 1816, recalled: > I set out for Newport, a small town on the French Broad River. At sunset I > arrived, having much difficulty in finding the town for it was hid in a deep > valley. It is the most licentious place in the State of Tennessee, > containing about twenty houses of sloth, indolence and dissipation.Evelyn > Parrott Graham, Rolfe Godshalk (editor), Newport (Newport, Tennessee: > Clifton Club, 1970), 41. New Port's residents countered this lawlessness with swift methods of justice. The town had a pillory, stocks, and a ducking chair. Hangings were not uncommon. Civil War By 1834, New Port had a population of 150. The town included two general stores, two doctors, three blacksmiths, two tailors, two hatters, a wagon maker, two churches, and two taverns. A new brick courthouse had been erected in 1828 to replace the crude log courthouse.Evelyn Parrott Graham, Rolfe Godshalk (editor), Newport (Newport, Tennessee: Clifton Club, 1970), 36. While slavery was not as common in East Tennessee as in other parts of the Southern United States, it did occur. Some buildings in early Cocke County were built with slave labor. Sometime before the Civil War, local records report the executions of at least two slaves. One was a grandmother whose grandson drowned while she fled across the Pigeon River in an attempt to keep him from being sold. The other, a slave by the name of \\"Tom\\", was tortured and burned alive for the murder of Mary Lotspeich.Nancy O'Neil, \\"Beechwood Hall -- Through Sunlight and Shadows,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 12, no. 2 (Summer of 1986), 40. In the years leading up to the war, Newport's Methodists split into pro-slavery and anti-slavery denominations, reflecting a division common throughout the county.E.R.

The town was a consistent target of raids from both Union and Confederate soldiers. The owners of Beechwood Hall buried their silver and kept their horses in the basement to prevent them from being stolen.Nancy O'Neil, \\"Beechwood Hall -- Through Sunlight and Shadows,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 12, no. 2 (Summer of 1986), 41. The residents of Cocke County eventually recruited a home guard to protect them from raids, which they based at the mouth of Indian Camp Creek, a few miles south of New Port.John Weaver, \\"Origins .\\" Newport Times, January 10, 1940. Retrieved: September 14, 2007. Several skirmishes occurred in the vicinity of New Port, namely along Lick Creek to the north and Cosby Creek to the south. At the latter, the brother of North Carolina Governor Zebulon Vance was captured in an ambush.Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 114. The railroad and the Clifton annexation controversy In 1867, the Cincinnati, Cumberland Gap, and Charleston Railroad constructed a line through Clifton, which was located just south of New Port on the other side of the Pigeon River. As railroads were quickly replacing flatboats as the preferred mode of transportation and shipping in East Tennessee, the residents of New Port sought to build the new Cocke County Courthouse in Clifton. To bypass state law, which required an election to move a county seat, New Port decided to simply annex Clifton.Carolyn Sakowski, Touring the East Tennessee Backroads (Winston-Salem: J.F. Blair, 1993), 234-239. The residents of Clifton, however, made it clear that they didn't want to be annexed. When New Port ignored them and moved forward with the annexation anyway, the residents of Clifton sued. After a 17-year legal battle, the Tennessee State Supreme Court ruled that the annexation violated the state's constitution. The new courthouse was constructed in Clifton in 1884. Perhaps due to railroad interests at the time, Clifton was renamed \\"Newport\\". New Port became known as \\"Oldport\\" or \\"Oldtown\\". Thus the town of Newport \\"shifted\\" from its location on the flatboat-friendly French Broad to its current location along the railroad running parallel to the Pigeon. Alexander Arthur and the logging boom The Pigeon River in Newport Innovations in the logging industry in the late 19th century led to a rapid deforestation of the Ohio Valley and Mississippi Delta. Logging companies eventually turned to the timber-rich forests of Southern Appalachia to keep up with the increasing demand for wood, and band saw mills began spring up in towns located along the base of the mountains. In 1880, Canadian-born entrepreneur Alexander Arthur (1846‚Äì1912), representing the Scottish Carolina Timber and Land Company, arrived in Newport with ambitious plans to log the Pigeon valley. Arthur's plan called for the construction of a series of dams and booms which would be used to move logs from the higher elevations downstream using the river's current. The logs would eventually be floated all the way to Knoxville. The operation would be based in Newport, with a sawmill in the higher elevations at Pigeon Valley (now Hartford, Tennessee). Over the next six years, Arthur and his team of engineers and lumberjacks--some from as far away as South Africa and Europe-- cut and sawed thousands of logs which they stocked behind a large dam. Arthur built an extravagant house in Newport and even made proposals to modernize the town square.Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 167-174. The residents of Newport--who were nonplussed by the flashy and energetic Arthur--warned the entrepreneur about the Pigeon River's volatility. While the mountain streams of Southern Appalachia appear calm and serene on a typical day, torrential rains in the higher elevations can turn these streams into raging whitewater rapids. In the spring of 1886, the warnings of the locals became reality when a cloudburst hit the Balsam Mountains near the Pigeon's source and the river became a raging torrent. All day long, Arthur and his team fought ferociously to secure the dam holding back the company's precious stock of logs. That evening, one of Arthur's engineers returned to Newport briefly to rest. Before leaving again, he told the anxious wives of the company men and the curious Newportians that if they heard the whistle, all would be \\"gone to hell\\". Historian Wilma Dykeman described that night: > Just before daybreak at the depth of the dark and rain, the waiting women > and all the rest of the wakefull town heard the great crash as the booms > burst, and the cry of the whistle signaled the men's defeat. Logs from > thousands of trees boiled over the broken dams, smashed together in a > grinding roar and surged on down the current like giant toothpicks tossed by > some elemental energy.Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, > 1955), 174. His venture now bankrupt, Alexander moved to Knoxville to start rebuilding his fortune. He would later be instrumental in the founding of Middlesboro, Kentucky.Carolyn Sakowski, Touring the East Tennessee Backroads (Winston- Salem: J.F. Blair, 1993), 236. The residents of Newport converted Scottish Timber's now-abandoned commissary into a saloon.Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 175. 1900s Newport Depot, photographed by Marion Post Wolcott in 1939 By the 1890s, the population of Newport had grown to 900. While Alexander Arthur's logging venture failed, industry continued to find its way to the town. In 1895, the A.C. Lawrence Leather Company established what eventually become one of the world's largest tanneries in Newport.Rolfe Godshalk (editor), Newport (Newport, Tennessee: Clifton Club, 1970), Appendix I-II. Three years later, brothers James and John Stokely founded the Stokely Brothers Company (now Stokely-Van Camp's) to can vegetables they grew throughout the French Broad valley.Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 208. Newport native Ben Hooper served as governor of Tennessee from 1911 to 1915. Carson Springs, southwest of Newport, developed around William Wilson's tavern and stagecoach terminal in the early 19th century. Later in the century, C.P. Peterson and wife built and operated the Peterson Hotel.Carolyn Sakowski, Touring the East Tennessee Backroads (Winston-Salem: J.F. Blair, 1993), 240-241. As the mineral-rich mountain springs of Appalachia were thought to have health-restoring qualities, Carson Springs developed into an early tourist resort. The establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1934 brought a still greater influx of tourists to Newport, but nothing like the tourism explosion that occurred in neighboring Sevier County. Kiffin Yates Rockwell, who was born in Newport in 1892, joined the French Foreign Legion during World War I. After being wounded, Rockwell joined one of the Legion's aviation corps, known as the Lafayette Escadrille, and would become the first American pilot to shoot down an enemy plane in combat.Exhibit Remember Kiffin Yates Rockwell, Local WWI Aviator and WNC Resident.\\" Hendersonville.com Community News, 1999. Retrieved: September 14, 2007. Moonshining and crime Appalachia is characterized by winding narrow coves and hidden hollows separated by high ridges. Many of these hollows contained just enough bottomland to support an economy based on subsistence agriculture, but with each crop, the soil grew poorer and poorer. Thus, to make ends meet, farmers in communities such as Cosby and Del Rio began setting aside some of their corn crop for liquor production. These early distillers found an easy market in the taverns and saloons of Newport, itself located at a point where the Appalachian highlands meet the Tennessee Valley. At the onset of Prohibition in 1920, the demand for illegally distilled liquor skyrocketed, and Cocke County was primed to meet it. Not only did the county have moonshiners with generations of experience, but the remote Appalachian hollows and thick forest provided perfect hiding places for illegal stills. And as young men left the farms of rural Tennessee to seek employment in the textile mills of Knoxville and the large manufacturing hubs of the Midwest in the early 20th century, networks for moving the liquor from the mountain hollows to the large urban areas were already in place.Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration, Tennessee: A Guide to the State (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1986).Rolfe Godshalk (editor), \\"Moonshining,\\" Newport (Newport, Tennessee: Clifton Club, 1970). From the 1920s through the 1960s, Cocke County became notorious throughout the Southeast as a moonshine hot spot. To complicate matters, large numbers of servicemen passing through Newport en route to Knoxville or Asheville during World War II drew large numbers of prostitutes to the area. In 1969, the Knoxville News Sentinel published a series of reports regarding organized crime in the county, and Governor Buford Ellington launched an investigation that led to the arrest of Constable D.C. Ramsey, Cocke County Sheriff Tom O'Dell, and several state troopers stationed in within the county on charges of extortion and bribery. In the following decade, a new district attorney, Al Schmutzer, launched a crackdown on the various moonshining, gambling, and cockfighting rings within the county, with some success.J.J. Stambaugh, \\"Timeline: Cocke County Confidential\\". The Knoxville News-Sentinel, August 1, 2005. Retrieved: August 13, 2015. In spite of Schmutzer's efforts, Cocke County continued to struggle with organized crime. In 1982, 40,000 marijuana plants were found growing just off Asheville Highway. The following year, Cocke County Sheriff Bobby Stinson was indicted along with 43 others on cocaine conspiracy charges. In 1987, 30 people from Cocke and Sevier County were arrested on charges relating to a car theft ring. Corruption probes and federal indictments relating to Cocke County law enforcement continued into the 21st century. In the 1990s, a series of economic initiatives by Newport and Cocke County, however, helped to curb the crime rate substantially. In 2008, production for the CMT reality television program Outsiders Inn took place at the Christopher Place Resort in Newport. In 2009, the FBI indicted and successfully prosecuted a 23-person car theft and drug ring. Six persons entered guilty pleas by 2010, including a retired Newport police captain and his family. Eddie Hawk was sentenced to nine years. The investigation was branched from the FBI Rose Thorn case, which focused upon Cocke County Sheriff officers' corruption, resulting in an earlier 170 arrests on federal and state charges. Geography Newport is located in western Cocke County at (35.963318, -83.196542). The town is situated along the Pigeon River in an area where the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains descend into the French Broad drainage basins. English Mountain rises prominently to the southwest and Hall Top Mountain rises to the southeast, with the Pigeon River cutting a valley between the two. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park boundary passes some to the south. The confluence of the French Broad, Nolichucky, and Pigeon rivers occurs northwest of Newport in an area once known as Forks-of-the-River. This area now comprises the northeastern section of Douglas Lake, which was created by an impoundment of the French Broad by the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1940s. The French Broad eventually merges with the Holston River in Knoxville to form the Tennessee River, some to the west of Newport. Mt. Cammerer Several major federal highways intersect at Newport. Interstate 40 passes through the city's southern section about north of the North Carolina border. U.S. Route 321 runs perpendicular to I-40, approaching Newport from Cosby to the south. U.S. Route 411 merges with U.S. Route 70 in Carson Springs, and the merged road enters Newport from the west, intersecting US-321 in downtown Newport. US-70 continues east to Del Rio, Tennessee, and Hot Springs, North Carolina, while US-321 turns north and crosses the Pigeon and French Broad en route to Greeneville and northeastern Tennessee. Newport consists of several sections relating to its historical development. The main section of town, centered around the courthouse, is situated along the south bank of the Pigeon amongst a series of relatively low but steep cliffs. North of the main section is \\"Oldtown\\", situated between the Pigeon and French Broad, which was the town's main area before the advent of the railroad in the late 19th century. A more modern section of town has developed along US-321 between the courthouse area and I-40. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Utility dinghies are usually rowboats or have an outboard motor. Some are rigged for sailing but they differ from sailing dinghies, which are designed first and foremost for sailing. A dinghy's main use is for transfers from larger boats, especially when the larger boat cannot dock at a suitably-sized port or marina. Etymology The term is a loanword from the Bengali ', Urdu ', and Hindi '.  Different types  Dinghies usually range in length from about . Larger auxiliary vessels are generally called tenders, pinnaces or lifeboats. Folding and take-down multi-piece (nesting) dinghies are used where space is limited. Some newer dinghies have much greater buoyancy, giving them more carrying capacity than older boats of the same size. *Whaleboats are among the classic \\"pulling\\" (rowing) boats, with a sharp bow, fine stern lines and a canoe stern. Despite being somewhat more tippy, with less cargo capacity than prams, they row, motor and sail well because of their fine lines. Prior to the introduction of fibreglass as a construction material, dories were more popular because their ease of assembly and, thereby, lower cost. *Whitehall rowboats were the water taxis of the late 1800s until the invention of the small gasoline outboard. Considered one of the most refined rowboats for harbour and lake use, Whitehall rowboats are a descendant of the captain's gig which was used for a similar purpose on a naval vessel. *Dories are sharp-ended boats traditionally made of wood but now also produced in fibreglass or aluminium. They cut the water well, but their initial stability is low, making them feel tippy in flat water; a loaded dory becomes more stable as it is loaded. Dories are not generally used as service boats to yachts; they were used in large numbers in the cod fishing business, launched in numbers from the deck of a schooner hove to on the Grand Banks or other fishing ground. A dory can be landed or launched through surf where a Whitehall may founder. Dories are seldom called dinghies. *Prams are usually short with transoms at both bow and stern. They are difficult to tip and carry a lot of cargo or passengers for their length but are slower to row because of their short length and extreme rocker, although a skeg and/or bilge runners can make a difference, and even without they will row better than an inflatable.A Norwegian pram Popular as tenders on sail boats with limited deck space. *Some inflatable boats have a rigid deck and transom which allows an engine to be used for propulsion. They row poorly and do not tow well because of their blunt bows and large wetted surface area, but they are exceptionally buoyant. *Rigid safety dinghies are designed to row, motor, tow, and sail. In addition to their self-rescue lifeboat functionality, these boats serve as everyday tenders and as recreational boats. They are extremely buoyant and/or unsinkable and have great carrying capacity relative to length. See photo above. Dinghy is also a term given to any small cars, trucks or SUVs towed behind a motor home. Space issues Inflatable dinghy On yachts shorter than , there is usually not enough room for a reasonably sized dinghy. A dinghy is useful to avoid the need for expensive dock or slip space, so owners of small yachts compromise by carrying a small rigid dinghy or deflated inflatable, or by towing a larger dinghy. Space can be saved by storing items in containers or bags that are tied to the dinghy. Dinghies are sometimes used as lifeboats. Recently, self-rescue dinghies have returned to use as proactive lifeboats that can be sailed to safety. Rigid dinghies for small yachts are very small, about , usually with a pram (blunt) bow to get more beam (width) in a shorter length. Larger dinghies are towed and should have reserve buoyancy, an automatic bailer, and a cover to prevent them from being lost at sea. Most masters prefer a tow cable long enough to put the dinghy on the back side of the swell to prevent the dinghy from ramming the transom of the yacht. Inflatables are inconvenient to tow and take extra time to inflate but are very compact and fit easily into place while at sea. Space can also be saved by using a sectional two-piece rigid dinghy that is towed while in harbour and disassembled into two nesting pieces while off-shore; typically the bow section fits inside the stern and is stored upside down on deck. There are several types of collapsible rigid dinghy that dismantle into a series of flat panels for easy stowage. Nestable dinghy on sailboat cabin Inflatable tubes can be fitted to an existing hard dinghy, increasing buoyancy and stability. Hardware and materials A dinghy should have a strong ring on the bow. The ring secures the painter (the line that anchors the boat to a dock), and is used for towing and anchoring. Ideally, the dinghy should also have two other rings (one on each side of the stern transom) which, with the bow ring, are used for lifting and securing the dinghy for stowage. The only other essential pieces of hardware are rowlocks (also known as oarlocks). Conventionally, a dinghy will have an oar on each side. A single sculling oarlock or notch on the transom is less common, but requires less space; and is used with a single sculling oar moving back and forth, never leaving the water, as used on a sampan. Many modern dinghies are made of synthetic materials. These require minimal care and do not rot but can suffer from fibre glass pox which is caused by the ingress of saltwater through the gel coat. Inflatable dinghies can be made of fabrics coated with Hypalon, neoprene or PVC. Rigid dinghies can be made of glass-fibre reinforced plastic (GRP) but injection-moulded one- piece hulls are also available. Other materials for modern rigid dinghies include aluminium, marine plywood which tends to be much lighter than most types and, with the advent of sturdy, UV resistant polyurethane varnishes, wood. Some wooden dinghies (especially of classic or historical form) are built using the carvel or clinker methods. Favoured woods, in order of rot- resistance, are white oak, black locust, species of cedar and pine, true as well as African and Asian mahoganies, fir and spruce. Rot resistance depends on paint as well as protection from rainwater. Plastic hardware is sometimes used, but bronze and stainless steel are good corrosion-resistant materials for hardware, although stainless steel can be subject to crevice corrosion after many years especially in a boat using an outboard or other motor and must be inspected. Stainless steel should never be used for fittings permanently in the water. Owners should check that the correct grade of stainless steel is used in a fitting. Working boats may use lower-cost galvanized steel, but the hardware may need to be re-galvanized or replaced eventually. The dinghy is generally carried inverted amidships on yachts, on top of the coachroof where there is the most space. It is useful for a dinghy carried this way to have handholds built into the bottom, making launching easier and providing handholds on deck. Most yachts launch their dinghies by hand or with a simple lifting tackle rigged from the main mast. Davits over the transom is convenient and elegant, but sailing in a heavy following sea could cause the loss of a dinghy. If a dinghy is towed, an extra line with a loop in the end (known as a lazy painter) can be attached to a dinghy so that if the towing line breaks, there is a line to grab with a boat hook. This makes retrieval easier at sea, especially if the boat is partially swamped. In some countries dinghies have names or registration numbers. On hard dinghies these are usually on the bow, on inflatables on the inside of the transom. Propulsion=Oars Operating a dinghy with oars Small dinghies under are usually powered by rowing with one set of oars. Beyond it is feasible to have two or even three rowers, normally using a pair of oars. In some models, sliding thwarts allow far more powerful rowing while in others, a removable thwart can permit standing rowing. Some self-rescue dinghy/yacht tender dinghies have two sets of oarlocks (rowlocks) and an adjustable middle seat to allow for ergonomically efficient rowing positions. A single sculling oar with an oarlock on the rear transom can be a compact emergency oar. Inflatable dinghies without a rigid bottom are difficult to row more than a short distance, and are usually powered with an outboard motor, or, if necessary, paddled. Motor A motorized dinghy with seats and a console Another option is an outboard motor. Two horsepower per meter can reach hull speed. Ten horsepower per metre will put a flat-bottomed dinghy on plane. A dinghy with a hard V-bottom hull and a fifteen-horsepower outboard can reach speeds of . The gas tank is usually placed under the rear thwart. Engines always swing up so the dinghy can be grounded without damage. Since the transom may need to be cut down for the engine to fit properly, an engine well should be used to prevent low waves from splashing over the transom and flooding the boat. Sail Sailing dinghies racing North Haven, Maine, displayed at the Maine State Museum in Augusta; used in the 1880s, participated in sailing races A typical sailing rig for a dinghy is a gunter with a two-piece folding mast stepped through a thwart and resting on the keel. It is raised by pulling a rope called a halyard. A single-sailed rig is usually preferred over a marconi or Bermudan (with a triangular mainsail and jib) because this rig is simpler, with no stays to attach. Sprit rigs also have no boom, and the advantage that the sail can be brailed up out of the way against the mast when rowing or motoring. Lug rigs are another common single sail type used in small dinghies, both standing and balanced (with some area forward of the mast), and usable with or without a boom. Traditional working dinghies have a lee board that can be hooked over the side. This does not split the cargo space. A sailing rudder is usually tied or clipped to a simple pair of pintles (hinge pins) on the transom with the bottom pintle being longer so that the rudder can be mounted one pintle at a time. The rope keeps the rudder from floating off in a wave. Both rudders and lee boards have swiveling tips so the dinghy can be landed. Rudders are often arranged so the tiller folds against the rudder to make a compact package. Racing dinghies usually have a daggerboard or centreboard to better sail upwind. The trunk is in the middle of what would otherwise be cargo area. A self-rescue dinghy intended to be used as a proactive lifeboat has leeboards on either side, to allow for maximum open cockpit area. Self-rescue dinghy lifeboat, sailing. Note unzipped middle section of canopy and reefed sail. Solar This solar dinghy was created by Leonard Holmberg. Based on Freedom Electric's X10 hull. One of the only tri-power small boats in the world, Solar, Propane, Lithium \\"SPL\\" Solar propulsion uses hybrid flexible solar panels integrated into the biminiBimini top supplying power to a lithium battery bank.Lithium-ion battery Twin in-hull trolling motorsTrolling motor produce 72 pounds of thrust powering the solar dinghy to 3 - 5 knots depending on weather conditions. Alternate power is supplied by a propane outboard for increased speed and range. Other equipment Additional U.S. Coast Guard required and non-required items that should always be on a dinghy: These are the U.S. Coast Guard's minimum requirements for recreational boats: *Personal Flotation Devices for every occupant *Bell, whistle *Visual distress signals *Fire extinguisher *Ventilation (boats built on or after 8/1/80) *Back-fire flame arrestor (gasoline engines installed after 25 April 1940) These next items are not a Coast Guard requirement but should always be kept on board to maximize safety: *Oars *Bucket *First Aid Kit *Blanket *Rope This equipment should be in a bag made of water-resistant materials. Andersen-style self-bailers are also useful for engine-driven and sailing dinghies. These slot-shaped seacocks project into the stream below the hull and open when submerged and moving rapidly using the venturi effect. The downside of this solution is that if the boat is beached in sand, it can clog the self-bailers until the boat is inverted and the sand removed. These devices do not replace a hand-bailer as they are only useful if the vessel is moving. A small anchor can be used to allow the crew of the dinghy to fish or rest. Dinghy anchors are usually either a mushroom shape, a small folding grapple hook or the more modern and efficient Danforth type, with floating rope that will avoid being cut by snags on the bottom. The mushroom is used in locations where the bottom is very muddy, while the grapple works better in rocks. Some persons prefer a small Danforth or plow, because of their superior holding power in all but rocks, but these have sharp edges, and need to be set with a little care. Even a dinghy should have a length of chain attached to the anchor - the same length as the dinghy. The warp then attaches to the short chain with a wired shackle. This gives added weight and help in setting an anchor. It also stops the warp fraying on sharp rocks when the dinghy swings to and fro with the tide. Generally an anchor warp should be 4 times the depth of the water. In strong winds this can be extended to 8 times the depth but most dinghies are not seaworthy enough to be anchored securely in such storm conditions. A dinghy should not be able to scratch the mother-boat's paint; therefore a fender made from a length of heavy rope (or a strip of polyurethane) can be tied loosely to the outside of the bulwarks. This also provides a handhold for launching, or for people overboard to climb into the boat. Many modern dinghies have a molded ridge of plastic to replace the rope. A fitted acrylic canvas cover can shed seas or act as a shade or storage cover. Traditionally it toggles to the fender-rope or is suspended from the gunter (small folding mast) but can also be tied to a few points and secured with snaps or Velcro. Depending on the design there may be a large locker under a thwart.

Belle Meade operates independently as a city, complete with its own regulations, a city hall, and police force, but it is also integrated with the Nashville government. Developed in part on the territory of the former Belle Meade plantations, residential areas are suburban with tree-lined streets and wooded areas. The median annual income of Belle Meade residents is $195,208, which exceeds the median annual income in the U.S. by more than three times.

He named the property Belle Meade, which is French for \\"beautiful meadow\\". Over the next few decades, enslaved African Americans built Harding's mansion, and established a thoroughbred breeding farm and cotton plantation. He conducted various service businesses on the property, including a grist and saw mill, a cotton gin, and a blacksmith shop ‚Äì all primarily operated by enslaved African-Americans. Harding's son, William Giles Harding, a Confederate veteran, inherited the estate in the later 19th century and renamed it as Belle Meade Plantation. In 1906, debt forced the Harding family to sell Belle Meade. Belle Meade Land Company built the first road and in 1938 developed the neighborhood that established the City of Belle Meade. The mansion was converted into a museum. On December 30, 1969, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (#69000177).

Before the Civil War, the younger Harding more than doubled the property and built a new mansion, with the labor of the 136 slaves he owned. His descendants founded the Belle Meade Country Club here in 1901. Because of debt, the trustee of the Belle Meade Estate sold the mansion and 2,200 acres in May 1906 to Jacob McGavock Dickinson, the general counsel of the Illinois Central Railroad.

Arts and culture  Built in the 1820s by John Harding, Belle Meade Plantation is a primary attraction for those interested in the history and culture of the area. The plantation is home to a number of historical buildings, including Dunham Station's cabin and a Victorian-style manor that houses a museum filled with artifacts that once belonged to the Harding family. Cheekwood Estate and Gardens ‚Äì now a 55-acre botanical garden and museum of art ‚Äì is the former home of Leslie and Mabel Cheek. Located just outside the southwestern boundary of Belle Meade, the attraction hosts world-renowned art exhibits, festivals, and family events throughout the year.  Parks and recreation  Belle Meade Country Club ‚Äì This members-only club is home to an 18-hole, par 72, 6,885-yard golf course and various other amenities, including tennis courts and a pool. Use of the club requires membership ‚Äì a lengthy and challenging process ‚Äì or entering as a guest with a member. Originally designed by architect Donald J. Ross and later renovated by architects Rees Jones and Bryce Swanson, the course has Bermuda grass fairways and bent grass greens and was rated by Golf Digest as a top Tennessee course in 2005‚Äì2006. Percy Warner Golf Course ‚Äì This golf course is located in the northeastern corner of Percy Warner Park at the southwestern edge of Belle Meade. It is a 9-hole, par 34, 2,600-yard course with tree-lined fairways. The course uses a first-come, first-served, open play concept, and greens and rental cart fees are modest. Rental clubs and pull carts are also available, and private carts are allowed for a fee. Percy Warner Park and Edwin Warner Park ‚Äì They are technically two connecting parks, but Nashville locals often refer to Percy Warner Park and Edwin Warner Park simply as \\"The Warner Parks\\". The northern border of Percy Warner Park lies at the southwestern edge of Belle Meade. Combined, the parks include more than 3,100 acres. Amenities include picnic grounds and shelters, a nature center, hiking and biking trails, scenic overlooks, sports fields, horse trails, an equestrian center, and golf courses. The parks also have historical significance and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Colonel Luke Lea and his second wife, Percie Warner, donated almost 900 acres of land ‚Äì a large portion of which came from the former Belle Meade Plantation ‚Äì to establish the park in 1927. Margaret Warner, the widow of Percy Warner, donated the funds to erect the sandstone gates and stone eagles that have marked the entrance of Percy Warner Park since 1932. The limestone staircase known as The Allee was designed by landscape architect Bryant Fleming and built in the mid-1930s to mark the entrance to Percy Warner Park at Belle Meade Boulevard. Other historical sites in the park include 10 pre-Civil War cemeteries and a World War I memorial that honors Camp Andrew Jackson, a WWI army training site previously located at the site of Percy Warner Golf Course. Parmer Park ‚Äì Located on a section of land that used to be the home of Parmer School, which burned in the 1980s, this park consists of open green space, basketball courts, playground equipment, and a baseball field. The entrance of the former school still stands in the middle of the park.  Government  The form of government for the City of Belle Meade is a city manager-commissioner structure.

Residents of the area voted on whether to incorporate as a city on February 28, 1950. The vote was 138 to 135 favoring incorporation. Berry Hill became the first community in Davidson County to incorporate since Belle Meade incorporated in 1938. The population of Berry Hill at the time of incorporation numbered around 1,200. The city's first mayor was Ralph Rosa, who served for 22 years. In 1963, the governments of Davidson County and the City of Nashville merged to form a consolidated metropolitan government, thereby making Berry Hill part of Metropolitan Nashville. In 1991, Berry Hill became home to the Center for Gay and Lesbian Community Services. It was described as \\"a vital part of Nashville's gay and lesbian community\\" by The Tennessean in a 1993 article.

The area is adjacent to 100 Oaks Mall, the first enclosed shopping mall in Tennessee, and the Tennessee National Guard Armory. Government Although Berry Hill is officially part of Metro Nashville, it retains its municipal status as a city. Metro Nashville basically acts as a county government for Berry Hill and provides some of the same services to the city as it provides for the rest of the county.

The population was 4,812 at the 2010 census and 4,866 in a 2018 estimate. History Nashville was settled by Anglo-Europeans in 1780, and over the next two decades settlers staked claims on what was originally land cultivated and hunted by Native Americans. Several land grants were awarded to Revolutionary War veterans. The recipients of these grants seldom settled the land themselves, but either sold them to individuals or passed them along to their children or other relatives. In the Forest Hills area, William Nash received a grant along what is now Granny White Pike south of Tyne Boulevard. Nash opted to sell off parcels of his land, including a tract to Henry Compton in the early 19th century. Much of the land west of Hillsboro Road was part of a grant awarded to James Robertson. A Revolutionary War veteran named McCrory chose to give his land grant to his son Thomas, who came to the area in 1790. The younger McCrory went on to acquire some in Davidson and Williamson counties, including land along what is now Old Hickory Boulevard. McCrory built a two-story log dwelling on this property in 1798. The property was purchased by William B. Carpenter in 1837, and his daughter and son-in-law Mary E. and George Mayfield inherited the house in 1869. It remained in the Mayfield family until 1939. This is the oldest building remaining in Forest Hills, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. As Nashville assumed prominence on the western frontier, a road known as the Natchez Trace was created to provide an overland route for settlers returning from New Orleans. Many settlers in the Ohio and Cumberland River valleys floated on rafts down the Mississippi River to New Orleans to sell their goods. Prior to the invention of the steamboat, western settlers had no choice but to walk home through the wilderness to reach home. In order to provide an improved road, the Natchez Trace was constructed from Nashville to Natchez, Mississippi. Construction of the Natchez Trace began in 1802, and work continued on improving the road until it was officially declared complete in 1809. From the early 19th century to the 1820s, the Natchez Trace was the primary north/south route through central Tennessee. With the advent of steamboat travel, the use of the Natchez Trace declined significantly, and the old roadbed was used as local farm roads by the mid-19th century. Various surveys and land records of the 19th century refer to the \\"Natchez Trace\\" or \\"Natchez Road\\" located on at least three different routes in Davidson County, two of which ran through Forest Hills. As National Park Service historian Dawson Phelps wrote in the 1940s, \\"All this has been very confusing to many Nashvillians who dabble in local history. Each has a definite idea that one or the other of the roads mentioned above is the Old Trace and is eager, at the drop of a hat, to defend his position obstinately, profanely, and at great length.\\"[1] However, a recent study of the Natchez Trace identified one of the main routes extending through what is now Forest Hills along either side of present-day Hillsboro Pike. In northern Williamson County, the Natchez Trace crossed the Harpeth River in the vicinity of Union Bridge Road. A National Park Service study in 1935 stated that the Natchez Trace \\"crossed the Harpeth at Robinson Bend just upstream from Union Bridge, an old covered bridge.\\" The Natchez Trace then turned north along present-day Stockit Road, and two branches diverged in what is now Edwin Warner Park. One of these branches continued north along what is now Page Road, and then followed the route of present-day State Route 100 (Harding Pike) to its terminus at Cockrill's Spring in Centennial Park. The second of these branches ran east to present-day Hillsboro Pike, continuing north of Otter Creek before turning north through a gap, recrossing present- day Hillsboro Pike, and extending north through Green Hills to the terminus of the Natchez Trace at Cockrill's Spring. This route is shown on a map prepared by the National Park Service in 1935. With the decline of travel on the Natchez Trace, this roadbed became known as Compton Road, named for the prominent Compton family of the vicinity. Compton Road, shown on various maps of the 19th century, was separate from Hillsboro Pike through Green Hills. Residential and commercial expansion has obliterated almost all traces of this road north of Harding Place. A small intact section of the historic roadbed of Compton Road is located just north of Woodlawn Drive. In addition to these two branches of the Natchez Trace, a third route led from Franklin to Nashville along what was historically known as the Middle Franklin Turnpike. This branch of the Natchez Trace left the main road at Leiper's Fork in Williamson County and extended east to Franklin. From Franklin, this route of the Natchez Trace followed the existing roadbed of the Middle Franklin Turnpike, now known as Granny White Pike. Although many travelers passed through the area on the Natchez Trace, settlement was initially not extensive. Compared to the rest of Davidson County, in the early 19th century few large farms existed within what is now Forest Hills. This was primarily because of the area's topography of steep forested hills, which proved difficult to till. In the northwest corner of the city limits are rich bottomlands along the tributaries of Richland Creek. In the central section of the city also are the fertile lands along Otter Creek. With these exceptions, few other areas of Forest Hills supported large-scale farming. Oats, Indian corn, and potatoes were primary crops, and because the topography limited crop production, livestock were essential to most farms. Swine were the dominant livestock on most farms, and many settlers also raised sheep, which made wool an important product. The number of cattle raised was minimal, with most farms emphasizing milk cows and the production of butter over beef cattle. As the Comptons were one of the most prominent early families, one of Henry Compton Sr.'s cousins, William, built homes and established farms along Hillsboro Pike and later served under Andrew Jackson in New Orleans.[3] William began with a farm of about one hundred , but had acquired around by the time of his death. His sons Felix and Henry W. also acquired substantial property in the area. In 1860, Felix Compton owned a farm and of woodlands valued at forty thousand dollars. Corn and oats were his main crops along with ample livestock of mostly swine and sheep.[4] Felix Compton's home along Hillsboro Pike, which was on the land that has been developed into Burton Hills, stood until the 1980s when it was dismantled and moved to Dickson County. Henry Compton Sr. (1784-1873) came to Tennessee in 1806. Shortly after his marriage to Sarah Cox in 1815, Compton settled on in what is now Forest Hills.[5] Around 1819, Compton erected a two-story log dwelling near what is now Tyne Boulevard. The dwelling was enlarged ca. 1900 to accommodate the Comptons' growing family, which included ten children. Henry Compton became one of the area's most prominent landowners, with improved and of woodlands in 1860. At this time his substantial farm was valued at $195,000 and produced 7,500 bushels of Indian corn, 1,800 bushels of oats, 1,500 bushels of potatoes, and 1,300 bushels of wheat. Compton's livestock included 200 swine, 150 sheep, and 29 horses. He also owned 41 cattle, 21 of which were milk cows. The Compton estates grew over generations, and by the late 19th century their lands \\"stretched from the Belle Meade plantation on the west to the Lealand estate on the east.\\" An 1871 map of Davidson County confirms this statement and shows the estates of Felix Compton, Henry Compton Sr., and Henry Compton Jr. in the Richland Creek area. Henry Compton Sr.'s ca. 1819 two-story log house remains extant at 1645 Tyne Boulevard (DV11567). Also on the property is the Compton family cemetery, which contains approximately 25 graves. William Scruggs established a large estate in the Forest Hills area during the 19th century. Scruggs purchased land along Hillsboro Pike in the 1830s and eventually owned some . At his death, his nephew Edward Scruggs inherited the property. Edward Scruggs continued to operate a successful farm and was a key figure in the community as part shareholder in the Hillsboro Turnpike Company, which constructed Hillsboro Pike. In 1890, Scruggs built an elaborate two-story, frame, Queen Anne style dwelling with Eastlake detailing along Hillsboro Pike. With perforated gables and pediments, carved panels, a fishscale shingle roof, and numerous spindles and lattice work, the Scruggs house served as a landmark along the Pike. This house remains extant at 6251 Hillsboro Road (DV24931). Geography Forest Hills is bordered by Old Hickory Boulevard on the south, Granny White Pike on the east, Harding Place (also known as Battery Lane) on the north, and Chickering Road/The City of Belle Meade on the west.Welcome , City of Forest Hills website, retrieved from Google cache on May 13, 2011 The city hall is located within city limits, at the intersection of Hillsboro Pike and Old Hickory Blvd. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Like its neighbor, Belle Meade, it has distinct signage covenants concerning land size and use. Forest Hills is considered a \\"satellite city\\" of Nashville, and residents do not receive access to all city-county combined services, taking financial responsibility for some services like garbage collection on their own, while the city of Forest Hills provides other services, such as chipper service, road maintenance and stormwater management. The area was developed as a suburb of Nashville in the wake of the post-World War II population and economic boom. Forest Hills was born as a result of the ensuing conflicts between suburban residents and Nashville city government as Nashville struggled to deal with the ramifications of suburban growth. As its name implies, Forest Hills is composed primarily of steep wooded hills. These steep-sided hills were covered with forest until the early 20th century, when residential development extended south from Nashville. Several hills have water towers and cellular towers, and the WKRN and WNPT TV towers and the WSIX radio tower are located on a hill north of Old Hickory Boulevard. In addition to the area's many hills, the south-central section of the community contains what was originally fertile farmland within the Otter Creek watershed. This area supported numerous small farms during the 19th and early 20th century. Nashville has enjoyed prosperity and growth during the past several decades, which is reflected in the development of Forest Hills. Since 1970, hundreds of dwellings have been built in Forest Hills, and the community no longer retains many tracts of open space or farmland. Most dwellings are sited on parcels of to , and only a small number of houses are located on tracts of or more. Several of the community's hills and ridges ‚Äî such as the properties along Laurel Ridge Drive and Fredericksburg Drive ‚Äî also have been developed in recent decades. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 4,710 people, 1,729 households, and 1,471 families residing in the city. The population density was 507.8 people per square mile (196.2/km2). There were 1,791 housing units at an average density of 193.1 per square mile (74.6/km2).

Historic properties The growth and development of Forest Hills has resulted in the loss of most of the community's 18th- and 19th-century dwellings. Only a handful of properties dating from this early period remain extant. One of the most notable of these is the McCrory-Mayfield House at 1280 Old Hickory Boulevard, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. This two-story log dwelling was built circa 1798 and is the oldest remaining dwelling in Forest Hills. Although 19th-century dwellings are rare, Forest Hills contains a number of significant houses built in the early 20th century. With improvements in automobiles and road systems, this section of Davidson County became a preferred area for country estates by the 1920s. Properties built along Hillsboro Pike mirrored those built in nearby Belle Meade as West Nashville became home to the area's most prosperous businessmen and professionals. Representative of this type of rural country home is Longleat at 5819 Hillsboro Pike, which was completed in 1932 as the home of insurance executive Thomas Tyne. Longleat was listed on the National Register in 1984 for its architectural significance. Another 20th-century home is \\"The Hibbettage\\" at 2160 Old Hickory Boulevard. Built in 1939, this two- story brick dwelling was constructed as a replica of The Hermitage; it was listed on the National Register in 1998 for its architectural significance.

Robinson has claimed to be the original painter of the Liberty Mule: > In early October 1906, I climbed up the face of the Allen Bluff to a ledge > and with some coal tar made a flat picture of a character from a famous > comic strip of that day.

In 2003, Liberty residents became upset that an expansion of U.S. 70 to a four-lane road could threaten the mule painting. The residents started a letter writing campaign to the Tennessee Department of Transportation. Supporters of the mule also placed signs along the roadway stating \\"Save the Mule.\\" Ultimately the road expansion was far enough away from the mule, that it was never in any danger.

About 8.2% of families and 9.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under the age of eighteen and 14.3% of those sixty-five or over. History Slayden's growth was spurred by the existence of a railroad line (the \\"Mineral Branch\\" of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad) which was built in the late 19th century largely to assist the movement of iron from the nearby works at Cumberland Furnace to market. In the early 20th century Slayden was home to a department store and was considered a major community of Dickson County. With the closure of the Mineral Branch and the Cumberland Furnace works, the area went into an economic decline. As the area declined from the loss of the furnace works, nearby Nashville and Clarksville offered more non-farming opportunities. The local primary school was closed in 1960 and merged with the larger one in nearby Vanleer. At about this time mail ceased to be delivered from the post office, which continues to serve post office boxholders. In the 1980 census, Slayden had only 69 inhabitants and was known for the next decade as Tennessee's smallest incorporated town. In the 1980s the former railroad depot was removed to Hickman County to become an attraction at a proposed amusement park honoring Minnie Pearl that never actually came into operation. The voting precinct in the area was abolished after the 2000 elections and split between those in Vanleer and Cumberland Furnace. In 2003 the town's future as an incorporated community seemed endangered when only six voters (out of 127 registered) participated in a municipal election and only two candidates qualified for the four unpaid positions on the Board of Mayor and Aldermen. This was prevented when the vacancies were filled by persons who had received write-in votes; participation in the 2005 municipal elections was considerably higher. The Slayden family appears in the census for Dickson County in 1820, 1830 and 1840, by which time there were four Slayden heads of household, all being descended from brothers Daniel Everett Slayden and William Everett Slayden. Both lines produced a prodigious number of military officers, medical doctors, or dentists. One son of Daniel Everett Slayden was Hartwell Marable Slayden, born ca. 1806, who had three sons who were medical doctors: William Marshall Slayden, John Dann Slayden and Hartwell Marable Slayden Jr. All three sons of Hartwell M. are in the 1850 Dickson County census, along with one of the patriarchs \\"William Everette Slayden\\" listed as a \\"waggonmaker\\" born 1788 in Virginia, and four other heads of households. The name of the community probably reflects the land ownership (possibly plantations) of this family, as the 1860 census reveals 35 \\"white\\" members of this extended family, and there are also slaves on the 1860 Slave Schedules. Alternatively, it could reflect the service of the three physicians to the community. The Slayden Cemetery (sometimes called Guerin Cemetery, an allied family) holds many members of this family. The name continued into the 1930 census. Most other lines of this family (cousinage proven by DNA) now use \\"Slayton\\" or \\"Slaton\\" as name spelling, though a few \\"Slayden\\"s are still found in parts of Tennessee and Florida.

It is located in northwest Tennessee, northeast of Memphis on the Forked Deer River. The population was 17,145 at the 2010 census. History=Early history The lands that make up Dyersburg once belonged to the Chickasaw people. The final treaty by which they relinquished all of West Tennessee was signed in 1818. 19th century The first European settlers began to arrive in the area around 1819. In 1823, the Tennessee General Assembly passed an act to establish two new counties immediately west of the Tennessee River, Dyer County being one of them. John McIver and Joel H. Dyer donated for the new county seat, named Dyersburg, at a central location within the county known as \\"McIver's Bluff\\". In 1825, Dyer surveyed the town site into 86 lots. The first courthouse was built on the square in 1827. The current Classical Revival-style courthouse, designed by Asa Biggs in 1911, centers a downtown historic district listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Situated as the hub of steamboat navigation on the Forked Deer River, Dyersburg grew as a river town, especially once the Grey Eagle made the first successful steamboat trip in 1836. The county's first industrial boom dates to 1879, when the steamboat Alf Stevens shipped timber from A. M. Stevens Lumber Company of Dyersburg to St. Louis, Missouri markets. The Stevens company established a large sawmill in 1880 and opened a planing mill in 1885. The Bank of Dyersburg opened in 1880, while another timber industry, Nichols & Co. Wooden Bowl Factory, began operations in 1881. The arrival of the Newport News and Mississippi Valley Railroad in 1884 further expanded market possibilities; a branch line, the Dyersburg Northern, soon linked the county seat to Tiptonville. The new railroad links encouraged the creation of new industries and businesses. In 1884, for example, investors established the Dyersburg Oil Company, a cottonseed factory. This company remained locally important through the 20th century. Civil War During the Civil War, a number of skirmishes occurred in the Dyersburg area resulting in Union victories. On August 7, 1862, about 50 men of the 6th Illinois Cavalry Regiment attacked a group of Confederates about 5 miles east of Dyersburg. In a report by Brigadier General Grenville M. Dodge, he wrote the Confederates who escaped left without their clothes, arms, or horses and said that \\"they killed some 25 to 30 [Confederates], took 53 horses, and a large number of guns & arms.\\" Dodge also recommended burning the county as \\"They pay no attention to the oath, feed and guide the rebels.\\" He reported they were assisted in routing the Confederates by \\"two Negros\\" and that \\"No white man had the pluck to do it.\\" On August 18, 1862, the 6th Illinois Cavalry Regiment attacked a small band of Confederates on the Obion River six miles from Dyersburg taking all their horses, arms, and ammunition. On January 30, 1863, Union forces under the command of Colonel Oliver Wood of the 22nd Ohio Infantry Regiment \\"completely routed them [Confederates], killing 2, wounding 4, and capturing 17, when the rebels broke and fled in every direction.\\" Nathan Bedford Forrest and Robert V. Richardson occupied Dyersburg in August 1863, until they retreated upon the arrival of Colonel Edward Hatch in the area. 20th century Between 1909 and 1914, Dyersburg emerged as a regional railroad hub as it became the junction point for three different lines, led by the Illinois Central Railroad. The Edward Moody King House is on the National Register of Historic Places. On December 2, 1917, a 24-year-old black farmhand named Lation (or Ligon) Scott was brutally lynched by a white mob before a crowd of thousands. Over the course of several hours, Scott was publicly tortured. He was chained to a post in an empty lot adjacent to the town's court square. Torturers burned out his eyes with red-hot irons. When he cried out in pain, a red-hot poker was rammed down his esophagus. He was then castrated, and more hot irons placed on his feet, back, and body until \\"a hideous stench of burning flesh filled the Sabbath air\\". After being tortured, Scott was slowly burned at the stake. Scott's torture and murder occurred over a three and a half hour period. No one was prosecuted for the lynching.

History The community of Hickory Withe was settled in 1834 by families who moved from the region around Prosperity, South Carolina. Hickory Withe Presbyterian Church One of the first acts of these settlers was to form the congregation of Prosperity Presbyterian Church, which was founded on the fourth Sunday of December, 1834. This congregation united with another Presbyterian congregation, Mt. Pleasant Presbyterian Church, in 1907 to form Hickory Withe Presbyterian Church, which is still active today. That church, meeting in an historic property on Donelson Drive, is all that remains of what once was \\"Main Street\\" of Hickory Withe: Donelson Drive used to be home to a post office, a general store, a cotton gin, and a two-room school house, in addition to the church. The school facility was deeded to the Hickory Withe Presbyterian Church in 1974, and is maintained today; the remaining businesses and buildings have been removed, leaving only residences and the church., Efforts to incorporate Hickory Withe led to revisions of Tennessee laws regarding incorporation and annexation. In the mid-1990s supporters of the idea of incorporating Hickory Withe went to Lieutenant Governor John S. Wilder, who was from nearby Braden and had represented the area in the Tennessee Senate since 1966, with the idea of sponsoring a bill which would allow Hickory Withe to incorporate, something which could not be accomplished under the then-existing law. Wilder learned that he could not introduce an act allowing only for the incorporation of Hickory Withe as this would be rejected by the courts as unconstitutional, so it was necessary for any act to help Hickory Withe to incorporate to be worded in a broad enough fashion to allow any similar area in Tennessee which also desired to incorporate to do so as well. The eventual bill which passed was drawn in such a way as to allow almost any previously-unincorporated area to incorporate, and several attempted to do so, including, famously, an apartment building near Elizabethton. The resulting legislation became known, somewhat derisively, as the \\"Tiny Towns Bill\\". Most of the towns which were set up, or were attempted to be set up under the act, seemed primarily to be efforts to prevent areas from being annexed by larger jurisdictions which charged property tax. The Tennessee Supreme Court struck down the new legislation on November 19, 1997, less than a year after it entered the books.See Phil Campbell, Memphis's Unruly Suburbs , Metropolis, December 1997-January 1998, and Jesse Walker, Rebel Yell: Tennesseans fight back against the conquering cities Reason Magazine, June 1998. Corrective legislation enacted since has required any new town being set up to have a property tax rate set as a condition of its incorporation (and that rate cannot be \\"zero\\"). Towns set up under the \\"Tiny Town\\" law, like Hickory Withe, were not automatically dissolved with the act's repeal, although some have subsequently taken this step. Community character Hickory Withe is predominantly semi-rural and agricultural. The primary agricultural product cultivated in and around the community is cotton. Horse farming is also a significant agricultural land use. The community has seen more recent residential development as a result of the eastward expansion of the Memphis urban area and the completion of the Memphis outer beltway (now I-269) in nearby eastern Shelby County. Acclaimed experimental music collective Nonconnah, and their home studio Ghost Salon, are based in Hickory Withe.

Estill Springs is part of the Tullahoma, Tennessee, Micropolitan Statistical Area and is located in Middle Tennessee. History=Founding Mineral springs in the area had long been known to the Cherokee people of the region. Before they settled here, varying cultures of indigenous peoples had lived in the area for thousands of years. The European-American town dates from circa 1840, when the Frank Estill family, which owned considerable property in the area, donated a right-of-way for railroad construction. The combination of mineral waters, which were much in vogue as a health remedy at the time, and convenient rail access caused the settlement to develop as a small-scale spa town, which took its name from the springs. Oscar Meyer was appointed the first mayor of Estill.Estill Springs, Tennessee , Franklin County Chamber of Commerce website. Accessed: 18 October 2015. Civil War era During the Civil War, the town was generally known as \\"Allisonia\\", for another family which had settled in the area. It was the site of a Confederate training camp, Camp Harris, named for Isham G. Harris, the Confederate governor of Tennessee, who was a native of the county. Southern forces retreated through the town during the 1863 Tullahoma Campaign, named for the nearby community which served as Confederate headquarters. Twentieth century to present Following Reconstruction, whites in the county worked to maintain dominance over freedmen. They committed violence against African Americans perceived to violate social norms. Based on a conflict with local whites in the small town, who appeared to resent his family's relative success, Jim McIlherron was reported to have shot at three young white men who were taunting him. After trying to escape, McIlherron was captured and taken back to Estill Springs. He was lynched by a white mob on February 4, 1918, whose members tortured him with burning before his death. Rev. G.W. Lych, believed to have helped McIlherron escape, was shot to death before this.Walter F. White, \\"N. A. A. C. P. INVESTIGATION\\", February 1918 These two murders were among three recorded lynchings in Franklin County through the early 20th century.Lynching in America, Third Edition: Supplement by County , p. 9, Equal Justice Initiative, Mobile, AL, 2017 The fad for bathing in and drinking spring waters eventually passed. Local lore has it that the long-awaited construction of U.S. Route 41A through the town in 1940 caused the springs to dry up. The spa era passed by mid-century, and the hotels were razed. The new highway connected the town to sources of employment in neighboring communities, and gave it a strategic position on the main artery between Nashville and Chattanooga. The development of local lakes through dam construction by the Tennessee Valley Authority generated recreational business as well. During the time of Prohibition, Estill Springs was home to prominent local mobster and bootlegger Parker Jones. Parker and his gang took advantage of the heavily wooded terrain to distill their bootleg booze. Parker and his men also used Estill as their primary logistics hub to traffic the booze through Middle Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia. Jones remained in Estill for several years, \\"owning\\" mayors, city councilmen, and police officers. The government dispatched dozens of revenue agents to arrest him and his men. However, when they finally arrived at his hideout, they found nothing and Parker was never seen in Estill again.

In 2008, American Ordnance, the private contractor operating the plant, began the process of moving operations to Iowa and commercializing the Milan Army Ammunition Plant. By March 2013, employment had fallen to 110. The Milan Army Ammunition Plant is nicknamed \\"Bullet Town\\" by locals. Attributed population growth The Milan Army Ammunition Plant employed over 10,000 during World War II, dropping to 1,500 in 1947. Employment rose again to over 8,000 during the Korean War before falling to less than 500 in 1959. By 1968, employment had risen again to 7,000. During the period 19401971 the population of Milan had increased from 3,000 to 7,000. The growth was largely attributed to the Milan Army Ammunition Plant. In a 1944 article, the Saturday Evening Post, in discussing the boom created by the Milan Arsenal during World War II, predicted Milan would become a \\"ghost town\\" when the war was over. National Priorities List inclusion In 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) placed the Milan Army Ammunition Plant on the National Priorities List. Contamination of the city's groundwater in the Memphis Sand Aquifer of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and RDX was of particular concern. In 1989, the EPA, United States Army and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) signed a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) for the site. The FFA ensures that the parties would fully investigate environmental impacts associated with past and present activities at the installation and complete appropriate cleanup actions through established schedules and enforceable milestones. In the early 1990s, the United States Army financed the relocation of the city's drinking water well field. The United States Army implemented institutional controls to prohibit groundwater use in contaminated areas. In 2010, the third Five-Year Review found that the cleanup activities were protecting people and the environment. In 2013, the United States Army submitted its Site-wide Feasibility Study to the EPA for approval. The cleanup of affected soil was completed leaving the cleanup and long-term care of the groundwater contamination plume. The velocities of the plume vary, but the direction is primarily North towards the Rutherford Fork of the Obion River and from the Northwest boundary towards the city. The long-term care of the groundwater contamination plume is expected to last through 2075 when contamination is expected to be below the EPA required two parts per billion.

In 1801, Rutledge became the official county seat of Grainger County, a distinction that had been shared by several communities since the county's formation in 1796. Rutledge prospered in the early 19th century in part due to its situation along the Federal Road (present day US 11W), which connected New Orleans and Virginia. The road intersected the Wilderness Road (present day US 25E) at Bean Station, just east of Rutledge. Replica of Andrew Johnson's tailor shop In the 1820s, President Andrew Johnson, who worked as a tailor in Greeneville, briefly operated a tailor shop in Rutledge.Tennessee Historical Commission Marker 1B 43 in Rutledge, Tennessee. Information accessed: 17 February 2008. In 1976, a replica of Johnson's tailor shop was erected on the Grainger County Courthouse lawn. During the U.S. Civil War, guerilla warfare largely paralyzed Grainger County. In December 1863, Confederate General James Longstreet, who had earlier failed to wrest Knoxville from Union forces, passed through Rutledge en route to winter quarters at Russellville. On December 14, in what became known as the Battle of Bean's Station, Longstreet attacked a Union detachment that had been pursuing him. The Confederates failed to exploit the element of surprise, and the Union forces were able to hold out until reinforcements arrived. While Longstreet was victorious, Union forces were able to retreat to fortifications at Blaine, and Longstreet subsequently abandoned the assault and continued eastward to Russellville.

The population was 477 at the 2010 census. A resort town in the 19th century, Beersheba Springs was the summer home of author Mary Noailles Murfree. It now serves as a major summer meeting center for the Tennessee United Methodist Church.  History  In 1833 Beersheba Porter Cain discovered a chalybeate spring. The spring and surrounding area, located above Collins River Valley, would be incorporated in 1839. Upon its incorporation, Beersheba Springs would serve as a summer resort with a small hotel and log cabins. The resort would be popular with stagecoach traffic that would travel between Chattanooga and McMinnville. It was notable for its mineral waters. Eventually Louisiana farmers also moved into the area, leaving behind the notoriously hot summers of their home state. Beersheba Springs served as the summer home for Tennessee Mary Noailles Murfree. Beersheba Springs Hotel, 1913 Beersheba Springs resort In 1854 Colonel John Armfield, a slave trader from Louisiana, acquired the property. Upwards of 100 slaves were brought to Beersheba Springs to work on Armfield's changes to the property: a new luxury hotel, cabins and grounds that would accommodate 400 guests. The resort would feature laundry facilities, ice houses, billiard rooms, and bowling alleys. French chefs were brought in to serve guests, as were musical acts from New Orleans. A wooden observatory was built at the front of the hotel. From the observatory, guests could watch Confederate and Union armies battle during the Civil War. Eventually the threat of war, raids, and plundering would cause a decline in visitation to Beersheba Springs and the resort was handed over to Northern investors. The resort would re-open in the 1870s but never returned to its former glory. In 1940, the Methodist Church purchased the resort and re-opened it for assembly and summer camps. Architecturally the resort remains unchanged besides, as of recently, parts of the hotel have been \\"modernized\\" or restored. The camp now serves as the home to the annual Beersheba Springs Arts and Craft Festival. In 1980 the resort area was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Centuries prior to the Civil War, Native Americans used a location on the mountain known as Signal Point to send fire and smoke signals across the Tennessee Valley. Later, the Union Army used Signal Point as a communications station during the Civil War. At the outbreak of the war, only a few families lived on the mountain. However, when various health epidemics struck Chattanooga in 1873 and 1878, several wealthy families relocated to the mountain where they could find clear air and pure water. In the early 20th century, Charles E. James purchased of land in the Signal Point area and developed the mountain. In 1913, construction was completed of of streetcar track, which linked Chattanooga to Signal Mountain.

The population was 12,714 at the 2010 census and estimated to be 13,619 in 2019. The city was formed in 1969 when the communities of Soddy (to the north) and Daisy (to the south), along with nearby developed areas along U.S. Highway 27, merged to form Soddy-Daisy. It is becoming a bedroom community of nearby Chattanooga and is part of the Chattanooga Metropolitan Statistical Area. Sequoyah Nuclear Generating Station is located in Soddy-Daisy. History Soddy-Daisy is an incorporated city, comprising the Tennessee cities Soddy and Daisy. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. Soddy- Daisy was home to Hamilton County's first courthouse and government seat, Poe's Tavern.http://community.timesfreepress.com/news/2011/mar/23/soddy-daisy- commits-50000-historic-poes-tavern-pro/ The tavern, built in 1819, was the home of Soddy-Daisy resident Hasten Poe. In 1838, the tavern served as a way station for 1,900 Cherokees who were on the Trail of Tears. During the Civil War, Poe's Tavern served as a hospital for both Union and Confederate troops. Though the original Poe's Tavern was torn down in 1911, the city of Soddy Daisy has reconstructed a replica of the building a block away from the original site.http://soddy-daisy.org/?s=poe%27s There are two popular stories about how the city of Soddy got its name. The first is that the word \\"Soddy\\" is an anglicization of Tsati, a shorter form of the Cherokee word ·é†·èÇ ·é´·èå·èò ·è± (Ani-Kusati-yi), referring to the Muskogean Koasati people who lived there in the 18th century prior to Cherokee migration to the area after 1776. The second theory is that Soddy was named for William Sodder, who ran a trading post in the city. Others claim that Soddy's name is a reference to Soddy Creek, which is believed to have originated from the Cherokee word Sauta, which is derived from Echota. Soddy was a very small town until the Soddy Coal Company began mining in 1867. Daisy is rumored to have taken its name from Daisy Parks, the daughter of Thomas Parks. Thomas Parks was Vice-President of the Tabler-Cleudup Coal & Coke Company, and founded the Daisy Coal Company in April 1881.http://www.hctgs.org/communities/soddy_daisy.htm The two cities incorporated in April 1969 along a stretch of U.S. 27.http://soddy- daisy.org/about Geography Soddy-Daisy is located in north-central Hamilton County at (35.258538, -85.176996).

It is located along State Highway 57 in southwest Hardeman County. The population was 99 at the 2000 census and 81 at the 2010 census showing a decrease of 18. Saulsbury is the least-populated incorporated municipality in Tennessee. History Saulsbury's historical roots stem from a former settlement named Berlin, TN, which was located one mile south of the current location of Saulsbury. Two regional mail roads - one from Bolivar to Ripley, Mississippi, and another from LaGrange to Corinth, Mississippi. These mail roads met at an intersection which would form into a trading center. In 1839 a post office was established there, and Berlin would be incorporated in 1846, and within five years it would be home to 351 people. Upon the completion of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, Berlin was bypassed due to one landowner's refusal to sell their property to the railroad. A track was instead laid one mile north of Berlin, on land that was owned by Burrell Sauls and Berry Futrell. The finished railroad station and track would be called Sauls-Berry Depot. Eventually Berlin would be deserted as people moved to the new settlement and in 1856 Saulsbury was incorporated. Civil War Just after the taking of Memphis in 1862, the Union Army took Saulsbury. Skirmishes continued throughout the area, and eventually Saulsbury would return to Confederate control. Confederate soldiers used Saulsbury as a rally point to travel to Corinth to join their regiments. After the Civil War, Saulsbury maintained itself as a town, unlike others in the area which barely survived the war. Saulsbury's cotton production survived the war as well, and Saulsbury emerged as a leader in cotton production in the region. The town also became a producer of eggs, turkeys, poultry and hogs; which were often sent to Memphis for sale. Sand mining became a major industry in the 1870s, providing 47 different types of sand for brass molding. 1999 Tornado On January 17, 1999, an F1 tornado formed just southwest of Saulsbury, and moved northeast until dissipating near Rogers Springs.

The population was 303 at the 2010 census. Saltillo is located on the left bank of the Tennessee River, about 12 miles north of Savannah. History Saltillo was founded by Thomas Shannon in October, 1822. He had left Davidson County, Tennessee and arrived in the area on a keelboat with enough provisions to last one year, two men, Colonel John Holland and Parkerson Mitchell, to assist him, and four black men. The men arrived via Tennessee River and built camp about half a mile from the river. Shannon's wife and seven children came by land with a drive of forty cattle. This cattle would serve as the starting point for Shannon to raise cattle for income, but the cattle were unable to adapt to the change in their environment and feeding. Within three months of grazing, 39 of the 40 cattle were dead. Shortly after the Shannon family's arrival, Shannon and his sons built a log cabin in 1825, serving as the first house built in Saltillo. Shortly thereafter a store-house was built by Smith Hawkins for dry goods to be distributed, which were sold out within three months. The area where this store-house was built is now called Hawkin's Landing. More settlers came to the area and another store was built a quarter mile south of the first store by Hawkin's brother, Perry. The first man to be killed in town was Simpson Lee, who was thrown off his horse. Barges began regularly delivering goods and residents would travel as far as the Duck River for a grist mill. In 1842 Thomas Davy purchased the land once owned by Thomas Shannon and it was named Davy's Landing. In 1849 Davy leased the land to Scott Terry, who renamed the area Saltillo. The town was named Saltillo after Saltillo, Mexico by Terry, who was a veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The Saltillo post office was opened in 1850. Saltillo was incorporated in 1870.

It is adjacent to Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. It was settled in 1775 by the grandparents of Davy Crockett, and is the second- oldest town in the state. It is named for its founder, Joseph Rogers. Tennessee's second oldest courthouse, the Hawkins County Courthouse, first newspaper The Knoxville Gazette, and first post office are all located in Rogersville. The Rogersville Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Rogersville is part of the Kingsport-Bristol (TN)-Bristol (VA) Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City-Kingsport-Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area - commonly known as the \\"Tri-Cities\\" region. The population of Rogersville as of the 2010 census was 4,420. In 2019, its estimated population was 4,377. History=Settlement background Hawkins County Courthouse, ca. 1835-36, is situated at the center of Rogersville. Still in use, it is the second oldest courthouse in Tennessee.The Dickson County Courthouse in Charlotte, Tennessee, was built and completed in 1835. In 1775, the grandparents of Davy Crockett, a future member of the United States Congress from Tennessee and hero of the Alamo, settled in the Watauga colony in the area in what is today Rogersville near the spring that today bears their name.Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) chs. 1-2. After an American Indian attack and massacre, the remaining Crocketts sold the property to a Huguenot named Colonel Thomas Amis.Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) ch. 2. In 1780, Colonel Amis built a fort at Big Creek, on the outskirts of the present-day town, with the assistance of fellow Scots- Irish settler John Carter. That same year, about above downtown Rogersville, Amis erected a fortress-like stone house, around which he built a palisade for protection against Native American attack. The next year, Amis opened a store, erected a blacksmith shop, and built a distillery. He also eventually established a sawmill and a gristmill. From the first he kept a house of entertainment. Founding of the town In 1785, the State of Franklin organized Spencer County (which includes the area of present-day Hawkins County, Tennessee) and declared the seat of county government to be located at what is today Rogersville.Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) chs. 2-3 Thomas Henderson was chosen county court clerk and colonel of the militia. William Cocke and Thomas King were elected representatives to the Franklin General Assembly. The remaining county officers are unknown. In November 1786, North Carolina began once more to contend with the Franklin government for control over the area, and that state's General Assembly passed an act creating Hawkins County.Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) ch. 3. It included within its limits all the territory between Bays Mountain and the Holston and Tennessee rivers on the east to the Cumberland Mountains on the west. The county court was organized at the house of Thomas Gibbons. As had the state of Franklin, North Carolina set the new county seat about the property of Joseph Rogers.Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) ch. 4. Joseph Rogers Joseph Rogers founded Rogersville on land granted to him by his father-in-law after his marriage to Mary. Joseph Rogers (August 21, 1764 ‚Äì November 6, 1833) was born near Cook's Town, Ireland, the son of James Rogers and his wife, Elizabeth Brown. He traveled to the area, by then known as the State of Franklin (which had been carved out of far west North Carolina), by 1785. During a stay at a tavern adjacent to Colonel Thomas Amis' home, Rogers met the colonel's daughter, Mary Amis, whom he wed, on October 24, 1786. Her father ceded the lands near Crockett Spring to his son-in-law‚Äî the same land that Colonel Amis had purchased from the heirs of David Crockett. When North Carolina considered where to establish the county seat for its new Hawkins County, Rogers successfully lobbied to have the government located near his home. He volunteered his tavern, which had been established about 1784-85, as the first county courthouse, where it was finally established in 1787. With the help of other local settlers, Rogers laid out a plan for the town, and the town of Rogersville was chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1789. The plan included a public square, deeded to the town government, which would host the town's public well and a county courthouse. In November 1792, Rogers was appointed the first postmaster at Rogersville. The town's second post office, built by Rogers c. 1815, still stands at the corner of east Main Street and south Hasson Street. Rogers was the father of fourteen children with Mary. He died on November 6, 1833, at Rogersville, and is buried in Rogers Cemetery. His wife, Mary, died a month later. A town divided In November 1863, during the Civil War, Rogersville was the site of a battle between occupying Federal forces and invading Confederate troops. Union forces had encamped just outside the town. The Confederates, led by Brigadier General William E. Jones, were able to surprise the Union forces and pursue them across the Holston River and into Greene County. The Confederates held the town for the remainder of the war. Sentiment in Rogersville was divided. Many supported the efforts of twenty-six East Tennessee counties seceding from the state (much as the State of Scott had done) and re-joining the Union. Others saw President Lincoln's invasion of Tennessee as an unprecedented invasion of their homes and an incursion by Federal power; these people became strong Confederates. Rogersville was spared destruction during the war. In fact, structures such as the Hale Springs Inn were used by the different occupying armies. Cradle of Tennessee journalism Downtown Rogersville has been home to many of the town's numerous newspapers and publications. George Roulstone was Tennessee's first printer. He was encouraged to settle in Rogersville by William Blount, the new governor of the Southwest Territory. Roulston printed Tennessee's first newspaper on November 5, 1791. Because Knoxville, the intended seat of the new territorial government, had not yet been established, Roulstone published the first year of his paper near the Rogers tavern. Roulstone called the newspaper The Knoxville Gazette and in October 1792, he moved his press to Knoxville, where he continued to publish the Gazette as well as other papers until his death in 1804. After the Gazette was moved, there was no newspaper in the area until 1813, when John B. Hood began publishing The East Tennessee Gazette at Rogersville. Other papers shortly followed, including The Western Pilot, c. 1815, and The Rogersville Gazette from the same era. Specialty publications emerged during these early days, including The Rail-Road Advocate, The Calvinistic Magazine, and The Holston Watchman. Numerous other newspapers have been published in Rogersville over the years, most surviving only a short time and having modest circulation. Among them were The Independent, The Rogersville Spectator, The Weekly Reporter, The Rogersville Gazette, Rogersville Press and Times, Holston Journal, Hawkins County Republican, Hawkins County Telephone, and The Rogersville Herald. Rogersville's longest-lasting newspaper is The Rogersville Review, which began publication as The Holston Review in 1885 by William T. Robertson. A year later, Robertson changed the name to the present banner. The Review's closest competitor in lifespan was The Rogersville Herald, which was published from 1886 to 1932. The town's printing heritage is chronicled by the Tennessee Newspaper and Printing Museum, located in the town's historic Southern Railway train depot, c. 1890.

It is located north of the Hatchie River, a tributary of the Mississippi, which originally served as the main transportation routes to markets for cotton.

Their choice was a site, of which were owned by Joseph Blythe and owned by Peter Ruff; both men donated the land to the county to have the seat there. A public square, streets, alleys, and 104 lots were laid off, and the lots were sold at auction over a two-day period in either March or April 1823. Paris was incorporated on September 30, 1823. It was the first town incorporated in West Tennessee, followed by Lexington on October 9, 1824, and Memphis on December 19, 1826. The city was named after Paris, France, in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolutionary War. As the county seat, Paris was a center of trade for the rural county, which was largely devoted to agriculture and particularly the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop. The planters depended on a large workforce of enslaved African Americans. Between about 1970 and 1990, Paris became the center of the Old Beachy Amish. Beachy Amish from different regions moved there to maintain their traditional ways. Because of internal conflicts, most Old Beachy Amish left the region in the early 1990s and had completely vacated it by 2000.Midwest Beachy Amish Mennonite Church at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online Geography Paris is located just south of the center of Henry County at (36.301229, -88.313815).

The population was 4,105 at the 2010 census. History Waverly was established by Steven Pavatt as a stop along the stagecoach road between Nashville and Memphis in the early 19th century. Pavatt was a fan of the author Sir Walter Scott, and named the community after Scott's Waverley Novels. When Humphreys County was created in 1803, Reynoldsburg, located northwest of Waverly along the Tennessee River, was chosen as the county seat. However, when county lands on the west bank of the Tennessee split off to become part of the newly created Benton County in 1835, the Humphreys County seat was moved to Waverly, which had become the more central location in the county. A courthouse was built in 1836, and the town was officially incorporated in 1838. THC marker in Waverly recalling the now-defunct town of Reynoldsburg Like most of Middle and West Tennessee, Waverly was staunchly pro-Confederacy during the American Civil War. Humphreys County voted unanimously in favor of secession in 1861. Union troops occupied the town in 1863 to guard the railroad between White Bluff and Johnsonville (now Old Johnsonville), the latter being a Federal supply depot and transfer station. The Union troops managed to build a fort at the courthouse square, although they were constantly harassed by Confederate guerillas. On November 4, 1864, Confederate troops under Nathan Bedford Forrest attacked and destroyed the Federal depot in what became known as the Battle of Johnsonville. The battle occurred approximately west of Waverly at the mouth of Trace Creek. Hurricane Mills, located a few miles south of Waverly along TN-13, was the site of a substantial mill and carding factory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It is part of the Morristown Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census the population was 8,047. History Heading southwest along the Holston River from Virginia, Adam and Elizabeth Peck arrived on the banks of Mossy Creek in 1788, soon settling the area with a fort, a house of worship, and a gristmill. It is suggested that original name of the city, Mossy Creek, originated due to the first settlers' description of the 'vivid' green moss developed around a creek near the settlement. By 1797, Mossy Creek had around 75 to 100 families with a four- mile-radius of the city. Around the beginnings of the American Civil War in September 1861, Union Army General Ambrose Burnside liberated the city from the Confederacy, but was attacked in an unsuccessful siege by Confederate General James Longstreet. Several skirmishes took place around Mossy Creek, most notably the Battle of Mossy Creek on December 19, 1863. In the later 19th century, two communities formed around Mossy Creek, Frame Addition and Carsonville. In 1901, Mossy Creek merged with the two communities, incorporating as Jefferson City. In 1940, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) began purchasing property in Jefferson City for the construction of Cherokee Dam and the impounding of the Holston River for Cherokee Lake. Many residents reluctantly gave up their farms and homes for the promise of flood control and electricity offered by the TVA. Construction brought many new residents to the city, and Cherokee Lake made Jefferson City a popular recreational hub for locals and tourists alike.

The project received extensive NIMBY backlash from an organized group of affected property owners and farmers, citing the massive loss of land as a negative impact on Jefferson County's agricultural industry. The project would also have required Jefferson County funding dollars in off- site costs such as transportation and utility infrastructure upgrades. In 2011, Norfolk Southern acquired several parcels of land in New Market and proposals for an on-site logistics park were dropped after a developer pulled out of its deal with Norfolk Southern.

A political booster and store owner at the stop successfully petitioned the railroad to name the stop in honor of Emerson Etheridge, a prominent mid-19th century politician and post-Civil War candidate for governor.Larry Miller, Tennessee Place Names (Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 72-73. The current site of Ethridge, meanwhile, was located at the intersection of two mid-19th century cattle drovers' roads. When the railroad constructed a station at this site in the late 1890s, it was named Wayne Station.

In 1980, the fair became a district fair, serving five counties and paying over $10,000 in agriculture premiums. As far back as 1889, there are records for the harness racing that takes place still today at the fairgrounds. The racetrack was made of red clay until 1978 when it was converted to an all weather track by grading it and covering it in limestone dust. Other elements of the fair include a demolition derby, rides, food vendors, a cattle showing, pageants, art competition, and concerts.

Its population was at 1,064, according to the 2010 census. It is included in the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area. History=Early history Located near modern-day Greenback, Morganton Ferry (initially called Wear's Ferry) was an important crossing of the Little Tennessee. It was established in the late 18th century, and had grown into a small community known as \\"Portville\\" by 1810.Alberta and Carson Brewer, Valley So Wild (Knoxville: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1975), pp. 92-96. The community was chartered as \\"Morganton\\" after local merchant Gideon Morgan in 1813. Around this time, the Tellico agent relocated to Fort Southwest Point (now Kingston), and a road quickly developed between this fort and Maryville. Since the road crossed the Little Tennessee at the Morganton Ferry, the road became known locally as Morganton Road.Inez Burns, History of Blount County, Tennessee: From War Trail to Landing Strip, 1795-1955 (Nashville: Benson Print Co., 1957), pp. 87-89, 266. In the years leading up to the Civil War, a cave in the Morganton and Greenback area is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad, perhaps reflecting the area's ties to abolitionist-heavy Blount County.\\"Underground Railroad - Tennessee Stations .\\" The Center for Historic Preservation, Middle Tennessee State University (2005). Retrieved: 21 December 2007. The William H. Griffitts House, located just outside Greenback, was also a stop on the Underground Railroad. In 1859, entrepreneur Jesse Kerr established a hotel and health resort at the mineral-rich Sulphur Springs near the base of Chilhowee Mountain several miles southeast of Morganton (the resort was located near the modern junction of US-129 and TN-336). The resort was connected to Morganton Road by a stagecoach road which roughly paralleled what is now Highway 95. This resort was purchased by Indiana businessman Nathan McCoy in 1885, and a new 3-story, 60-room hotel was completed the following year. The resort was renamed \\"Allegheny Springs.\\" Founding and later history In 1876, Lorenzo Thompson established Thompson's Stand, a general store located a few miles east of modern Greenback. In 1882, Thompson applied for federal post office. He initially hoped to use the name \\"Thompson's Station,\\" but the name was already in use. After several other names were rejected, Thompson settled on \\"Greenback,\\" a name inspired by the local Greenback Party politician, Jonathan Tipton.Heather Bailey, \\"National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Greenback Depot, 10 June 2013, pp. 9-11. Accessed at TN.gov website: 25 January 2014. View along Morganton Road in Greenback in the 1910s; the Greenback Depot is partially visible on the right In the late 1880s, the Knoxville Southern Railroad (not to be confused with the larger Southern Railway) began building a rail line connecting Knoxville with Blue Ridge, Georgia. Developers bought up the land surrounding this railroad's intersection with Morganton Road with plans to develop a town, initially known as \\"Allegheny\\" after the resort hotel to the south. Lots were sold, and a depot was constructed in 1891. Thompson moved his post office, still known as \\"Greenback,\\" to the Swanay Brothers Store in the new town. The name \\"Greenback\\" gradually came to be favored over \\"Allegheny,\\" and the railroad changed the name of the station to \\"Greenback\\" in 1897. By the late 1890s, Greenback had three stores, a barbershop, blacksmith shop, school, livery stables, a hotel, and two baseball teams (segregated between white and black players). The Knoxville Southern was purchased by the Marietta and North Georgia Railroad, which was in turn purchased by the Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern Railroad in 1895. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;), which was building a rail line between Cincinnati and Atlanta, purchased the Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern in 1902. The L&N;'s Greenback Depot, completed in 1914, still stands in Greenback, and has since been remodeled by Ron Edmondson as a community events center. The Greenback Drug Company, opened in 1923, still stands and has served as a community restaurant and diner for the past few decades. Locals still call it \\"the drugstore\\" and meet there for food and community. Greenback Mills, photographed in 1942 Prior to the Great Depression, thirty-four commercial buildings were constructed in Greenback. Over half of these, however, were destroyed in a series of six major fires during this period. Though the community's growth slowed, Greenback was officially incorporated in 1957, with Glenn McTeer as its first mayor. A community center-- built by the town's residents with no outside help or outside funding-- was completed in 1978. It now houses a library, the city hall, and recreational facilities.Linda Albert, \\"About Greenback,\\" The Maryville-Alcoa Daily Times, 19 February 2000. On September 22, 1964, one of the first confrontations between the Tennessee Valley Authority and conservation groups over the proposed Tellico Dam project took place in a meeting at Greenback High School. TVA had called the meeting in hopes of gaining the support of locals, and the agency was surprised when most of the 400 or so in attendance vehemently opposed the project. TVA Chairman Aubrey Wagner, who spoke on the Authority's behalf, was continuously interrupted throughout his speech. At one point, Wagner was shouted down by legendary Monroe County judge Sue K. Hicks, who as president of the Fort Loudoun Association feared the destruction of the historic fort's site by the proposed dam's reservoir.W. Bruce Wheeler, TVA and the Tellico Dam, 1936-1979: A Bureaucratic Crisis In Post-Industrial America (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1986), p. 64. In 2011, H&R; Block featured Greenback in its national advertising campaign. The campaign, known as \\"Greenbacks for Greenback,\\" included a review of many of the citizens' taxes - a program H&R; Block calls \\"second look.\\" The campaign saved locals more than $14,000 in taxes. The savings were revealed in a celebration with the community at Greenback School. Television, radio and print advertising featured the historic Greenback Depot, the Greenback Drugstore Diner, Greenback School and the Greenback Historical Society as well as many people who call Greenback home. Geography Greenback is located at (35.655751, -84.164898). The city is situated around the junction of Tennessee State Route 95 and Morganton Road, with the greater community extending to U.S. Route 411 to the south and U.S. Route 321 to the north, and along Morganton Road westward to East Tellico Parkway (which follows the shores of Tellico Lake). A small commercial area is located around the intersection of Highway 411 and Highway 95. The relatively flat land in and around Greenback is part of a valley carved by Baker Creek, a tributary of the Little Tennessee River. Chilhowee Mountain and the Great Smoky Mountains are visible to the south. The Red Knobs, part of a heavily- dissected ridge typical of the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley range, rise just north of Greenback's city limits. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.80%) is water.

History Native Americans were living in the Lenoir City area for thousands of years before the arrival of the first European settlers. On Bussell Island, which lies across the Tennessee River to the south, archaeologists have discovered evidence of habitation dating to as early as the Archaic Period (8000-1000 B.C.). The island is also believed to have been the location of \\"Coste,\\" a village visited by Hernando de Soto in 1540.Charles Hudson, Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 1997), pp. 204‚Äì207.

By the early 19th century, an early East Tennessee pioneer, Judge David Campbell, had laid claim to part of what is now Lenoir City, where he had built a log cabin and a gristmill.Gail Guymon, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Lenoir Cotton Mill Warehouse, February 2006. Retrieved: 2010-03-03. The William Ballard Lenoir House, built in 1821, now part of the Ledbetter Apartments In the early 19th century, a tract of land-- which included what is now Lenoir City-- was deeded to General William Lenoir as payment for his services in the American Revolutionary War. David Campbell and another early settler, Alexander Outlaw, filed a case against Lenoir in court, arguing they had already laid claim to parts of the Lenoir tract. After the case was settled in favor of Lenoir in 1809, Lenoir deeded the tract to his son, William Ballard Lenoir (1775-1852), who in 1810 moved to the tract and established a large plantation. Along with agricultural pursuits, which included producing hams from a herd of Berkshire hogs, Lenoir operated several small-scale industries, including a sawmill and flour mill. In the early 1830s, the Lenoir Cotton Mill-- one of the earliest in the South-- was completed along the banks of Town Creek. After Lenoir's death, his estate was divided up among his children. His sons formed the William Lenoir and Brothers Company to manage the family's businesses. When the railroad reached the Lenoir estate in 1855, a depot was constructed, and the community of Lenoir Station developed around it. During the Civil War, the Lenoirs supported the Confederacy, due in part to associations with Confederate-leaning business interests in Knoxville (one of William Ballard Lenoir's sons was married to the daughter of Knoxville historian and banker, J. G. M. Ramsey, who was an ardent Confederate). On June 20, 1863, a Union scouting expedition led by General William P. Sanders arrived at Lenoir Station after having failed to destroy the railroad trestle at Loudon. Sanders burned the depot as well as the Lenoirs' sawmill and flour mill. He spared the cotton mill, however, since there were few such mills in the area to provide cloth for the army, and because the Lenoirs were fellow Masons.Tennessee Civil War Trails informational sign in Lenoir City, Tennessee; information accessed 8 September 2009. Lenoir City Company Baumann Brothers In the late 1880s, an abundance of financial capital, the popularity of social theories regarding planned cities, and a thriving coal mining industry in East Tennessee's Cumberland Plateau region led to the establishment of a number of company towns throughout the Upper Tennessee Valley, most of which were funded by investors from the northeast or Knoxville. In 1889, Knoxville railroad magnate Charles McClung McGhee and his friend and associate, Edward J. Sanford, formed the Lenoir City Company, believing the Lenoir estate would be the ideal location for such a town. The company incorporated in April 1890 with $800,000 in stock, and purchased the Lenoir estate, which then consisted of , for $300 per acre. When the company issued the stock to the public, the investors each received stock in the company and a lot in the planned town.John Benhart, Appalachian Aspirations: The Geography of Urbanization and Development in the Upper Tennessee River Valley, 1865-1900 (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2007), pp. 74-79, 90-92, 97. Lenoir City was laid out in a grid pattern with four quadrants, west of Town Creek and north of the railroad tracks. The city's northwest quadrant would be a middle class and affluent residential area, whereas the northeast quadrant would be for the city's wage-workers. The southwest quadrant would contain blast furnaces, steel works, and other large factories, while the southeast quadrant would contain woodworking, furniture, and canning factories. Influenced by late 19th-century reform movements that stressed health and temperance, several lots were set aside for public parks, and a large garden area was planned between the railroad tracks and the river. The Lenoir City Company struggled due to a recession that froze financial markets in the early 1890s. By 1892, the company had only sold 144 of the town's 3,448 lots. McGhee and Sanford persisted, however, and while it never developed in the grand fashion conceived, Lenoir City nevertheless survived. McGhee convinced a rail car company to open a factory in Lenoir City, and a short time later a knitting mill was established. Both establishments still employed several hundred workers in 1910.Benhart, pp. 116-117, 122-123. 20th century Lenoir City in 1940 Beginning in the 1930s, a series of federal government projects provided a needed boost to Lenoir City's economy. The Tennessee Valley Authority's construction of Fort Loudoun Dam and reservoir, which began in 1940, provided hundreds of locals with jobs, and brought a number of road improvements to the area. The creation of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and 1960s brought about the construction of I-75 and I-40-- two trans- national highways that intersect just northeast of Lenoir City. U.S. Highway 321 was built through Lenoir City in the 1980s primarily to provide greater access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, some down the road in Blount County. On February 21, 1993 at 5:05PM, an F-3 tornado touched down in eastern Roane County (just west of town) and tracked east-south-east directly towards the City. The tornado devastated parts of the city. Parts of Downtown, as well as the area near A Street and 5th Avenue were destroyed. This included major damage to the former Lenoir City High School/Middle School property (now River Oaks Place). The Tornado continued east-south-eastward going through the town of Friendsville before lifting in western Maryville. The death toll was 1 (in Lenoir City) and there were 55 injuries, per the NWS Tornado Database.http://innovation.srh.noaa.gov/tors/index.php?cw=mrx In March 1998, A historic landmark, the William B. Lenoir Hotel, the block of Broadway (US 11) between A and B Street, was destroyed by a massive fire. The entire block was lost due to what is called a common attic and basement, meaning that there were no firewalls between buildings. Wilburn's Barbershop, the Lenoir City Public Library, a Mexican grocery, TV Readers magazine, Habitat for Humanity, a school photography company along with a photo finishing lab, as well as several apartments were destroyed by the blaze. The ruins of the property were demolished and replaced by Roane State Community College, Tennessee Career Center, and a new state of the art Lenoir City Public Library. 21st century In the early 2000s, Lenoir City continued to grow economically. U.S. Highway 321 saw by far the most growth, with new restaurants such as Ruby Tuesday, Chili's, Cracker Barrel, Aubrey's, and Zaxby's to name a few. New stores included The Home Depot, Goody's Family Clothing (Now Defunct), Cato, and Blockbuster Video (Now Defunct). A new hospital, Fort Loudoun Medical Center, was built replacing the old Fort Sander's Loudon Hospital in nearby Loudon. In the late 2000s, two major commercial developments were announced. Creekwood Park was the first to announce new development. This is located parallel to I-75 between US-321 and US-70. A new four-lane road was built between the two highways. Shortly thereafter a luxury apartment complex was built on part of the site. Otherwise most of the site remained vacant for several years following completion of the new road. In 2014, development finally started commencing in the area with a few medical offices being built. From 2016 - 2017, the city constructed a new community center called \\"The Venue\\" and a new Headquarters for Lenoir City Utilities Board on a portion of the site. Later, local physician and TV personality, Dr. Bob Overholt, announced that The Market at Town Creek would connect US-321 and Harrison Road near the Lenoir City High School and Middle School property. Several Businesses have opened on the property, including a new Food City grocery store, Bojangles, Knoxville TVA Employees Credit Union, AT&T; Store, Pizza Hut, and a tanning salon. In 2013 the long-awaited Town Creek Parkway, a four- lane road connecting US-321 and Harrison Road, was completed. In 2016, the city inaugurated its first female city councilwoman, Jennifer Wampler, whom was appointed to fill out the remainder of the term vacated by her husband, Harry Wampler, upon his death. Geography U.S. Highway 321 (Lamar Alexander Parkway) in Lenoir City Lenoir City is located at (35.797618, -84.271103). The Tennessee River and TVA's Fort Loudoun and Watts Bar reservations provide the city's southern boundary. Four major federal highways pass through Lenoir City: U.S. Route 11, which runs roughly parallel to the river shore, traverses the city east-to-west; U.S. Route 321, which crosses Fort Loudon Dam south of the city, traverses the city north-to-south. Interstate 75 and U.S. Route 70 intersect US-321 in the northern part of the city. I-75 provides access to the city from exit 81, and leads northeast 26 mi (42 km) to downtown Knoxville (via a connection with I-40), and southwest 91 mi (146 km) to Chattanooga. U.S. 321 runs through the center of town from southeast to northwest, leading northwest 7 mi (11 km) to I-40 at exit 364 (the highway's northern terminus), and east 20 mi (32 km) to Maryville. U.S. 70 runs to the north of the city, leading northeast 9 mi (14 km) to Farragut and northwest 19 mi (31 km) to Kingston. U.S. 11 runs through the center of the city, leading northeast to Farragut and Knoxville, and southwest 7 mi (11 km) to the city of Loudon. Lenoir City is traditionally spread out along US-11, west of the road's junction with US-321. This section of the city still roughly follows a grid plan laid out in the 1890s. In recent decades, Lenoir City has annexed a corridor of land along US-321 between its US-11 intersection and I-40 intersection. This corridor contains the city's newer, commercial area that caters to the high volume of traffic brought to the area by I-75 and I-40. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 8,642 people, 3,369 households, and 2,183 families residing in the city. There were 3,703 housing units.

Government The City of Lenoir City operates under a Mayor/City Council Form. The mayor is elected on 4 year terms. The City Council is elected every 4 years. Education Residents are zoned to both city and county schools. Because of the proximity of the county schools to Lenoir City and the distance to the county high schools (Loudon High School and Greenback School), most students who attend county schools within the city through elementary and middle grades (Kindergarten through eighth) transfer to the city school system upon enrolling in high school.

The population was 1,112 at the 2010 census. History=Founding The area was originally known as Salt Lick Creek due to a salt lick that was located approximately four miles northwest of current day Red Boiling Springs. The salt lick attracted animals, American Indians, and other peoples. Among the people who came to hunt the animal trails was Daniel Boone, who reportedly carved his name and the year 1775 into a beech tree in a nearby community.History The area was first surveyed and land grants were first awarded in the mid-1780s. The first post office was established in 1829 and named the Salt Lick Creek post office. In 1847, the post office was renamed \\"Red Boiling Springs.\\" Sometime in the 1830s, a farmer named Jesse Jones noticed red-colored sulphur water bubbling up from springs on his farm. In 1844, a businessman named Samuel Hare, realizing the springs' commercial potential, purchased a plot of the Jones farm surrounding the springs, and constructed an inn. The inn's remote location and the region's poor roads likely doomed the venture, and the inn was gone by the 1870s.Jeanette Keith Denning, A History of the Resort at Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee: A Thesis Presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School, Tennessee Technological University (Cookeville, Tenn.: 1982), pp. 6-7. Aunt Sooky's Salve was a widely distributed product that was manufactured in Red Boiling Springs under the supervision of 'Aunt' Sooky Goad, who also claimed to be the original discoverer of the benefits of the Red Boiling Springs water. Early in life she had dropsy and claimed to be cured by drinking the sulphur water. In 1914, a Nashville man wrote an article stating that Shepherd Kiby (Kirby), the brother of Goad, discovered that washing his eyes with the spring water reduced eye irritation, but Goad's use of the water seems to have preceded that of Kirby.HISTORY OF MACON CO TN (Harold Blankenship, 1986) pg 60-61. Tourist attraction In 1873, a stagecoach line was established between Red Boiling Springs and Gallatin, where there was a railroad stop. This likely led to renewed commercial interest in the springs, and by 1876, a general store owner named James Bennett had purchased the springs tract and had built a hotel. Bennett's hotel consisted of a row of log cabins flanking a central frame dining hall. In the late 1870s, Nashville newspapers first started mentioning Bennett's hotel and its guests' activities, as it was vogue during the Gilded Age for newspapers to report on daily happenings at upper class and upper- middle class resorts.Denning, thesis, p. 8-9. The Thomas House, formerly the Cloyd Hotel The 1880s saw a boom in the development of mineral springs resorts as \\"summer getaways,\\" due in part to the publicity received by places such as Saratoga Springs in New York. During this decade, New York businessman James F. O. Shaugnesy purchased the Red Boiling Springs tract and began development of the area as a resort.Tennessee Historical Society In 1889, the town first made the Nashville newspapers' front pages when former Tennessee Governor John C. Brown died of a hemorrhage at one of the hotels. The papers emphasized that due to the isolation of the town and a lack of a telephone or telegraph, there was no way to get help. During the following decade, a railroad line was extended to Hartsville, and the railroad established a stagecoach line to Red Boiling Springs. With the continued rise in the number of visitors, two local general store owners-- Zack and Clay Cloyd-- opened the Cloyd Hotel during this period.Denning, thesis, pp. 11-13. In 1905, several investors formed the Red Boiling Springs Water and Realty Company, and the following year purchased the original springs tract from Shaughnesy. By 1916, the company had replaced Shaughnesy's hotel with a lavish 64-room structure named \\"The Palace.\\" During this same period, road improvements allowed the stagecoach lines to be replaced with automobile taxis, reducing the travel time from the railroad to just three hours.Denning, thesis, pp. 17-19. In 1918 there were four hotels in town-- the Palace, the Cloyd, the Donoho, and the Central Hotel; a decade later that number doubled and soon after, over a dozen hotels and at least that many boarding houses had been erected to take advantage of tourism. The hotels all followed a similar design plan-- two stories with elegant verandas spanning the facade, and interiors containing large dining halls and 50 to 60 rooms (some later doubled or tripled their roomspace with annexes). While most mineral water resorts fell out of favor as medical science began to question the healing properties of mineral springs, Red Boiling Springs persisted, reaching its peak in the 1920s and 1930s.Denning, thesis, pp. 22-33. The resort was visited by many famous personages in the first half of the 20th century. The hotel registers included the names of judges, lawyers, heads of business and industry, famous musicians and singers, and politicians, among them Jo Byrns; Al Gore, Sr.; Nathan Bachman;Denning, thesis, p. 37. Secretary of State Cordell Hull, who sent a beautiful French tapestry that hung in the main lobby of the Donoho Hotel; and most notably President Woodrow Wilson. Although the Great Depression destroyed many Americans' disposable incomes and hence budget for travel, Red Boiling Springs still had large numbers of visitors. The Summer of 1936 brought over 14,000 people to the little hamlet of approximately 800.\\"Good Times - Vacationing at Red Boiling Springs\\", Jeanette Keith in Rural Life and Culture in the Upper Cumberland, The University Press of Kentucky, 2004 The mineral springs and daily life in the resort period Mineral springs pump Almost uniquely, five different types of mineral waters are found at Red Boiling Springs., 1986 These springs are \\"mineralized\\" by their contact with exposed black shale, from which iron sulfate is dissolved into the waters.Denning, thesis, pp. 23-24. Some were named for the color they would turn a silver coin; two, dubbed \\"Red\\" and \\"Black\\", were from springs which were capped off and then piped throughout the town to a series of wells with manually operated pumps on both public and private property. Along with iron and sulphur, Red and Black waters both contained relatively high amounts of calcium and magnesium.Denning, thesis, pp. 22-23. The flavor of the \\"Red\\" water was only somewhat sulfurous and seemed to be at least slightly agreeable to many; the \\"Black\\" was very- strongly flavored, off-putting to the novice, and an acquired taste (at best) for most. \\"White\\" was used only to cure dyspepsia. \\"Freestone\\" water contained none of the trace minerals that brought the crowds to the springs but it was by far the most palatable. The most mineralized water, known as \\"Double and Twist,\\" was named for the effect it had on the person drinking it. \\"Double and Twist\\" was advertised as the \\"only water of its kind in the United States.\\"Bellar, Jim: \\"Red Boiling Springs The Tradition Lives. Macon County Times Publishing Company, 1981 Armour's Hotel, formerly the Counts Hotel \\"Taking the waters\\" at Red Boiling Springs generally consisted of more than merely ingesting them; steam and tub baths featuring the waters and their alleged therapeutic properties were often featured. The bathhouses followed the hydrotherapy regimen developed by John Harvey Kellogg at his Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan, which was very popular at the time.Denning, thesis, pp. 34-35. The various waters contained several minerals but sulfur was predominant, giving the waters the scent (and some would say, the flavor) of rotten eggs. There were medical doctors on hand to prescribe which treatments would work for a particular ailment. The mineral waters, either from ingesting them or bathing in them, were touted as cures for diseases such as dyspepsia, hydropsy, diabetes, rheumatism, neuralgia, kidney stones, gonorrhea, and various eye and skin diseases. An advertising brochure claimed \\"sickness among the year 'round residents is practically an unknown thing.\\"\\"Red Boiling Springs\\" promotional booklet, 1924. As the resort grew, it became the stopping point for minstrel shows, circuses and other entertainments to a far greater degree than typical for towns of its small size. The town boasted a number of \\"diversions\\": bowling alleys, tennis courts, shuffle board, croquet, a ballroom, swimming pools, a small golf course, theatre, and an amusement park. The hotels also provided picnics and barbecues. Dancing was the most popular nighttime activity, and many of the hotels had their own orchestras for nightly ballroom dances. String bands also frequented the town, playing mostly at the many taverns scattered around the town's periphery.Denning, thesis, p. 36. Decline Red Boiling Springs park Several factors contributed to the town's decline as a major resort. One was a general loss of confidence and interest in the purportedly curative powers of mineral waters by Americans as the 20th century progressed. A new highway system made it easier for people to travel, but it also meant they could travel to other places as well, such as the state parks that were opening. Those who had promoted tourism and the mineral resorts had retired or died and the next generation was not as interested. Some of the hotels had been left in the hands of managers that did not reinvest the profits in the upkeep of the buildings. A number of the hotels burned and were not rebuilt. The townspeople were hesitant to support tourism. The area's general remoteness began to work against it; this was greatly aggravated by World War II and the resultant gasoline rationing. Tourism focus shifted within Tennessee to more highly developed areas such as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. By the time the postwar period had arrived, most of the hotels had closed and the area was a shell of its former self. There was a slight rebirth during the 1950s. The town was incorporated on April 27, 1953. A booster club was formed, two of the hotels were restored and new attractions were added. A drive-in billed as the only one of its kind in Middle Tennessee outside of Nashville joined the local theatre. By the early '60s only five hotels remained, then, by the end of the decade, it was back down to three. One of the hotels was lost to a fire and a nursing home bearing the name of the original hotel was later erected on the cleared site. 1969 flood At 3:30 AM on the morning of June 23, 1969, raining began. Area newspapers reported that by 6:00 AM, the water had risen \\"about 5 feet above maximum flood level\\". In six hours the entire Salt Lick Valley was under water. An unofficial report stated that 10 inches of rain fell in 6 hours.Retrieved 2008-05-28 Overall, 15 businesses and 35 houses were either heavily damaged or destroyed, and a Trailways bus had been swept approximately 500 feet into a steel-concrete bridge. Whole houses and many cars floated through town. Two young girls, sisters, Renah Louise Bilbrey, 8, and Jennifer Rae Bilbrey, 2, daughters of Grady and Frances Bilbrey, were killed in the flood. Both girls were found by search parties composed of their relatives and town residents. The girls' uncle was one of the members to find both bodies. One was not found until seven days later after being swept 4 miles downstream. A brother, 5, survived and the Bilbreys went on to have two more children, including a daughter. An aunt who aided in the search later died during childbirth as a result of hepatitis contracted from the flood waters. In the years following this, several sites including a town park, a housing development, and a dam built to prevent another such flood from happening again were named in memory of the two sisters. Many years later, Nashville Channel 4 WSMV meteorologist Nancy VanCamp and team produced a documentary that recounted the events and the family of the girls were interviewed. The documentary resulted in an Emmy award to the station.family members Two songs about the tragedy were produced, one of which, \\"The Tragedy of Red Boiling Springs\\", garnered extensive airplay and resulted in a hit for the producers, artists, and writers involved. The Bilbrey family refused to have anything to do with either record and would not accept any proceeds resulting from sales. The graduating class of the elder sister, Renah, dedicated the annual yearbook to her memory.Family members, surviving child State and Federal grant money aided businesses, built watershed dams and help the townsfolk rebuild. One dam was named in memory of the young victims. By the late 1970s the town began to revisit its history in earnest with an eye to marketing it a tourist destination again, if only on a small scale. Two covered bridges were built, and park lands were developed. Later, a library was built on the site of a former hotel. A park was constructed in the early 2000s close to the site of the home of the young victims and was named in their memory. A dedication ceremony honored the surviving family members and rescue workers who aided in finding their bodies.direct source, KJ Bilbrey Brown, sister Present day At the beginning of the 21st century, a large water bottling plant was built on the outskirts of town by Nestl√©, where water is bottled from Bennet Hill Springs, a source of Freestone water. Ironically, the plant removes all the natural minerals from the water by reverse osmosis and later adds a specific mixture of minerals to give it a consistent taste. The old hand pumps that stood on public land were made inoperable because of liability issues that could occur. The hand pumps can still be seen on private property around town, and some people still believe in the curative powers of the mineral waters. , three of the historic hotels were in operation, with The Armour's Hotel still offering a full complement of steam treatment, mineral tub baths, and therapeutic massage. One of the surviving hotels has undergone several name changes and two fires, the first fire in the 1920s completely destroyed the structure but it was rebuilt, the second fire in the 1990s destroyed one wing, which was also rebuilt. Names it has operated under include the Cloyd Hotel and it is currently known as The Thomas House. The hotel gained notoriety in the early half of the 2010s when it became the subject of the popular SyFy channel television program Ghost Hunters.

Located east of Memphis, it is a regional center of trade for West Tennessee. Its total population was 65,211 at the 2010 census and 67,191 in the 2019 Census estimate. Jackson is the primary city of the Jackson, Tennessee metropolitan area, which is included in the Jackson-Humboldt, Tennessee combined statistical area. Jackson is Madison County's largest city, and the second- largest city in West Tennessee next to Memphis. It is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court's courthouse for West Tennessee, as Jackson was the major city in the west when the court was established in 1834. In the antebellum era, Jackson was the market city for an agricultural area based on cultivation of cotton, the major commodity crop. Beginning in 1851, the city became a hub of railroad systems ultimately connecting to major markets in the north and south, as well as east and west. This was key to its development, attracting trade and many workers on the railroads in the late 19th century with the construction of railroads after the American Civil War. Through the 1960s, the city was served by 15 passenger trains daily, but industry restructuring reduced such service and caused the loss of jobs. The economy has adjusted to new businesses, with major manufacturing in the area. According to the 2017 census estimate, Jackson was the eighth-largest city in Tennessee. Geography Jackson is located at (35.633132, ‚àí88.820805). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. History=Early settlement Bird's eye view of the city of Jackson, Madison County, Tennessee 1870. This area was occupied by the historic Chickasaw people at the time of European encounter. They were pushed out by European-American settlers under various treaties with the United States, in actions authorized by the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and ratified by the US Senate. European-American settlement of Jackson began along the Forked Deer River before 1820, primarily by migrants from eastern areas of the Upper South, such as Virginia and Kentucky. Originally named Alexandria, the city was renamed in 1822 to honor General Andrew Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812. He was later elected as President of the United States. The City of Jackson was founded by an act of the Tennessee General Assembly, passed in 1821, entitled an \\"act to establish a seat of justice for Henry, Carroll, Henderson and Madison Counties.\\" The act required of land to be deeded to the commissioners. The commissioners chosen by the Legislature were Sterling Brewer and James Fentress. The places considered for the seat of justice were Alexandria, Golden's Station, and Jackson. The larger portion of the settlers at that time were living on Cotton Grove Road, and as Jackson was closer to them than either of the other settlements, this settlement was determined to be the more suitable site for the seat of justice. At the time of the second Tennessee State Constitution in 1834, when the Tennessee Supreme Court was established, Memphis had not yet been developed. The county seat of Jackson was the most significant city in West Tennessee and this was designated as a site for the State Supreme Court in this part of the state. The city of Jackson did not establish public elections until 1837, with a Board of Aldermen elected at-large. From 1854 to 1915, Jackson had a Board of Aldermen of eight members elected from four districts, each with two members elected at-large. Free people of color and freedmen were not allowed to vote in the state until after passage of federal constitutional amendments following the Civil War that granted them citizenship and suffrage. This area was initially developed for agricultural purposes, especially cotton plantations for producing the chief commodity crop of the Mississippi Valley and Deep South. Cotton plantations were dependent on the labor of African-American slaves and thousands were brought into the area as it was developed. As county seat, Jackson was a trading town and retail center for surrounding agricultural areas. But developing as a railroad hub of several lines was most important to Jackson's industrial and population growth, from 1852 on for the next hundred years. Civil War through 19th century In 1862 Tennessee came under the control of Union forces and was occupied until General Ulysses S. Grant decided to concentrate his efforts to the South. Between December 11, 1862 and January 1, 1863, an engagement at Jackson occurred during Confederate Brigadier General Nathan Bedford Forrest's expedition into West Tennessee. Forrest wanted to disrupt the rail supply line to Grant's army, which was campaigning along the route of the Mississippi Central Railroad. If Forrest destroyed the Mobile & Ohio Railroad running south from Columbus, Kentucky through Jackson, Grant would have to curtail or halt his operations altogether. Forrest's 2,100-man cavalry brigade crossed the Tennessee River on December 17. Grant ordered a soldier concentration at Jackson under Brigadier General Jeremiah C. Sullivan and sent a cavalry force under Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll. Forrest's command defeated the Union cavalry in Lexington, Tennessee on December 18. As Forrest continued his advance the following day, Sullivan ordered Colonel Adolph Englemann to take a small force northeast of Jackson. At Old Salem Cemetery, acting on the defensive, Englemann's two infantry regiments repulsed a Confederate mounted attack, then withdrew a mile closer to the city. The fight amounted to no more than a feint and show of force intended to hold Jackson's Union defenders in position, while two mounted Confederate columns destroyed railroad track to both the north and south of the town, then returned. Forrest withdrew from the Jackson area to attack Trenton and Humboldt after this mission was accomplished.Battles in Tennessee As a result of the destruction of the railroad, Grant abandoned his plans to invade Mississippi from Tennessee in favor of an attack on Vicksburg, Mississippi, for control of the river. Federal troops left Jackson and moved to Memphis, which became a major center for Union troops for the duration of the war. Forrest returned to Jackson in early 1864 and used the city as his headquarters as his forces attacked Federal positions in northern West Tennessee and Fort Pillow, a Union position on the Mississippi north of Memphis. Forrest returned to Jackson again later that year in preparation for an attack on Federal river traffic on the Tennessee River east of Paris and the supply base at Johnsonville. With the emancipation of slaves and passage of US constitutional amendments granting suffrage to African-American males, Jackson's freedmen and formerly free people of color began to participate in the political system. But secret vigilante groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, developed chapters in Tennessee and throughout the South that intimidated and attacked freedmen in order to exercise white supremacy. As Reconstruction continued, they worked to suppress the black Republican vote. In the late 19th century, the white-dominated state legislature passed several laws that made voter registration and voting more difficult, including payment of a poll tax, and resulted in reducing voting by many blacks and poor whites. After Reconstruction, white violence increased against blacks. In 1886, Eliza Woods, an African-American woman, was lynched in Jackson after being accused of poisoning and killing her employer, Jessie Woolen. Woolen's husband later confessed to the crime.\\"A Woman Lynched\\", The New York Times, August 20, 1886.Paula J. Giddings. Ida: A Sword Among Lions. Harper Collins, 2009, pp. 117, 152. Two other African Americans were known to have been lynched by whites in Madison County in this period that extended into the early 20th century. 20th century In 1915, Jackson was one of several cities in the state to adopt a commission form of government, changing its electoral scheme to at-large voting citywide for three designated positions: a mayor and two commissioners. This resulted in a government dominated by the majority, with no representatives elected from minority populations. (Other cities to make this change included Clarksville, Chattanooga, Knoxville and Nashville.) Although the state in 1913 enacted a law enabling cities to adopt the commission form of government independently, Jackson was chartered by the state for this change. The commissioners each were allocated specific responsibilities, for instance, for the school system and city departments. In the late 19th century, the state of Tennessee had already adopted residency requirements, voting process, and poll taxes that sharply reduced the ability of African Americans to register and vote. The City Charter was amended to include run-off elections within two weeks in cases of one candidate not receiving a majority of votes. This created an extra burden on campaigns by less wealthy candidates. In Jackson, the total effect of these changes to the city electoral system was to reduce the ability of African Americans in the 20th century to elect candidates of their choice and to participate in the political system. In 1977 three city residents filed suit against the city in US District Court, in Buchanan v. City of Jackson (1988), (683 F.Supp. 1515), challenging the structure and electoral system of the city government because the at-large voting had diluted the voting power of the city's significant minority of African-American residents. (According to the 1980 Census, the city population was 49,074, of which 16,847, or 34.3%, were black.) Since 1915, no black person had ever been elected to, or served on, the Board of Commissioners. The court found this commission electoral system was found to be discriminatory in effect. Over the decades, the African-American minority was effectively closed out of city government. The case was appealed and affirmed; the defendants ultimately proposed a new system approved in 1988 by the court. By a new city charter, in 1989 the city created a Board of Commission based on nine single-member districts for broader representation.BUCHANAN v. CITY OF JACKSON, 683 F. Supp. 1515 (W.D. Tenn. 1988), Case Text website The mayor is elected at-large. Similar legal challenges to the electoral and city systems in Clarksville and Chattanooga led to changes in their city charters to establish more numerous members of a city council or board of commission, to be elected from single-member districts. As a result, more African-American and women candidates have been elected as representatives from those jurisdictions. The dissolution of the former government in Jackson resulted in the need for an elected city school board, since one of the commissioners had previously managed education. The city commissioners chose to consolidate their school system with that of the Madison County, Tennessee school system in 1990, creating the Jackson-Madison County School Board. This was also done to achieve desegregation goals. The nine-member board is elected from six districts across the county; three districts elect two members each and the other three each elect one member. All members are elected for four-year terms, with elections held on a staggered basis every two years. The demographics of the county in 2012 for major ethnic groups were 60.3% white and 37% African American.\\"Jackson-Madison County School System, Tennessee\\", Ballotpedia In 2008 the school system was still under a court order supervising its desegregation progress.Tennessee Advisory Committee, School Desegregation in Tennessee, to the US Commission on Civil Rights, April 2008 In the post-World War II era, the railroad industry went through restructuring and mergers. (See section below). By the end of 1960s, it sharply reduced passenger service to Jackson; there were related losses of associated industrial jobs supporting the railroads, causing economic problems in the region. The Jackson area has since attracted such major manufacturing companies as Procter & Gamble and Stanley/Black and Decker, and also diversified its economy. It has also Japanese manufacturers, including TBDN and ARJ [Toyota Boshoku], and Pacific Industries [Pacific Industrial Co]. 1999 to present Destroyed dormitory building in February 2008. In 2005 Bodine Aluminum, a 100% Toyota-owned high-volume, die-casting plant, opened in Jackson, providing high-quality industrial jobs. The city had already begun investing in a large fiber network in 2003. In January 2015 Jackson was named a \\"Gig City\\" for the upgrades to its fiber network, which offer Internet speeds up to 1 gigabit per second to private residences. Between 1999 and 2008, several violent tornadoes struck large portions of the city. The McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport was severely damaged in January 1999, a storm that resulted in eleven fatalities. The 1999 tornado also damaged the Riverside Cemetery, where 40 known Confederate soldiers, 140 unknowns, and many families of the founders of Jackson are buried. The cemetery's acres of old trees and many of the statues, monuments, and graves were damaged during the tornado. Parts of the Union University campus were damaged in November 2002. The downtown area was devastated in May 2003 by an F4 tornado, and there were eight deaths. Many dormitories at the Union campus were demolished in a storm in February 2008. On May 1, 2010 a severe thunderstorm hit Jackson, dropping 13 inches of rain in a short period of time. Flash floods destroyed many homes and streets. Railroad history John Luther \\"Casey\\" Jones grave stone Jackson developed rapidly just prior to the Civil War as a railroad junction and maintenance shop for several early railroads, including the Mississippi Central, the Tennessee Central and the Mobile and Ohio lines. Located over seventy miles east of Memphis, Jackson lies along the shortest rail route between Cairo, IL; Jackson, MS (Mississippi's capital); and New Orleans, Louisiana. As the railroad was extended from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, Jackson, Tennessee was perfectly situated as a station along the north-south line; and, to serve as a junction between the north-south line, and lines east and west between Memphis and Nashville, the major cities of West and Middle Tennessee. The first was the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, which began in October 1849 in Mobile, Alabama. The line first entered Jackson in 1851. These tracks were completely destroyed during the Civil War. The line merged with the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad in 1940 to become the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad. The second railroad to enter Jackson was the Mississippi Central & Tennessee. In 1873, the line was contracted and later controlled by the Illinois Central Railroad. On December 29, 1886, the Tennessee Midland Railway received a charter to build a railroad from Memphis, Tennessee to the Virginia state line. The line from Memphis to Jackson was completed on June 1, 1888. In 1893, the Tennessee Midland went into receivership and was sold at foreclosure to the L&N; Railroad. Around 1968 the remainder of the Tennessee Midland was abandoned east of Cordova with the exception of some track in Jackson, Tennessee. That track is now used to deliver goods to Jackson's east and west industrial parks. The Tennessee Midland Railway Company line from Memphis to Jackson was the forerunner of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. This line was often referred to as the \\"NC\\" by locals. Like all other railroads to enter Jackson, it was built with funds subscribed by citizens and investors of Jackson. The first passenger train entered Jackson from Memphis on June 1, 1888. The highly profitable railroad was merged into the Louisville and Nashville Railroad following WWII. Eventually the L&N; was merged into and is now part of CSX Transportation. A charter was granted by the State of Tennessee on August 16, 1910, and construction began on July l, 1911. The first sector extended from Jackson to the station of Tigrett, and by April 20, 1912, of the line were ready for operations. On June 16 the remaining sector was set into service, connecting Dyersburg, Tennessee with Jackson. When the line began operations in 1912, its president was Isaac B. Tigrett, a prominent young banker of Jackson. The railroad became an important local thoroughfare, used to transport much of the produce of the region to market in Jackson and Dyersburg. The Birmingham and Northwestern Railway Company had 4 locomotives, 5 passenger cars, and 92 freight cars. When Isaac B. Tigrett became President of the GM&N; in 1920, he ceased to direct the affairs of the Birmingham and Northwestern Railroad Company. After he became president of the GM&O;, the railroad was purchased and merged to become the Dyersburg branch. During the 1930s through the 1960s, fifteen regularly scheduled passenger trains of the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio, Illinois Central and Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis served the two depots in Jackson. The names of some of those trains were The Rebel, Gulf Coast Rebel, The Sunchaser, The Floridan,'Flashback Miami' June 3, 2015; includes reference to 'Floridan' without a second 'i' http://flashbackmiami.com/2015/06/03/seaboard-railroad/'Official Guide of the Railways,' August 1936, Illinois Central section, additional reference documenting 'Floridan' spelling The Seminole, The City of Memphis, and The City of Miami. Without change of train, one could travel to Memphis, Nashville, Meridian, Montgomery, Mobile, Birmingham, Jacksonville, Daytona, Orlando, Miami, Centralia, Champaign-Urbana, Springfield, Chicago, St. Louis, and New Orleans. With railroad restructuring under Amtrak, passenger service was markedly reduced. The Illinois Central's The City of Miami was the last train stopping in the city, on April 30, 1971.

The population was 126 as of 2010. It is part of the Chattanooga, TN-GA Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Orme is rooted in a coal mining community known as Needmore, which was established in the early 1890s. Mining operations in the valley were slow to develop, however, due to the area's remoteness and lack of adequate means of transportation for the coal. In the late 1890s, Chattanooga businessman Frederick Gates purchased the Needmore mining operations, and began negotiating with the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway to build a branch line into the valley. After some hesitation, this railroad agreed to build the line in 1902.James Dennis Lambert, Jr., \\"Orme, Tennessee, 100th Anniversary: A Centennial View of Her History,\\" South Pittsburg Historic Preserveration Society website, August 2002. Retrieved: September 25, 2016. Entrance to a mine at Orme in the early 1910s After negotiating the construction of the branch line, Gates sold the Needmore operation to Richard Orme Campbell (1860-1912), who renamed the operation the \\"Campbell Coal and Coke Company\\". He renamed the town of Needmore after his son, who was also named Richard Orme Campbell (the name \\"Orme\\" was the maiden name of the elder Campbell's mother, Virginia Orme).\\"Richard Orme Campbell, National Cyclopaedia of American Biography (J.T. White, 1916), pp. 175-176. Along with mining facilities, Campbell built a commissary, an office building, workers' cottages, schools, and a hotel. Within a few years, the town had grown to several thousand residents. Campbell sold the Orme operation in 1905, and the new owners renamed the company, \\"Battle Creek Coal and Coke Company.\\" By 1912, the operation consisted of four drift mines,William McIntyre, Jr., \\"Battle Creek Mine, Tenn.,\\" Colliery Engineer, Vol. 33 (December 1912), pp. 237-239. some reaching high up the walls of the Cumberland Plateau. Mule-drawn rail cars carried the mined coal to the mine entrances, where it was transferred to a locomotive. The locomotive then carried the coal to an upper tipple, which in turn transferred it to a lower tipple. At its height, the mining operation was shipping 1,000 tons of coal per day out of the valley. The operation was known for its \\"good coal, inaccessibility, irregular stratification, and consequently difficult mining.\\" Following a miners' strike in 1939, major mining operations in Orme were shut down. The railroad company removed the rails, and the metal was used for ongoing World War II efforts. Afterward, Orme declined. The hotel closed in 1945, the school closed in 1961, and the post office closed in 1970.

These sources dried up to only 5,000 gallons/day (19,000 liters/day), not enough to pressurize the supply lines to the town's residents.

In his words: \\"It's not a short-term solution. It is THE solution.\\" The connection would be via a pipe between the two towns, paid for by an emergency grant of $377,590 from the USDA.

The town occupies most of the Tennessee portion (i.e., the northern end) of Doran's Cove, a narrow valley surrounded on the north, east, and west by the Cumberland Plateau. Most of Orme's public buildings and residences are concentrated in a small stretch of bottomland along Dry Creek, the valley's primary drainage. The walls of the plateau rise nearly a thousand feet in all directions, the exception being a relatively narrow gap that opens to the south. South Pittsburg, Tennessee, lies across the plateau to the east, and Bridgeport, Alabama, lies to the southeast. Russell Cave National Monument lies just across the state line to the south. A single paved road, Orme Road, connects Orme to Jackson County, Alabama. To reach Orme via paved road from Tennessee generally requires driving along U.S. Route 72 from South Pittsburg southward into Alabama, and following county roads 75 and 98 northward through Doran's Cove (the latter highway becomes Orme Road at the state line).

History What is now South Pittsburg remained a primarily agrarian area until the construction of a branch line of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad (later the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway) into the Sequatchie Valley in the late 1860s. Small-scale mining operations began during this period. When a post office was opened in 1869, the community was called Battle Creek Mines.Dennis Lambert, \\"The Birth of South Pittsburg, Tennessee,\\" South Pittsburg Historic Preservation Society website, c. 2004. Retrieved: 18 August 2015. In the mid-1870s, several British investors formed the Southern States Coal, Iron and Land Company, in hopes of establishing a major industrial operation in the Sequatchie Valley. The company dispatched James Bowron to investigate the area for potential town and manufacturing sites. Bowron chose the Whitwell and Victoria areas in northwestern Marion County for the company's coal mining and coke production operations, and the Battle Creek Mines area as the company's iron production center and commercial hub. The latter site was chosen primarily for its immediate access to both the railroad and the Tennessee River. On May 23, 1876, the name of the Battle Creek Mines post office was changed to \\"South Pittsburg\\" in hopes that the city would one day grow to become a great iron manufacturing center like Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The death of Bowron in 1877, along with several other key company officials within a short period of time, halted the Southern States operation. In 1882, the company was purchased by the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TCI), which resumed the development of the mining and iron production facilities. In 1886, the townsite of South Pittsburg was purchased by Nashville banker William Duncan, who helped organize the South Pittsburg City Company in December of that year. The town was platted by F.P. Clute, and incorporated in 1887 with John G. Kelly as its first mayor. This revival of the city's development roughly coincided with the completion of two large blast furnaces and a foundry, allowing large-scale iron production to begin. South Pittsburg experienced rapid growth in the 1890s, but struggled after TCI relocated to Alabama. In 1906, the Dixie-Portland Cement Company (later Penn-Dixie) established a cement production center in what was then known as the Deptford area, south of South Pittsburg. The company hired New York insurance executive Richard Hardy to oversee the development of a company town, which became known as \\"Richard City\\" after Hardy. After becoming president of the company in 1914, Hardy initiated a major expansion project in Richard City. Many of the town's houses, churches, businesses, and even utility poles were constructed using the company's cement. The plant operated until 1980, when Penn-Dixie went out of business. The site was later purchased by Vulcan Materials.Kelly Wilkerson, \\"Richard City,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Retrieved: 18 August 2015.

Whitwell was incorporated as a city in 1956, having grown as a mining town due to the abundance of coal in the mountains near the town. In 1981 there was a major mining accident when 13 coal miners were killed in an explosion. A full list of the names of those killed in the mine explosion is on a monument at Whitwell High School.

Paper Clips Project  Whitwell has become renowned for the Paper Clips Project, a Holocaust memorial and educational project, that was carried out by children of the local middle school starting in 1998. A subsequent documentary was made about the children's achievement. This project started because students at the local middle school wanted to visually grasp how much six million was. The students started collecting paper clips, one for every Jew who was murdered in the Holocaust during World War II. This project soon attracted media attention and international support. Many Jewish notables sent paper clips representing lost members of their families. The children collected well over the number of paper clips they wanted (11 million, representing all noncombatant prisoners---Jew and Gentile---killed by the Nazis). The total collected number of paper clips now stands between ten and fifty million. This number is approximately equal to the total number of war deaths between 1939‚Äì1945. The rail car that appears in the movie is original rolling stock, actually used to transport Jews to the concentration camps. This rail car is located at the Whitwell Middle School. The Middle School routinely hosts Holocaust survivors as well as other guest speakers on the subject of the Holocaust. Notable person A notable former resident of Whitwell is artist Jon Coffelt. He was born in Dunlap, raised in Griffith Creek, and now lives and works in New York City.

History The area in which Lewisburg and Marshall County is located was long occupied by various cultures of indigenous peoples. Historic Native Americans were here when French, Spanish and English explorers entered the area. Revolutionary War veterans were given land grants in this area by the State of North Carolina for services rendered during the war followed in the 1780s. North Carolina still claimed this territory under its colonial charter, but later gave up that claim and Tennessee became an independent state. Marshall County, named in honor of the young nation's first Supreme Court Chief Justice and noted American jurist, John Marshall, was established by an act of the Tennessee General Assembly in 1836. The act which created the county specified that the county seat be named Lewisburg to commemorate the deeds of frontier explorer Meriweather Lewis. He had been leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the Louisiana Territory soon after its purchase. Lewisburg was incorporated in 1837, on a site of donated for civic purpose. There was white violence against freedmen during and after Reconstruction, extending into the early 20th century. Some lynchings of African Americans took place at the Marshall County Courthouse in Lewisburg during the period of highest violence around the turn of the 20th century. Two unidentified black men were lynched without trial in Lewisburg on August 5, 1903.Lynching Victims in Tennessee, America's Black Holocaust Museum; accessed 25 May 2018 Another account said that John Milligan (Millikin) and John L.

Until 1925, Lewisburg served the area principally as a trading and shipping center for its livestock and farm produce. As the county seat, it was a center of the justice system and active as a retail center for the area farmers. The world headquarters of the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association has been based in Lewisburg since 1939. The Tennessee Walking Horse, a gaited breed, is considered to have been developed in Middle Tennessee, and the area is still a center of breeding and exhibitions for this horse.

The self- proclaimed \\"mule capital of the world,\\" Columbia annually celebrates the city- designated Mule Day each April. Columbia and Maury County are acknowledged as the \\"Antebellum Homes Capital of Tennessee\\"; the county has more antebellum houses than any other county in the state. The city is home to one of the last two surviving residences of James Knox Polk, the 11th President of the United States; the other is the White House.  History  The James K. Polk Home in Columbia is the only one of President Polk's private homes that is still standing A year after the organization of Maury County in 1807 by European Americans, Columbia was laid out in 1808 and lots were sold. The original town, on the south bank of the Duck River, consisted of four blocks. The town was incorporated in 1817. For decades during the antebellum years, Columbia was the county seat and Maury County was the richest county in the state, based on its agricultural production. Planters used enslaved African Americans as workers to cultivate and process the commodity crops of tobacco and hemp. They also raised high-quality, blooded livestock. Many planters also bred and trained thoroughbred race horses, bringing this custom with them from Bluegrass country in central Kentucky. During the Reconstruction era, the state of Tennessee had competitive voting. But in the late 19th century, the white-dominated, conservative Democratic state legislature passed laws to disenfranchise African Americans by raising barriers to voter registration. This political exclusion largely continued deep into the 20th century, and adversely affected racial relations for decades in Columbia and Maury County, and other parts of the state. Columbia was the site of Jackson College. This facility was burned during the Civil War and did not reopen. The county had five documented lynchings; these occurred in the 20th century.Lynching in America, 2nd edition , Supplement by County, p. 6 In 1924 a black man was shot and killed in the courthouse after his sentence was commuted,, by the brother of his alleged victim. In 1927 and 1933, young black men were lynched in Maury County for alleged assaults against white women; the first was being held as a suspect when he was lynched.Dorothy Beeler, \\"Race Riot in Columbia, Tennessee/ February 25-27, 1946\\", Tennessee Historical Quarterly Vol. 39, No. 1 (Spring 1980), pp. 49-61, accessed 6 March 2015 In 1933 Cordie Cheek, a 19-year-old black man, was falsely accused of raping a white girl. After a grand jury declined to indict him, he was abducted from Nashville by white men including law officials, and taken back to Columbia. There he was castrated and lynched by a white mob. During World War II phosphate mining and the chemical industry expanded in Columbia to support the war effort. By the 1940 census, the total city population was 10,579; more than 3,000 were African American. After the war, chemical plants were a site of labor unrest between white and black workers, both in terms of competition for work and efforts to unionize. Veterans sought to re-enter the economy, and Black veterans resisted being pushed back into second-class status after having fought in the war. In the postwar period, Black veterans often became leaders in the growing campaign for civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s throughout the state. Today, the county is a heritage tourism destination, because of its numerous historic sites. Attractions include the President James K. Polk Home, the Columbia Athenaeum, Mule Day, and nearby plantation homes. Historic American Buildings Survey, W.

Pleasant Pike (Columbia highway). Master builder Nathan Vaught started construction in 1838, and the mansion and other buildings were completed in 1839, for Gideon Johnson Pillow (1806-1877) on land inherited from Gideon Pillow. Columbia is the location of Tennessee's first two-year college, Columbia State Community College, established in 1966. President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the new campus on March 15, 1967. On June 26, 1977, 42 people, including 34 inmates, died in a fire at the Maury County Jail. Rescue efforts were complicated by the fact that each cell required a separate key, and the dispatcher reportedly had difficulty locating the keys. The fire was reportedly intentionally started by a juvenile inmate. Columbia race riot of 1946 On February 25, 1946, a civil disturbance, dubbed \\"the Columbia Race Riot,\\" broke out in the county seat. It was covered by the national press as the first \\"major racial confrontation\\" following World War II. In a fight instigated by William \\"Billy\\" Fleming, a white repair apprentice, James Stephenson, a black Navy veteran, fought back and wounded him. Stephenson had been on the boxing team and refused to accept being hit. Stephenson had accompanied his mother to the repair store, which had mistakenly sold a radio which she had left for repair to John Calhoun Fleming, Billy's father. A white mob gathered during the altercation. The senior Fleming convinced the sheriff to charge both Stephensons with attempted murder. Rumors were rife that the Stephensons would be lynched. As whites gathered in the square talking about the incident, blacks armed themselves and planned to defend their business district, which they referred to as \\"the Bottom\\". It started about one block south of the square. Later that evening whites drove around the area, shooting randomly into it; they referred to the neighborhood as \\"Mink Slide.\\" Armed black men turned out some street lights and shot out others, patrolling the area for defense. Four policemen who entered the area were wounded and retreated, increasing white rage. Worried that the small police force could not control the mob, the mayor called in the State Guard and the sheriff called in the state Highway Patrol that night. The Guard resisted Patrol requests to arm the white mob. In an uncoordinated effort, the Highway Patrol entered the district early the next morning before a planned time; they provoked more violence and destroyed numerous businesses. Eventually through the next day, they and the State Guard rounded up more than 100 blacks as suspects in the police shootings. No whites were charged at that point. Two black men were killed and a third wounded, in what the police said was an escape attempt while the Highway Patrol was trying to take them from the jail to the sheriff's office.Gilbert King, Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America, HarperCollins, 2012, pp. 8 and 14 The State Guard was withdrawn on March 3. Twenty-five black men were eventually charged with attempted murder of the four policemen. Another six were charged with lesser crimes, as were four white men. The main attorney defending Stephenson and other men in the case was Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP. He worked with Z. Alexander Looby, who was based in Nashville but associated with the national legal team, and Maurice Weaver, a white civil rights lawyer from Chattanooga, Tennessee. Marshall asked for a change of venue, hoping to get the trial moved to Nashville or another major city. The judge agreed to move the trial only to nearby Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. Local residents there were unhappy to be involved in the controversial case. Marshall and his team achieved acquittal from an all-white jury for all but two men. The prosecution dropped their charges against these men, as they believed the convictions would be overturned on appeal. The Stephensons were never tried, nor were four whites charged with murder, nor were several blacks. Of two black men tried for murder, only Loyd Kennedy was convicted in his trial of 1947. The NAACP continued a publicity campaign about these events, which were also covered by national media. The case gained much attention on the issue of civil rights for African Americans in the United States. The NAACP and other organizations put pressure on President Harry S. Truman to take action to improve the situation. He appointed a President's Committee on Civil Rights, which issued its report in October 1947. In 1948 Truman directed integration of the Armed Services by Executive Order 9981, as a result of the report and his consultation with black leaders. Marshall was later appointed as the first black United States Supreme Court justice. Geography The Old Columbia Dam is a concrete gravity dam constructed during the 1930s, before TVA.

It is the county seat of McMinn County and the principal city of the Athens Micropolitan Statistical Area has a population of 53,569, which is part of the larger Chattanooga-Cleveland-Athens Combined Statistical Area. The city is located almost equidistantly between the major cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga. The population was 13,458 at the 2010 census and 14,030 at the 2020 census. The population of the zipcode area is at 23,726 History=Early history and Civil War The Samuel Cleage House outside of Athens, set on the site of McElhaney and Sons Nursery, built in the 1820s The Cherokee were living in McMinn County at the time of the arrival of the first Euro-American explorers. The Athens area was situated nearly halfway between the Overhill Cherokee villages of Great Tellico to the north in Monroe County and Great Hiwassee along the Hiwassee River to the south. In 1819, the Cherokee signed the Calhoun Treaty, selling the land north of the Hiwassee (including all of modern McMinn County) to the United States. McMinn County was organized on November 13, 1819 at the home of John Walker in what is now Calhoun. The Native American village, Pumpkintown (a corruption of Potemkin town), was located on a farm about two miles east of present-day Athens. It is sometimes incorrectly identified as a forerunner of Athens. Athens was laid out and chosen as the county seat in 1822.C. Stephen Byrum, McMinn County (Memphis, Tenn: Memphis State University Press, 1984), 5-9, 20. The name \\"Athens\\" may have been chosen due to perceived topographical similarities to Athens, Greece.Bill Akins, \\"City of Athens - History.\\" Retrieved: November 27, 2007. By 1834, the population of Athens had grown to over 500.Byrum, McMinn County, 21. Prominent early settlers included William Henry Cooke, who operated an iron forge near modern Etowah, and Samuel Clegg (or Cleage), a construction entrepreneur. Jesse Mayfield, whose descendants founded Mayfield Dairy Farms, arrived in the early 1820s.Byrum, McMinn County, 11-13. The Hiwassee Railroad received a charter in the mid-1830s to build a railroad connecting Knoxville, Tennessee and Dalton, Georgia. The railroad began construction in 1837, although financial and legal problems delayed its completion until 1851. In 1836, General John Wool arrived in Athens to help coordinate the Cherokee Removal. Although initially voluntary, the operation became a forced removal in 1838 when many Cherokee refused to leave. The removal culminated in the forced march west that became known as the Trail of Tears. Wool set up his headquarters at the Bridges Hotel, which was located across the street from the McMinn County Courthouse.Information obtained from the McMinn County Heritage Book Committee marker at the Bridges Hotel site (c. 1997). Information accessed: November 26, 2007. McMinn County was divided during the American Civil War. The well-established railroad brought numerous pro- secessionist and anti-secessionist speakers to the county, including Andrew Johnson, Horace Maynard, John Bell, and William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow. In 1861, McMinn County voted against secession by a narrow 1,144-904 margin. The county sent 12 units to the Union army and 8 units to the Confederate army.

In 1887, several investors established the Athens Mining and Manufacturing Company with plans to convert the town into a model industrial community and initiate large-scale mining operations in the area. Textile mills, flour mills, and timber mills dominated the county's industry by the late 19th century, complemented by furniture and appliance factories in the 1920s.Byrum, McMinn County, 40-60. In 1946, several McMinn County World War II veterans ran for local office in hopes of removing a county government deemed corrupt. On August 1, local authorities locked themselves in the county jail along with the ballot boxes. Suspecting foul play, the veterans armed themselves and assembled on a hill across the street from the jail. After an exchange of gunfire, the county authorities surrendered. The ballots were counted, and the veterans' ticket was elected, ending the Battle of Athens.Information obtained from Tennessee Historical Commission marker 2A 102 in Athens, Tennessee.

The population was 1,785 in 2020 History In 1857, businessman John Dixon established the Eureka Cotton Mills near what is now Englewood where they used regionally- grown cotton to produce yarn. The small mill community that developed around the mill became known as Eureka Mills. By 1875, Elisha Brient, a partner of Dixon, and several of Brient's relatives had acquired Eureka Cotton Mills, and in 1894 the Brients renamed the town of Eureka Mills \\"Englewood\\".Jenny Burney, \\"Englewood Mills\\". Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture (Nashville, Tenn.: Rutledge Hill Press, 1998), pp. 256-257. The name was suggested by Nancy Chestnutt, a sister-in-law of James Brient, who thought the area resembled the English forests of the Robin Hood tales she had read about as a child.C. Stephen Byrum, McMinn County (Memphis, Tenn.: Memphis State University Press, 1984), pp. 48-50. Englewood in 1907 In the late 19th century, the Brients began building shops and gristmills approximately northeast of their milltown at a railroad stop called Tellico Junction, where the Atlanta, Knoxville & Northern Railroad (which roughly followed modern U.S. 411) intersected the Tellico Railroad (which connected Athens and Tellico Plains). The Brients also expanded their Englewood operation, establishing a flour and feed mill in partnership with J.W. Chestnutt. In 1907, the entire Englewood operation was moved to Tellico Junction to take advantage of the railroad. The following year, Tellico Junction was renamed Englewood and the original milltown subsequently became known as \\"Old Englewood\\". Display at the Englewood Textile Museum In 1917, Chestnutt formed the Englewood Manufacturing Company, which built a hosiery mill at Englewood. Englewood grew to include housing for 300 workers, and had its own company stores, sawmill, and school. The tenement section associated with the Eureka Cotton Mill became known as \\"Yellow Top\\", the section associated with the hosiery mill became known as \\"Socktown\\", and the section associated with the flour mill was called \\"Onion Hill\\". Women worked at the mills in large numbers, mainly as weavers, while most supervisory positions were held by men. During the Great Depression, the Englewood mills were forced to close, and many of the town's residents joined various federal work programs. During World War II, the Eureka Cotton Mill was refurbished by the United National Clothing Center, which made clothing for donations to wartorn countries. Several mills and factories established operations at Englewood over subsequent decades, but most had shut down by the late 1990s. The last of the Englewood mills, Allied Hosiery, closed its doors in 2008.McMinn County Mill Shuts Down, Leaving 45 Jobless. WBIR.com, October 6, 2008. Retrieved: July 23, 2009.

The population was 3,490 at the 2010 census. History Etowah was founded in 1906, primarily as a location for a depot on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad (L&N;) line as part of a more direct route between Atlanta and Cincinnati. The etymology of the town name is unclear, but local folklore states that a train crew brought a sign reading \\"Etowah\\" from the Etowah River, and the name stuck. The word Etowah comes from the Muskogee/Creek word ' meaning \\"town.\\" About Etowah, Etowah Chamber of Commerce, May 9, 2008 In 1902, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad announced its plan to build a more direct line from Atlanta to Cincinnati in order to avoid the rugged mountains of North Georgia and East Tennessee bypassing the Great Hiwassee Loop. A point midway between these cities was needed to service cars and change crews, and at the end of 1904, land had been purchased in McMinn County to serve as this site and the city of Etowah was planned. The L & N purchased for the main terminus (depot), maintenance and repair facilities (shops), railroad yards and proposed township to support the railroad workforce. This land was purchased at $10 to $20 per acre and the L&N; set about building a major rail center and the town of Etowah. Out of what was referred to then as a wet swampland, a boomtown sprung up in 1906 with the L & N Depot serving as the hub of the new town's business and social activities. Since then, the City of Etowah has ridden the waves of economic downturns and successes, such as the closing of the L & N shops in the 1930s and the recruitment of new industries, to evolve into the city that it is today. Etowah has seen positive growth in industry and retail over the past decade. In 1974, Etowah residents Doug, Carol and Michael Tullock started the Bargain Barn grocery store, which has since grown into a chain that includes 35 stores in 5 states.

The historic Muscogee settled here, before moving further south. In the late 18th century, the Cherokee settled in this area, displaced from the east and north by European colonial encroachment. Tellico Plains occupies the former site of the Cherokee town of Great Tellico, which was one of the more important towns of the Overhill Cherokee during the late 18th century and before Indian Removal of the 1830s. Two important Native American trails met at Great Tellico, the Trading Path and the Warrior Path, which connected farflung communities.Duncan, Barbara R. and Riggs, Brett H.

During the 1840s, Elisha Johnson, a former mayor of Rochester, New York, purchased a plantation here and built the Tellico River Mansion on his property. With his brother Ebenezer, the former mayor of Buffalo, New York, he purchased the Tellico Iron and Manufacturing Company. During the Civil War, the Confederacy commandeered the iron works for production of munitions. General William Sherman's Union Army soldiers destroyed the Tellico Iron Works. Sherman pardoned Elisha Johnson for his part in supplying the Confederates because of Johnson's northern birth and sympathies. Johnson returned to the North, settling in Ithaca, New York, where he died in 1866.\\"A History of the Mansion on Tellico River\\", The Tellico Plains Mountain Press, accessed 14 September 2011 The nearby Coker Creek was the site of a minor gold rush during the late 1800s.

It is the principal central city of the Clarksville, TN‚ÄìKY metropolitan statistical area, which consists of Montgomery and Stewart counties in Tennessee, and Christian and Trigg counties in Kentucky. The city was founded in 1785 and incorporated in 1807, and named for General George Rogers Clark, frontier fighter and Revolutionary War hero, and brother of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Clarksville is the home of Austin Peay State University; The Leaf-Chronicle, the oldest newspaper in Tennessee; and neighbor to the Fort Campbell, United States Army post. Site of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), Fort Campbell is located about from downtown Clarksville, and spans the Tennessee-Kentucky state line.

History=Before colonization and Native American history Map of portion of the Trail of Tears showing Cherokee removal routes The area now known as Tennessee was first settled by Paleo-Indians nearly 11,000 years ago. The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between first settlement and the time of European contact are unknown, but several distinct cultural phases have been named by archaeologists, including Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian, whose chiefdoms were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee people who inhabited the Tennessee River Valley prior to Cherokee migration into the river's headwaters.\\"Archaeology and the Native Peoples of Tennessee .\\" University of Tennessee, Frank H. McClung Museum. Retrieved: 5 December 2007. When Spanish explorers first visited Tennessee, led by Hernando de Soto in 1539‚àí43, it was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi people. Possibly because of European diseases devastating the native tribes, which would have left a population vacuum, and also from expanding European settlement in the north, the Cherokee moved south from the area now called Virginia. As European colonists spread into the area, the native populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw, and Choctaw. From 1838 to 1839, nearly 17,000 Cherokees were forced to march from \\"emigration depots\\" in Eastern Tennessee, such as Fort Cass, to Indian Territory west of Arkansas. This came to be known as the Trail of Tears; as an estimated 4,000 Cherokees died along the way.Satz, Ronald. Tennessee's Indian Peoples. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1979. Colonization Transylvania Purchase, bought from the Cherokee tribe, stretches from Sycamore Shoals in Elizabethton, Tennessee, to the Wilderness Road into Kentucky. The area around Clarksville was first surveyed by Thomas Hutchins in 1768. He identified Red Paint Hill, a rock bluff at the confluence of the Cumberland and Red Rivers, as a navigational landmark.Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge University Press, 2008) at p. 55-60 In the years between 1771 and 1775, John Montgomery, the namesake of the county, along with Kasper Mansker, visited the area while on a hunting expedition. In 1771, James Robertson led a group of 12 or 13 families involved with the Regulator movement from near where present-day Raleigh, North Carolina now stands. In 1772, Robertson and the pioneers who had settled in northeast Tennessee (along the Watauga River, the Doe River, the Holston River, and the Nolichucky River) met at Sycamore Shoals to establish an independent regional government known as the Watauga Association. However, in 1772, surveyors placed the land officially within the domain of the Cherokee tribe, who required negotiation of a lease with the settlers. Tragedy struck as the lease was being celebrated, when a Cherokee warrior was murdered by a white man. Through diplomacy, Robertson made peace with the Cherokee, who threatened to expel the settlers by force if necessary. In March 1775, land speculator and North Carolina judge Richard Henderson met with more than 1,200 Cherokees at Sycamore Shoals, including Cherokee leaders such as Attacullaculla, Oconostota, and Dragging Canoe. In the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals (also known as the Treaty of Watauga), Henderson purchased all the land lying between the Cumberland River, the Cumberland Mountains, and the Kentucky River, and situated south of the Ohio River in what is known as the Transylvania Purchase from the Cherokee Indians. The land thus delineated, , encompassed an area half as large as the present state of Kentucky. Henderson's purchase was in violation of North Carolina and Virginia law, as well as the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited private purchase of American Indian land. Henderson may have mistakenly believed that a newer British legal opinion had made such land purchases legal. All of present-day Tennessee was once recognized as Washington County, North Carolina. Created in 1777 from the western areas of Burke and Wilkes Counties, Washington County had as a precursor a Washington District of 1775‚Äì76, which was the first political entity named for the Commander-in-Chief of American forces in the Revolution. Founding In 1779, James Robertson brought a group of settlers from upper East Tennessee via Daniel Boone's Wilderness Road. Robertson later built an iron plantation in Cumberland Furnace. A year later, John Donelson led a group of flat boats up the Cumberland River bound for the French trading settlement, French Lick (or Big Lick), that would later be Nashville. When the boats reached Red Paint Hill, Moses Renfroe, Joseph Renfroe, and Solomon Turpin, along with their families, branched off onto the Red River. They traveled to the mouth of Parson's Creek, near Port Royal, and went ashore to settle down. However, an attack by Indians in the summer drove them back. (See Port Royal State Park) Clarksville was designated as a town to be settled in part by soldiers from the disbanded Continental Army that served under General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. At the end of the war, the federal government lacked sufficient funds to repay the soldiers, so the Legislature of North Carolina, in 1790, designated the lands to the west of the state line as federal lands that could be used in the land grant program. Since the area of Clarksville had been surveyed and sectioned into plots, it was identified as a territory deemed ready for settlement. The land was available to be settled by the families of eligible soldiers as repayment of service to their country. The development and culture of Clarksville has had an ongoing interdependence between the citizens of Clarksville and the military. The formation of the city is associated with the end of the American Revolutionary War. During the Civil War a large percent of the male population was depleted due to Union Army victories at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. Many Clarksville men were interned at Union prisoner of war (POW) camps. Clarksville also lost many native sons during World War I. With the formation of Camp Campbell, later Fort Campbell, during World War II, the bonds of military influence were strengthened. Soldiers from Fort Campbell, Kentucky have deployed in every military campaign since the formation of the post. On January 16, 1784, John Armstrong filed notice with the Legislature of North Carolina to create the town of Clarksville, named after General George Rogers Clark. Even before it was officially designated a town, lots had been sold. In October 1785, Col. Robert Weakley laid off the town of Clarksville for Martin Armstrong and Col. Montgomery, and Weakley had the choice of lots for his services. He selected Lot #20 at the northeast corner of Spring and Main Streets. The town consisted of 20 'squares' of 140 lots and 44 out lots. The original Court House was on Lot #93, on the north side of Franklin Street between Front and Second Street. The Public Spring was on Lot #74, on the northeast corner of Spring and Commerce Streets. Weakley built the first cabin there in January 1786, and about February or March, Col. Montgomery came there and had a cabin built, which was the second house in Clarksville. After an official survey by James Sanders, Clarksville was founded by the North Carolina Legislature on December 29, 1785. It was the second town to be founded in the area. Armstrong's layout for the town consisted of 12 four-acre (16,000 m¬≤) squares built on the hill overlooking the Cumberland as to protect against floods. The primary streets (from north to south) that went east-west were named Jefferson, Washington (now College Street), Franklin, Main, and Commerce Streets. North-south streets (from the river eastward) were named Water (now Riverside Drive), Spring, First, Second, and Third Streets. The tobacco trade in the area was growing larger every year and in 1789, Montgomery and Martin Armstrong persuaded lawmakers to designate Clarksville as an inspection point for tobacco. In 1790, Isacc Rowe Peterson staked a claim to Dunbar Cave, just northeast of downtown. When Tennessee was founded as a state on June 1, 1796, the area around Clarksville and to the east was named Tennessee County. (This county was established in 1788, by North Carolina.) Later, Tennessee County would be broken up into modern day Montgomery and Robertson counties, named to honor the men who first opened up the region for settlement. 19th century Clarksville grew at a rapid pace. By 1806, the town realized the need for an educational institution, and it established the Rural Academy that year. It was later replaced by the Mount Pleasant Academy. By 1819, the newly established town had 22 stores, including a bakery and silversmith. In 1820, steamboats begin to navigate the Cumberland, bringing hardware, coffee, sugar, fabric, and glass. The city exported flour, tobacco, cotton, and corn to ports such as New Orleans and Pittsburgh along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Trade via land also grew as four main dirt roads were established, two to Nashville, one crossing the Red River via ferry called the Kentucky Road, and Russellville Road. In 1829, the first bridge connecting Clarksville to New Providence was built over the Red River. Nine years later, the Clarksville-Hopkinsville Turnpike was built. Railroad service came to the town on October 1, 1859 in the form of the Memphis, Clarksville and Louisville Railroad. The line would later connect with other railroads at Paris, Tennessee, and Guthrie, Kentucky. By the start of the Civil War, the combined population of the city and the county was 20,000. Planters in the area depended on slavery for the labor-intensive tobacco industry, one of the major commodity crops. In 1861, both Clarksville and Montgomery County voted unanimously for the state to secede and join the Confederate States of America. The birthplace of Confederate President Jefferson Davis was about 20 miles across the border in Fairview, Christian County, Kentucky. Both sides considered the city to be of strategic importance. Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston set up a defense line around Clarksville expecting a land attack. The city was home to three Confederate States Army camps: * Camp Boone located on U.S. Highway 79 Guthrie Road/(Wilma Rudolph Boulevard), * Camp Burnet * Fort Defiance, Tennessee, a Civil War outpost that overlooks the Cumberland River and Red River and was occupied by both Confederate and Union soldiers. In 2012 the City of Clarksville, Tennessee completed construction of an interpretive/ museum center to chronicle the local chapter in the Civil War.http://www.cityofclarksville.com/parks&rec;/parks/fortdefiance.php The Union sent troops and gunboats down the Cumberland River, and in 1862 captured Fort Donelson, Fort Henry, and Clarksville. On February 17, 1862, the USS Cairo along with another Union Ironclad came to Clarksville and captured the city. There were no Confederate soldiers to contend with because they had left prior to the arrival of the ships. White flags flew over Ft. Defiance and over Ft. Clark. The citizens of the town who could get away, left as well. Before they left, Confederate soldiers tried to burn the railroad bridge that crossed the Cumberland River. The fire did not take hold and was put out before it could destroy the bridge. This railroad bridge made Clarksville very important to the Union. The USS Cairo tied up in Clarksville for a couple of days before moving on to participate in the capture of Nashville. Between 1862 and 1865, the city would shift hands, but the Union retained control of Clarksville, including control of the city's newspaper, The Leaf Chronicle, for three years. Many slaves who had been freed or escaped gathered in Clarksville and joined the Union Army, which created all-black regiments. The 16th United States Colored Infantry regiment was mustered in at Clarksville. Other freed slaves lived along the side of the river in shanties. Reconstruction Clarksville Museum and Cultural Center, built 1898 After the war, the city began Reconstruction, and in 1872, the existing railroad was purchased by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. The city was flourishing until the Great Fire of 1878, which destroyed 15 acres (60,000 m¬≤) of downtown Clarksville's business district, including the courthouse and many other historic buildings. It was believed to have started in a Franklin Street store. After the fire, the city rebuilt. The first automobile rolled into town, drawing much excitement. 20th century Mural painted on the only remaining wall of a building destroyed by the '99 tornado. In 1913, the Lillian Theater, Clarksville's first \\"movie house\\" for motion pictures, was opened on Franklin Street by Joseph Goldberg. It seated more than 500 people. Less than two years later, in 1915, the theater burned down. It was rebuilt later that year. As World War I raged in Europe, many locals volunteered to go, reaffirming Tennessee as the Volunteer State, a nickname earned during the War of 1812, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and other earlier conflicts. Also during this time, women's suffrage was becoming a major issue. Clarksville women saw a need for banking independent of their husbands and fathers who were fighting. In response, the First Women's Bank of Tennessee was established in 1919 by Mrs. Frank J. Runyon. The 1920s brought additional growth to the city. A bus line between Clarksville and Hopkinsville was established in 1922. In 1927 the Austin Peay Normal School was founded, later to develop as Austin Peay State University. In 1928 two more theaters were added, the Majestic (with 600 seats) and the Capitol (with 900 seats). John Outlaw, a local aviator, established Outlaw Field in 1929. With the entry of the United States into World War II, defense investments were made in the area. In 1942 construction started on Camp Campbell (now known as Fort Campbell), the new army base northwest of the city. It was capable of holding 23,000 troops, and as staffing built up, the base gave a huge boost to the population and economy of Clarksville. In 1954, the Clarksville Memorial Hospital was founded along Madison Street. Downtown, the Lillian was renamed the Roxy Theater, and today it still hosts plays and performances weekly. The Roxy has been used as a backdrop for numerous photo shoots, films, documentaries, music videos and television commercials; most notably for Sheryl Crow's Grammy-award-winning song \\"All I Wanna Do.\\" Since 1980, the population of Clarksville has more than doubled, in part because of annexation, as the city acquired communities such as New Providence and Saint Bethlehem. The construction of Interstate 24 north of Saint Bethlehem added to its development potential and in the early 21st century, much of the growth along U.S. Highway 79 is commercial retail. Clarksville is currently one of the fastest-growing large cities in Tennessee. At its present rate of growth, the city will displace Chattanooga by 2020 as the fourth-largest city in Tennessee. Natural disasters On the morning of January 22, 1999, the downtown area of Clarksville was devastated by an F3 tornado, damaging many buildings including the county courthouse. The tornado, wide, continued on a -long path that took it north to Saint Bethlehem. No one was seriously injured or killed in the destruction. Clarksville has since recovered, and has rebuilt much of the damage. Where one building on Franklin Street once stood has been replaced with a large mural of the historic buildings of Clarksville on the side of one that remained. On Sunday, May 2, 2010, Clarksville and a majority of central Tennessee, to include Nashville and 22 counties in total, suffered expansive and devastating floods near the levels of the great flood of 1937. Many businesses along Riverside Drive along the Cumberland River were lost. On the evening of February 24, 2018, the east side of Clarksville was struck by a strong EF-2 tornado. Two injuries were reported and a spokesperson for the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office stated four homes and two duplexes were destroyed, dozens more damaged and 75 vehicles damaged at the nearby Hankook Tire plant. The tornado had maximum sustained winds of , a path length of , and a maximum width of . History of the county courthouse Montgomery County Courthouse The first Montgomery County courthouse was built from logs in 1796 by James Adams. It was located close to the riverbank with the rest of the early town, on the corner of present-day Riverside Drive and Washington Street. It was replaced by a second courthouse built in 1805, and a third in 1806, with land provided by Henry Small. The fourth courthouse was built in 1811, and was the first to be built of brick. It was constructed on the east half of Public Square, with land donated by Martin Armstrong. In 1843, a courthouse was built at a new location on Franklin Street. It was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1878. The sixth courthouse was built between Second and Third Streets, with the cornerstone laid on May 16, 1879. It was designed by George W. Bunting of Indianapolis, Indiana. Five years later, the downtown area was hit by a tornado, which damaged the roof of the courthouse. It was repaired. On March 12, 1900, the structure was ravaged by fire, with the upper floors gutted and the clock tower destroyed. Some citizens wanted the building replaced, but the judge refused and ordered the damage repaired. The courthouse was destroyed by the January 22, 1999 tornado. Residents considered replacing it with a new building, but decided to restore and reconstruct the historic structure. In the process it was upgraded and adapted for use as a county office building. On the fourth anniversary of the disaster, the courthouse was rededicated. In addition to restoring the 1879 courthouse and plazas, the county built a new courts center on the north side for the court operations. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.71%) is covered by water. Clarksville is located on the northwest edge of the Highland Rim, which surrounds the Nashville Basin, and is northwest of Nashville. Fort Campbell North is a census-designated place (CDP) in Christian County, Kentucky. It contains most of the housing for the Fort Campbell Army base. The population was 14,338 at the 2000 census. Fort Campbell North is part of the Clarksville, TN‚ÄìKY Metropolitan Statistical Area. Climate The climate is humid subtropical (K√∂ppen: Cfa) with hot summers and cold winters but interspersed with milder times due to its location between the warmer climates of the Gulf of Mexico and the colder ones of the Midwest. Freezing temperatures are not uncommon but usually the averages are above zero in January (around 2 ¬∞C) and in July can often pass through 25 ¬∞C. Snow in winter is common, but large accumulated amounts are more sporadic, usually the soil is covered by a thin layer during some time of winter. Precipitation is abundant year-round without any major difference, but March tends to have the highest cumulative, by logging sum in average over 1300 mm, especially in the form of rain.

Its population was 9,000. Other cities adopting a board of commission were Chattanooga and Knoxville in 1911, Nashville in 1913, and Jackson, Tennessee in 1915. The result of this change favored election of candidates favored by the majority in each city. It closed out minorities from being able to elect candidates of their choice to represent them in local government.BUCHANAN v. CITY OF JACKSON, 683 F. Supp. 1515 (W.D.

The population was 212 at the 2010 census, a decrease from the 2000 census figure of 244. History Oakdale was originally known as \\"Honeycutt\\" after an early settler, Allen Honeycutt. In the 1880s, the Cincinnati Southern Railway, which connected Chattanooga and Cincinnati, was built through the area, intersecting the vast system of the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad (later the Southern Railway) at Emory Gap near Harriman. Allen Honeycutt donated land to the railroad for construction of a switching point. In 1892, the name of the town was changed to \\"Oakdale\\" after a nearby mining operation.Vera Scarbrough, Regina Headden, \\"A Brief History of Oakdale,\\" Oakdale Alumni Association website, 2008. The Babahatchie Inn The stretch of the Cincinnati Southern from Oakdale to Somerset, Kentucky, involves steep grades that were too difficult for normal late-19th and early-20th century steam-powered locomotives, so a railyard was set up at Oakdale where trains were modified to allow them to make the trek north. By the early 1900s, Oakdale had developed into an important railroad town, with a bank, five general stores, a drugstore, a hardware store, three schools, two churches, six secret societies, and a newspaper.Dickinson, p. 77. The railroad also erected a large hotel, the Babahatchie Inn (\\"Babahatchie\\" was the original name of the Emory River), in 1880, and rebuilt it after it burned in 1892.Calvin Dickinson, Morgan County (Memphis State University Press, 1987), pp 47-48. In 1905, this hotel was converted into one of the nation's largest YMCA facilities,See Monroe, H.

Oakdale initially incorporated in 1887, though the state repealed its charter in 1895. It incorporated again in 1911. The advent of diesel locomotives, which could handle the steep grades without modifications, eliminated the need for the Oakdale railyard, and the town declined in the mid-20th century.Barbara Hayes, \\"Oakdale,\\" An Encyclopedia of East Tennessee (Oak Ridge, Tenn.: Children's Museum of Oak Ridge, 1981), pp. 362-363.

The first settlers arrived in the area shortly thereafter.Donald Todd, \\"Morgan County.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 20 January 2008. Wartburg was founded in the mid-1840s by George Gerding, a land speculator who bought up large tracts of land in what is now Morgan County and organized the East Tennessee Colonization Company with plans to establish a series of German colonies in the Cumberland region. German and Swiss immigrants, seeking to escape poor economic conditions in their home counties, arrived at the site by traveling from New Orleans up the Mississippi and Cumberland rivers to Nashville, and then by ox cart to the Cumberland Plateau. The first of these settlers arrived in the area in 1845, and new groups of immigrants would continue trickling in until 1855.Calvin Dickinson, Morgan County (Memphis State University Press, 1987), pp. 20-25. The new settlement, which had already been platted by East Tennessee Colonization Company agent Friedrich Guenther, was named after Wartburg Castle in Germany. The first six streets were initially named for European cities, but the names were changed within a few years to Rose, Church, Maidenland (now Maiden), Kingston, Mill, and Cumberland. As most immigrants lived on farms outside the town, Wartburg grew slowly. By 1850, the town consisted of Gerding's house and store, a church and school building, a doctor's office, and a few small houses. Early residents included a number of professionals trained in Europe, including architect Carl Rothe, musician Gustav Knabe, painter George Dury,Klaus G. Wurst.
