It was originally a 17th-century Latin hymn, \\"Finita iam sunt proelia\\"; the popular English-language version is an 1861 translation by the English hymnwriter Francis Pott. Text The text of the hymn extols the triumphant Christ whose victory over death and Hell is described as a battle, as related in the Harrowing of Hell. The hymn also makes reference to Christ breaking the chains of hell and to Christ in Majesty. Each verse concludes with an Alleluya! refrain. The strife is o'er, the battle done; Now is the Victor's triumph won; O let the song of praise be sung. Alleluya! Death's mightiest powers have done their worst, And Jesus hath his foes dispersed; Let shouts of praise and joy outburst. Alleluya! On the third morn he rose again Glorious in majesty to reign; O let us swell the joyful strain. Alleluya! He brake the age-bound chains of hell; The bars from heaven's high portals fell; Let hymns of praise his triumph tell. Alleluya! Lord, by the stripes which wounded thee From death's dread sting thy servants free, That we may live, and sing to thee. Alleluya! Tune \\"The strife is o'er\\" has a metre of 8.8.8 with Alleluya, and is it commonly sung to one of two hymn tunes. The most common is the tune , adapted from a 1591 setting of the Gloria Patri by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina from a Magnificat tertii toni. The additional Alleluya refrain was set to music by William Henry Monk. << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/2 \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\relative c << { a2 a a  b1 a2  a( g) fis  a1. \\\\bar\\"\\" fis2 fis fis  fis1 fis2  fis( e) d  e1. \\\\bar\\"\\" \\\\break a2 a a  b1 a2  a( g) fis  a1. \\\\bar\\"\\" r2 a2 d  cis1.  d1. \\\\bar\\".\\" } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { fis,2 fis fis  g1 fis2  fis( b,) d  e1.  d2 d d  d1 d2  d( b) b  cis1.  cis2 fis fis  g1 fis2  fis( b,) d  e1.  r2 d2 fis  e1.  fis1. } >> } ew Lyrics \\\\lyricmode { The2 strife is o'er,1 the2 ba1 -- ttle2 done;1.

It is believed that stone roofs of this type did not emerge until the 16th century and can be traced back to rural models with straw or reed roofs in the rainy regions of Bengal. Description Characteristic features of the Bengal roofs are the broad partial dome-like shape of the roof with runners down the corners. There are several common types of Bengal roofs: the do-chala type has only two hanging roof tips on each side of a roof divided in the middle by a ridge; in the rare char-chala type, the two roof halves are fused into one unit and have a dome-like shape; the double-storey at-chala type has eight roof corners, four on each level. History Such roof forms appeared for the first time in the 16th century.Michell, 156 Early examples are in the Bengali ruined city of Gaur, including the Mausoleum of Fateh Khan, the son of a general of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Distribution Two of the first Mughal buildings with echoes of Bengal roof shapes are the two outbuildings of the private palace (Khas Mahal) built by Shah Jahan around 1635 for two of his daughters in the Red Fort of Agra. A few decades later, his son Aurangzeb constructed the roof of the Pearl Mosque (Moti Masjid) in the Red Fort of Delhi in a similar manner. However, it is especially notable in the architecture of the Rajput princes and merchants of Rajasthan, especially the countless jaroka-the roofs of the 1799 Palace of the Winds (Hawa Mahal) in Jaipur, and the roofs of the houses of rich merchants (havelis) in Jaisalmer, Mandawa and elsewhere. Some of the later memorial pavillons (chattris), built in the 18th and 19th centuries on the incineration sites of the Hindu princes of Jaisalmer and their family members, are also covered with such roofs. Similarly, since the 19th century, the builders of many Sikh temples have used this element as the coronation of their gurdwara, especially Maharaja Ranjit Singh at the Golden Temple of Amritsar.

All 82 museum specimens were collected in the 1940s and 1950s and sat hidden at UCLA's fish collection and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County until they were described by PhD student, Kelsi Rutledge. It likely is similar in ecology and behavior to its closest relative, Pseudobatos productus. This species is found in the Gulf of California and is a fairly small ray, with an intermediate body form between that of a shark and a ray. It is benthic and found in shallow water, spending most of its time on the seafloor in sandy, muddy, coastal regions. It is different from other species due to its morphological characters, including a more narrow head and snout, as well as no spots or scales and thorns between orbits and down its snout. This species garnered a lot of media attention due to the describer, Rutledge, who posted mock birth-announcement style photos with a preserved museum specimen, including Forbes, Spectrum1 News, Smithsonian Magazine.

Turner (born July 25, 1966) is an American professor of economics and education and Souder Family Endowed Chair at the University of Virginia. She also holds appointments in the university's Department of Economics, the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, and the Curry School of Education. She is a faculty research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and a research affiliate at the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan.  Education  Turner received her bachelor of arts in economics with magna cum laude (high honors) from Princeton University in 1989. She earned her doctorate in economics from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in December 1997. While at the University of Michigan, Turner earned the NICHD Trainee title for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the Population Studies Center (1994-1997), and the Regent's Fellowship for Graduate Study (1992-1994).  Career  Turner has been University Professor of Economics and Education at the University of Virginia and the Souder Family Endowed Chair since 2008 and 2014, respectively, having joined the department as an assistant professor of education and economics in 1997. She was Economics Department chair from 2013 until 2016. Turner has been on the Spencer Foundation Major Grants Program Committee (1999-2001), and she was Baccalaureate & Beyond part of the Technical Advisory Committee (2001-2003), AERA (Division L) Program Committee (2005-2006) and the APPAM Program Committee (2006). She was an editor for the Journal of Labour Economics (2012-2014), American Economic Review (2011-2017), and the Education Finance & Policy (2018-present). Turner has also held private sector jobs such as working for J.P. Morgan in New York, NY as a Research Assistant from 1989-1990, and for The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in New York, NY as a Research Associate for the publication \\"The 'Flight from the Arts and Sciences': Trends in Degrees Conferred.\\" from 1990-1992.  Research  Turner is best known for her work on the economics of education in the United States. Her research specializes in the economics of educational policy, and the economics of higher education. Much of Turner's work explores how higher educational opportunities - in colleges and universities - affects the labor market, including the behavioral effects of financial aid policies, such as student aid programs, social insurances, and social welfare programs. Some of her more recent papers include \\"Public Universities: The Supply Side of Building a Skilled Workforce\\", which investigates and analyses the correlation between the decline in state funding per student and educational and research outcomes of schools, and \\"The Right Way to Capture College 'Opportunity'\\", which suggests measurement challenges in identifying whether high educational institutions actually provide opportunities for low-income students. As of today, Turner's research has been cited in 6,966 working and published papers as she continues to analyse economics of education in the United States. She is currently collaborating with John Bound at the Russell Sage Foundation in order to examine the mobility of high-educated workers through the U.S. census data.  Selected work  \\"A Letter and Encouragement: Does Information Increase Postsecondary Enrollment of UI Recipients?\\" (2018) This paper by Andrew Barr and Sarah Turner explores methods that increase enrollment in postsecondary programs. This paper suggests how the dissemination and timing of information sent to Unemployment Insurance (UI) recipients greatly impact their decision to enroll. The enrollment in postsecondary programs is necessary as it increases the chances to future employment, something that is necessary as unemployment rates rise in an undesirable amount in the United States: from 6.5 percent in 2008 to 10 percent in 2009. Regardless of the potential for significant federal financial assistance and the low cost of returning to school for the unemployed, very few do due to its difficult navigation characteristics. The federal government's 2009 initiative called \\"Pell Letter\\", where more than 20 million individuals were sent letters, had an overall impactful effect on enrollments: it increased by 40 percent above the baseline. It suggests how an information nudge or letter intervention can affect one's decision, and in this case, for the better as more individuals choose to enroll in postsecondary institutions. This paper's findings propose how well-coordinated information intervention can be more cost-efficient than raising financial aid policies to increase postsecondary enrollment participation. \\"What High-Achieving Low-Income Students Know About College Options\\" (2015) Turner co-authored this article with Caroline Hoxby. Turner and Hoxby propose a project called Expanding College Opportunities (ECO), which is an intervention designed to test their hypothesis on how the high-achieving low-income students were less likely to apply in postsecondary institutions that have more resource-intensive characteristics as their net prices were harder to ascertain. The ECO intervention presents guidance on how to apply in higher education, its costs, graduation rates, the institution's resources, and no-paperwork fee waivers. Rather than recommending a higher education institution, the ECO intervention gave information with the freedom of choice for the individual. \\"Finishing Degrees and Finding Jobs: U.S. Higher Education and the Flow of Foreign IT Workers\\" (2014) As time passes, technology is improving. For this reason, it is a given that there is a rise of importance to Information Technology (IT) positions as they are slowly coming to dominate, in this case, the United States' economy. There is a tremendous increase in foreign-born in IT occupations from around 15.5 percent in 1993 to around 31.5 percent in 2010. This paper emphasizes the understanding of the role of higher education in the U.S. and immigration policies in this transformation. \\"Student Loans: Do College Students Borrow Too Much - Or Not Enough?\\" (2012) Christopher Avery and Sarah Turner study the benefits and costs of student loans and how it is changing over time. The authors suggest that we are now in the midst of what they call an \\"education bubble\\". They illustrate how current generations are overestimating the economic value that higher education provides, and many of them would be better off saving or using the money in something else. The combination of wage decline in entry-level positions and the tuition increase have placed many students in a no-win situation, pressuring them to make a financial risky decision and apply for student loans. On the other hand, the premium of a postsecondary degree in comparison to a high school degree has nearly doubled in the last three decades. In this paper, Turner and Avery analyze a framework that takes into account student loans (not as an anecdote) as something that can be optimally invested for postsecondary benefits. In enrolling in a college or university, it is most likely the first major capital investment that one will make. For many students, it will be the first time they encounter a formal loan. Similar to buying lottery tickets, we expect large sums of benefits. However, the gains are variable. In particular, one needs to take into account the probability of completing the degree, the field of study, and the earnings differences linked to the different levels of degrees. The observation that colleges and/or universities are good investments for students still leaves many significant unanswered research questions about a student's decision to obtain a degree/diploma and their borrowing behaviour.

Filer was a northern Michigan nineteenth century businessman famous for developing Manistee County and the towns of Manistee, Filer City and Ludington in the state of Michigan. He was a lumber baron, real estate developer, and philanthropist.  Biography  = Early life = Filer was born in Herkimer County in the state of New York on September 17, 1817. He is of Scottish ancestry. = Education = Filer attended local public schools for his initial training. Because of his scholastic interests he soon became a teacher in the New York District School system. = Mid Life = Filer had a particular keen interest in the lumber industry and merchandising early in his adult life. He left New York in 1849 and moved to Racine, Wisconsin. There he became a traveling salesman selling cigars and tobacco. Filer did this occupation for four years. His territory was Wisconsin and Illinois. Filer came to Manistee, Michigan, in the fall of 1853. He became bookkeeper for the accounting firm E. & J. Canfield. Filer had already had been previously employed with the Canfields in Racine. In Manistee he earned $400 per year, which was not enough to support his family. To supplement his income to have enough money for his wife and four children he used his knowledge of medicine to work part-time in the field as a physician. He worked throughout Manistee County and the surrounding counties. Filer & Sons Mill in 1882 Filer saved up enough money by 1858 to buy property. First he bought some land containing timber and then a half-interest in the Batchelder mill property that included a sawmill. He was successful in operating his half of the sawmill business and eventually bought out the other half-interest. Success in operating the Batchelder mill he owned outright gave him the opportunity to buy additional surrounding land containing timber. Filer then bought the McVickar estate in 1862. At this point the land he owned was around two-thirds of the present day city of Manistee. Filer established the firm D. L. Filer & Sons in 1866. His sons names were Delos W. Filer and E. Golden Filer. He sold his interest in the land encompassing the future Manistee area to the firm. The firm also bought 2,500 acres of land three miles from Manistee at the south end of Manistee Lake. It contained mostly timber. Here they built a double circular sawmill in 1867 under the name of the Filer lumber mill. It was located at the mouth of the Little Manistee River that flows into Manistee Lake. Part of the acreage was platted and became Filer City, a suburb of Manistee. Filer was a founding father of the city of Manistee through the sawmill firm. He donated land and money for building public buildings and churches to help develop the town. The management of the sawmill firm was done mostly by Filer's sons. The sawmill was eventually updated to produce 100,000 feet of lumber, 250,000 shingles, and 50,000 lath daily. The Filer & Sons lumber mill at Filer City went out of business in 1914 after using up all their timber.Filer's mill shuts down = Later life = Filer moved to Ludington in 1868. He became one of the owners of Pere Marquette Lumber Company that officially organized in 1869. The other owners of the lumber company were Edward A. Foster and Luther H. Foster both of Ludington, John Mason Loomis of Chicago, and James Ludington of Milwaukee. The lumber company bought for $500,000 the property previously owned by James Ludington that encompassed the future town of Ludington. This included 25,000 acres of pine timber, Pere Marquette village platted lots, a large general store, and the local sawmills. Filer became the new lumber company's president. = Death = Filer traveled extensively in the South and West late in his life due to failing health. He started to travel to California in the winter of 1878, but only got as far as Denver. There he became seriously ill and returned to Ludington. After a long illness he died on July 26, 1879. He is buried in Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. = Marriage = Filer was married 3 times. His first married in 1838 to Miss SA Paine who died in June 1839 leaving a baby daughter Mary J Filer. His second marriage was to Miss Juliet Golden and their son E. Golden Filer carried on his mother's family name. Juliet died in 1864 leaving four children Mary J Filer, E. Golden Filer, Frank Filer, and Delos W Filer. Filer's third marriage was to Miss Mary M Pierce of Manistee on January 23, 1866, who had a daughter Grace.

He was seriously wounded near Minsk in Russia in 1915 due to a head shot and lost his left eye. As a consequence, he underwent treatment at the Eye Hospital in Stuttgart for a period of one year. As a result of his injuries, he suffered from severe headaches and spells of dizziness as well as kidney problems for the rest of his life. In June 1917, he returned to Berlin-Lichterfelde Grammar School and qualified as drawing teacher in September. From October 1917 to September 1918, he served as district officer in Rastenburg in East Prussia. = Berlin = In 1918, Ernst Zipperer married Elisabeth Nestler (born 3 November 1894 in Hildburghausen; died 5 June 1977 in Heilbronn). Following their wedding, he took up the post of art teacher at Hermann von Helmholtz Grammar School in Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld. The couple had three children: Ernst Wilhelm (1919 ‚Äì 2005), Gisela (1921 ‚Äì 1928) and Vera Charlotte (born 1931). In 1920, he moved to Berlin-Friedenau Grammar School where he taught until 1940. There, until 1940, he influenced a whole generation of young people. His pupils included persons such as the resistance fighter Friedrich Justus Perels, the columnist Friedrich Luft and the politicians Egon Bahr and Peter Lorenz. Zipperer was deeply respected by his pupils and many remained in close contact with him until his death. He enjoyed a deep friendship with Helmut Ammann who became a prominent sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ernst Zipperer‚Äôs first years of teaching in Berlin also marked the beginning of his first major creative phase which lasted until 1940. During these two decades, Zipperer produced a significant body of work. He traveled extensively throughout Germany and to various European countries in order to study and produce art works. His preferred technique at the time was drypoint etching and with this technique he became known both in and outside Germany. Ernst Hermann Zipperer (father), pastel, 1913 In Berlin, Zipperer developed friendships with the artists Heinrich Zille and Max Liebermann.‚ÄöDer Weg‚Äò - Vision und Auftrag, Ernst Zipperer zum 80. Geburtstag. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw√§bisch Hall. February 23,1968, p. 9. He was particularly close to the sculptor August Gaul, in whose house he lived for almost one year in 1917. Gaul appreciated and sponsored Ernst Zipperer. Through Gaul, a member of the Executive Committee of the Berlin Secession, Zipperer came into contact with Berlin arts world. Tannenburg near B√ºhlertann In 1931, Zipperer bought Tannenburg Castle, a castle dating back to the Staufer period, with its farm estate near the village of B√ºhlertann in Ellwangen District (now Schw√§bisch Hall District) in north-east W√ºrttemberg.Klein, Erwin/Staudacher, Bernhard: Die Geschichte der Tannenburg und ihrer Besitzer. Summary of a lecture held in B√ºhlertalhalle, B√ºhlertann, on Fryday November 13, 2009. B√ºhlertann: Heimatverein. 2010. He leased the associated farm estate and continued to work in Berlin. = Tannenburg and B√ºhlertann, W√ºrttemberg = As a disabled war veteran, Ernst Zipperer retired from teaching in 1940 and moved from Berlin to Tannenburg Castle. Under extremely difficult conditions, he managed the farm estate until the return of his son Ernst Wilhelm from the war and captivity (1940 ‚Äì 1948). In 1951, he handed over the castle and the farm estate to his son and, in 1963, left the castle to move to the home of his daughter Vera in B√ºhlertann. With the deterioration of his remaining eye‚Äôs sight, he had to give up his artistic work in 1972. He spent the last years of his life at the home of his daughter who had since moved to Flein near Heilbronn. Ernst Gustav Zipperer died on May 26, 1982 at the age of 94 and was buried in B√ºhlertann.Tannenburg, Drypoint, 1940  Work  The artistic work of Ernst Zipperer covers his early work until 1918, the creative phase in Berlin (1918-1940) and his late work (1950-1972). According to the current status, about 1,300 works have been documented. = Early work (until 1917) = Already as a child and during his apprenticeship, Ernst Zipperer showed a particular talent for drawing. During this period, many drawings and sketches evolved, but most of them are now lost. From the period of his artistic education in Hanover, Kassel and Munich, numerous studies on perspective and shadowing as well as technical drawings still exist. Under the influence of Prof. HeubachKunstausstellung im Kunsthaus G√∂bel. In: Ulmer Tagblatt. Ulm. No. 87, April 16, 1931. in Hanover Zipperer turned its attention to the drawing of architecture. At the same time he created landscapes, portraits, nudes, ornaments and still lifes, which he mainly executed as pencil drawings, rarely as watercolors. During his wartime deployment in Russia (1914 ‚Äì 1915), his artistic talent expressed itself in a wide variety of ways. Due to a lack of photographic resources, he sketched military combats which were used in connection with strategic decisions. In the trenches, he sketched portraits of fellow soldiers and officers as a memento to be sent to their families. Two small drawings from this period are extant. His severe war injury was followed by a one-year convalescence period at the Eye Hospital in Stuttgart. After regaining the sight of his remaining eye, he produced many art works, while still in hospital. In numerous sketches and drawings, he focused on people who showed considerable signs of what they had gone through during the war. Some pictures of that time clearly show the influence of Heinrich Zille.Rieber, A.: Heute f√ºhren die Wege ins Unendliche. In: Heilbronner Stimme. Heilbronn. March 3, 1973, p. 21. = Berlin Phase (1918 ‚Äì 1940) = Magdalen Tower, Oxford, Drypoint, 1925 In 1919 Ernst Zipperer discovered drypoint etching for himself. He drew and etched castles, city views, churches, landscapes, portraits, flowers and animals - mostly in small to medium format. The main topic in this phase was architecture. He found more than 40 motifs alone in his hometown of Ulm. On his numerous travels he made pencil drawings as preliminary studies for the later etchings. Swabian Alb with Hohenrechberg and Hohenstaufen, drypoint, 1925 A total of more than 300 drypoint etchings were created, which were characterized by careful area division, well thought-out image composition and formal design ability. Added to this was the perspective effect of his pictures, which he succeeded convincingly despite one-eyed. Zipperer achieved an increase in spatiality and expression by drawing inspiration from Chiaroscuro.Zur Ausstellung von Radierungen Ernst Zipperers. In: Ipf- und Jagst-zeitung / Ellwanger Tagblatt. Ellwangen. Vol 115 (1933), No. 237, October 28, 1933, p. 5. Also characteristic was the staffage found in many etchings, which discreetly guides the eye of the beholder. Station Hall Berlin, drypoint, 1923 \\"The many moving strokes, which sometimes had an almost shimmering effect - combined with a strict mold design - that was typical Zipperer\\".Ausstellung im Kunsthaus Frey in Ulm zum 90. Geburtstag. In: Ulmer Zeitung. Ulm. February 11,1978. But he was not just concerned with the reproduction of reality. \\"Zipperer did not represent dead objects, but things that have a destiny and therefore life.\\"Ohne Titel. In: Vaterst√§dtische Bl√§tter. L√ºbeck. (1927/28), No. 3, October 30, 1927, p. 3f. Rather, he sought the creative translation of his perception into the artistic. \\"He knew how to express what weaves the visible in emotional mood\\".Kunstverlag Carl B√ºchle. Berlin-Tempelhof 1925 [publisher's catalog]. That Zipperer was also \\"a portrait drypoint etcher of rank and depth\\"Bilder aus Heimat und Welt. In: Sonntagsbeitr√§ge der Weser- Zeitung. Bremen. November 27, 1927. is shown by his portraits, which he executed as pencil drawings and etchings. During training in Kassel he had received an award for portrait drawing. In the mid-twenties, Zipperer occasionally colored etchings by hand. As towards the end of the decade increasingly colored etchings were required, he had many of his motifs in color print. Numerous etchings were commissioned by cities, companies, art dealers or private individuals. A large part of the etchings was published by various publishers as art cards and sold through the art trade. Zipperer worked for decades with the copper printing company Wilhelm Schneider in Berlin, where the copper plates were stored. A larger number of plates were lost during the Second World War and in the subsequent turmoil or got into unauthorized hands. This explains that pirate prints came into circulation as a result. With his drypoint etchings Ernst Zipperer became known in Europe and America - less by exhibitions than by the very successful distribution of his pictures by some art publishers and numerous art shops in Germany and abroad.Copperplate printing company, art publishers and art dealers (selection): Kupferdruckerei und Kunstverlag Wilhelm Schneider & Co, Berlin / Kunstverlag Balkheimer, Ulm (K√ºnstlerkarten) / Kunstverlag J.C.

Also some sketches in different techniques, which served for demonstration purposes in the classroom, are preserved from this time. Ernst Zipperer‚Äôs wife Elisabeth contributed considerably to his work since she kept him free from the burden of day-to-day activities. She handled business correspondence with the copperplate printers, art dealers and prospective buyers. Likewise, she helped to organize the countless visits of art lovers. = Creative break (1941 ‚Äì 1949) = During World War II and the immediately succeeding years, Ernst Zipperer‚Äôs artistic activities almost came to a complete stop. The difficult conditions of everyday life at the castle left no scope for art. = Late work (1950 ‚Äì 1972) = After the turmoil of the war and the handover of Tannenburg to his son, Ernst Zipperer was able to devote himself entirely to his art. He left the era of drypoint behind him and entered a new intense phase of artistic creation. The late work of the artist is characterized by experimentation and new ideas. For Zipperer, the movement runs along the art-historical development of his time from realistic- naturalistic to abstract-reductionist representation. At the same time, the realistic and abstract modes of expression do not stand for a closed stage of artistic recognition. Rather, both exist side by side. Abstract depictions are again followed by a landscape or a bouquet of flowers. He is always looking for \\"ground under his feet,\\" as he called it.Jedes Bild ist ein Wettlauf mit der Sonne. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw√§bisch Hall. October 29, 1966, p. 8f. It is a further thematic arc that spans the \\"complexity of its meaningful images\\".Kalinke, Dieter: Ein Stiller im Lande. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw√§bisch Hall. April 22, 1972, p. 20. In many cases, these are already well-known motifs that recur again and again - often in a reduced form - trees in the landscape, a ravine and clouds above; especially the clouds occupied him throughout his life.Der Maler auf der Tannenburg. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw√§bisch Hall. No. 226, September 30, 1961. In addition, there are themes such as peace and quiet, but also division and destruction, which he translates abstractly. \\"Everything you can think of, you can also draw\\", the artist described his own spectrum in later years.Die Tannenburg ‚Äì eine Trutzveste aus der Stauferzeit. In: Haller Tagblatt. Schw√§bisch Hall. May 14, 1966, p. 8f. Increasingly employed Ernst Zipperer, who was influenced Protestant in the parental home, but in his old age increasingly took up Catholic thought, religious and biblical themes: The Psalms, the story of creation, Job and the Gospel of John. He also transformed the music of Bach, Mozart and Tchaikovsky into colors and forms.

In the gravure printing of the heliogravure Zipperer did in 1955 in cooperation with his Berlin printing on new ways on how he could spread some of his large-sized pastel paintings in large numbers. It is a fine-printing process that transfers the original to a copper plate in a complex photo-chemical process. The heliogravure makes a very differentiated reproduction of halftones possible and thus creates a wealth of color power. The prints, also known as hand copper, met with great interest in the art trade and in the personal environment of the artist. They were affordable, allowing a wider audience access to this art. There is not a single self-portrait by Ernst Zipperer. However, he draws a picture especially in his late works: In it he shows how he sees the visible and invisible world with his inner eye. In addition to some extensive, there are many smaller private collections with works by Ernst Zipperer. Individual works are held in German museums or municipal archives. Ernst Zipperer‚Äôs artistic estate is managed by his daughter Vera Prior and grandson Lothar Zipperer.

It flows into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, opposite to Anticosti Island. Location The V√©ronique River drains Lake V√©ronique and Little Lake V√©ronique. It flows for about from Lake V√©ronique at its mouth. The mouth of the river is in the municipality of Baie-Johan-Beetz in Minganie Regional County Municipality. The river enters the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northeast of the Baie Quetchou, just east of the Baie Johan-Beetz. The Quetachou River enters the northwest of the same bay. The bay is about east of Havre-Saint-Pierre. Basin The river basin covers . It lies between the basins of the Watshishou River to the east and the Quetachou River to the west. It includes part of the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me as well as part of Baie-Johan-Beetz. The river has low volume and the current is slow. Donat Devost and his sons set up a sawmill on the V√©ronique River around 1953. Six years later the mill was sold to Lorenzo Tanguay. In 1969 Tanguay moved the sawmill to Lac Sal√© and closed the business. Environment A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the river in sub-regions 6j-T and 6m-T of the east spruce/moss subdomain. The north of the V√©ronique valley has potential for use by moose (Alces alces), and traces of moose were found in the region in 1978 and 1979. Beaver (Castor canadensis) is well represented in the river basin. The V√©ronique River has low potential for Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and average potential for surface ducks and diving ducks. Fish The river is used by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and American eel (Anguilla rostrata). Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod) has also been reported. It is narrow, its bed is littered with trees and the vegetation along its course is dense, so it is not attractive for sport fishing. It is not officially a salmon river, and does not have the physical characteristics preferred by salmon. The bed of the river is clay and mud along almost its entire length. However, juvenile salmon were found in samples in 1980 and 1984, so there must be some good spawning areas.

Bartuloviƒá died as member of Chetnik forces at the end of 1943. Bartuloviƒá participated in the Ba Congress held between 25 and 28 January 1944 where he was elected as member of the committee of the Yugoslav Democratic National Union, a new political party established during the congress. After the capitulation of Italy in late 1943, the German forces occupied Split and put Bartuloviƒá to prison because of his contacts with Yugoslav government-in-exile, and he remained in German prison from 29 March to 26 October 1944.  Death  Many post-war Yugoslav published works contain an inaccurate date of his death as 1943. Some sources state that he was murdered in 1945, based on orders of the Communist Party of Croatia, with full knowledge and support of Vladimir Bakariƒá and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, because he was a Chetnik.

A large amount of scientific literature in social psychology studies diversity ideologies as prejudice reduction strategies, most commonly in the context of racial groups and interracial interactions. In research studies on the effects of diversity ideology, social psychologists have either examined endorsement of a diversity ideology as individual difference or used situational priming designs to activate the mindset of a particular diversity ideology. It is consistently shown that diversity ideologies influence how individuals perceive, judge and treat cultural outgroup members. Different diversity ideologies are associated with distinct effects on intergroup relations, such as stereotyping and prejudice, intergroup equality, and intergroup interactions from the perspectives of both majority and minority group members. Beyond intergroup consequences, diversity ideology also has implications on individual outcomes, such as whether people are open to cultural fusion and foreign ideas, which in turn predict creativity. There are two major categories of diversity ideology that are frequently compared and contrasted with each other: colorblindness and multiculturalism. Both ideologies have been shown to have mixed effects on intergroup relations: in general, colorblind ideology is associated with lower stereotyping but greater prejudice, especially implicit prejudice. On the other hand, multicultural ideology is associated with greater stereotyping but reduced prejudice, including both implicit and explicit prejudice. The ideologies are differently accepted by majority and minority groups, and often lead to divergent outcomes for groups depending on their position in the social hierarchy. Besides the two most commonly studied diversity ideologies, there is another emerging ideology termed polyculturalism. Research suggests that polyculturalism has mostly positive implications for intergroup attitudes, but given the novelty of this ideology, further exploration of its full spectrum of effects is needed.  Colorblindness  In a colorblind ideological approach, ‚Äúprejudice derives from people‚Äôs emphasis on superficial and irrelevant group categories (e.g., race), and therefore prejudice can be decreased by de-emphasizing group memberships‚Äù (p. 216). Therefore, colorblindness aims to address bias and reduce prejudice by neglecting all differences between social groups and avoiding drawing any distinction between people based on group categorizations. The ideology became prominent during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. It was proposed as a strategy to eliminate blatant racism of Whites against Blacks in America. By explicitly recognizing that race does not and should not matter, colorblindness was intended to treat all races as identical, so that race could no longer be used as a basis to discriminate. Colorblind ideology derives from classic social psychology research on group categorization. Social identity theory posits that people have a natural tendency to identify with groups based on common social identity, and due to the motivation to maintain positive distinctiveness, people display ingroup favoritism, i.e. giving preferential treatment to ingroup versus outgroup members in evaluations and behaviors. As a result, group categorization and affiliation is associated with the primary source of intergroup conflict, which leads to a lardy body of work studying how changing group boundaries, such as recategorizing or minimizing group membership can help reduce ingroup bias and promote intergroup harmony. This literature reflects the core value of colorblind ideology, i.e. de-emphasizing group memberships in order to improve intergroup attitudes. = Forms = Research has identified two forms of colorblindness, respectively focusing on group similarities and individual uniqueness. With the similarity approach, a common ingroup identity is emphasized, e.g. \\"We all belong to nation X.\\" By stressing a superordinate identity that everyone across groups belongs to, the salience and importance of intergroup differences is downplayed. With the uniqueness approach, individual differences are emphasized. Each individual is seen as unique and contributes distinct values. When individual identity is underscored as the most valuable, no meaningful comparisons should be made based on group categorizations. However, research suggests that the uniqueness approach may not be effective because focusing on each individual's unique qualities in daily encounters is too cognitively taxing for people and can impair social interactions. At the same time, even if outgroup members' unique values are stressed, people tend to neglect stereotype-inconsistent information and when they do, they tend to categorize these outgroup members as subcategories and thus do not change perceived stereotypes of outgroups. Moreover, critics of colorblind ideology argue that it largely neglects people's need to affiliate and belong, especially for marginalized group members who have greater need to identify with their groups. = Distinction from assimilation = Assimilation refers to the belief that in order to promote intergroup harmony, minority groups should give up their group identities and adopt the dominant mainstream culture. The underlying idea is that if a society is culturally homogeneous, no prejudice could take place. However, this ideology may in itself reflect racism because it assumes the superiority of the majority group's culture while devaluing identities and cultures associated with minority groups. Assimilation is often compared to colorblindness as an intergroup ideology. Some researchers contend that colorblindness is a similarly racist approach as assimilation because both require minority groups to forgo their group identity and devalue minority groups' meaningful traditions and cultures. On the other hand, other researchers argue that while assimilation promotes a unitary cultural ideal by the dominant standard and requests conformity and submission, colorblindness as a diversity ideology is intended to promote a larger whole with which everyone identifies and to facilitate equal treatment of majority and minority group members. Research suggests that assimilation as an intergroup ideology is linked to higher social dominance orientation, or the tendency to support social hierarchy and anti-egalitarianism. It is associated with the most negative intergroup consequences, including greater stereotyping, more negative intergroup attitudes, and less support for liberal public policies promoting social equality for majority group members. = Effects =  Acceptance by majority and minority groups  Although colorblindness is intended to be a hierarchy-attenuating ideology that promotes equal treatment of all social group members, it is differently accepted by majority and minority group members. Research shows that the adoption of colorblindness by majority groups is associated with external motivation to control prejudice as it serves the purpose of ego protection. When White participants were concerned about appearing biased or faced normative pressure, they were more likely to avoid talking about race or recognizing race differences, suggesting the strategic use of colorblindness to appear egalitarian. Colorblindness can also serve as a tool to defend the status quo by majority groups. When anti- egalitarian White participants were exposed to intergroup threat, they used colorblindness to rationalize inequality and legitimize the racial status quo. From a developmental perspective, children learn to avoid expressing racial prejudice and minimize racial categorization around age 10. On the other hand, minority groups tend to seek more identification with their minority group identities, which is not recognized by the colorblind ideology. Therefore, while White Americans have been shown to be more likely to endorse colorblind ideology, Black Americans are more likely to endorse multicultural ideology where their unique racial identity is acknowledged.  Stereotyping and prejudice  The effects of colorblind ideology on intergroup relations are mixed. In terms of stereotyping and prejudice, colorblindness is associated with decreased stereotyping of minority groups. People who are primed with colorblind ideology favor counterstereotypical minorities over stereotypical minorities. These findings suggest that colorblindness increases people's preference for individuals who display attributes atypical of their social groups and cross the group boundary. The colorblind ideology is also found to suppress expression of explicit prejudice in the short term, especially when intergroup conflict is high and more threat is triggered in the dominant group. However, implicit prejudice against minority groups rebounds at a later time point. The findings suggest that colorblindness may not reliably reduce prejudice, especially implicit prejudice, for sustained period of time.  Intergroup interactions  In terms of intergroup interactions, research suggests that colorblind ideology is associated with worse intergroup attitudes towards minority group members. Colorblindness promotes a prevention orientation in people as it emphasizes not harboring certain perception and performing certain behaviors. Therefore, trying to consciously suppressing bias against outgroups and negativity in intergroup interactions can impair majority group's cognitive ability and executive functions. As a result, inducing majority group members to adopt a colorblind ideology and to ignore racial differences in intergroup interactions, which leads them to consciously exert to appear non-prejudiced, can paradoxically increase their tendency to express more negative attitudes and discriminate against minority groups. Majority group members can exhibit more negative nonverbal behaviors and be perceived as less friendly by their minority interaction partners. Moreover, in some research colorblindness is linked with greater ethnocentrism and in- group favoritism, i.e. favoring ingroup members and perceiving them in more positive light than out-group members. However, there are also some studies finding that colorblindness decreases ethnocentrism. From minority groups' perspective, evidence suggests that the adoption of colorblind ideology by majority group members also impairs minority performance and their perceived risk of discrimination. As a result, interacting with colorblind majority group members increases minority's cognitive taxation. This set of findings suggest that colorblindness may be more effective to address explicit bias than implicit unintentional bias in intergroup interactions between majority and minority groups.  Sensitivity to racism  Colorblindness is associated with reduced awareness of racism and sensitivity to microaggressions as well as reports of them among majority group members. In the educational setting, research suggests that in schools advocating for colorblind ideology, White teachers who deemed themselves as being fair still discriminated against Black students, giving Black students more severe punishments and favoring White students in class elections. Similarly, children who were exposed to the colorblind ideology were less likely to perceive race-biased behaviors as discriminatory. Therefore, while colorblindness takes the stance of facilitating egalitarianism, it may prevent racism from being recognized and addressed.  Multiculturalism  In a multiculturalism ideology, ‚Äúprejudice derives from a lack of knowledge of and respect for other groups‚Äù and prejudice can be decreased by learning about other groups and appreciating the differences (p. 220). Its focus is on embracing, appreciating and learning about and from differences between social groups in order to promote justice and equality, and to better improve the living conditions of minority group members. In contrast to colorblindness that advocates for neglecting differences and avoiding discussion of group categorization, multiculturalism states that minority groups' unique histories, traditions and pasts should be recognized and appreciated. Therefore, multiculturalism is commonly viewed as the competing ideology directly contrasting with colorblindness. = Forms = Three forms of multiculturalism are identified in social psychology research. First, the \\"important difference\\" form focuses on only recognizing that differences between groups exist and understanding the variety of perspectives, experiences and lives of different groups. Second, the \\"appreciate contributions\\" form emphasizes also the importance to appreciate each group's unique positive contribution and value to the diverse society. Lastly, the \\"maintain culture\\" form, directly in opposition to assimilation ideology, puts emphasis on paying attention to groups', especially newcomers to the society like immigrants, ability to maintain their unique identities and cultures. These forms are not mutually exclusive with each other, and many intergroup researchers study multiculturalism in some combined forms. = Effects =  Intergroup attitudes and interactions  Research shows that multiculturalism has positive implications for intergroup attitudes. Individual difference in multiculturalism ideology is related to different intergroup attitudes, such that people who score higher on measure of the ideology and support for multicultural policies are more tolerant of outgroups. Similarly, a meta-analysis of multicultural education programs indicates that multiculturalism as diversity ideology positively influences intergroup attitudes. With regard to prejudice, dominant group members who endorse multiculturalism exhibit less explicit and implicit prejudice towards minority members. Moreover, priming a multiculturalism ideology in majority group members is shown to increase their inclusivity, including increased capability of perspective-taking, more positive perception of minority group members, less ethnocentrism or ingroup bias, and less tendency to discriminate. From minority groups' perspective, because multiculturalism is more aligned with minority groups' need to identify with their unique group identity, minority groups are more likely than majority group members to support multiculturalism. Minority groups' psychological engagement in the workplace increases when working with colleagues who endorse multiculturalistic attitudes, an effect mediated by the perception of reduced intergroup bias.  Stereotyping  However, research has also identified some negative effects associated with multiculturalism. While multiculturalism tends to decrease prejudice, some studies suggest that multiculturalism is associated with stronger stereotyping of minority group member, such that stereotypical minorities are viewed as favorable by White participants than counterstereotypical minorities when they are exposed to multicultural ideology. At the same time, multiculturalism, by putting great emphasis on how groups are distinctively different from each other, may be at risk of promoting greater division between groups and foster a more salient ‚Äúus‚Äù versus ‚Äúthem‚Äù mindset. Therefore, the ideology may encourage people to restrict themselves to only their associated group membership rather than cross group boundaries. Some research supports that multiculturalism endorsement is associated with greater beliefs that racial differences are fixed and nonchangeable, which may explain why multiculturalism leads to greater stereotyping  Majority group resistance  Another weakness of multiculturalism is that when intergroup conflict and perceived threat is high, multiculturalism can backfire and promote more hostility towards minority groups among majority group members. The more identified they are with their ingroup, majority group members experience more symbolic threat, and thus endorse multiculturalism less. When White participants perceived greater threat from racial minority groups, they endorsed multiculturalism ideology to a lesser degree, showed less tolerance of outgroups, and expressed more hostility towards their minority interaction partners. One reason underlying the role of threat in influencing the relationship between multiculturalism and improved intergroup attitudes is that majority groups are likely to perceive multiculturalism as exclusionary to minority groups and feel threatened about their status. Research finds that dominant group members identify with the multiculturalism ideology less than their minority counterparts. White participants were slower to associate multiculturalism with their self-concept than racial minorities, and were faster to pair exclusion with multiculturalism in an implicit association test. However, after being exposed to an \\"all-inclusive multiculturalism\\" message that intentionally frames the dominant group as being part of the diversity, the automatic pairing becomes slower. = Comparison with colorblindness = As two major competing diversity ideologies, multiculturalism and colorblindness are frequently studied together to contrast their effects on intergroup interactions and attitudes. In one of the first set of studies directly comparing multiculturalism and colorblindness, researchers found that in the colorblind condition with a message of how intergroup harmony can be achieved by focusing on a superordinate identity and treating every individual as unique, participants were more likely to exhibit prejudice and ethnocentrism but less likely to display stereotyping of minority groups, as compared to the multiculturalism condition with a message stressing how diversity is valuable and group differences should be recognized. Compared to colorblindness, multiculturalism is also associated with greater collective self-esteem, such as identification with and sense of belonging to the ingroup, for minority groups. In a recent meta-analysis examining the relationship between different diversity ideologies and prejudice, researchers show that assimilation has a positive association with prejudice, multiculturalism has a small negative association with both explicit prejudice and implicit prejudice, and colorblindness has a very small negative correlation with prejudice. Compared to control group, priming a colorblind ideology is associated with lower explicit prejudice and ingroup bias, but with higher implicit bias than multiculturalism. Reviewers have drawn similar conclusions that the multiculturalism ideology has a more positive effect on intergroup relations and attitudes than colorblind ideology.  Polyculturalism  In a polyculturalism ideology, each group's culture is not viewed as standing alone but rather receives influence from other groups‚Äô culture and traditions too. All cultures and people are conceptualized as the products of historical and contemporary interactions among many different groups, and deeply interconnected by intersecting histories. This ideology is developed based on historians' work that recognizes the existence of multiple racial and ethnic groups and focuses on the connected history, past and traditions among groups as well as their mutual influence. For example, historian Robin Kelley underscores interracial shared past by writing, \\"All of us, and I mean ALL of us, are the inheritors of European, African, Native American, and even Asian pasts, even if we can‚Äôt exactly trace our blood lines to all of these continents.\\" Similarly, in this discussion of the historical roots of Kung Fu, historian Vijay Prashad shows that although considered as a uniquely Asian cultural product, Kung Fu has also been greatly influenced by African cultures and evolved as it received influence from multiple cultures in the world. Therefore, polyculturalism pays more attention to the interactions and connections between different racial groups. Unlike assimilation and colorblindness, polyculturalism does not require giving up one's unique social group identity or being assimilated into a dominant culture. Unlike multiculturalism, besides recognizing group differences and preserving the values of each group, polyculturalism moreover focuses on emphasizing the interconnectedness of one group's identity with other groups' identities. = Effects =  Intergroup attitudes and endorsement of equality  Social psychology research on polyculturalism has suggested generally positive effects on intergroup attitudes and endorsement of social equality. Polyculturalism is found to be associated with less support for social dominance and hierarchy, greater willingness to make intergroup contact, and greater support for public policies and institutions that promote social equality, such as affirmative action. It is also linked to improved and more positive intergroup attitudes towards minority groups. When dominant group participants endorsed polyculturalism more, they had less negative attitudes towards the LGBTQ community and less sexual prejudice. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests that majority and minority groups are equally likely to support this ideology. The findings indicate that polyculturalism ideology could lead to greater endorsement of social equality, greater interest in and comfort with diversity and differences, and lower evaluative bias.  Openness to change and foreign ideas  One reason why polyculturalism promotes more positivity in intergroup relations is that polyculturalism can encourage greater willingness to learn about different cultures and open to criticize and change one's own culture. As a downstream consequence, research finds that polyculturalism fosters creativity on problems that emphasizes cultural integration, an effect driven by greater propensity for foreign idea inclusion. Colorblindness, on the other hand, impaired creativity in problem- solving tasks that required associations between cultures. = Potential weaknesses = There are some potential issues associated polyculturalism. Polyculturalism might lead group members to perceive that the cultural traditions and attributes valued by and unique to their respective ingroup as de-emphasized. When people deem their ingroup contribution to these values as greater than outgroups, they can view outgroups as more deviant than interconnected, which could have negative impact on intergroup harmony (see Ingroup Projection Model). As the study of this ideology is in an early stage, the weaknesses of polyculturalism and how it might incur backlash await further examination.

At the top of the painting is a vision of the Holy Trinity. Seated in the foreground are Saint Sebastian and Mary Magdalene, the latter modelled on the artist's wife Lucrezia del Fede. Behind them stand four male saints, from left to right Augustine of Hippo (with his bishop's staff), Saint Lawrence (with the gridiron of his martyrdom), Peter Martyr (holding a book, wearing a Dominican habit and with a sword in his head) and Francis of Assisi (in his order's habit and bearing the stigmata). History Some art historians argue the work was commissioned by the Peri family due to its inclusion of saints linked to that family. It was the third painting Sarto produced for the Augustinian church of San Gallo in Florence - the others were the San Gallo Annunciation and a Noli me tangere. All the monastery's goods were moved to the church of San Jacopo tra Fossi for safety in 1529 just before the Siege of Florence. That church was destroyed soon afterwards. The date painted on the step is a later addition, but Vasari's Lives of the Artists records it was produced after the Madonna of the Harpies (1517) - this dating is generally accepted by comparison with other works from that time. Bocchi's account of the painting states it was damaged in the 1557 flood, but no trace of such damage was found in a 1985 restoration. The work is included in a 17th century inventory of the Galleria Palatina, spending some time at the Uffizi (1697-1716) before returning decisively to the Galleria Palatina in 1829, where it was hung in the Sala di Saturno Marco Chiarini, Galleria palatina e Appartamenti Reali, Sillabe, Livorno 1998. .

An alternative term is allowed edge. A fundamental problem in matching theory is: given a graph G, find the set of all maximally-matchable edges in G. This is equivalent to finding the union of all maximum matchings in G (this is different than the simpler problem of finding a single maximum matching in G). Several algorithms for this problem are known.  Motivation  Consider a matchmaking agency with a pool of men and women. Given the preferences of the candidates, the agency constructs a bipartite graph where there is an edge between a man and a woman iff they are compatible. The ultimate goal of the agency is to create as many compatible couples as possible, i.e., find a maximum-cardinality matching in this graph. Towards this goal, the agency first chooses an edge in the graph, and suggests to the man and woman on both ends of the edge to meet. Now, the agency must take care to only choose a maximally-matchable edge. This is because, if it chooses a non-maximally- matchable edge, it may get stuck with an edge that cannot be completed to a maximum-cardinality matching.  Definition  Let G = (V,E) be a graph, where V are the vertices and E are the edges. A matching in G is a subset M of E, such that each vertex in V is adjacent to at most a single edge in M. A maximum matching is a matching of maximum cardinality. An edge e in E is called maximally-matchable (or allowed) if there exists a maximum matching M that contains e.  Algorithms for general graphs  Currently, the best known deterministic algorithm for general graphs runs in time O(VE) . There is a randomized algorithm for general graphs in time \\\\tilde{O}(V^{2.376}) ..  Algorithms for bipartite graphs  In bipartite graphs, if a single maximum-cardinality matching is known, it is possible to find all maximally- matchable edges in linear time - O(V+E). If a maximum matching is not known, it can be found by existing algorithms. In this case, the resulting overall runtime is O(V^{1/2}E) for general bipartite graphs and O((V/\\\\log V)^{1/2}E) for dense bipartite graphs with E=\\\\Theta(V^2). = Bipartite graphs with a perfect matching = The algorithm for finding maximally-matchable edges is simpler when the graph admits a perfect matching. Let the bipartite graph be G=(X+Y, E), where X = (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) and Y=(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n). Let the perfect matching be M = \\\\\\\\{(x_1,y_1),\\\\ldots,(x_n,y_n)\\\\\\\\}. Theorem: an edge e is maximally-matchable if-and-only-if e is included in some M-alternating cycle - a cycle that alternates between edges in M and edges not in M. Proof: * If e is in an alternating cycle, then either e is in M, or - by inverting the cycle - we get a new perfect matching that contains e. Hence, e is maximally- matchable. * Conversely, if e is maximally-matchable, then it is in some perfect matching N. By taking the symmetric difference of M and N, we can construct an alternating cycle that contains e. Now, consider a directed graph H=(Z, E), where Z = (z_1,\\\\ldots,z_n) and there is an edge from z_i to z_j in H iff i eq j and there is an edge between x_i and y_j in G (note that by assumption such edges are not in M). Each M-alternating cycle in G corresponds to a directed cycle in H. A directed edge belongs to a directed cycle iff both its endpoints belong to the same strongly connected component. There are algorithms for finding all strongly-connected componentsin linear time Therefore, the set of all maximally-matchable edges can be found as follows: * Given the undirected bipartite graph G=(X+Y, E) and the perfect matching M, mark every edge (x_i,y_i) in M as maximally-matchable. * Construct the directed graph H=(Z, E) as above. * Find all strongly-connected components in H. * For each i, j such that (z_i,z_j) are in the same component, mark the edge (x_i,y_j) as maximally-matchable. * Mark all remaining edges as not maximally-matchable. = Bipartite graphs without a perfect matching = Let the bipartite graph be G=(X+Y, E), where X = (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) and Y=(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_{n'}) and n\\\\leq n'. Let the given maximum matching be M = \\\\\\\\{(x_1,y_1),\\\\ldots,(x_t,y_t)\\\\\\\\}, where t \\\\leq n \\\\leq n'. The edges in E can be categorized into two classes: * Edges with both endpoints saturated by M. We call such edges M-upper. * Edges with exactly one endpoint saturated by M. We call such edges M-lower. * Note that there are no edges with both endpoints unsaturated by M, since this would contradict the maximality of M. Theorem: All M-lower edges are maximally-matchable. Proof: suppose e = (xi,yj) where xi is saturated and yj is not. Then, removing (xi,yi) from M and adding (xi,yj) yields a new maximum-cardinality matching. Hence, it remains to find the maximally-matchable edges among the M-upper ones. Let H be the subgraph of G induced by the M-saturated nodes. Note that M is a perfect matching in H. Hence, using the algorithm of the previous subsection, it is possible to find all edges that are maximally-matchable in H. Tassa explains how to find the remaining maximally-matchable edges, as well as how to dynamically update the set of maximally-matchable edges when the graph changes.

Canova finished the original work in 1802 and modelled two further variants which he completed in 1819. The work was to serve as a replacement for the Venus de Medici sculpture, a copy of an antique work by Cleomenes of Athens, which had been seized, taken to France and placed in the Louvre in 1802 by orders of Bonaparte. After Napoleon's abdication the Venus de Medici was returned to Italy on 27 December 1815 and is since on display in the Room of Venus in the Galleria Palatina at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. Early 19th century president of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze (Florence Academy of Fine Arts) Count Giovanni degli Alessandri encouraged the ingenious Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova to create a copy of the Venus de Medici. Canova approved and set to work on the Venus Italica, which is considered to be one of his masterpieces in both, artistic conception and craftship. According to art critic Edward Lucie-Smith the artistic expression of sexual vulnerability is conveyed better than on the original Venus de Medici. Most viewers have noticed Canova's superior craftmanship on marble surfaces and textures. His unique technique and ability to achieve the illusion of human flesh has been called the Direct touch. Canova would eventually begin to display his studio works in candlelight. Intrigued by the effects of the light and shade of the candles on the translucent marble surface Canova soon began to further soften the transitions between the various parts of the statue and rub them down with special tools and pumice stone, sometimes for weeks or months. Finally he would apply an unknown compound of patina onto the flesh of the sculpture to lighten the skin tone. This process has been called the Last touch.

He is also the Night Time Economy Adviser for Greater Manchester.  Early life  Lord was born in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, and grew up in the town. His father was a textile merchant, and his mother an interior designer. Lord was educated at Manchester Grammar School, leaving at aged 18 having gained two Us and an E at A-Level. After leaving school, Lord went on to work at a clothes shop in Altrincham, and later started a market stall at Liverpool market, selling leather jackets. After quitting his market job, Lord quickly found himself involved in the rave-influenced music scene, and spent most of his time listening to The Stone Roses, Prince, The Smiths and Bowie.  The Warehouse Project  Inspired by the success of the events, Lord launched the Warehouse Project, a series of rave events running annually from September to 1 January, in 2006 with Co- Founder Sam Kandel.} It began operations in the disused Boddingtons Brewery in Strangeways, and then moved into a space under Manchester Piccadilly station, on Store Street, which previously served as an air raid shelter. The opening night of The Warehouse Project was described by Lord as a nightmare due to its location next to the prison, and he later revealed the Governor of HM Prison Manchester had called to say it was disturbing inmates. The Warehouse Project went onto feature some of the most in-demand names in international house and techno music, including New Order, The Chemical Brothers and Calvin Harris - whose appearance, Lord later went onto reveal, was a favour for an A&R; at Sony. Lord revealed he put Harris ( an unknown DJ at the time) on the 21.30 slot, despite doors only opening at 22.00. The Warehouse Project attracted 100,000 people in its first year and has continued to sell out annually. In 2019, Lord and Kandel moved The Warehouse Project to Depot at the former Manchester Mayfield railway station - a move which saw it become the biggest club night in the UK with a 10,000 person capacity. The move also put it on a par with the current Guinness Book of World Records holder of the largest nightclub in the world, Privilege in Ibiza, which can also hold 10,000 revellers.  Parklife Festival  Lord co-created Parklife Festival in 2010, to celebrate artists across indie, house and techno music. It has hosted some of the biggest names in music, including Snoop Dogg, Liam Gallagher and Skepta. The weekend festival, which moved from Platt Fields to Heaton Park, Manchester in 2012,http://parklifetickets.co.uk/history-of-parklife-festival/ attracts 80,000 visitors each year. The Festival employs over 4,500 people over the weekend and brings more than ¬£10million into the local economy. Each year, it raises over ¬£100k for the Parklife Community Foundation, that is distributed to help local causes.  Hide Out Festival  Lord was one of the creators of Croatia‚Äôs Hideout Festival, a five-day alternative music extravaganza held on the island of Pag, Croatia, in 2011. It has sold out every single year since its conception.  Political Activity  In 2018, Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, appointed Lord as Greater Manchester‚Äôs first Night Time Economy Adviser, following in the footsteps of Amy Lam√©, who was appointed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan in 2016 to be the first London night czar. Lord is not paid for the role and any income created from the role has been donated directly to charity. He did not apply for the post, although it has been established that he lobbied Burnham on the importance of nightlife before the Labour politician won the inaugural mayoral elections in May 2017. The role acts to advise Burnham and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) on all issues relating to the night-time economy, providing a voice for workers, operators and the industry as a whole. Lord has since announced a raft of recommendations to improve safety, transport and cultural diversity in the region, including the introduction of later opening hours for greater accessibility and the development of night-time transport links to better serve under-represented communities on the outskirts of the region. Lord has also advocated for a fair wage policy for nighttime hospitality staff, including full transparency tipping for bar and restaurant workers. In January 2020, Lord appeared on BBC Question Time, alongside Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly, Labour‚Äôs Sarah Jones, National Farmers‚Äô Union (NFU) president Minette Batters and stand-up comedian Geoff Norcott. The transmission was the last episode to be broadcast before Britain left the European Union on 31 January 2020. During the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020, Lord was catapulted into the mainstream as the leading voice for the UK night life sector, and his expertise was called on by Paul Scully, the Secretary of State for Small Business, Consumers and Labour Markets in response to helping businesses survive the lockdowns placed on the sector.  Controversy  In 2006, The Warehouse Project was found solely responsible for an increase in drug-taking in Strangeways Prison, leading to the event being scrutinised. This was because the venue was right next door and the prisoners could hear the music. In 2012, Souvik Pal, aged 18, was ejected from a Warehouse Project event on suspicion of drug use; his body was found in nearby Bridgewater Canal 22 days later. In 2013, Nick Bonnie, 30, collapsed at the Warehouse Project after taking almost 15 times the standard recreational dose of MDMA, and subsequently died in hospital. Lord was not directly responsible for either incident, however, implemented drug-testing across events following the tragedies. In 2018, Lord called for all UK clubs and festivals to have drug- testing laboratories on site, and implemented the testing at The Warehouse Festival, which involves confiscated drugs being tested on site, and allowing alerts to be put out warning attendees of what the drugs actually are.  Charitable Work  Sacha Lord is patron of the Joshua Wilson Brain Tumour Charity (charity reg number 1151518). Lord is also an avid campaigner on the role of mental health services for those working in the night time economy. During the global Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Lord founded the UnitedWeStream Manchester campaign, a livestream gig website which raised over ¬£470,000 for businesses in the night time economy and charities in Greater Manchester including the Mayor's Homelessness Charity and music therapy charity, Nordoff Robbins, through a relief fund on the website. A number of artists performed on the live stream website, including Roger Sanchez and Paul Oakenfold.

She was the first such craft to run on Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. Launched in 1818, she transported people and supplies to sites and points of interest around the Great Lakes, before being grounded and wrecked in a gale force storm in Buffalo's bay in 1821. According to some sources, Walk-in-the-Water name originated from an Indian's impression of a steamboat moving (\\"walking\\") on the water with no sails. Description Walk-in-the-Water was built in 1818 at Black Rock, New York for the Lake Erie Steamboat Company by Noah Brown. Her keel was constructed at Scajaquada Creek, and she was launched sideways on May 28, 1818. Walk-in-the-Water was long with a beam of and a draft of . She had two masts, a quarterdeck raised above the spar deck, and a transom stern. A steamboat that ran on the Great Lakes in the early 19th century, there are no photos of the vessel, but there are several eyewitness accounts of its configuration. The raised quarterdeck allowed space for the cabins below, and better visibility for the helmsman as the ship's wheel was mounted on the quarterdeck at the stern. The hull was painted white overall, with two black stripes running the length of the vessel, and gray below the waterline. The rails were green, and the stem and transom were both ornamented with gold scrolling.Musham 1945. p. 32. Mounted in the bow was a four-pound wheeled cannon, used to announce the steamer's arrivals, departures and presence, as steam whistles had yet to be invented.Musham 1945. p. 31. Walk-in-the-Water was powered by a single cylinder, 73-horsepower crosshead steam engine with a bore and stroke, built in New York City by Robert McQueen.Musham 1945. p. 30 The engine was described as having \\"a curious arrangement of levers with as many cogs as a grist-mill\\", driving the paddlewheels, which were in diameter, through a series of gears. \\"Old-fashioned\\" coupling boxes between the main shaft and the paddlewheel shafts enabled the two paddlewheels to be individually engaged or disengaged. The boiler was built of copper, reportedly in length with a diameter of , with a single high smokestack. The fuel was wood, preferably \\"well-seasoned pine and hemlock split fine\\".McGreevy, 2018, Lakeshore GuardianHotchkiss, 1898, p. 332Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, 2019 The vessel is said to have had a speed of somewhere between 6 and 10 mph (9.7‚Äì16 km/h). According to one of her captains, Baton Atkins, she was named after a Wyandot Indian chief, who lived about south of the Detroit River.Palmer, 1821, Essay Alternatively, her name may have alluded to the expression \\"walks in the water\\", reputedly said by an Indian who had seen North River, Robert Fulton's pioneering steamboat, on the Hudson River in 1807.  Service history  Walk-in-the-Water at Detroit, 1820. This contemporaneous sketch by George H. Whistler appears to depict many details of the vessel accurately, such as the transom stern, raised quarterdeck and twin (black) stripes along the hull. Walk-in-the-Water was considered the pioneer of steamboat navigation on several of the Great Lakes,Hotchkiss, 1898, p. 104 the first steamboat to run on Lake Erie. Job Fish was Walk-in-the-Water's first captain. Chief engineer was Brock Grant, and the second engineer was his cousin, William Whitney Grant.Mansfield, 1899, Vol II, p. 265 Fish was dismissed when he rammed into the dock and blamed it on the engine crew. while he was cussing through the megaphone, where the company that owned Walk-in- the-Water soon found a replacement.McGreevy, Mensah (ed), 2019, Essay Walk-in- the-Water maiden voyage began on August 25, 1818, from Black Rock, New York, carrying 29 passengers, bound for Dunkirk, New York; Erie, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio, and her destination port of Detroit. Because she lacked sufficient power to make headway against the strong currents of the Niagara River, a team of 20 oxen were required to assist in hauling the steamboat out of the river on the first leg of this voyage.Heyl 1956. II. p. 275. The vessel then started her routine trips from Buffalo to Detroit on September 1, 1818. Buffalo at this time had no docks to accommodate large vessels. The steamboat completed her journey in about 9 days and traveled at about per hour on average. The fare for the trip in a cabin was $18 and less than half that for a bunk in steerage. Upon arrival in Cleveland, most of the townspeople came to the shore to greet the vessel. In September 1818, Walk-in-the-Water ran aground near Erie. After repairs, she traveled in 1819 to Mackinaw City, Michigan, via Lake Huron and then to Green Bay, Wisconsin, thus becoming the first steamboat to operate on both Lakes Huron and Michigan. The widely anticipated trip was announced in the May 1819 issue of the New York Mercantile Advertiser. It took ten days for the Walk-in-the-Water to travel from Buffalo to Detroit and back again carrying supplies and goods for the American Fur Company.Mansfield, 1899, Vol I, p. 596 During her employment on the Great Lakes, Walk-in-the-Waters passengers included many notable people, including generals Winfield Scott and Henry Leavenworth. The steamboat could accommodate one hundred cabin passengers along with a good number in the steerage deck. The vessel included a dining room, smoking room, and baggage room. = Loss = On November 1, 1821, Walk-in-the-Water was wrecked at night during gale force weather while near Buffalo, becoming the first steamboat wreck to occur on Lake Erie.Mansfield, 1899, Vol. I, p. 599 She was full of freight and carried 18 passengers. Bound for Detroit, the vessel, commanded by Captain J. Rogers, had departed Buffalo at 4p.m., on October 31 and proceeded to cross Lake Erie en route. Before reaching Point Abino some west of Buffalo on the Canadian shore of the lake, gale-force winds had developed. Captain Rogers made navigational efforts to avoid the winds but was unsuccessful. It was raining heavily and completely dark. The vessel was leaking badly, due to structural stress from the turbulent waters. In the late evening, the captain realized that it was virtually impossible to continue, so he turned about and proceeded back to Buffalo. After declining a dangerous proposal to dock in the river, the captain attempted to navigate to the city's pier. The light from the lighthouse was not visible because of the heavy rains and storm. At around 10 p.m., three anchors were dropped, unwittingly causing the vessel to plunge violently at its anchorage, while the leaking continued to worsen. Using the full power of the engine, the pumps were engaged while the vessel continued to drag her anchors. Walk-in-the-Water was now in imminent danger of foundering, and a decision was made to run the vessel towards the shore. After hours of toil, around 4:30 a.m., the captain ordered all passengers on deck to avoid the possibility of them being trapped below. Not knowing their exact location, and unable to see any lights from the shore, the crew cut the anchors. With the gale behind it, the vessel drifted towards shore, and finally made contact with the beach in Buffalo's bay, near the lighthouse. The next swell lifted the vessel and set her down with a crash, causing the keel of the boat to fracture in several places, wrecking her beyond repair. Her cargo, belonging to the passengers, was also considerably damaged.Buffalo Journal:Cleveland Weekly Herald, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 1821 Because of the darkness it was difficult for crew and passengers to know exactly where they had landed. There were no casualties involved, as all the passengers made their way to the lighthouse and took refuge inside by its fireplace. One of the passengers, Mary Palmer, who was aboard the Walk-in-the-Water on her first regular voyage and present during her final voyage, later wrote an account of the ship's loss.Cleveland Weekly Herald, November 13, 1821Mansfield, 1899, Vol. I, pp. 599‚Äì600 Sometime later the engine of Walk-in-the-Water was salvaged and placed in the new steamboat Superior, built as a replacement for Walk-in-the-Water. In 1835 the engine was again re-used, in the saw mill of Gardner Williams in Saginaw City, Michigan.Hotchkiss, 1898, p. 94 Legacy On March 3, 1989, the United States Postal Service issued a 25-cent postage stamp depicting and commemorating the Walk-in-the-Water.Smithsonian National Postal Museum Modern day historian and artist, Robert McGreevy, who writes for the Lake Shore Guardian, a historical news forum of Great Lake's history, gives lectures on the history surrounding Walk-in-the-Water and has recently completed a painting of the vessel.McGreevy, Mensah (ed), 2019, Essay See also * Yellowstone and Emilie, other steamboats that played pioneering and record-breaking roles during the mid-19th century * Joseph LaBarge, famous steamboat captain, designer and builder of the early to mid-19th century * Ontario, the first steam-driven sidewheeler steamboat to see active service on the Great Lakes, at Lake Ontario * Independence, the first steamboat to run on Lake Superior, in 1846 * Spread Eagle (steamboat), owned by the American Fur Company, one of the first such vessels to navigate the upper Missouri River Notes References Bibliography * p. 275\\\\.

He also taught himself the Lakota language. He managed to write as many as 800 letters per year. Balmer, at the suggestion of the Bureau of Indian Affairs also reached out to various Indian reservations in South Dakota befriending a number of the few surviving veterans of the Indian Wars. The descendants of Chief Red Cloud at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation adopted Balmer into the family bestowing upon him the Lakota name Wambli Ista [Eagle Eye], a fact into which he took great pride. Over the years Balmer acquired hundreds of first edition books on Native American subjects by notable authors, many of which are inscribed personally to him. He also owned an impressive collection of Native American artifacts, among of which is a pair of moccasins once owned by James Henry Red Cloud (1879-1960), grandson of the great chief Red Cloud and a warbonnet trailer decorated with eagle feathers that had belonged to Jackson \\"Jack\\" Red Cloud (ca. 1858-1918), the former's son. Balmer also assembled a vast collection of period photographs by notable photographers such as David Francis Barry, Orlando Scott Goff, John C. H. Grabill, Stanley J. Morrow, Frank Bennett Fiske, George W. Scott, Laton Alton Huffman, George E. Trager & Frederick Kuhn and others. By the 1950s Balmer's reputation as an Native American expert had become legendary, even though he never set foot onto the American continent or ever personally encountered a Native American.

A large body of research has previously linked low socioeconomic status to poor physical and mental health outcomes, including early mortality. Low socioeconomic status is hypothesized to get ‚Äúunder the skin‚Äù by producing chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis, which increases allostatic load, leading to the pathogenesis of chronic disease. However, some individuals of low socioeconomic status do not appear to experience the expected, negative health effects associated with growing up in poverty. To account for this, the Shift- and-Persist Model proposes that, as children, some individuals of low socioeconomic status learn adaptive strategies for regulating their emotions (‚Äúshifting‚Äù) and focusing on their goals (‚Äúpersisting‚Äù) in the face of chronic adversity. According to this model, the use of shift-and-persist strategies diminishes the typical negative effects of adversity on health by leading to more adaptive biological, cognitive, and behavioral responses to daily stressors.  Shift strategies  Broadly, ‚Äúshift‚Äù strategies encompass a variety of cognitive and emotion self-regulation approaches that individuals use to deal with stress, including cognitive restructuring, reframing, reappraisal, and acceptance strategies, which change the meaning of a stressor or reduce its emotional impact. These shift strategies particularly focus on changing one's response to a stressor, instead of attempting to change the situation or stressor itself. As shift strategies depend more on internal processes (self-control and regulation), than external resources, it is hypothesized that shift strategies may be particularly adaptive responses to the chronic, uncontrollable stressors that are associated with low socioeconomic status.  Persist strategies  According to Chen and Miller, ‚Äúpersist‚Äù strategies are any strategies that help individuals to maintain optimism about the future, create meaning from their experiences of challenge and hardship, and persist ‚Äúwith strength in the face of adversity.‚Äù  Measurement  To evaluate the combination of shift-and-persist strategy use, distinct \\"shift‚Äù and ‚Äúpersist‚Äù constructs were initially measured separately by using multiple, self-report measures of reappraisal, emotional reactivity, and future orientation in early research on this model. In 2015, Chen and colleagues published the Shift-and-Persist Scale, which is a combined self- report measure that assesses both shift and persist strategies. The Shift-and- Persist Scale has been validated for use with adults and teenagers. The questionnaire asks respondents to rate how well 14 statements about various approaches to dealing with life stressors apply to them on a 1-4 scale. Out of the 14 items on the measure, 4 assess a respondent's use of shift strategies, 4 load onto persist strategies, and 6 items are non-relevant distractors that are ignored during scoring. When scoring the Shift-and-Persist Scale, one item (#4) is reverse-scored. This scale is publicly available online. A simplified 5-item Shift-and-Persist scale has also been published for use with younger children and adolescents (ages 9‚Äì15). Total scores on this version of the Shift-and-Persist Scale range from 0-20, such that higher scores are indicative of greater use of shift-and-persist strategies. This scale is also publicly available online and has been previously used in research with children from kindergarten through 8th grade.  Proposed mechanisms  = Reduction of the harmful biological effects of stress = The shift-and- persist model mainly hypothesizes that these strategies have protective effects for the health of low socioeconomic status individuals because they affect biological and physiological stress response tendencies that are relevant for disease. There is some evidence that shift responses (e.g., reappraisal) to acute stressors are associated with attenuated physiological responses to stress, including reduced cardiovascular reactivity. Specifically, reappraisal has been linked to a ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù pattern of hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis response characterized by a rapid return to homeostasis (i.e., faster cortisol recovery) in the wake of a stressor. Persist tendencies, such as optimism, have also been associated with adaptive immune responses and faster cortisol recovery. By constraining the magnitude and duration of biological stress responses, including cardiovascular, hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis, and inflammatory responses to stress, shift-and-persist responses are hypothesized to prevent the wear and tear on these systems that increases allostatic load and risk for chronic diseases of aging. Cross-sectional studies provide some evidence that greater emotion regulation abilities are associated with reduced health risk on a variety of indicators of allostatic load. Similarly, self-reported trait levels of optimism and purpose in life have been linked to better concurrent health and health trajectories over time. However, most of the health benefits associated with shift-and-persist consistent strategies are only seen in low socioeconomic status samples. = Enhancement of adaptive biological stress- recovery systems = Another alternative, but not mutually exclusive hypothesis, is that shift-and-persist strategies affect health by increasing or up-regulating biological responses that enhance stress recovery and resilience. In particular, the parasympathetic nervous system's functioning may be enhanced by shift-and-persist response tendencies. Emotion regulation abilities that are consistent with shift-coping have been linked to greater parasympathetic nervous system functioning at rest, as indexed by higher levels of high-frequency heart rate variability. Further, the parasympathetic nervous system is highly integrated with, and may contribute to the down- regulation of hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis and immune system stress responses that influence allostatic load over time. Although parasympathetic nervous system activity is correlated with aspects of shift-and-persist coping, it is not yet established that the use of these strategies actually increases parasympathetic nervous system activity. The oxytocin system has also been identified as another potential mechanism by which shift-and-persist strategies could influence health outcomes. Oxytocin is a hormone that has been linked to a wide range of positive social and emotional functions and can be used to effectively attenuate hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system responses to stress. However, there is little research examining the interplay between shift-and-persist strategy use and the oxytocin system. = Impact on health behaviors = It has also been proposed that shift-and-persist strategies may buffer health outcomes in individuals of low socioeconomic status by affecting health behaviors. Previous research has demonstrated that, regardless of socioeconomic status, individuals with emotion regulation difficulties are also likely to engage in poorer health behaviors, including over-eating, sedentary lifestyle, risky sexual health behaviors, and drug use. Individuals of low socioeconomic status who learn to regulate their emotions more effectively, by using ‚Äúshift‚Äù strategies in childhood, may be more likely then their peers with emotion regulation difficulties to establish and sustain positive health behaviors throughout development. Similarly, persist strategies that help individuals to maintain a positive focus on the future may also affect wellbeing through health behaviors. Prior studies have linked being ‚Äúfuture-oriented‚Äù to lower levels of drug use and sexual risk behaviors. Therefore, it is possible that individuals who regularly use shift-and-persist strategies will be more likely to practice positive health behaviors, which promote healthy development and aging. However, it is important to note that the relationships between emotion regulation abilities and health behavior are bidirectional. Health behaviors, such as physical activity and sleep hygiene, can also have powerful effects on our capacity to successfully regulate emotions.  Research support for associations with health  Since 2012, integrative research groups concerned with clinical health psychology, social psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, and public health have begun to evaluate the relationships postulated by the shift-and-persist model. The majority of empirical studies on this topic test whether shift-and-persist strategies are associated with differential health outcomes in low vs. high socioeconomic status samples. Thus far, high levels of shift-and-persist strategy use have been linked to: * Lower total allostatic load in adults who grew up in low, but not high, socioeconomic status households. * Lower body mass index in children from low, but not high, socioeconomic status families. * Reduced low-grade inflammation in adolescents (and parents) from low ssocioeconomic status families. * A ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù profile of hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis functioning, as indexed by diurnal cortisol in children from low socioeconomic status families. * Lower levels of asthma-related impairment and inflammation in children from low, but not high, socioeconomic status families. * Better asthma profiles in children and teens from families reporting low, but not high, perceived social status. * Lower levels of depressive symptoms in Latinx youth from low, but not high, income families. Although it has been proposed that a variety of psychological interventions for at-risk youth of low socioeconomic status may reduce health disparities, in part, by increasing shift-and-persist tendencies in families, the majority of studies on shift-and-persist have been cross-sectional. Therefore, it remains unknown if shift-and-persist strategies play a causal role in reducing the negative impact of low socioeconomic status on health. More longitudinal and treatment studies are needed to evaluate directional and causal hypotheses based upon the shift-and-persist model.

In May 2017, sailor Jennifer Appel and landsman Tasha Fuiava left Honolulu with their two dogs aboard a fully stocked and equipped Sea Nymph. According to the women, on their first night afloat, their boat took damage from a \\"force 11 storm\\"; further damage was inflicted by a typhoon, leaving the boat functionally adrift and incommunicado. Tiger shark attacks, a white squall, and Fuiava's inexperience supposedly caused further problems for the four. Almost six months after leaving Hawaii, Sea Nymph was spotted by a Taiwanese fishing vessel, and though Appel would later claim the larger boat was attacking theirs, she was able to use their satellite phone to contact the United States Coast Guard for help. arrived to rescue Appel, Fuiava, and their dogs, but left Sea Nymph adrift after determining it to be unseaworthy. After their rescue and the media attention it garnered, the two-woman crew of the erstwhile Sea Nymph were questioned about many aspects of their story. Experts in sailing, meteorology, Hawaiian seamanship, and marine biology, as well as the Coast Guard and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office disputed claims made. Appel continued to stand by their statements. If unrecoverable, she could not collect Sea Nymph insurance, though the ship was spotted still afloat about four months later. Background Appel and Fuiava, October 2017 Jennifer Appel (born ) and Tasha Fuiava (born ) were residents of Hawaii, and met in December 2016. Within a week of meeting, they had planned an 18-day trip, sailing to Tahiti‚Äî Appel was an experienced sailor while Fuiava was a novice. Appel wrecked her first boat, a fiberglass sloop, in 2012. Sea Nymph is a sailboat, and was stocked with two desalinators as well as non-perishables such as \\"beef jerky, oatmeal, rice, pasta, dried fruits, [and] nuts\\". The boat was also equipped with a properly registered, fully operational emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station (EPIRB). Adrift Appel and Fuiava were residents of Honolulu, living with two dogs (Zeus and Valentine) aboard their sailboat Sea Nymph. The women said they set sail from Hawaii on May 3, 2017 for an 18-day, voyage to Tahiti, but encountered a \\"force 11 storm\\" (winds between , waves from ) that same night. This initial storm lasted three nights and three days. Four days later, the boat's spreader broke. The pair considered returning to Hawaii, but did not because neither Maui nor Lanai had deep-enough harbors to accommodate Sea Nymph. Further problems occurred, including tiger shark attacks, damage to their engine and mast, and malfunctions in their radiotelephone and Iridium satellite phone. Lacking communications, Sea Nymph failed to avoid a typhoon with winds and waves. The women headed for Kiribati, but couldn't land due to broken communications equipment. The Cook Islands were their next target, but a white squall and Fuiava's inexperience pushed them further west. On October 1, Sea Nymph came within of Wake Island, and the women aboard managed to contact officials there. However, the boat was on the wrong side of the island to receive assistance, and both the swell and winds were pushing them westward, preventing them from looping around. Rescue On October 24, southeast of Japan, Sea Nymph was spotted by a Taiwanese fishing vessel. Initial reports say the Taiwanese notified the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in Guam, and began towing the lost boat, compromising its hull. Once they knew rescue was on its way, Appel and Fuiava began broadcasting a mayday. Appel later changed this part of her story, saying the Taiwanese ship had instead attacked Sea Nymph by intentionally failing to keep the appropriate towing distance and colliding with the much smaller vessel: \\"The Taiwanese fishing vessel was not planning to rescue us [‚Ä¶] They tried to kill us during the night.\\" Appel claimed she was able to use the Taiwanese satellite phone and alert the USCG of all this because nobody aboard the Taiwanese ship spoke English. was on a routine deployment nearby, and arrived on October 25 at 10:30a.m. Rescuing the two women and two dogs at 1:18p.m., the Navy determined Sea Nymph to be unseaworthy and left the boat adrift off the coast of Asia. Appel and Fuiava were given \\"medical assessments, food, and berthing arrangements\\" aboard Ashland until the ship could deliver the four to its next port of call: White Beach Naval Facility, a US Naval base in Okinawa. In a press conference aboard Ashland, Appel stated that, \\"Had they not been able to locate us, we would have been dead within 24 hours\\". Upon arriving in Okinawa on October 30, Zeus and Valentine were quarantined while Appel and Fuiava recovered at the US consulate in Naha. Inconsistencies Asked about the unused EPIRB by CNN, United States Coast Guard (USCG) PO2 Tara Molle said, \\"I can't speculate as to why they wouldn't have activated it.\\" On 31 October, Appel said that they didn't activate the EPIRB because their boat was still seaworthy; \\"EPIRB calls are for people who are in an immediate life threatening scenario [‚Ä¶] It would be shameful to call on the USCG resources when not in imminent peril and allow someone else to perish because of it.\\" She followed this up saying, \\"Had we known our calls were going nowhere ‚Äî we would have used the EPIRB ‚Äî but hindsight is 20/20\\". On November 8, Appel told Today Matt Lauer that after activating the EPIRB, it would take taken emergency services 4‚Äì24 hours to arrive; the USCG disputed such a delay, citing \\"cases in remote Alaska where a ship in distress just using one form of beacon brought a fairly quick response from nearby fishing boats and the Coast Guard.\\" Appel defended their decision saying, \\"we took our chances with the man upstairs, who gave us grace and allowed us to still be here today.\\" After she amended her version of events with the alleged Taiwanese attack on Sea Nymph, Appel said she eschewed the EPIRB because it would have immediately alerted the Taiwanese captain, as opposed to her telephoning Guam and relaying her emergency in English. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific-Ocean weather readings for May 3, 2017 Appel and Fuiava said they encountered a \\"force 11 storm\\" on May 3. Though the National Weather Service in Hawaii issued a small craft advisory for the  ªAlenuihƒÅhƒÅ and Pailolo Channels that day, it recorded \\"no organized storm systems near the Hawaiian Islands on the dates of May 3, 2017 or the few days afterward.\\" Not only is the claim that Maui and Lanai harbors could not accommodate Sea Nymph untrue, but Hawai ªi has multiple such places to dock. Furthermore, Appel's descriptions of other landing opportunities not taken seem to confuse Kiritimati (population over 2,000 people) for being uninhabited. As for the claims of tiger shark attacks, marine biologists refuted this, saying that the macropredators don't behave that way, nor do they grow to the lengths reported. On October 30, USCG spokesperson Lt. Scott Carr announced that in June, the Coast Guard contacted a ship calling itself Sea Nymph in the vicinity of Tahiti. That ship's captain said their ship was in no distress, and would make landfall the next day. According to the timeline given by Appel and Fuiava, this interaction happened after they allegedly had loss of engine and mast/rigging damage. On Today, Appel produced a GPS tracking unit, claiming that it was from her boat, and that it recorded Sea Nymph \\"nowhere near Tahiti\\". As for Appel's allegations against the Taiwanese ship, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office called them untrue, citing the Taiwanese vessel's \\"GPS and a satellite system that automatically submits its track, location, and speed to a 24-hour monitoring center. [‚Ä¶] the fishing vessel stopped sailing right after spotting Ms. Appel's boat and never attempted to ram against their vessel or kill them as she claimed\\". Aftermath Of the inconsistencies, the United States Navy stated that it doesn't investigate such incidents, while , the Coast Guard was still reviewing the case. Appel and Fuiava's story received enough attention that a tabloid published nude photos of the older woman from her time as a dominatrix in the 2000s. Furthermore, prior to ceasing contact altogether, Appel's family in Texas told her they didn't want her to return home. By mid- November 2017, both women were in New York City, having been flown there by Today. In an interview with The Guardian, they each expressed a desire to return to the sea, preferably aboard a recovered Sea Nymph. If Sea Nymph is unrecoverable, Appel cannot receive its insurance money because it was abandoned more than from shore. Zeus and Valentine required vaccinations before they could return to Hawaii, but Appel left her wallet aboard the boat, and was running out of cash. Since the dogs could not return to Hawaii until December at the earliest, Appel and Fuiava were planning a trans-continental road trip saying, \\"Eventually, we're either going to find out my boat has been found or we're going to start working on a new boat [‚Ä¶] We are incredibly appreciative of the navy, [‚Ä¶] if I had it to do again, I would just keep going.\\" During the 2017‚Äì2018 Volvo Ocean Race, Sea Nymph was spotted by Turn the Tide on Plastic on February 13 (UTC) during the sixth leg of the yacht race. Turn the Tide on Plastic was between Hong Kong and Auckland, approximately east of Guam. Captain Dee Caffari described the abandoned boat as \\"sitting pretty low in the bow and her mainsail was washed over the side but the rest of her looked like she would make a nice cruiser.\\" In the interests of the race, Sea Nymph was left where it was found, \\"a hazard to shipping, a risk to islands, reefs and atolls and slowly not going anywhere.\\" References Category:2017 controversies Sea Nymph Category:sea rescue Category:transport controversies ","title":"Rescue of Sea Nymph"},{"id":"61936808","text":"Diaa Jubaili (, (·∏åƒ´ya Jubaylƒ´); born 23 May 1977) is an Iraqi novelist and writer from the city of Basra.

On 19 June 1802, she was created Baroness Sandys, with a special remainder to her second, third, fourth and fifth sons respectively, and finally to her eldest son, who had succeeded his father as Marquess of Downshire.

Sadfishing is said to hurt younger people, exposing them to bullying and child grooming. This is due to people sharing their personal and emotional stories online, often getting targeted. Another consequence of this behaviour is that people with \\"real problems\\" end up being overlooked or even accused of sadfishing themselves and being bullied for it. Young people who seek support online have started being accused of sadfishing, a report has said. The report says that the accusations of sadfishing could further harm young people with mental health problems. Sadfishing is related to cyberbullying, and is often looked upon as a method of attention seeking. Sadfishing has been said to attract a lot of bullies and paedophiles.  Background  The first known usage of the word sadfishing was in January 2019, in an article for the Metro, written by Rebecca Reid in reference to Kendall Jenner's Instagram posts about her acne problems, posting pictures of herself while talking about it. The term was later picked up by Good Morning Britain, where they did an interview and talked about it. It started trending on social media at the start of October 2019, with several news channels and newspapers picking it up.  Potential causes  Sadfishing can be caused by many things, the main reason being that someone doesn't get enough attention, and/or has low self-respect. This is proven by the fact that people sadfishing are looking for compliments: very close to narcissistic behaviour, but with desire for compliments from other people for self-satisfaction. Sometimes adults partake in sadfishing because of jealousy. When someone finds themselves threatened by another person who takes all the attention, they may respond with sadfishing behaviour. Loneliness can result in sadfishing as well; by posting about their emotional problems, people tend to crave attention. Posts about anxiety and depression are really common while sadfishing, as people tend to show care and give attention to the one sadfishing. Another reason for sadfishing can be that someone feels uncomfortable sharing feelings with their close friends or family, and as a result they turn to social media to share feelings for sympathy and attention. Anti-social behaviour can lead to sadfishing as well: if someone has no friends and no one to talk to, she or he often ends up sharing it online. Another reason for sadfishing can be trolling; people will troll and see if they can hook an audience onto themselves. Sadfishing can also be because of actually wanting help; people tend to sadfish in order to feel better, after letting people know that they need help.  Separating sadfishing from crisis  It can be difficult to tell if a person is looking for support, sympathy, or if the person is at risk for harming themselves. This is due to the fact that social media often lacks context and the ability to read nonverbal cues, says Dr. Lindsey Giller, a clinical psychologist in New York. People at risk for suicide will show other signs in addition to talking about suicide; such as a deepening depression, expression of feeling trapped, feelings of worthlessness, or a preoccupation with death. They may even post online if they are considering suicide or self-harm; this can help stop suicide or self-harm if taken seriously. Taking people seriously is a must, as talking about suicide can be a plea for help, and can also be a late sign in the progression towards a suicide attempt. There is no way to know if a friend is suffering or in crisis, or is only seeking attention, especially if you're not a mental health professional. As such, each alarming post should be taken seriously, notes Dr. Jelena Kecmanovic, a clinical psychologist in Arlington, Virginia.

Written by John J. Gray and directed by Liz Friedlander, it aired on October 30, 2019, on the cable network FX. Plot In 1948, Camp Redwood was known as Golden Star Camp. Lavinia Richter works there as a cook so her sons Benjamin (Richter) and Bobby can have a fun summer. They go down to the lake to swim, but Benjamin leaves Bobby to watch a lifeguard and counselor have sex. Bobby goes into the lake and is killed by a motor boat propeller. Lavinia is distraught and blames everyone, including Benjamin, for the death of her son. In 1989, Donna, having faked Brooke's death and rescued her from the prison, tries to care for her, who is skeptical and threatens her for an answer. Donna explains that she is trying to make things right. Brooke sees a newspaper showing Camp Redwood's concert event, and states that she wants to go back and kill Margaret. Donna takes Brooke to a roller rink hoping she can change her mind, but Brooke still wants to go back to the camp. A man named Bruce approaches them and asks for a ride. Donna refuses, but when he fixes her car she reluctantly gives him a ride. During the ride, Bruce unnerves the girls and they pull over. Before Bruce can get out, a police car pulls up behind them. When the cop approaches, Bruce shoots him and the women drive off. Bruce kills the cop and takes his car. Richter returns to Redwood and is ambushed by his victims, out for revenge for killing them. They bring him to the other ghosts, who are infuriated and demand to know why he has returned to the camp. Richter explains that he came to kill Richard Ramirez in revenge for killing his wife. They tell Richter that they are terrorized by a woman dressed in a white night gown, who chases them. Richter realizes that the woman is his mother and explains that after Bobby's death, Lavinia went insane and slaughtered the staff. When Lavinia grabbed hold of Benjamin, he fatally stabbed her in self- defense. When Xavier guides Richter to an abandoned cabin, Richter enters alone and is greeted by Lavinia. She is disgusted with Richter and it's revealed that she manipulated Margaret into carrying out the 1970 massacre and blaming Richter for the crime. She disappears, leaving a devastated Richter alone in the cabin. Bruce speeds toward Donna's car and rear ends it, knocking the two unconscious. Brooke awakens in the car with Bruce and he gives her two options: put the car into drive and drag Donna who is tied to the back of the car, or he would shoot her and drag Donna himself. Brooke takes a third option and puts the car into reverse, then shoots Bruce with his own gun. Donna tries to choke him, but Brooke stops her. At Camp Redwood, Kajagoogoo's tour bus arrives. Trevor reunites with Montana's ghost. Donna and Brooke tie Bruce to a road sign and cut off both his thumbs. Brooke then leaves for Redwood and Donna insists that she join her to see things through to the end. During the night, Courtney walks into the tour bus and finds all the members of Kajagoogoo dead. Richter sits on the dock and Lavinia approaches him. She demands that he leave. Richter explains that he has a son named after Bobby. Lavinia encourages Richter to kill himself before Ramirez comes to collect his soul. She disappears and Richter kills himself with his knife. His ghost appears, takes the knife, and leaves the dock. Reception \\"The Lady in White\\" was watched by 1.05 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.5 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received largely positive reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"The Lady in White\\" holds a 90% approval rating, based on 10 reviews with an average rating of 7.4/10. Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4/5, saying, \\"That's a [...] brilliant bit of scripting from John J. Gray, who gives both Lily Rabe and John Carroll Lynch a lot of meaty material to work with. Rabe in particular leans into her material hard, and as an AHS veteran, she knows how to play up the campier aspects of her wailing widow character by chewing every bit of scenery she can find and spitting it back aggressively into the face of Lynch, who uses his considerable size to good effect by visibly shrinking in the face of his mother's wrath.\\" He also praised McDermott's character and performance, commenting that he is \\"great at going from aggressive and confident to a scared, sobbing wreck, and this role plays perfectly into his strengths as an actor.\\" He concluded his review by \\"People die, people come back, ghosts haunt a campground while thinking up revenge plots, and a one-hit wonder 80's band is slaughtered, and even the most predictable aspects of AHS are still pretty wild when compared to everything else on television.\\" Kat Rosenfield of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B- rating. She praised the return of series veterans Rabe and McDermott, as she started her review by \\"Familiar faces from AHS seasons past make this episode extra-haunted.\\" She also enjoyed the opening scene/flashback, commenting that the \\"episode starts strong\\". While she criticized Brooke's and Donna's nonsense decision of taking Bruce with them, she appreciated the scene where Brooke defends herself against the hitchhiker. Rosenfield also noted how this episode used the same narrative since the beginning of the season, as \\"everyone converges on the camp, again, and people start dying, again.\\" However, she enjoyed the final scenes between Richter and his mother. Overall, she appreciated the episode but criticized its similarities with Friday the 13th, commenting that it was \\"more like a blatant rip-off\\". Variety Andrea Reiher gave a positive review, and said \\"Last week‚Äôs episode of American Horror Story took all the 1984 characters and jumped them forward in time by five years. It seemed to be setting up a reunion back at Camp Redwood, which was about to be reopened. But when the seventh episode, entitled \\"The Lady in White\\", began, it did so catapulting viewers back in time even further. Because in order to understand where pivotal players are going this season, one must understand from where they came.\\" References External links * Category:American Horror Story: 1984 episodes Category:Matricide in fiction ","title":"The Lady in White (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"61937026","text":"The 1940‚Äì41 Oshkosh All-Stars season was the All-Stars' fourth year in the United States' National Basketball League (NBL), which was also the fourth year the league existed.

Background The 1990s during The Troubles in Northern Ireland brought back sectarian tit-for-tat killings that plagued Belfast, Armagh, Tyrone and parts of the Republic of Ireland in the mid 1970s. The main groups involved in the killings were the Loyalist paramilitary groups the UFF, the Red Hand Commando and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), on one side and on the other side the Republican paramilitary groups, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), the Irish People's Liberation Organization (IPLO) and to a lesser extent the Provisional IRA (IRA), although the Republican groups did not like each other, they agreed the Loyalists had to be attacked back, but they had no combined force unlike the Loyalists who had the Combined Loyalist Military Command to plan attacks together. The IRA did not involve themselves in random wildcat attacks on Protestant pubs and clubs like the IPLO and INLA, but instead would try to kill leading Loyalist paramilitary members from the UDA and UVF, for example on the 29 June the IRA shot dead a Belfast UDA Commander Cecil McKnight and on the 9 August they shot UDA Derry commander Gary Lynch. The IRA claimed these killings were revenge for the UDA killing of Sinn F√©in member Eddie Fullerton and the killing of other Nationalist civilians. A week after the death of Gary Lynch the UDA killed another Sinn F√©in member and former IRA volunteer Thomas Donaghy.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack - UDA: Inside The Heart Of Loyalist Terror (Penguin Ireland) pp.200 On the same day the UVF shot dead IPLO member Martin O'Prey. The Road to Devenish Arms A month before the attack, the IRA went on the rampage on the 13 November, they had got a list of addresses of top Loyalists to shoot dead, first home they broke into belonged to a UDA man Billy Kingsberry (44) who they shot dead, also in the house with him was a young member of the Red Hand Commando (RHC) Samuel Mehaffey (19) they shot him also. The next house the IRA went to was owned by a UVF man two Protestant civilian workers were doing work in the UVF home when the IRA broke in and mistook the two Protestant workers for Loyalists and shot them dead, they were brothers Stephen Lynn (30) and Kenneth Lynn (28). The IRA also fired shots at Johnny Adair's house and they also booby-trapped the car of Gerry Drumgoole one of Adair's men in his unit, but even though Drumgoole was not killed he did lose a leg when the car exploded in Hazelfield Street.Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack - UDA: Inside The Heart Of Loyalist Terror(Penguin Ireland) pp.208 The very next day the UVF hit back killing two Catholic civilians and one Protestant civilian who they mistook for a Catholic, during the 1991 Craigavon killings. These were the last killings of the year that the UVF claimed credit for. Ten days later the IRA hit back against the Loyalists, when the IRA managed to plant a time bomb in the Loyalist dining area of Crumlin Road Prison, two Loyalists were killed, one from the UVF and one from the UDA/UFF, eight others were wounded, see: Crumlin Road Prison bombing for more information. The UDA/UFF took revenge the day after on the 25 November shooting dead a Catholic civilian deliveryman on Kandahar Street. On 21 December early in the morning the INLA shot dead Robin Farmer (19) a Protestant civilian. Before the UDA/UFF even had time to retaliate the IPLO shot up a pub in the Donegall Arms shooting at the evening time, in which two more Protestant civilians were killed. Later that same night the UDA/UFF killed a Catholic civilian shooting him dead at his home on Fortuna Street, Belfast. Attack on Devenich Arms According to the Irish writer Henry McDonald there was at least two gunmen from Johnny Adair's \\"C\\" Company at the Devenish Arms. They smashed their way in through the bar and started firing at people, the people inside the pub first believed it was somebody playing a prank with fireworks, and nobody bothered to dive for cover. But Aidan Wallace (22) a Catholic civilian was hit twice in the back by a range of only nine inches. Some sources that next Stephen McKeag himself walked calmly around the pub, pointing his 9 mm pistol at different people, picking his target. He finally stopped at an eight year old boy, the child was shot in the head and although he did not die he lost one of his eyes. One of the Loyalists shouted \\"Out, out, out\\" and the two UDA/UFF killers fled the scene firing more shots in the air as they left. Aftermath The reason no more people were killed was because the UFF hitmen were using Chinese ammunition from their Lebanese haul they got in the late 80's and the Chinese ammunition was always faulty and jammed on them on a number of occasions between 1990 - 1992.Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack - UDA: Inside The Heart Of Loyalist Terror(Penguin Ireland) pp.209 In 1991 the UDA killed 15 people and the UVF 19, that is 34 altogether only about half a dozen short of the people killed by the IRA and Republicans, in 1992 the Loyalists would equal the Republican kill count for the year and in 1993 they would surpass it.

The 3,000 square foot plot of land is located at the end of Pond Farm Road, near the border with Westwood. In 1863, Hannah B. Chickering established the Temporary Asylum for Discharged Female Prisoners on land that once belonged to Eliphalet Pond in Dedham. The halfway house served women who had left prison, and the children buried there were born to them. Many of the women, who were housed with men, were sexually assaulted while in prison. There are 11 small, oval stones made of marble marking the graves of children, but records indicate that at least two more were buried there. The oldest was two years and one day old, and most were less than one year old. All died between 1871 and 1882 and it has since closed. It is thought that there could be as many as 50 more bodies buried there, including some women. The land was purchased in the late 1940s by Joseph Stivaletta, a local developer. He discovered the graves and, rather than disturb them, set the land aside and did not build a home on it. When Massachusetts Route 128 was being constructed, Stivaletta convinced then- Transportation Secretary John Volpe to move the road rather than disturb the graves. Volpe's family came from the same small town in Italy as Stivaletta. Stivaletta died in 1956 and property taxes were not paid on the property, resulting in a lein being placed on the property in 1963. Neighbors cared for the property for many years, mowing the grass and planting flowers. The Town of Dedham was unaware of the cemetery's existence until alerted to it by a neighbor in 1991. Town Meeting voted to accept the cemetery in 1998 after being gifted the land from the Stivaletta family.

For her bachelor's degree, Zentner studied business administration at the University of Colorado. She continued her studies at the University of Colorado to pursue a master's degree in economics with a focus in econometrics.  Career  After graduate school, Zentner began her career at Texas State Comptroller as a Senior Economist in the Revenue Estimating Division. She worked there for five years, from 1998 - 2003, for Carole Keeton Strayhorn There, she did a study on how the state of Texas's different taxes impacted households of different income levels. Zentner moved to New York to work on Wall Street at the Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. She worked as Senior US Macro Economist for eight years and monitored the U.S. economy to make forecasts. In May 2011, Zentner moved to Nomura Securities International, where she served as a Senior Economist for Fixed Income. In August 2013, Zentner joined Morgan Stanley, as a Senior U.S. Economist and Managing Director. In February 2015, Zentner was appointed as Chief U.S. Economist. = Economic and academic advisory panels = In 2015‚Äì2016, Zentner was president of New York Association for Business Economics. Zentner is currently involved in the New York Federal Reserve Bank's Economic Advisory panel, the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank's Academic Advisory Panel, and the American Bankers' Association Economic Advisory Committee. Zentner also sits on the board of directors for the National Association for Business Economics.  Research and forecasts  = \\"The Economic Cost of Inequality\\" = There are three parts in this paper: historic view of income and inequality, how income inequality has grown since the financial crisis, observable factors to close the income inequality gap. Historically, inequality has always been growing, as Zentner says, \\"For decades, the average American household had been taking on more and more debt to supplement the lack of income growth, all so that Middle America could stay, well, in the middle\\". Zentner says, \\"What the financial crisis did was lay bare the ugliness of a growing income gap by removing the layer of debt accumulation that had been masking its presence\\". However, wages have been increasing among small businesses, households are experiencing less debt and more savings, and workers are having greater job stability. = \\"Millennials, Gen Z and the Coming \\"Youth Boom\\" Economy\\" = Zentner discusses the implications of Gen Z, the generation born between 1997 - 2012, who will likely dominate the U.S. by 2034. Zentner and her economic team at Morgan Stanley project that the combination of Gens Y and Z in the U.S. workforce will yield higher consumption, wages, and housing demand, thus stimulating GDP growth. However, these impacts of the demographic shifts are not taken into account in the Congressional Budget Office's projections for growth in the labour force. Zentner says, \\"The CBO projections understate potential labor-force growth by 0.2 to 0.3% per year in the 15 years through 2040. We concluded that the CBO forecasts could be underestimating the level of potential GDP in 2040 by as much as 2.4% to 4.3%‚Äù. Besides beyond-average GDP growth, Social Security and Medicare solvency have an optimistic outlook. Between the 2020s and 2040s, investors may take a bullish view on the U.S. economy. Zentner says, ‚ÄúPowered by the economic machine of Gens Y and Z, the prime working-age population is projected to accelerate into the 2030...We project trend consumption growth moves up steadily to average 2.5% in the 2030s, driven by Millennials, and then Gen Z, moving through their prime working years\\". Some supporting contributors of the \\"youth boom\\" include: new Gen Z entrants to the workforce are more financially stable compared to Millennials, more jobs are available, cheaper college tuition, better skills match to available jobs, and no generational gap between Millennials and Gen Z, thus driving an increase in productivity in the workforce. A virtuous cycle of growth is created to the growing labour force, productivity, income, and consumer spending.  Awards and recognition  Zetner received the Lawrence Klein Award in 2018 and 2020.

He studied in the Soviet Union, enlisted in the Chinese Red Army, and participated in the Long March. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, he served as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, China's first ambassador to Yugoslavia, and Vice Minister of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China. After being imprisoned for eight years during the Cultural Revolution, Wu was appointed Deputy Chief of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department in 1975 and later served as vice president of the special court that tried and convicted the Gang of Four and the Lin Biao clique of numerous crimes during the Cultural Revolution.  Early life and education  Wu was born in March 1908 in Wuchang, Hubei, toward the end of the Qing dynasty, with his ancestral home in Yangxin County. While studying at Wuhan Middle School, he was active in the student movement and became a member of the Socialist Youth League of China under the influence of Chen Tanqiu and Dong Biwu. In October 1925, he was sent to the Soviet Union to study international politics at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. After the 1927 Shanghai massacre, the Communist Party of China established its own military force, and Wu transferred to Moscow Infantry School to receive military training. He worked in the Russian Far East after 1929.  Wartime career  Wu returned to China in May 1931, when the Communist movement was at its nadir. He enlisted in the Red Army and participated in the Long March. At the crucial Zunyi Conference in 1935, Wu served as the interpreter for the Comintern advisor Otto Braun (Li De), but opposed Braun and supported Mao Zedong's strategy, unlike other returnees from the Soviet Union who supported Comintern's orthodox line. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Wu was appointed head of the Eighth Route Army's Lanzhou office, which he developed into a hub for receiving and transporting military aid from the Soviet Union for China's war effort. After the surrender of Japan at the end the war, Wu was appointed Chief of Staff of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the formerly Japanese-occupied Northeast China. He became Chairman of the Shenyang Military Control Commission after the PLA seized the city in November 1948, and a member of the Northeast People's Government when it was founded in August 1949.

In November 1950, Wu attended a United Nations Security Council meeting as the PRC representative. He made a long speech condemning the United States for its \\"armed aggression\\" in Taiwan and \\"armed intervention\\" in the Korean War, and called for the UN to demand the withdrawal of U.S. forces from both Taiwan and Korea. In 1951, Wu was promoted to Vice Foreign Minister of the PRC. In March 1953, he visited Moscow again, as a member of the Chinese delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai, to attend the funeral of Joseph Stalin. In September 1954, Wu was elected a member of the Sichuan delegation to the 1st National People's Congress. In March 1955, he was appointed the PRC's first ambassador to Yugoslavia. He was elected a member of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1956. From October 1958 to April 1967, he served as Vice Minister of the International Liaison Department of the CPC.  Cultural Revolution and aftermath  During the Cultural Revolution, Wu resisted Kang Sheng's attempt to persecute the senior leader Wang Jiaxiang. On 8 April 1967, after he posted a big-character poster condemning the chaos created by the radicals at the International Liaison Department, Kang Sheng and Lin Biao arrested Wu as a foreign spy and imprisoned him for eight years. In April 1975, Marshal Ye Jianying worked to rehabilitate Wu and appointed him Deputy Chief of the PLA General Staff Department. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Wu was appointed vice president of the special court for the trials of the Gang of Four and the Lin Biao clique. He presided over 16 trials and participated in 14 others. He was elected a member of the 11th Central Committee and a standing committee member of the 12th and 13th Central Advisory Commission. He was also a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Wu published several memoirs, including My Life's Journey, Reminiscences of Wu Xiuquan, and Eight Years in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 9 November 1997, Wu died in Beijing at the age of 89. Family Wu had four daughters and a son with his first wife. After her death, Wu married Xu He () in 1948 in Dalian, and she gave birth to another daughter. Xu He was the third of five children of the educator Xu Yibing. Xu Chi, a renowned writer, and Xu Shunshou, a founder of China's aircraft manufacturing industry, were Wu's brothers-in-law.

Within the U.S in the state of Arizona they have been found in both mountainous and agricultural regions. E. mella is a parasitoid fly, a polyphagous generalist which parasitizes a variety of hosts. Female E. mella flies are selective when deciding on what host to parasitize. Once a host is selected a female may oviposit her eggs on the surface of the host. Larvae then burrow into the host for the remainder of their development usually killing the host once they emerge during either prepupae or pupae stage of development. Experiments in these flies have suggested that they can learn from experience that influence certain behaviors as suggest them as candidates for biocontrol agents to control certain pests.  Description  Physical characteristics include having a stigmal plate that is not elevated like their protuberance, as well as a sternopleuron pertaining to the thorax on the lateral side with three bristles. Likewise, behavioral characteristics include their parasitoid tendencies. As parasitoids, E. mella typically spend most of their life growing in a host. Unlike other fly species born in a host, in E. mella, neither sex determination nor sex ratio divergence is related to host size. However, the size of adult E. mella is directly correlated with the size of the host from which the fly emerged. Thus, flies that were oviposited and burrowed alone into larger hosts were larger than those that emerged from a smaller host or one that was superparasitized. A study shows that the sex of the emerging flies does not correspond to the host size or superparasitism of the host, though the two factors influence the size of adult flies, and the larger adult flies deposit a larger number of eggs than the smaller ones. Additionally, host larvae activity has a larger impact on parasite oviposition than host larvae size.  Distribution and Habitat  E. mella is commonly found in the United States and in Canada. In Arizona, E. mella have been found in the mountainous regions as well as agricultural regions of southern Arizona.  Life cycle  = Larvae = On average, the larval development of E. mella lasts for 10 days. Larvae emerge from their eggs on the surface of their hosts, after which they burrow into the host for the remainder of their development. Delays in development occur when the host molts. If the host does not molt, larvae are able to develop within an average of 6.4 days, as opposed to an average of 12.9 days if the host does molt. = Pupae = E. mella larvae are able to emerge from any stage (i.e. prepupae and pupae) of their host during their development. = Longevity = The lifespan of adult E. mella flies varies. Males typically have an average lifespan of about 29.5 days, while females survive an average of about 38.0 to 40.6 days.  Parental care  = Preoviposition = The earliest recorded viable eggs in a study were from females 48 to 72 hours old, which had immediately mated after emerging. Even without having mated, newly emerged females have also been documented to be able to oviposit infertile and consequently unviable eggs. The gestation period lasts for an average of at least 2 days upon emergence from the host. = Oviposition = Female E. mella flies extend their ovipositor onto the surface of their host of choice to lay their hard-shelled eggs. On average, a female E. mella fly can oviposit about 150 eggs during her lifespan. The most an E. mella fly has been recorded to oviposit on a single host for one study was 65 eggs. Typically, the oviposition period lasts for about 24.8 days. E. mella typically oviposit on the cuticle of their host, but have also been documented to oviposit on the head capsule, setae, prolegs, and on the abdomen of hosts. Though they prefer to oviposit on live hosts, females were also observed to oviposit on the surface of dead hosts. Larger females were also observed to oviposit a greater number of eggs than smaller females.  Parasitism  = Hosts = As a polyphagous and generalist fly, E. mella feeds on a variety of hosts. It has been recorded to parasitize the following families of caterpillars: Arctiidae, Noctuidae, Notodontidae, Lymantriidae, and Lasiocampidae. E. mella has also been noted by one study to be one of the core three parasitoids to account for the mortality of a variety of caterpillars. Some of these hosts, such as the Grammia geneura moth, have been observed to be able to fight back against parasitism by E. mella through a particular diet of plants, as well as surviving through adulthood. = Host selection = Female E. mella flies spend time browsing hosts by moving around habitats where they are likely to find hosts, such as in low shrubs and herbs that their hosts feed on. When choosing a host, the flies usually drum their feet on its body to determine if it is an adequate and living host. One experiment found that E. mella flies respond more strongly to certain characteristics of a host than others, one such characteristic being the movement of the host. The more the host moved, the faster the flies were observed to approach the host. Female E. mella flies have been found to preferentially oviposit on larger hosts. They have also been found to prefer host caterpillars that are in their late instar stage of development. = Experiments = One experiment observed more experienced flies learning and behaving in a different way than inexperienced flies. Where more experienced flies typically oviposited more eggs onto a host, experienced females were also documented to be able to recognize suitable hosts faster than inexperienced hosts and tended to oviposit on live hosts more often. Another experiment looked into the potential of E. mella flies as biocontrol agents in agriculture for certain pests. Where parasitism of the host rarely lets the pest that is chosen as a host live. The study itself looked at the ability of flies to do so either by depositing their eggs into a host described as macro egg laying or on the plant which they feed off of described as micro egg laying. E. mella was one of a couple of flies in the study that could deposit on both the plant and the host, with parasitism having a greater percentage to occur within a host.  Mating  E. mella flies have been found to mate shortly after emerging from their host, and the success rate of mating increases when the time before the formation of pairs after emergence is shorter. Both sexes have been observed to show a decline in their ability to produce viable offspring after a certain amount of time after emergence. For males, this was on average 14 days, while for females it was after 16 days of emergence. Males have been observed to have the ability to fertilize the eggs of more than one female. Thus, it is the usual case that pairs mate shortly after emerging from the host.

The novel is drawn from Mitchell's experience of queer communal living in the 1970s, with particular emphasis on topics of sexual liberation and anti-assimilationism. Synopsis Described by Artforum as a \\"fairytale-cum-manifesto\\", The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions is a series of allegorical vignettes set in the declining empire of Ramrod, ruled by \\"the men\\" (patriarchal society) under the rule of Warren-And-His-Fuckpole, while the eponymous \\"faggots\\" (gay men) live communally, produce art, have sex, and await the next revolution. Their \\"friends\\" include the \\"strong women\\" (feminists), the \\"queens\\" (drag queens), the \\"women who love women\\" (lesbians), and the \\"faeries\\" (the Radical Faeries), among others. Distinct from the faggots are the \\"queer men\\" ‚Äì gay men who are closeted, or who have assimilated into patriarchal society. The novel is primarily non-narrative, and is composed largely of a combination of single-page episodes, polemic writing, and aphorisms. Background and publication Mitchell was inspired to write The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions following a trip to The Castro in San Francisco in the early 1970s. He based the novel in part on his experience living in Lavender Hill, a queer commune in Ithaca, New York, that Mitchell and Asta were founding members of. Mitchell conceived of the book in reaction to a lack of contemporary gay literature; he initially planned for The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions to be a children's picture book illustrated by Asta, but it would ultimately become a novel of prose and illustrations. The novel was first published in 1977 by Calamus Press, founded by Mitchell to self-publish the book after being rejected by other publishers. The book subsequently went out of print, until it was republished twice in the 2010s: first in 2016 by Pocketed Books, and again in 2019 by Nightboat Books to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Stonewall riots. The 2019 reissue features a new preface by Tourmaline, and an introduction by Morgan Bassichis. Adaptations In 2017, a three-part musical adaptation of The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions was staged by Morgan Bassichis at The New Museum. Reception and legacy In the years subsequent to its release, The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions has developed a cult following, having proliferated through the circulation of unofficial photocopied and PDF reproductions. Reviewing the novel's 2019 reissue for Slate, critic John Russell comments on the novel's contemporary relevance, noting that \\"the descriptions of Ramrod's disintegration and the men's hostility toward the faggots and their friends are echoed in Trump's America.\\" Regarding the novel's utopian philosophy, Russell writes that he is \\"of two minds,\\" and expresses discomfort over \\"what seems to me like Mitchell's ultimate strategy of divestment from the world of the men.\\" In his review of The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions for The Nation, Sam Huber expresses similar skepticism, writing that \\"when I catch myself trying to force into coherence this book's scattered proposals for another world, I entertain the possibility that I'm reading it wrong [...] It's too weird and protean to serve as a guidebook for ongoing queer struggles or to propel us reliably into a revolution to come.\\" He nonetheless praises the novel's irreverence and continued relevance, stating that its similarities to contemporary politics are \\"like stumbling into a new room where many of the same actors and problems are reflected but with the fun restored.\\" References External links * The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions at Nightboat Books * The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions at Google Books Category:1977 American novels Category:1977 fantasy novels Category:1970s LGBT novels Category:American LGBT novels Category:American novels adapted into plays Category:Novels with gay themes Category:LGBT speculative fiction novels Category:Radical Faeries ","title":"The Faggots &amp; Their Friends Between Revolutions"},{"id":"61937593","text":"The 1911‚Äì12 Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team represented Indiana State University during the 1911‚Äì12 college men's basketball season.

She co-authored the three-volume series Flora of New Zealand Desmids in the 1980s and 1990s. Early life and education Born in Edmonton, London, England, on 26 May 1909, Flint was raised in the London suburb of New Malden until she emigrated with her family to New Zealand in 1921. There, she was educated at St Margaret's College, Christchurch, and went on to study botany at Canterbury University College, graduating with a Master of Science degree in 1936. Her master's thesis was titled The periodicity of the phytoplankton in Lake Sarah, with a consideration of some ecological factors, and required her to carry out field work at Lake Sarah, a sub-alpine lake near the university's field station at Cass. Flint then undertook doctoral studies at Queen Mary College, London, under the supervision of Felix Eugen Fritsch, investigating the changes in distribution of algae in a reservoir at Barn Elms, near Hammersmith. Her thesis was 'An investigation of the distribution in time and space of the algae of a water-reservoir (Barn Elms).' Career During World War II, Flint worked in London at the Metropolitan Water Board laboratory, and then, between 1943 and 1945, did operational research for the Royal Air Force. She then worked at the Shirley Institute of the British Cotton Industry Research Association, before returning to New Zealand in 1947 to lecture in botany at Victoria University College in Wellington. However, in 1948, she returned to Britain, to lecture botany at the University of Leeds, and then, from 1950, at University College Hull. Flint returned to New Zealand in 1955 as her father was terminally ill, but was unable to find full-time employment. She worked part-time at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) until retiring in 1974. She conducted research into terrestrial and freshwater algae, and published over 30 scientific papers. Later life and death From 1987, Flint was a research associate in the DSIR botany division, and co-wrote the three-volume series Flora of New Zealand Desmids with Hannah Croasdale and Marilyn Racine, published between 1986 and 1994. She continued research in a voluntary capacity at Lincoln University and Landcare Research two days a week, until she was 100 years old, and was co-author of a scientific paper published when she was aged 101. She died on 7 December 2011. Honours and awards In 1990, Flint was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1991 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to botany.

A member of this family is called a mustelid; Mustelidae is the largest family in Carnivora, and its extant species are divided into eight subfamilies. They are found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, and are a diverse family; sizes range, including tails, from the widespread 17 cm (7 in) least weasel to the 1.8-meter (6 ft) giant otter of Amazonian South America. Habitats vary widely as well, from the arboreal marten to the fossorial European badger to the marine sea otter. Population sizes are largely unknown, though one species, the sea mink, was hunted to extinction in 1894 and several other species are endangered. Some types have been domesticated, e.g. the ferret, a subspecies of the European polecat, and some populations of the South American tayra. Mustelidae is one of the oldest families in Carnivora; early mustelids first appeared around 28‚Äì33 million years ago. The 23 genera and 59 species of Mustelidae are split into 8 subfamilies: Guloninae, martens and wolverines; Helictidinae, ferret-badgers; Ictonychinae, African polecats and grisons; Lutrinae, otters; Melinae, Eurasian badgers; Mellivorinae, the honey badger; Mustelinae, weasels and minks; and Taxidiinae, the American badger. In addition to the extant subfamilies, Mustelidae includes three extinct subfamilies designated as Leptarctinae, Mustelavinae, and Oligobuninae. Extinct species have also been placed into all of the extant subfamilies besides Helictidinae, in both extant and extinct genera; around 200 extinct Mustelidae species have been found, as well as fossil genera not given a species name, though due to ongoing research and discoveries the exact number and categorization is not fixed. Conventions Conservation status codes listed follow the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Range maps are provided wherever possible; if a range map is not available, a description of the mustelid's range is provided. Ranges are based on the IUCN red list for that species unless otherwise noted. All extinct species or subspecies listed alongside extant species went extinct after 1500 CE, and are indicated by a dagger symbol \\"\\". Population figures are rounded to the nearest hundred. Classification The family Mustelidae consists of 59 extant species belonging to 23 genera and divided into hundreds of extant subspecies, as well the extinct sea mink, which is the only mustelid species to become extinct since prehistoric times. This does not include hybrid species or extinct prehistoric species. Modern molecular studies indicate that the 23 genera can be grouped into 8 subfamilies. Some prior classification schemes divided the family solely between the aquatic otters and all other species.

There are several additional proposals which are disputed, such as placing the Asian small-clawed otter as a monotypic genus Amblonyx instead of as part of Aonyx, or separating the Cameroon clawless otter as a separate species from the African clawless otter, which are not included here. =Subfamily Guloninae= =Subfamily Helictidinae= =Subfamily Ictonychinae= =Subfamily Lutrinae= =Subfamily Melinae= =Subfamily Mellivorinae= =Subfamily Mustelinae= =Subfamily Taxidiinae= Prehistoric mustelids In addition to extant mustelids, a number of prehistoric species have been discovered and classified as a part of Mustelidae. Morphogenic and molecular phylogenic research has placed them within the extant subfamilies Guloninae, Ictonychinae, Lutrinae, Melinae, Mellivorinae, Mustelinae, and Taxidiinae, as well as the extinct subfamilies Leptarctinae, Mustelavinae, and Oligobuninae. There is no generally accepted classification of extinct mustelid species, and many discovered species have not been placed within any subfamily.

Some of the processes studied under the umbrella of political cognition include attention, interpretation, judgment, and memory. Most of the advancements in the area have been made by scholars in the fields of social psychology, political science, and communication studies.  History  In the early 20th century, the psychological study of cognition encountered significant push back from behaviorism. According to behaviorists, if social psychology was to be considered a serious science, it should study observable and measurable phenomena. Since the processes of the mind are not observable and thus are hard to measure, behaviorist believed that these were not worth studying. However, as Gestalt psychology was introduced to the US by European immigrants, the dominance of the behaviorist approach began to declined. Questions related to perception, judgment, impression formation, and attitude change began to attract more researchers. In the 1950s, the development of new methodological tools ignited the Cognitive Revolution. In 1984, Susan Fiske and Shelley E. Taylor published the first social cognition book, Social Cognition. = Early theories of social cognition =  Na√Øve scientist  First proposed by Fritz Heider in 1958, the Na√Øve scientist model of cognition conceptualizes individuals as actors with limited information that want to derive an accurate understanding of the world. Much of the work done within this model focused on examining how people perceive and explain why others behave the way they do. This work served as the basis for the development of modern theories of attribution, advanced independently by Harold Kelley and Bernard Weiner. Kelley's attribution theory included the interaction between three variables: consistency, consensus, and distinctiveness. This interaction was summarized in Kelley's Covariation model, also known as Kelley's cube. Consistency refers to whether the person exhibit the behavior across time. The more the person exhibits the behavior across time, the more representative this behavior is of the person. Consensus refers to whether other individuals exhibits the same behavior when presented in the same situation. If many individuals exhibit the same behavior, then the behavior is less informativeness of the person. Distinctiveness refers to whether the person exhibits similar behavior in other situations. The more the person exhibits the behavior in other situation, the less the behavior is representative of the individual.  Cognitive miser  The cognitive miser model argues that, when individuals are attempting to understand the world, they tend to prefer methods that allow them to reduce the amount of cognitive work required to process information. This preference for efficiency leads to the development of biases and heuristics. In the past, political psychologists have identified a wide range of biases and heuristics--such as partisan heuristics and the Black utility heuristic--that people use to make political decisions.  Motivated reasoning  Motivated reasoning is a cognitive phenomena that occurs when an individual changes a peripheral attitude that is inconsistent with a more central element of the self. The purpose of these cognitive biases is to maintain a positive sense of self- esteem. In the past, they have been referred to as cognitive adaptions and positive illusions. Motivated reasoning has been extensively studied in political psychology. One of the most significant contributions of this area of research is the identification of cases in which voters adopt their preferred candidates' or party' policy positions. = Study of public opinion = In political science, the study of political cognition was facilitated by the emergence of survey research and a growing interest in understanding how individual make voting decisions. In the 1930s, however, the explosion of commercial polling agencies facilitated the collection of data at the individual level. The availability of this new type of data increased an interest in understanding what individuals know about politics, what attitudes individual have towards political objects, and how individuals make political decisions. In 1940, Paul Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, and Hazel Gaudet carried out one of the earliest studies examining how individual-level factors influence political decisions. The study took place in Erie County, Ohio. Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet were interested in identifying what sources of information influence an individual's political attitudes during an electoral campaign. They found that, among those who were less interested in politics, had not decided who to support, or change their voting intentions during the campaign, personal influences‚Äîsuch as the opinion of a friend or a family member‚Äîplayed a more significant role than the media. In 1948, by Bernard Berelson, Paul F. Lazarsfeld, and William N. McPhee carried out a similar study in Elmira, New York. Both the Erie County and the Elmira studies had been significantly influential to the study of American public opinion. Their findings have been replicated repeatedly and still explain the ways people develop political attitudes today. The biggest influence of these studies, however, was their methodological approach. These two studies were the first studies that followed an individual's political attitudes and voting intentions throughout a campaign with an interview-reinterview approach. In 1944, the National Opinion Research Center (NOR) at the University of Chicago was the first organization ever to collect panel data at a national level in the United States. In the elections of 1944 and 1948, the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan performed similar panel-data studies at the national level. These studies were characterized by unstructured questions that allowed participants to express what they knew about politics, as well as what attitudes they had towards political actors and policies.  Major theories of voting behavior (1950s‚Äì1980s)  =The rational voter= In his 1957 book, An Economic Theory of Democracy, Anthony Downs argues that individuals are rational voters‚Äîi.e., they decide who to support by calculating which candidate will maximize the benefits they receive from the government, while minimizing the costs. This rational calculation is performed by taking into consideration the individual's interest, what the party in office has done in the past, and what the party in office and the party out of office could do in the future. Downs defines political parties as coalitions of political elites, whose primary goal is to be elected to office. Because they know voters behave rationally, parties adopt the policy positions of most voters to maximize their chances of being elected into office. The interaction between the rational behavior of voters and the rational behavior of the political elite facilitates the development of a two-party system when voters are normally distributed along the liberal-conservative spectrum. The reason for this is that each party will try to maximize the number of voters it can appeal to while still maintaining significant distinctions from the other party. This results in a party heuristic: voters start to consistently support the party that is closest to their beliefs along this liberal-conservative lines. Since its publication, the theory of rational voter has encountered numerous empirical challenges, as research suggests that the average voter is not equipped with the necessary information to make rational decisions as defined by Downs. Specifically, most American voters are unable to think in ideological terms‚Äîi.e., to articulate their political positions using coherent belief systems. Drawing from social cognition theories, some scholars have argued voters might be still able to make rational decisions even if they are incapable of putting their perceptions, beliefs, and rationales into the formal language of political elites. Specifically, these critics believe that, instead of expecting the average voter to present high levels of political sophistication, political scientists should take into account individual-level variations of information acquisition and processing. They propose that partisan biases motivate individuals to seek out and reject particular sets of information that then lead to candidate evaluations, and then voting. Thus, these critics advance a theory of rational voter that incorporates both cognitive processes and economic utility calculations. = Party attachment = In 1960, Angus Campbell, Philip E. Converse, Warren E. Miller, and Donald E. Stokes published The American Voter. Unlike most prior work, The American Voter was the first book to systematically analyze quantitative data at the national level from three presidential elections (Truman-Dewey in 1948, Eisenhower-Stevenson in 1952, and Eisenhower-Stevenson in 1956). This data was collected by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan. The theoretical framework derived from these studies is thus known as Michigan model. The American Voter is also one of the first works to ever look for observable implications of the rational choice theory of voting behavior‚Äîa body of work that claims voters are aware of political events, have well- developed political attitudes, and thus are able to aligned their votes with the candidate that is closest to their political dispositions. Lastly, this book was also one of the first works to incorporate a social psychological perspective to the study of politics. > Taken as a system, these [attitudinal] variables were seen to constitute a > field of forces operating on the individual as he deliberates over his vote > decision. As described by the quote above, the authors of this seminal work that a Lewinian view of the political world. They conceptualize attitudes towards political objects as field forces that led an individual to decide who to support in an election. According to Campbell and colleagues, the most significant of these forces is partisan identification, which the authors defined as a psychological attachment to a party. These psychological attachments are developed early in life and remain stable throughout adulthood. Today, partisan identification is still the strongest and most reliable predictor of vote choice. According to Campbell and colleagues, these partisan attachments function as lenses that paint the way people perceive political information about issues and political actors. Specifically, voters accept and endorse information that is consistent with their partisan beliefs, and reject information that is inconsistent with their partisan views. Additionally, since most voters do not have the time to acquire and process all political information available, they use these partisan attachments as heuristics, or shortcuts, when deciding who to support. = Political information and voter sophistication =  Ideology  In his widely known book chapter, \\"The Nature of Belief Systems\\", Philip E. Converse examines the nature of abstract political thought among American voters. Converse defined a belief system as a set of idea-elements that were interconnected by logical, psychological, or social constraints. These belief systems could vary in terms of how central certain idea-elements are to the belief system relative to other idea-elements. The centrality of each idea- element influences whether an individual changes her belief based on external changes in the political world. Idea-elements that are peripheral to an individual's belief system are more likely to change than idea-elements that are central to an individual's belief system. To perform this study, Converse relied on the analysis of open-ended questions. He specifically examines two things. First, he examines what types of political information is associated with what type of political attitudes. Second, he examines whether voters are able to provide an abstract reason to explain this association by referring to the liberal-conservative spectrum. He found that most voters do not think in coherent ideological terms. He divided voters into five types based on their ideological sophistication: Ideologues, Near Ideologues, Group Interest, Nature of the Times, and No issue content. About less than 10% of the voters are considered ideologues or near ideologues. Converse's findings provided further evidence against the theory of rational voting, as voters seem not to be aware of political events, seem to lack well-developed political attitudes, and thus might be unequipped to make rational and informed decisions.  Political attitudes  In 1992, political scientist John Zaller published his book, The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion. In this work, the author examines the processes by which people develop and report their political opinions. According to Zaller, the study of political opinion must be understood through the lens of political awareness and political values, which is summarized in his Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) model. This model contends that individuals receive political information, decide what to accept and store in memory based on their political values, and when asked to express their opinions about a topic they use a sample of whatever relevant information is accessible in memory to construct their opinions on the spot. Since most people do not have a direct experience with the political world, they often rely on the political elite--which includes both politicians and the media--to acquire political information. Zaller argues that voters vary greatly in terms of political awareness either because of a lack of interest in politics or because of a lack of time to pay attention. Consequently, the average voter tends to score low on measures of political knowledge. Zaller observes that this lack of political information is associated with the high level of attitude instability that is exhibited among voters. According to Zaller, this instability is a sign of voters constructing their opinion statements on the spot based on relevant information that happens to be available in memory, rather than the complete in-existence of an attitude (as suggested by Converse) or measurement error. When voters receive information from the political elite, they almost never receive a complete and neutral account of facts. They receive an oversimplified version of the relevant information that often comes with a political frame, which interacts with the voter's predispositions. If the information is consistent with the voter's prior beliefs, then the information is accepted and stored in memory. If the information is inconsistent with the voter's prior beliefs, then the information is not accepted. In political science, Zaller's work has been instrumental in the examination of two major types of evaluations: 1) on-line evaluations; and 2) memory-based evaluations. On-line evaluation model asserts that individuals update their evaluations of political objects every time they acquire new information. The memory-based evaluation model asserts that individuals construct their evaluations on the spot based on information available in the working memory. Because most voters fail to recall the content of information they are exposed to during a campaign, many political scientists believed that voters rely on memory-based processes to make political judgments. On the contrary, other scholars believed that voters do update their evaluations of political objects as they acquire new information, but these updates take the form of affective evaluations. Specifically, when voters receive political information‚Äîeither from a political campaign or from the media‚Äîthe voter processes that information and turns it into an affective evaluation that is then stored in memory. These stored affective evaluations are then used to make political decisions along with memory-based information. This process is known as the dual processing model. = Priming and agenda setting = Priming is a cognitive process that occurs when a stimulus changes the attitudinal or behavioral response of an individual. This process is facilitated by the activation of information related to the stimulus in the working memory without the individual's awareness. In the study of politics, priming effects have been primarily studied with relation to the media and political campaigns. In 1987, Shanto Iyengar and Donald Kinder published News That Matters: Televised and American Opinion. This work reported the results of a series experiments designed to assess the role of the media on political attitudes. They found that the primarily role of the media is to set the agenda for political evaluations. According to the authors, the media is able to achieve this by priming‚Äîor in this case, by making more salient‚Äîcertain political issues. These salient issues are then used to make political evaluations. Additional work has illustrated that priming only occurs among topics in which the voter has already well-established predispositions. = Persuasion = Most research about political persuasion has taken place within the context of campaign effect. Early work finds that campaigns that use various forms of personal contact (e.g., canvassing and telephone calls) to deliver information are more effective than campaigns that use non-personal contact (e.g., mailing information) at mobilizing voters. Contemporary research suggests that whenever persuasion‚Äîdefined as an attitude change‚Äîis achieved, its effects are relatively small and fade away rapidly. Additionally, well-developed political predisposition are not easily persuadable, while less developed attitudes move around fairly easily.  Social identities and inter-group relations  = Linked fate: black utility heuristic = In his 1994 book, Behind the Mule: Race and Class in African- American Politics, Michael Dawson argues African American voters use evaluations of their group-level interests as short-cuts to determine the policy positions, vote choice, and political engagement that would safeguard their individual-level interest. According to Dawson, this political heuristic was developed as a consequence of the historical oppression of African Americans, which facilitated the development of the belief that individual interest was linked to the racial group interest among African Americans. Consequently, this black utility heuristic is known as linked fate. Dawson argues that racial issues override class-based differences which results in the political homogeneity of African Americans. Additional work suggests that other groups‚Äîincluding Whites, Asian Americans, Latinxs, and women‚Äîalso exhibit linked fate. Other researchers have advocated for the revision of the current linked fate measure, as it seems to be inconsistently associated with group identification and with political engagement.

It is the last surviving suspension bridge built in empire style in the Czech Republic. Originally, between 1848‚Äì1960, it spanned the Vltava river near Podolsko, South Bohemian region. it was dismantled between 1960‚Äì1975 and moved to its present location near St√°dlec. Since 1989 it has been on the on Czech national cultural monuments list.  History  The bridge, designed by engineers Gassner and Friedrich Schnirch, was built by Vojtƒõch Lanna between 1847‚Äì1848 over the Vltava in Podolsko. It replaced the old ferry that at that time could not handle the growing traffic between Bavaria and Galicia. The bridge served for many years until 1960 when it was decided to take it down. The reason being that there was already a 510 meters long reinforced concrete bridge from 1942 towering above it and also the Orl√≠k dam was being filled and that would flood the bridge, at that time already a cultural monument. The bridge was dismantled, documented and stored at Mark≈Øv ml√Ωn. For ten years it has been waiting there for its new home. Finally a picturesque location on the Lu≈ænice near St√°dlec was chosen from several possible locations. After the relocation, the bridge has been in operation since the opening ceremony on May 25, 1975, connecting townships St√°dlec and Dob≈ôejice. = Relocation = The bridge was dismantled into 2,000 blocks and 1,100 steel parts and then reassembled. After ten years of temporary storage, however, some of the iron parts of the chains were damaged or missing at all, making it much more difficult to recover. Of the total weight 102 tons of the iron parts, 14 tons had to be recreated, and some new stone blocks had to be delivered. How difficult the dismantling and rebuilding was shows the fact that at some point the officials considered to shorten the bridge from the original 90 m length to only 60 meters. The construction was completed on May 25, 1975 by the ceremonial insertion of a memorial stone into the right bank pylon. The total relocation cost was 11 837 000 Kƒçs (at that time).  Description  The basic supporting structure consists of four chains arranged in two pairs. These are connected to the wooden deck by vertical rods. The chains are pulled through the holes in the two stone pylons bounding the bridge and anchored in the bricked stone blocks. The stone pylons form 4 m x m x 10 m bridge \\"gates\\".The pylon height is 13 m. The bridge is 6 m wide, 157 m long. Bridge tonnage is limited to 2.5 tons. The deck consists of oak planks, which were newly installed in 2007. The deck is 5 m above the water level. A mobile catwalk for minor repairs is installed under the deck.  Reconstruction  In 2005, during a general bridge inspection, it was noted that the wooden deck was significantly damaged. A total bridge reconstruction was scheduled for 2006-7. Repair cost was 3.5 million CZK. In September 2019 the council of the South Bohemian region endorsed the bridge repair. The estimated cost is 10 162 000 CZK and the work should commence in 2020. The unique bridgework is currently in disrepair since the wooden parts are attacked by a highly invasive and dangerous wood decaying fungus. The repair will include the replacement of all wooden parts and also anti- corrosion measures of the steel parts.  Recognition  In 1959 the bridge was declared a cultural monument. Since 1989 it has been on the on Czech national cultural monuments list In 2009 the Czech National bank issued a 2500 CZK commemorative gold coin as part of the Industrial Heritage Sites series. The coin was designed by Lubo≈° Charv√°t. In 2018 a postage stamp depicting the Podolsk√Ω and St√°dleck√Ω bridges was issued. The stamp with a face value of CZK 35 was designed by Milan Bauer, engraved by V√°clav Fajt.

This excellent play helped him qualify for South Africa's 1969 World Cup team.  Professional career  Henning's first top performance on the international stage was at the 1967 Engadine Open. After opening with an even par 70 Henning fired consecutive rounds of 67 and 66 to get into contention. As the final round started he was at ‚àí7, one back of Australia's Randall Vines. Henning fired an astonishing final round 62 to outplay Vines by 11 and win by 10 strokes. Two years later, in 1969, he would play excellently on the international circuit. In February, he won the 1969 General Motors Open at the Wedgewood Golf Course in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. He defeated compatriot Hugh Inggs by two shots. A month later he nearly won again on the South African circuit. He held the 36-hole lead at the Rhodesian Masters before shooting a \\"disastrous\\" third round 75 (+4) and ultimately finishing one behind, this time losing to Inggs. In June, he tied England's Alex Caygill at the Martini International on the European circuit. Henning had a chance to win outright but hit his drive in the woods on the last hole and would make bogey. In August, he finished runner-up to Italy's Roberto Bernardini at Munich's Agfa-Gevaert Tournament, one stroke behind. His final high finishes were in the early 1970s. In 1971 he would finish a distant runner-up to England's Peter Oosterhuis at the Transvaal Open. The following year he would win two team events with brother Harold. After his touring career was over Henning was the club professional at Wanderers for many years.

This species is primarily present in Central and South America, but has also appeared in Mexico. There have been reports of L. longipalpis as far south as Argentina, as they are found in a wide variety of ecological conditions. Both males and females feed on sugars from plants and aphids, but only adult females feed on the blood of other mammals. The species has recently begun appearing in urban areas throughout Brazil, and serves as a key vessel for the propagation of the parasite Leishmania infantum. The presence of these flies appears to be strongly correlated to the presence of domestic chickens in Latin America. The first major urban outbreak of the lethal Visceral leishmanias epidemic was detected in Teresina, Piau√≠ State in the early 1980s following a massive planting of acacias.Lima, L., Mesquita, M., Skrip, L. et al. DNA barcode for the identification of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis plant feeding preferences in a tropical urban environment. Sci Rep 6, 29742 (2016) doi:10.1038/srep29742  History of taxonomy  L. longipalpis has only recently (2017) been accepted as a complex of sibling species as opposed to a heterogeneous species. Earlier on, there were many doubts that L. longipalpis constituted a single species due to its wide geographic distribution over Latin America. Populations of L. longipalpis and sand flies studied within Brazil showed morphological differences. Males in the northern region of Brazil had only one pair of pale tergal spots, while those in the northeastern region of Brazil had two pairs. Thus, it was hypothesized that the species might be further broken down into two different forms. This hypothesis was confirmed through insemination experiments as males from one form of the species were unable to successfully mate with females of the other form. Since then, several studies within Brazil have been conducted to support the hypothesis that L. longipalpis is a species complex. Studies involving isoenzyme electrophoresis, genetic polymorphism assessments of DNA and mRNA, cytogenetics, analysis studies of nucleotide variation in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4, as well as assessments of other mitochondrial genes are all part of mounting evidence supporting the species complex hypothesis.  Habitat  L. longipalpis is the most abundant species of sandfly occupying northeastern Brazil, representing 97.9% of all phlebotomine sand flies present there. This species is followed in descending order of abundance by L. evandroi, L. lenti, and L. sallesi. L. longipalpis. These flies are most prevalent near animal shelters, such as chicken coops and corrals. They can also be found in houses, but only in small quantities.  Physiology  L. longipalpis possesses the enzyme Trypsin in their midgut, which is responsible for the primary digestion of proteins in females. Trypsin activity is naturally decreased by 36% to 46% during the first and second days after the second gonadotrophic cycle.E. L. Telleria, A. P. O. de Ara√∫jo, N. F. Secundino, C. M. d'Avila-Levy, and Y. M. Traub-Csek√∂, ‚ÄúTrypsin-like serine proteases in Lutzomyia longipalpis - expression, activity and possible modulation by Leishmania infantum chagasi,‚Äù PLoS ONE, vol. 5, no. 5, Article ID e10697, 2010. However, the presence of the Leishmania parasite within the sandfly is associated with even lower levels of activity of the protease enzyme. This modulation in Trypsin activity after a sandfly's second blood meal is suspected to produce a conducive physiological environment for Leishmania infections, which is exploited by the parasite.C. S. Moraes, K. Aguiar-Martins, S. G. Costa, P. A. Bates, R. J. Dillon, and F. A. Genta, ‚ÄúSecond Blood Meal by Female Lutzomyia longipalpis: Enhancement by Oviposition and Its Effects on Digestion, Longevity, andLeishmania Infection,‚Äù BioMed Research International, vol. 2018, Article ID 2472508, 10 pages, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/2472508. Transmission and development of the disease are consequently dependent upon the sandfly's access to multiple blood meals. Dogs that have been treated with the LJM17 salivary protein from L. longipalpis presented a more powerful cellular immune response in response to infection. Higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected with a specific increase in the production of IFN-Œ≥ and IL-10, indicating a stronger and longer-lasting immune response to the disease antigen. The strong immune reaction in response to exposure to the salivary protein indicates the protein's potential use in the field as a treatment to vaccinate dogs who then become immune to the disease. = Midgut = The acidity of the sandfly midgut is maintained at a stable homeostatic pH level of ~6, even in the presence of strong buffer solutions. However, the proper digestion of blood requires an alkaline pH of 8.15 in the abdominal midgut for proteases like Trypsin to function properly.Kelly, Patrick H., et al. ‚ÄúThe Gut Microbiome of the Vector Lutzomyia Longipalpis Is Essential for Survival of Leishmania Infantum.‚Äù MBio, vol. 8, no. 1, 2017, doi:10.1128/mbio.01121-16. Lutzomyia longipalpis females contain the ability to abruptly alter their physiology by switching the internal environment of the abdominal midgut from acidic to alkaline. The presence of undigested proteins serves as the acting stimulus to drive female sand flies to undergo a shift in abdominal midgut pH. Even though the pH of the abdominal midgut is alkaline, carbohydrate digestion is able to function efficiently due to the maintenance of the acidic pH of the thoracic midgut.  Diet  Humans are an important blood source for these flies, but they are also known to feed on dog, chicken, and armadillo blood. Blood from horses, guinea pigs, and humans provide the best nutrients to support L. longipalpis females in their reproduction processes. Interestingly, sand flies do not feed on the blood from cats or the opossums Monodelphis domestica. Most scientific evidence points towards L. longipalpis being eclectic feeders, signifying that they acquire blood from multiple sources. = Dangers of Multiple Blood Meals = Although the feeding of blood is important for the maturation of oocytes, too many blood meals can also negatively impact the lifespan of females. Lutzomyia Longipalpis, like most other blood-sucking organisms, ingest large amounts of blood in a single meal. A female sandfly consumes between three and ten times its body weight in one feeding.Gra√ßa-Souza, C. Maya-Monteiro, G. O. Paiva-Silva et al., ‚ÄúAdaptations against heme toxicity in blood-feeding arthropods,‚Äù Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, vol. 36, no. 4, pp. 322‚Äì335, 2006. Blood is rich in proteins, consisting mainly of hemoglobin (Hb), which accounts for approximately 60% of the blood protein content. The digestion of hemoglobin results in the release of high levels of the prosthetic group heme. Heme acts as a toxic molecule that can generate oxygen-reactive species and bypass membranes due to its high permeability. Elevated levels of heme in female L. longipalpis are suspected to be the cause of increased mortality for females that have ingested multiple blood meals.  Pathogenesis  Leishmania infantum in a bone marrow smear. L. longipalpis plays a primary role in the transmission of Leishmania infantum throughout several countries in South America.This parasite directly causes visceral leishmaniasis, which is a severe disease that affects internal organs, including the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. The parasitic pathogen is transmitted through the bite of a sandfly, and although humans can be infected, humans cannot spread the disease further. Instead, domestic dogs are the primary amplification host for the parasite. = Immune Response = The direct bite of an infected sandfly during blood feeding allows for the parasitic transmission of Visceral leishmaniasis from L. longipalpis to the vertebrate host. The sandfly saliva contains potent physiological compounds that cause anticoagulant, vasodilating, and anti-inflammatory activity, which influences the immune response of the host vertebrate.Abbehusen, Melissa Moura Costa, et al. ‚ÄúImmunization of Experimental Dogs With Salivary Proteins From Lutzomyia Longipalpis, Using DNA and Recombinant Canarypox Virus Induces Immune Responses Consistent With Protection Against Leishmania Infantum.‚Äù Frontiers in Immunology, vol. 9, 2018, doi:10.3389/fimmu.2018.02558. Dogs that have been treated with the LJM17 salivary protein from L. longipalpis presented a more powerful cellular immune response in response to infection. Higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected with a specific increase in the production of IFN-Œ≥ and IL-10, indicating a stronger and longer-lasting immune response to the disease antigen. The strong immune reaction in response to exposure to the salivary protein indicates the protein's potential use in the field as a treatment to vaccinate dogs who then become immune to the disease. = Microbiome of Midgut = For transmission of Leishmania to occur, it must first undergo development into an infective promastigote. This crucial step of development occurs in the midgut of Lutzomyia longipalpis. The microbiome of the midgut is a critical factor that influences the growth of the pathogen into its infective state. Sucrose-rich diets result in highly diverse, stable bacterial microbiomes. Meanwhile, blood-feeding diets cause a markable decrease in microbial richness, but this decrease is eventually corrected after a short period of time. Sandflies infected with Leishmania experience a progressive decline in the bacterial diversity of the midgut. Interestingly, the perturbation of the midgut microbiome due to the introduction of antibiotics causes the sand flies to become unable to support the parasitic growth of the pathogen. This highlights the bacterial microbiome of the L. longipalpis midgut as another area of interest that can be explored to control the disease.  Interactions with domestic chicken  Latin American chicken. One study within Bahia, Brazil discovered that people with chicken coops in their homes were 4.21 times more likely to contract zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) compared to those who did not have chicken coops. However, other studies have not been able to verify this significant correlation. Nevertheless, it is well known that L. longipalpis are highly abundant near chicken coops, but the relationship between chicken raising and ZVL is not fully understood because chickens are unable to harbor infections of the parasite. Although chickens cannot serve as host reservoirs for the disease, chickens may play a crucial role in sustaining populations of the sandfly vector for the disease, as well as attracting other mammals, such as dogs, for the parasite to potentially infect. = Theories of Explanation = One factor possibly contributing to the high L. longipalpis presence near chickens is the feeding of sand flies on chicken blood. Chickens are dormant at night, which leave large areas of exposed skin susceptible to fly feeding. The epidermis of chickens is relatively thin (~0.02 mm), which allows the sandfly to more easily pierce the skin to acquire the blood nutrients. From an evolutionary standpoint, one theory proposes that male blood-sucking L. longipalpis may have gained a significant mating advantage by staying near chickens and waiting for females to arrive and feed. At any given moment, the number of male flies far outweighs the number of female flies present on a chicken host, which is similar in size to their mating ritual of courtship. Thus, chickens may play a vital role as a hub for the propagation of the fly species. Another theory is that in general, many of these people who raise chickens in chicken coops tend to also raise other animals, such as pigs and livestock, in their yards. Dogs are commonly used as security to guard the chickens, which presents a convenient group of amplification hosts for the parasite within a concentrated area.  Life History  Lutzomyia longipalpis larva. The total developmental time for each generation lasts about 6-7 weeks. L. longipalpis follow a general life cycle common to sand flies consisting of eggs, larvae, and pupae, and winged adults. After the female acquires a blood meal, oviposition occurs within 5-9 days. After eggs are laid, they require 4-9 days to grow before they hatch. Larvae develop in 9-24 days, while pupae then develop in approximately 10 days. Carrasquilla, Mar√≠a C. ‚ÄúFeatured Creatures: Lutzomyia Longipalpis.‚Äù Entomology and Nematology Department, University of Florida, University of Florida, May 2015, entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/flies/Lutzomyia_longipalpis.htm. Immature stages involve growth in the ground, and soil traps have identified chicken sheds as the optimal breeding site for L. longipalpis larvae. Implications for the residence of these larvae suggest that larval control at chicken sheds could aid in control of adult flies and thus, disease pathogenesis with regards to L. infantum. = Development = After emergence from pupae, both male and female L. longipalpis initially feed on sugars from plants and aphids, but as development occurs, only adult females are hematophagous. Both genders will consume sugar-rich foods, such as nectar, honey dew, and plant sap, but females will feed on a wide range of vertebrates, including dogs, chickens, horses, and humans. The blood meal serves as an essential step for the maturation of the ovaries. After consuming a fulfilling amount of blood, the female starts its digestion, which requires three to four days.N. F. C. Secundino, I. Eger-Mangrich, E. M. Braga, M. M. Santoro, and P. F. P. Pimenta, ‚ÄúLutzomyia longipalpis peritrophic matrix: Formation, structure, and chemical composition,‚Äù Journal of Medical Entomology, vol. 42, no. 6, pp. 928‚Äì938, 2005. Females are anautogenous insects, so egg development only occurs after a blood meal. Oviposition begins six days after the blood meal and generally lasts for six days.R. S. Milleron, C. R. Meneses, D. A. Elnaiem, and G. C. Lanzaro, ‚ÄúEffects of varying moisture on egg production and longevity of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae),‚Äù Journal of Medical Entomology, vol. 45, no. 1, pp. 160‚Äì165, 2008. However, a second blood feed is required to start a new cycle of digestion and oviposition.MD. Buescher, LC. Rutledge, J. Roberts, and JH. Nelson, Observations on multiple feeding by Lutzomyia longipalpis in the laboratory (Diptera: Psychodidae), Mosquito News, 1984.  Mating  This species has an overall sex ratio of 2:1 for males to females, so males outnumber females. Males of the species complex are attracted to vertebrate host odors called kairomones and collectively form nocturnal aggregations called leks near the hosts. Females, unlike males, are haematophagous and are attracted to the lek both by the kairomones secreted from the host, as well as the sex pheromones secreted by the males. = Males = Males possess glands that secrete pheromones to attract females that can act over a distance of 240 cm. After birth, pheromone biosynthesis occurs after 12 hours, and it takes males 24 hours to become sexually mature. Male courtship behavior involves the aggregation of males who compete with one another by producing sex pheromones. Males encircle females and use the vibrating movement and flapping of their wings to produce audible sounds. These pre-mating signaling frequencies resemble a song that the males use to attract and court the females.  Ecology  Several abiotic factors, such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity have been shown to influence the population density size of these sand flies. Rainfall is the most influential variable accounting for population size as documented increases in population size occur during the rainy months and directly after the rainy period. Higher relative humidity is significantly correlated with higher population sizes of the species, as well. = Flora = Legume plant. Because the diversity and quantity of plant wildlife are largely associated with the quality and availability of resources that insects can utilize, acacias have been targeted as a point of interest in their involvement with L. longipalpis and the propagation of its disease.Costa, F. V., Siqueira Neves, F., Oliveira Silva, J. & Fagundes, M. Relationship between plant development, tannin concentration and insects associated with Copaifera langsdorffii (Fabaceae). Arthropod-Plant Interactions 5, 9‚Äì18 (2010). Acacia trees attract the presence of these sand flies due to their ability to provide protection from predators, allowing the flies to proliferate. Sand flies also require sugar from plants as their energy source. Plants from the family Fabaceae are preferentially selected for in the feeding diet of L. longipalpis, while other trees that may be more abundant, such as the Anacardiacea and Meliaceae families are not preferred by the fly species. The Fabaceae family is commonly known as legumes and contain a mixture of carbohydrates ranging from simple sugars to complex heteropolysaccharides. The sandfly species are attracted to the specific carbohydrate composition of this plant species over others.

The multiple price list format is a simple procedure where participants are asked to respond yes or no to a variety of prices for a commodity, and while doing so, reveal their willingness to pay. Traditionally, the multiple price list format has had three potential flaws, interval responses, the ability to switch answers between prices, and framing effects. After manipulating the traditional price list format, Rutstr√∂m et al. were able to mitigate the majority of framing effects (tendency to move towards the middle price choice), and reduce a portion of ordering effects. Ordering effects still present were determined to be a result of human fatigue and the possibility of a learning curve as they moved farther down in the responses. Overall, they found that by manipulating small features of the multiple price list format, it could be improved to provide more accurate results on risk preference. This should specifically be designed for each unique population, due to differing results across groups. When eliciting discount rates, it was found that results were more consistent and the same level of format manipulation was not necessary.  \\"Eliciting Risk and Time Preferences\\"  In this 2008 paper, Rutstr√∂m was part of a group of researchers who conducted experiments in Denmark to jointly bring forth time and risk preferences in participants. Isolating for these preferences in separate experiments, they determined that when examining an individual's utility, discount rates are not linear as previously assumed. When accounting for participants that are risk averse rather than risk neutral, the resulting discount rates were significantly lower. This is in response to the difference in an individual's trade-off between long-run optimization and short-term temptation. They recommend that experiments involving time preference should jointly consider risk preference for a more appropriate discount rate.  \\"Is the Dichotomous Choice Approach Incentive Compatible?\\"  In this paper, Rutstr√∂m et al. examine if using the dichotomous choice method with incentive compatible questions, results in an accurate willingness to pay. The assumption behind the theory is that individuals will answer a hypothetical question with the same response that they would to an identical question with real economic consequences. Using their own set of incentive compatible questions, results showed that the real and hypothetical answers were significantly different and they could not confirm that this theory on dichotomous choice compatibility could reasonably be confirmed. These results held true for different question formats and across all tested demographics, including non-students.  \\"Risk Aversion in the Laboratory\\"  In collaboration with Glenn W. Harrison, Rutstr√∂m examines the popular assumption that participants are risk neutral in experiments, and the implications of altering this assumption. Experiments were conducted to estimate the different risk attitudes of individuals in such a way that it isolated risk preference in the laboratory from other factors. The majority of participants are discovered to behave as risk averse, a few as risk neutral, and almost none as risk preferring. Levels of aversion were determined to correlated with observable characteristics of the participants. Because risk preference is present in many economic experiments, Harrison and Rutstr√∂m argue that proper measurement and application of these attitudes should be conducted in all applicable cases. Although different methods may provide slightly different results, they do believe that there are reliable methods that can provide worthwhile information on risk aversion.  \\"Estimating Risk Attitudes in Denmark\\"  Alongside three other researchers, Rutstr√∂m conducted a field experiment to analyze how groups of different socio-demographic characteristics differ in their attitudes toward risk. Using a carefully selected sample from a six-step procedure, they analyzed 253 individuals aged 19‚Äì75, representing the Danish population. They concluded that as a whole, Danish people should be characterized as risk averse, rather than risk neutral. Certain socio-demographic groups also displayed different levels of risk preference. In particular, individuals over the age of 40, and those of increased education levels, displayed higher risk aversion.  Academic and community involvement  Over her teaching career, Rutstr√∂m has acted as PhD dissertation supervisor for more than 20 years, including the supervision of ten master and honors thesis'. Between 2005-2009, she also served as associated editor for the European Economic Review journal. Twice, Rutstr√∂m has served on the board of major organizations. During her time at the University of South Carolina, she was a board member and president for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of South Carolina, in 1999 and from 2000-2002 respectively.

The distinction of these scales is what separates it from other members of its family. Male S. barbata are on average smaller than the females and have stripes that are closer together. Below the section of the abdomen, males have the hypopygium, which is the genital segments. At the end of the genital segments is the anus, which is flanked by two curved forceps that lack lateral motion. The triangular accessory plate lies just outside of the forceps with the posterior and anterior claspers near the median of the plate. The two-jointed penis is located between the claspers next to the forceps. Males also possess combs on their hind legs composed of a close arrangement of short, blunt bristles. These combs are a distinctive feature of males.  Distribution and habitat  S. barbata can be found in North American and the Middle East year round. These flies prefer areas with direct sunlight and warmer climates. S. barbata are usually found in dead and rotting meat and animal excrement, which are prime environments for them. This is because their larvae are facultative parasites, as they feed on organic tissue and use the hosts' oxygen reserve. Such parasitic feeding causes dermal myiasis in humans and animals.  Life cycle  The life cycle of S. barbata takes between 12 and 60 days. It involves the larva stage, the pupa stage, and the adult stage. The fly is viviparous, which means the female gives birth directly to live maggots, the larvae, as opposed to giving birth to eggs that later form into larvae. = Embryo = The embryo develops inside the female body and is deposited through the ovipositor into the food source, which is usually decaying meat or animal excrement, with a still intact egg membrane. Some of the deposits might be unfertilized eggs and thus will degrade into the food source. The larvae will remain in their egg membranes until they are totally developed, at which point they will break out and begin to feed. = Larva = Fully developed larvae tend to be about 3.6 mm in length and of normal musocid shape. The smallest width is at the anterior end and tapers out reaching a stable cylindrical shape in the middle. The anal and genital areas are still not fully developed and are less prominent, but they have developed tubercles. The larvae contains irregularly spaced spines that form rings at the posterior and the anterior ends of each segment. The spine of the larvae becomes lighter closer to the posterior region while maintaining consistent color on both sides. The average female has 60 larvae, but can have as few as 6 larvae. = Pupa = The pupa puffs up as it develops over time. All cells of one region of the body aggregate and puff up together. However, there is no synchrony between regions of the body. The thoracic region puffs up one day before the abdominal region. This puffing pattern is related to the development of the pupa and is not hormonally controlled. After the pupa is fully developed and after eclosion has occurred, the cuticle of the newly emerged fly is darkened, which requires a hormonal cue that is delivered by the emergence.  Genetics  The ovaries of S. barbata experiences and under- replication of rDNA resulting in half the amount of rDNA as compared to the brain. A similar result is found in Drosophila hydei, which displayed under- replication in both nurse and follicle cells. This degree of under- replication, 47%, is still less than that in polytene chromosomes of the salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster, which is 20%. This under- replication of rDNA is in stark contrast to the oocyte nuclei of most species of animals, which show an increase rRNA synthesis during the growth period. Under replication is thought to be a product of asynchronous replication during mitosis. This made an important contribution to scientific research because it indicated a possible energy-saving mechanism employed by certain organisms during development, which is currently being studied. = Eye mutation = Wild type S. barbata possess a red eye color, but the recessive autosomal gene ivory causes a white eye color. The mutation blocks the formylkynurenine pathway, which produces xanthommatin. Xanthomattin is a yellow-brown pigment in its primary form, and its reduced form is red, which gives the flies their red eye color. These flies can display an intermediate eye color if they ingest xanthommatin precursors. Ivory gene mutation is homologous to the D. melanogaster mutation vermillion and the M. domestica mutation green. S. barbata with ivory are less viable than wild-type.  Spatial perception  An experiment to test the spatial perception of the larvae and its effect on pupation can be performed in vitro. As the larvae are placed in the test tubes to explore the container thoroughly, they relate visual cues to tactile stimuli and distinguish between a closed and an open container. If the container is open, there is no delay in pupation and the pupa faces the open end. If the container is closed, it is delayed by four to five days only because the tactile stimuli is present. Pupation delay in response to a closed container stopped after the dimensions of the container increases beyond the limit of the larvae's spatial perception.  Relation to humans  = Forensic importance = It is one of the dominant necrophagous flesh fly species. Forensic entomology provides data about the interval of time that has passed postmortem and even circumstances surrounding the death. They are specifically useful since they deposit maggots directly onto the decomposing body, their larger, visible size, and difference in activity during different stages. Their main limitation, however, is due to lack of information surrounding their geographic distribution and taxonomic features. = Biological research = S. barbata was used to study the oxidation of L-3-glycerophosphate in mitochondria. It is found that the L-3-glycerophosphate does not enter the mitochondrial matrix, unlike pyruvate. This helps locate the L-3-glycerophosphate-flavoprotein oxidoreductase, which is on the inner membrane of the mitochondria.

Overview  The Canadian Nationalist Party (CNP) was founded on June 1, 2017 by incumbent leader Travis Patron. He ran under the party banner during the 2019 federal election in Souris‚ÄîMoose Mountain, the electoral district containing his home town of Redvers in Saskatchewan. The CNP's stated purpose is \\"to improve the social and economic conditions of an ethnocentric Canada\\" by maintaining the demographic majority status of white Canadians whose interests would be prioritized by the party over that of ethnic minorities. The party proposes discontinuing public funding for pride parades, restricting abortion access, establishing a mandatory national curriculum based on \\"European and Christian values,\\" and repealing the Canadian Multiculturalism Act. On September 15, 2019, the CNP achieved registered federal party status from Elections Canada. The party unsuccessfully ran three candidates in the 2019 federal election in the ridings of Souris‚ÄîMoose Mountain, Lac-Saint-Louis and Scarborough‚ÄîGuildwood.  History  On August 9, 2017, coinciding with the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the CNP organized the Toronto Nationalist Rally at the University of Toronto's St. George campus. The event's Facebook page described the rally as an opportunity to \\"discuss the nationalist movement in Canada,\\" and to protest Canada's immigration policy. A counter-protest was organized in response to the rally, and the University of Toronto denied the party the opportunity to organize on campus grounds. In November 2017, party leader Travis Patron announced his intent to officially register the CNP as a federal political party and field candidates for the 2019 federal election. On November 26, Patron started a cross-country tour in Toronto. During the tour, the party's meeting at the Belgian Club in Winnipeg, Manitoba was cancelled following protests. The club's treasurer subsequently resigned, and the organization voluntarily withdrew from Folklorama, the city's multicultural festival. In early September 2018, Patron reached out to People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier \\"to see if there would be any interest in possibly co-operating with the Canadian Nationalist Party.\\" Bernier declined any further discussions with Patron. In June 2019, CNP members were among several far-right groups protesting against Pride parades alongside Yellow Vest demonstrators in Hamilton, Ontario, and Pegida in downtown Toronto. Both protests resulted in violence against counter-protesters, with the latter demonstration resulting in a violent altercation between anti-fascist counter- protesters inside the Eaton Centre. The RCMP launched a hate crime investigation against Patron after Ottawa-based human rights lawyer Richard Warman filed a formal criminal complaint about a video Patron uploaded to YouTube warning of a \\"parasitic tribe\\" controlling Canadian institutions and calling for their permanent removal from Canada. During the investigation, the RCMP pursued intellectual property violations against the CNP for using RCMP trademarks without permission. On August 23, the party lost their registered virtual office location in the Toronto Star Building after Telsec revoked their services. The CNP gained registered federal political party status on September 15, 2019. Shortly after the 2019 election, party leader Travis Patron was charged with aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm and breach of probation, after attacking two women in Regina, Saskatchewan, who were sent to hospital for their injuries. The matter remains before the courts. A complaint was filed by the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center with the RCMP on July 15, 2020, against Travis Patron. In their complaint they claim that a post on the party's Facebook page constitutes hate speech. The RCMP had investigated the party in 2019 for a similar claim.

Galin E. Frye, 566 U.S. 134 (2012), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that attorneys of criminal defendants have the duty to communicate plea bargains offered to the accused.  Background  In August 2007, Galin Frye was arrested and charged with driving without a license for the third time, making it a felony in Missouri. The prosecutor in the case sent Frye's attorney two plea offers; one to recommend a three-year sentence with Frye serving only ten days in jail if he pleaded guilty to the felony, and the second to reduce the felony to a misdemeanor, and Frye to serve 90 days in jail. Despite these offers being made, Frye's attorney never notified him about them and they expired before being acted upon. Frye was arrested again for driving with a suspended license shortly before his preliminary hearing, after the offers had expired. He pleaded guilty to the new charge, and was sentenced to three years in prison. Frye filed for postconviction relief, claiming that his attorney's failure to communicate the plea offers denied him of his right to effective counsel. At a preliminary hearing, he testified that had he known about the plea bargain offers, he would have pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge. His appeal was denied by a state court, but the decision was reversed by the Missouri Court of Appeals.  Arguments  The reversal was then appealed by the State of Missouri to the federal Supreme Court. In oral arguments, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster argued that Frye's guilty plea was \\"voluntary, intelligent, and final\\" under Hill v. Lockhart and Premo v. Moore. He further argued that plea negotiations \\"are not a critical stage because ... the fate of the accused is not set\\", and as such the defendant is not necessarily entitled to counsel under the Sixth Amendment in this stage.Transcript of Oral Argument at 3, Missouri v. Frye, 566 S. Ct. 134, 139 (U.S. 2012). Emmett Queener, Frye's counsel, argued that \\"fundamental fairness and reliability of criminal process requires that an attorney provide his client information regarding matters in this case\\".Transcript of Oral Argument at 30, Missouri v. Frye, 566 S. Ct. 134, 139 (U.S. 2012). He said that Frye's plea was \\"unknowing and involuntary\\" because he was not made aware of all options that were available, including the plea bargain that was offered.Transcript of Oral Argument at 28, Missouri v. Frye, 566 S. Ct. 134, 139 (U.S. 2012).  Ruling  The majority opinion, authored by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, ruled in favor of Frye. In the opinion announcement, Kennedy said that, while there is no right to a plea bargain, because \\"nearly 95% of convictions result from a plea bargain ... this Court is unwilling to say that within that system [of plea bargaining], counsel's performance does not matter\\". He noted that even if ineffective counsel is shown in this case, Frye would still need to show prejudice as set out in Strickland v. Washington to obtain relief. The Court held that \\"defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused\\". The ruling of the Missouri Court of Appeals was vacated and the case was remanded.

Congress responded by declaring Vizcarra's presidency suspended and appointed Vice President Mercedes Ar√°oz as interim president, moves that were largely seen as null and void. The next day, on 1 October 2019, interim president Ar√°oz announced her resignation, while Vizcarra issued a decree for legislative snap elections to be held on 26 January 2020.  Background  The presidency of Peru and the Congress of Peru have been in conflict since the beginning of the tenure of former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2016. On 15 September 2017, Congress passed, by a wide margin, a motion of no confidence against the prime minister and the cabinet, leading to a complete overhaul of the cabinet and appointment of a new prime minister. Kuczynski resigned from office in March 2018, when the vote-buying Kenjivideos scandal broke. He was replaced by First Vice President, Mart√≠n Vizcarra. Vizcarra made anti-corruption initiatives his main priority, pushing for a constitutional referendum to prohibit private funding for political campaigns, to ban the re-election of lawmakers, and to create a second legislative chamber. Transparency International praised the move: \\"This is a very important opportunity, one that is unlike previous opportunities because, in part, the president appears genuinely committed.\\" While Vizcarra pursued actions against corruption, political leader Keiko Fujimori was arrested in October 2018 on money laundering and corruption charges related to the Odebrecht scandal. The Fujimorists of the Popular Force party held the majority of seats in the Congress of Peru and had made Vizcarra's efforts complicated since he was vice president. Following the arrest of Fujimori, the Fujimorist-led congress introduced a bill to change Vizcarra's referendum proposals. Peruvians ultimately agreed with Vizcarra's proposals during the referendum in December 2018. = No-confidence law = In the Constitution of Peru, the executive branch can dissolve Congress after a second vote of no- confidence. The first vote of no-confidence occurred in September 2017. Demanding reforms in the Constitutional Court organic law, Vizcarra called for a vote of no confidence on 27 September 2019, stating it was \\"clear the democracy of our nation is at risk\\". Vizcarra and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights criticized Congress for blocking a proposal for general elections while it quickly approved nominations to the Constitutional Court of Peru without investigating the backgrounds on nominees. Vizcarra sought to reform the Constitutional Court nomination process and Congress' approval or disapproval of his proposal was seen \\"as a sign of confidence in his administration\\".  Events  = Constitutional Court nominations = The Congress scheduled the election of the new members to the Constitutional Court of Peru for September 30. On September 30, the prime minister Salvador del Solar went to the Legislative Palace to request the approval of an amendment to the Organic Law of the Constitutional Court as a matter of confidence. However, the Congress scheduled the minister to the afternoon. While the congress started the debate for the election of the new judges, the prime minister entered the Congress hemicycle room. Del Solar addressed the lawmakers to vote to reform the Constitutional Court nomination process. However, the Congress decided to postpone the vote of the amendment to the afternoon. The Congress named a new member to the Constitutional Court of Peru. Many of the Constitutional Court nominees selected by Congress were alleged to be involved in corruption. Hours later, the Congress approved the confidence motion. = Dissolution of Congress = Notwithstanding the affirmative vote, Vizcarra stated that the appointment of a new member of the Constitutional Court constituted a de facto vote of no confidence He said that it was the second act of no-confidence in his government, granting him the authority to dissolve Congress. These actions by Congress, as well as the months of slow progress towards anti-corruption reforms, pushed Vizcarra to dissolve the legislative body on 30 September, with Vizcarra stating \\"Peruvian people, we have done all we could.\\" = Congress declares interim president = Shortly after Vizcarra announced the dissolution of Congress, the legislative body refused to recognize the president's actions, declared Vizcarra as suspended from the presidency, and named Vice President Mercedes Ar√°oz as the interim president of Peru. Despite this, Peruvian government officials stated that the actions by Congress were void as the body was officially closed at the time of their declarations. By the night of 30 September, Peruvians gathered outside of the Legislative Palace of Peru to protest against Congress and demand the removal of legislators while the heads of the Peruvian Armed Forces met with Vizcarra, announcing that they still recognized him as president of Peru and head of the armed forces. = Resignation of Ar√°oz = During the evening of 1 October 2019, Mercedes Ar√°oz, whom Congress had declared interim president, resigned from office. Ar√°oz resigned, hoping that the move would promote the new general elections proposed by Vizcarra and postponed by Congress. President of Congress Pedro Olaechea was left momentarily speechless when informed of Ar√°oz's resignation during an interview. At the time, no governmental institution or foreign government recognized Ar√°oz as president. = Legislative elections decreed = Vizcarra issued a decree calling for legislative elections on 26 January 2020. The Organization of American States released a statement saying that the Constitutional Court could determine the legality of President Vizcarra's actions and supported his call for legislative elections, saying \\"It‚Äôs a constructive step that elections have been called in accordance with constitutional timeframes and that the definitive decision falls to the Peruvian people\\".  Response  Christine Armario of the Associated Press wrote, \\"The dissolution of congress has plunged Peru into its deepest constitutional crisis in nearly three decades, and it may also be the start of a final, bleak chapter for the country‚Äôs most prominent political dynasty. When the legislature was last shut down in 1992, strongman Alberto Fujimori sat in the presidential palace calling the shots. Fast forward 27 years, and now it is the party led by his cherished eldest daughter that is being kicked out\\". Public opinion polls by the Institute of Peruvian Studies (IEP) showed that 84% of respondents approved of Vizcarra's move to dissolve Congress. A similar poll by Peruvian pollster CPI found 89.5% of respondents supported the dissolution of Congress.  Reactions  = Mart√≠n Vizcarra = The contested President Mart√≠n Vizcarra questioned the legality of the Congressional inauguration of Vice President Mercedes Ar√°oz as Interim President and the members involved in this act of challenge of authority. > You can't just say 'I've sworn in as President, but I was just kidding.' > Swearing into a public office in a legislative institution in front of a > congressional audience is a legal action in the moment.

He is a Professor of Physics at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams and Department of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State University. Lee's research interests include superfluidity, nuclear clustering, nuclear structure from first principles calculations, ab initio scattering and inelastic reactions, and properties of nuclei as seen through electroweak probes. He also works on new technologies and computational paradigms such as eigenvector continuation, machine learning tools to find hidden correlations, and quantum computing algorithms for the nuclear many-body problem. Lee is a fellow of the American Physical Society.  Education  Lee received an A.B. in Physics in 1992 and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Particle Physics in 1998, both from Harvard University. His Ph.D. advisor was Howard Georgi. From 1998‚Äì2001, he joined the nuclear, particle, and gravitational theory group at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for his postdoctoral research under the supervision of John Donoghue, Eugene Golowich, and Barry Holstein.  Career  Lee joined the North Carolina State University as an Assistant Professor in 2001, becoming Associate Professor in 2007, and Full Professor in 2012. In 2017, he moved to the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University as a Professor, jointly appointed in the MSU Department of Physics and Astronomy. In 2018, Lee served as the Chair of the Topical Group on Few-Body Systems and Multiparticle Dynamics of the American Physical Society (APS). Since 2018 he has been involved in the establishment of the Advanced Studies Gateway at FRIB, an initiative that brings together researchers, innovators, creative thinkers, artists, and performers from all fields. In 1991, Lee shared the LeRoy Apker Award of the APS with Stephen Quake. In 2014, he was inducted as a fellow of the APS \\"for the development of lattice effective field theory as a novel approach to the nuclear few- and many-body problem, and for applications of this technique to the structure of the Hoyle state\\".  Research and work  Lee's research group develops and applies methods such as lattice effective field theory to study superfluidity, nuclear clustering, nuclear structure from first principles, and quantum scattering and reactions. Some of the techniques include spherical wall methods for scattering on a lattice, impurity lattice Monte Carlo for quantum impurities, adiabatic projection method for nuclear scattering and reactions, pinhole algorithm for nuclear structure, pinhole trace algorithm for thermodynamics, and eigenvector continuation method for quantum correlations beyond perturbation theory. Lee worked with collaborators Evgeny Epelbaum, Hermann Krebs, and Ulf-G. Mei√üner, to perform the first ab initio calculations of the Hoyle state of carbon-12. He also worked with collaborators Serdar Elhatisari, Gautam Rupak, Epelbaum, Krebs, Timo L√§hde, Thomas Luu, and Mei√üner, on the first ab initio calculation of alpha-alpha scattering. His research group also works on new technologies and computational paradigms such as eigenvector continuation, machine learning tools to find hidden correlations, and quantum computing algorithms for the nuclear many-body problem. = Lattice effective field theory = Lee and collaborators are perhaps most well known for developing lattice effective field theory. Effective field theory (EFT) is an organizing principle for the interactions of a complex system at low energies. When applied to low-energy protons and neutrons in a formulation called chiral EFT, it functions as an expansion in powers of the nucleon momenta and the pion mass. Lattice EFT combines this theoretical framework with lattice methods and Monte Carlo algorithms that are applicable to few-body systems, heavier nuclei, and infinite matter. The Lee research group is part of the Nuclear Lattice EFT Collaboration, which has pioneered many of the theoretical ideas and methods now being used in lattice EFT calculations.

Kendi. The book discusses concepts of racism and Kendi's proposals for anti-racist individual actions and systemic changes. It received mixed critical reception. Background At the time of authorship, Ibram X. Kendi was an assistant professor of African-American History at the University of Florida. He previously worked at the American University, where he founded the Antiracist Research and Policy Center. He wrote a 2016 book titled Stamped from the Beginning, about the origins of racism in America. Synopsis He relates his evolving concept of racism through the events of his own life, touching on observations from classes he has taught, contemporary events such as the O. J. Simpson robbery case and 2000 United States presidential election, and through historical events such as the scientific proposals of polygenism in Europe in the 1600s and racial segregation in the United States. Kendi further details the manifestations of racism, such as scientific racism, colorism and their intersection with demographics including gender, class and sexuality. Kendi comes to define racism as any policy that creates inequitable outcomes between people of different skin colors. Therefore a person is not \\"a racist\\" (noun). A policy is \\"racist\\" (adjective). And policy is made by the powerful. He examines his own internalized racism and disagrees with the prejudice plus power model of racism, which would not allow for Black racism. Finally, he suggests models for anti-racist individual actions and systemic changes. Reception The book was published in August 2019 to positive reviews. In June 2020, following protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, sales of How to Be an Antiracist surged. The book was listed eighth and fifth in Publishers Weeklys hardcover non-fiction list on May 30 and June 6, respectively. It was listed third in USA Todays Best-Selling Books List of June 10. The book topped The New York Times Bestseller List in Hardcover Nonfiction list for sales in the week ending June 6. It has spent a total of 18 weeks on the list, as of the July 19 edition of the list. =Critical reception= Ayesha Pande praised the book in a starred review for Publishers Weekly, describing the prose as \\"thoughtful, sincere and polished\\" and the ideas as \\"boldly articulated\\" and \\"historically informed\\". Pande summarized, \\"This powerful book will spark many conversations\\". A starred review for Kirkus Reviews found it to be \\"not an easy read but an essential one\\". Jeffrey C. Stewart of The New York Times lauded it as the \\"most courageous book to date on the problem of race in the Western mind\\". Ericka Taylor of NPR praised the book as \\"clear and compelling\\", saying that it is \\"accessible\\" and \\"exemplifies a commitment to clarity\\". In a mostly positive review by The Guardians Afua Hirsch, the author received praise for \\"honesty in linking his personal struggles\\" to the book's subject, which Hirsch described as \\"brilliantly simple\\" and \\"dogmatic\\", but criticism for personal anecdotes that seem incomplete and for a style resembling a textbook too much. It was the Book of the Day in a review for The Observer in which Colin Grant found that the book \\"encourages self-reflection\\" and praised the writing style as \\"calm\\" but \\"insightful\\". Coleman Hughes critiqued the book as \\"poorly argued, sloppily researched, insufficiently fact-checked, and occasionally self- contradictory\\". In The Washington Post, Randall Kennedy, praised Kendi's book for its candor, independence, and self-criticalness, but also critiqued it as having major flaws‚Äîespecially being internally contradictory and poorly reasoned. Andrew Sullivan criticized the book as having the character of religious tract with overly simplistic distinctions between good and evil that cannot be falsified, and being sparse on practical suggestions. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro criticized the book, claiming that the author changed the definition of racism to \\"the belief that any group differences can be attributed to anything other than racism.\\" References External links * Official website * After Words interview with Kendi on How to Be an Antiracist, September 7, 2019, C-SPAN Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:Books about African-American history Category:Non-fiction books about racism Category:One World (imprint) books Category:Racism in the United States Category:Random House books ","title":"How to Be an Antiracist"},{"id":"61938987","text":"Tetsuo Sat≈ç may refer to: *, Japanese rower *, Japanese volleyball player ","title":"Tetsuo Sat≈ç"},{"id":"61938996","text":"List of awards and nominations received by Dev may refer to: * List of awards and nominations received by Dev (Bengali actor) * List of awards and nominations received by Dev (singer) ","title":"List of awards and nominations received by Dev"},{"id":"61939008","text":"The Zhu Dayu Culture Museum () is a museum about fish in Su'ao Township, Yilan County, Taiwan.

Ji and his descendants held Jiaodong for 6 generations: *Liu Ji (ÂäâÂØÑ), King Kang (Â∫∑) of Jiaodong, 148 BC ‚Äì 119 BC; *Liu Xian (ÂäâË≥¢), King Ai (ÂìÄ) of Jiaodong, 119 BC ‚Äì 106 BC; *Liu Tongping (ÂäâÈÄöÂπ≥), King Dai (Êà¥) of Jiaodong, 106 BC ‚Äì 82 BC; *Liu Yin (ÂäâÈü≥), King Qing (È†É) of Jiaodong, 82 BC ‚Äì 27 BC; *Liu Shou (ÂäâÊéà), King Gong (ÊÅ≠) of Jiaodong, 27 BC ‚Äì 14 BC; *Liu Yin (ÂäâÊÆ∑), 14 BC ‚Äì 8 AD.Book of Han, Chapter 14. The last king of Jiaodong was deposed after the usurpation of Wang Mang. After the restoration of Eastern Han, Jiaodong was merged into Beihai Commandery.Book of Later Han, Chapter 1. In late Western Han, Jiaodong consisted of 8 counties, namely Jimo (Âç≥Â¢®), Changwu (ÊòåÊ≠¶), Xiami (‰∏ãÂØÜ), Zhuangwu (Â£ØÊ≠¶), Yuzhi (ÈÉÅÁß©), Ting (Êå∫), Guanyang (ËßÄÈôΩ) and Zoulu (ÈÑíÁõß).

The skate area is covered almost entirely by the roof of the former Milton Keynes Central bus station. Pronounced \\"Buzzy\\" () by the locals, the bus station, including the plaza that sits underneath its roof, is grade two listed. Location The full UK postal address of the Buszy is: 401 Elder Gate, Milton Keynes, MK9 1LR. History =The early years= The Buszy has always been a focal point of the skateboard scene in Milton Keynes, even before it became a designated area to skateboard. Long before the area was designated a skateboard plaza, Chris Ince and his family owned and ran the One Stop Caf√© inside the bus station. They sold skateboard products to the local skaters who skated the marble ledges and open flat ground areas around the station. The first skateboard competition was held at the Buszy in 1992, attended by between four and five hundred people. The Ince family, Chris, Jennifer, Steven and Damian built Radlands indoor skatepark that same year. =The SK8MK Project= Local skateboarder and cinematographer Lindsay Knight was instrumental in helping the local council understand the needs of the local skateboarders, making a video to help the Chamber of Commerce understand street skateboarding. He countered the actions of the local police, who had supported the criminalisation of skateboarding in Milton Keynes. =The Elder Gate Crew= The Buszy is historically the home of the Elder Gate Crew (EGC), a group of locals who skated at the spot together regularly. With the stewardship and cinematography skills of member Carter Hewlett, they released two skate videos documenting skateboarding at the Buszy during the late 200s, named \\"The Elder Gate Crew Video\\" and \\"Get to Know\\". =MK Skate= In May 2019, MK Skate, a project exploring the history of skateboarding in Milton Keynes, was founded, going on to secure ¬£97,800 in National Lottery Heritage Funding. To celebrate Milton Keyne's contribution to skateboarding, MK Skate delivered a city centre trail, an exhibition shown between 27 September to 22 December 2019, and a book. A permanent record of Skateboarding in Milton Keynes has been stored in the city's archive and the Milton Keynes Museum. Park Layout The layout of the Buszy =Obstacles= The Buszy has the following obstacles inside of the designated skate area: * A large marble and granite T-block * A low curved block * A 5 stair stairway * A large metal edged manual pad * A long flat medium height marble block * A short to medium in length, medium height marble block * A short very high to low manual pad * A small stair set * A fairly long metal edged, downwards sloping, successive chain of smoothly connected blocks also known as a \\"roller coaster\\" * A medium height, very long marble hubba style ledge down 5 stairs * A flat low, medium length metal bar * A medium height, very long metal edged hubba style ledge down 5 stairs Because the area is a street skateboarding plaza, the majority of the flooring is covered using the same large square floor tiles found in the rest of Central Milton Keynes. This is instead of a power-flowed concrete constructed floor found in traditional skateparks. Skateboarders new to the spot will notice the melodic rumble of the tiles as their wheels roll over them. Competitions and demos Since 1992, there have been many small events held at the Buszy by skateboarders in collaboration with local businesses and charities with both national and international professionals in attendance. =Notable events= There have been many jams, demos and competitions at the Buszy. The plaza has held demos and received visits from renowned professional skateboarding teams such as Girl Skateboards, Flip, Zoo York, DC, Element, Blueprint and Matix Clothing. Battle of The Buszy On 2 June 2007, Plan B Skateboards sent a team of Skateboarders to the Buszy to take part in a special one-off event called \\"The Battle of The Buszy\\". The group included professional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez. Go Skateboarding Day Each year on the 21st of June, there is a regular meeting of locals at the Buszy on Go Skateboarding Day. The event is loosely organised, and there is occasionally a competition that may include a game of S.K.A.T.E.. Easy access to the Buszy by train makes Go Skateboarding Day popular for Skateboarders from around the rest of the United Kingdom to travel to the plaza and skate. Hip Hop The plaza contains a large collection of vivid and creative art works as the result of many highly respected national and local graffiti artists working at the Buszy, who painted the large, free, legal wall that is situated at the near side of the designated skate area. All of the four basic elements of hip hop: breakdancing, graffiti, MC-ing, and DJing, have local history rooted to the spot. For example, members of the band Hacktivist would come to the skate jams to perform before the group was formed, gaining worldwide fame. Dance crew would regularly be seen practising in front of the reflective windows of the bus station. Charity =Make a Difference (MaD)= In 2005, the Community interest company Make a Difference (abbreviated to MaD), was given control of the Buszy to turn the disused building into a multi-service youth hub. With a ¬£500,000 investment from the SITA Trust and V, the national youth volunteering service, MaD spent the following ten years redeveloping the former bus station and delivered community youth services to the area. MaD was also instrumental in the majority of the skate jams and competitions that occurred between 2005 and 2015. Events were routinely overseen by Liam Snusher. On 19 January 2016, MaD's Buszy Twitter account announced the closure of the youth hub. The building owners, Milton Keynes Development Partnership, an agency of Milton Keynes Council, decided not to permit MaD further use of the building, stating that it did not have direct control of the Milton Keynes Development Partnership. The council now operates the carpark. =The Winter Night Shelter= Since MaD moved out of the building, The Winter Night Shelter has used the Buszy to provide shelter and assistance to the homeless population of Milton Keynes, which has grown significantly since sweeping local and national government cutbacks came into force. Business The owners of the building (Milton Keynes Development Partnership) currently let the old bus station's building to the following business tenants: *Romeo Dance Academy *New Money Recordings Romeo Dance Academy obtained a ten-year lease in May 2018.

It was the largest theatre in Brisbane. It was located at 193 Queen Street, Brisbane. Its fa√ßade was in the Italian Renaissance and Corinthian style.  History of the property  The property was originally owned by Byrne Hart. It was leased to C.H. Homes and Harold Ashton. It was later sold to the AMP Society in 1973. With the closure of the Winter Garden Theatre, a nearby cinema in 1973, Her Majesty's seemed the next likely candidate for sale and redevelopment. The Queensland government began to plan in the 1970's for an arts precinct in Brisbane, which would ultimately become the Queensland Cultural Centre. Her Majesty's was the only Brisbane theatre with a stage large enough to accommodate the scenery and staging requirements of a number of touring productions. The need for a large stage to possibly replace this kind of theatre would lead to the development of the Queensland Performing Arts Centre at South Bank.  Architect and interior design  The original theatre was designed by Italian born architect Andrea Stombuco and son. Stombuco designed a number of Brisbane's buildings in and around Brisbane. The chief builders were O'Keefe and Company and James Lang and Company were responsible for decorative features. In 1929, the theatre was modernised, rebuilt and reopened. Cedric Ballantyne and George McLeish were the architects of this project. The theatre was three storeys, and was 66 feet wide, 248 feet deep with a 60 by 63 foot stage. The earliest theatre included a hotel providing a public bar and tobacconist. The entry to the stalls and pit were via a fountain decorated with satyrs and other female figures. The auditorium ceiling was decorated with a number of cornices featuring egg and dart, chain and bead and other features. The cornices were decorated in rose, shamrock and thistle designs in green, salmon, blue and gold. Each side of the stage featured a pillar decorated in gold accents. Seats in the Dress Circle were in maroon velvet, as was the stage curtain. Stall seating was wooden chairs. Asbestos fire proof paint was used in the scenery, backstage and wings area to reduce the risk of fire. Ventilation was provided by air forced through earthenware pipes. The ceiling was designed to assist hot air to dissipate via a sliding section which was added to the theatre in 1901 by architect, William Pitt. The 1920 remodel of the theatre provided for additional seating, with the removal of the gallery and old dress circle. Another series of renovations occurred in 1941. Dressing rooms for performers were hot particularly in Brisbane summers.  Seating  The main auditorium could seat 1,911 people. This included dress circle, private boxes, stall and gallery seating.  Productions  The chief productions at the theatre were initially opera. In 1901 alone, 29 different opera productions were offered at Her Majesty's. Four theatre companies produced plays at the theatre. The theatre was the largest in Brisbane. J.C. Williamson's company held the lease on the theatre for over 80 years. Films were also shown there.  Famous performers  * Dame Clara Butt, a British contralto sang at a concert at His Majesty's in 1925 * Anna Pavlova and her ballet company toured in the 1920s *Ignacy Paderewski, the polish pianist toured in 1928 * Nellie Melba and Gladys Moncrieff * Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh performed at the theatre in 1948 *Bob Dyer *Dame Sybil Thorndike brought her company to perform there in 1932 The final performance at the theatre featured Australian and English performers, compered by Bobby Limb. Performers included Margaret Noonan, Brian Doyle, Barry Crocker, Reg Varney and Johnny Young.  Demolition  With the redevelopment of Queen Street in Brisbane's Central Business District to become a closed pedestrian mall following the 1982 Commonwealth Games, Her Majesty's was earmarked for demolition by the Kern Corporation. Despite community protest, the theatre was demolished on 23 October 1983 to make way for the Hilton Hotel and Wintergarden shopping centre in Brisbane's Central Business District. A Union ban on site over the preservation of the fa√ßade of the theatre caused delays.

He is credited with 25 confirmed kills. Life and career Kanno's Kawanishi N1K had extra stripes painted on it as he hoped they would lure enemies into attacking him. Kanno enrolled in the Japanese Navy Academy in December 1938, graduating in February 1943 in the 70th class. Upon completion of flight school, he was assigned to the front lines in April 1943, joining the 343rd Naval Air Group, quickly becoming a squadron commander (buntai leader) and by July 1944, leading (as the hikotai leader) the 306th Squadron of the . He gained the reputation as a rebellious but skillful fighter pilot. Initially based in Micronesia, his unit fought many engagements over the Philippines and the Yap island. On 27 October 1944 he claimed to have shot down 12 Grumman F6F fighter planes. He made requests to transfer to a kamikaze unit, but those were denied as he was considered too valuable a pilot to sacrifice. In December 1944 he became the squadron commander of the 301st Squadron of the 343rd Air Group. His unit moved back to the Kyushu in the Japanese home islands toward the end of the war. His final mission took place on 1 August 1945, two weeks before the end of the war, when he took off to intercept a group of B-24 bombers escorted by P-51 Mustang fighters off the island of Yakushima south of Kyushu. He sustained damage when a barrel of his gun exploded, and went missing in action shortly afterwards, presumed dead. His remains were never found. He was posthumously promoted to Lieutenant in the following month. In fiction Kanno is one of the protagonists of the Drifters manga and anime, where he was voiced by Tatsuhisa Suzuki.

History The palace dates back probably to the mid-15th century. The design is attributed to the architect Filippo Calendario, the designer of Palazzo Ducale. The palazzo has, nevertheless, undergone many renovations over the past centuries; it was almost completely rebuilt in 1847-48 by the architect Giovanni Battista Meduna. These interventions are visible on the side of the building facing the Rio Fosca river; they resulted in the mix of Gothic, late Renaissance, neo-Gothic style openings. Giovanni Battista Don√†, a member of one of the most important Venetian families, was an initial owner. Then the building was donated by the Republic to Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino in 1538, who passed the ownership to the Giovannelli family as a debt payment. The Giovanellis were originally from Bergamasco and became wealthy via investing in mines in Hungary. They bought the noble title in 1668, paying the enormous sum of 100,000 ducats to the Serenissima. Architecture The palazzo has three levels, including the ground floor. The noble floors are decorated with quadriforas flanked by pairs of single-light windows. The lower quadrifora is supported by a balustrade. The interiors were created by Meduna in the same period as the restoration of the Ca' d'Oro took place and were inspired by the neo-Gothic style. The interior rooms have coffered ceilings, stuccos, and marble chimneys. Also a very rich collection of art objects including La tempesta by Giorgione and Ritratto dell'Inglese by Titian was kept in the palace.

He was a Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine and a member of the Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. At the time of his death he was the head of the Department of Experimental Cytology at the Wellcome Research Laboratories.  Education  Goffe was born in 1920 to a black Jamaican father and a white English mother, who were both practising physicians. After attending Epsom College in Surrey, England, Goffe graduated in 1944 from University College Hospital with a medical degree. Goffe then specialised in pathology, first as a Pathological Assistant at the London Hospital and then at the Central Public Health Laboratory, taking some time out from the latter to complete a Diploma in Bacteriology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  Career  During his two years serving as Specialist in Pathology in the Royal Army Medical Corps, some of which was spent in Egypt, he turned his focus to intestinal pathogens such as typhoid. Once his national service had been completed, Goffe returned to the Central Public Health Laboratory, where he studied the poliomyelitis virus and helped to introduce cutting-edge techniques developed by Enders in the US to the UK. He set up a tissue-culture laboratory; worked on preparing inactivated versions of the virus; and was a member of a Medical Research Council committee aiming to bring learning from the US to develop a vaccine in Britain. In 1955 Goffe moved to the Wellcome Research Laboratories in Kent, where he worked as the Chief Medical Virologist. During his time at Wellcome he made important contributions not only to poliomyelitis vaccines, but also led on the development of an attenuated measles strain known as the \\"Beckenham\\" (also sometimes known as the \\"Goffe\\") strain. Goffe was involved in numerous clinical trials to test vaccines, publicly testing them on himself and his family to demonstrate his confidence in their safety. His interest in how some viruses could cause tumours led him to study the SV40 virus and the human wart virus, human papillomavirus. Two years before his death he was given the task of setting up a new Department of Experimental Cytology, unusual in that it was the first department dedicated to fundamental research at the Wellcome Laboratories.  Personal life  Goffe and his wife Elisabeth, who was a teacher, married in 1943 and had five children. Their son Hugh died from bone cancer aged 15, after which they set up the Hugh Goffe Foundation in his memory. At the age of 46 Goffe was drowned in an accident whilst sailing near the Isle of Wight.

The language isolate Tayap is traditionally spoken in Gapun by the Tayap people. Gapun village is the sole Tayap settlement, while all other neighboring villages are inhabited by non-related ethnic groups. The sociolinguistic history of the village has been presented in textbooks as a case study on how and why language shift and language death occurs. The village is called Sa≈ãgap in the Kopar language. In 2018, the village was burned down and abandoned due to violence among households. The former residents fled to the nearby villages of Wongan (), Watam (), and Boroi. Geography Gapun is located on a small hill overlooking the southern banks of the Sepik. The hill on which Gapun is located is part of a plateau that stretches from the village of Bosmun () in Yawar Rural LLG, Madang Province in the east to Gapun in the west. The hill used to be an island a few thousand years ago before alluvial sediment deposits pushed the coastline further northeast. The village is located about 10 kilometers from the coast with an estimated a population of 110 in 1992.Kulick, Don (1992). Anger, gender, language shift and the politics of revelation in a Papua New Guinean village. Pragmatics 2:3.281-296. Languages Tok Pisin is now the primary language spoken in Gapun, but Tayap was historically the primary language spoken within the village. Gapun is the only village where Tayap, a language isolate, is spoken. Gapun is currently undergoing a language shift from Tayap to Tok Pisin, since the Tayap people associate Tok Pisin with Christianity and modernity, while they associate their own traditional language with paganism and \\"backwardness.\\" Further contributing to the decline of Tayap is the fact that it is not spoken in any other neighboring villages, as Gapun is surrounded by Lower Sepik-Ramu languages such as Kopar, Watam, and especially Adjora.

The Court found that the bill was unconstitutional. The court ruled that patients were entitled to recover unlawful charges that they had paid because a person's rights to recover property are protected by the constitution[2017] IEHC 817[2011] 2 ILRM 157Doyle, O., Administrative action, the rule of law, and unconstitutional vagueness. In Judges, politics and the Irish Constitution. Manchester University Press, pages 6-12.  Background & Case Details  Article 26 of the Irish Constitution allows all bills to be sent to the supreme court by the president in order to ensure that they do not contradict the constitution. On December 22nd 2004, the President referred the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 to the Supreme Court for that purpose. Section 51 of the Health act 1970 defines \\"in-patient services\\" as institutional services provided to those maintained by the state either in hospitals, convalescent (nursery) homes or homes for the mentally disabled. The Act provides those in these institutions with maintenance, diagnosis, treatment, advice, medicines and special apparatus (if required). The act also distinguishes between those who can enjoy \\"full eligibility\\" and \\"limited eligibility\\" of such services. Section 45(1) of the Act describes Patients who are entitled to full eligibility as people who, without undue hardship, cannot arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependents. Section 53(1) of the act states that charges cannot be levied on those with full eligibility, however, section 53(2) stated that those with limited eligibility may be charged for these services if the Minister for Health makes regulations to this effect. Charges were imposed and money was demanded unlawfully from those with full eligibility, contrary to the express provisions of the 1970 Act. On August 6th 1976 the department of health reiterated to the health boards by way of a circular letter that all existing regulations made by the minister regarding in patient services did not apply to those with full eligibility. However, in spite of this information, the health boards continued to charge those who were considered fully eligible. The pool of people considered fully eligible was also increased in 2001 as section 1 of The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 extended the definition of those considered to be fully eligible to all persons who are normally resident in the state over the age of 70. Charges continued to be imposed on these people regardless. The Health (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2004 sought to amend section 53 of the 1970 Act by introducing new subsections (3)(4)(9)(10) and (11) regarding in-patient services. These provisions required the Minister for Health to regulate charges for some in- patient services; in addition the Minister was required to identify the \\"category\\" of people to which the charges applied, the circumstances for imposing them, and their maximum level[2005] IESC 7 at page 2 to page 4. Furthermore the bill required that a chief executive officer of a health board to reduce or waive a fee arising from the regulations if there was an instance of individual hardship. In addition the Bill sought to introduce subsections (5)(6)(7) and (11) regarding relevant charges[2005] IESC 7 at page 4 to page 10. These subsections would make the imposition of charges for in-patient services on persons with full eligibility lawful and would also consider them to have been always lawful. This would bar any patients bringing legal proceedings forward against the Minister for Health in order to recover their lost sums. In the past these charges had been imposed without any lawful authority and contradicted the express provision of Section 53(1) of the Act. Counsel assigned by the court stated that the Oireachtas lacked the power to validate past acts that, at the time, were unlawful[2005] IESC 7 at page 23 to page 25. While the Attorney General, sought to justify the provisions by referencing the cost to the state of paying the claims of patients who had paid charges levied without authority[2005] IESC at page 38.  Ruling of the Supreme Court  Following the referral of the bill to the Supreme Court, it was ruled: 1\\\\. The requirement for the Minister for Health to make regulations imposing charges for certain in-patient services while also setting out the category of persons on whom the charges should be charged was constitutional as well as the requirement that the minister set down the circumstances in which these charges may be imposed and the maximum level that the charges can be. Thus subsections (3)(4)(9)(10) and (11) regarding in patient services were all found to be constitutional[2005] IESC 7 at page 87. 2\\\\. The powers conferred on the Minister and Chief Executive Officers by ss 1(a) and (b) of the Bill were compatible with the Constitution[2005] IESC 7 at page 87. 3\\\\. Patients who had been unlawfully charged for these services had the right under articles 43 and 40.3.2 of the Constitution to sue in order to recover damages. The new provisions implemented by subsections (5)(6)(7) and (11) were therefore seen as an abolition of property rights and an unjust attack and therefore were found repugnant of the constitution[2005] IESC 7 at page 88.

The decision of Denham J, goes on to state in regards to hearsay that: \\"The relevance and weight of such evidence is a matter to be determined by the trial judge and that a judge should be careful on the weight he or she places on such evidence\\". The case also had implications for bail applications because the Supreme Court found that a high case load for the High Court had implications on bail decisions.  Background  On the 26th of November 2008, Tristan McLoughlin was charged with assault causing harm contrary to Section .3 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and was remanded in custody It is alleged that the assault occurred in a pub in Naas where due to the attack, the victim received 100 stiches over a period of four hours. The parties involved knew each other. His Brother had also been charged in relation to the same incident and was instead charged with common assault and was awaiting his sentencing. In the High Court, the prosecution objected to bail.This objection was on the basis that there was an alleged risk of witnesses' being interfered with as reported by Detective Inspector Hanrahan. As they had allegedly been intimidated in such a manner prior to the trial of the Appellant's brother. Where the injured party withdrew their statement die to this intimidation. One prosecution witness, for example, had their tyres slashed prior to the brothers case. There was an objection to the hearsay evidence and the case was adjourned until the 25th May, 2009. When the court re-adjourned, the counsel for the Director told witnesses claiming to have been intimidated were not in Court. The trial judge allowed the evidence to proceed, de bene esse. On cross examination, Detective Inspector Hanrahan suggested that no witness was in court because they feared for their safety. This cross examination was a key part of the trial because it directly connected witness intimidation to the bail application. A number of Garda√≠ gave evidence about intimidation. The judge stated that hearsay evidence was allowable in this case due to the circumstances and further ruled that the defendant should be refused bail.  Holding of the Supreme Court  The Appeal was allowed by the Supreme Court Judges and was remitted to the High Court. With regard to the issue of hearsay in bail applications, the justices allowed the hearsay evidence in the McLoughlin case, and declared that its important was for the trial judge to decide. They did, however, caution about the level of importance placed should be placed on it. Hardiman J, his opinion in accordance with DPP v. McGinley [1998 2 IR 408] stating that, the hearsay rule can lead to injustice if applied in a \\"rigid and unyielding manner\\" and for this reason, numerous exceptions have been grafted on to the general exclusionary rule. It was decided by the Supreme Court, regarding hearsay that: > ‚ÄúThe test is not whether the members of An Garda S√≠och√°na have fears or an > apprehension for witnesses. The court itself should be satisfied of the > probability of the risk of interference or intimidation and make that > finding expressly‚Äù. In this particular case, it was noted by Hardiman J. > that the evidence given by Garda√≠ regarding the information from the unknown > source was hearsay evidence as it \\"implied the truth of assertions made by > an unknown person whose credibility and general integrity as a witness could > not be tested by cross-examination‚Äù. Justice Keane stated in the ruling in the McGinley case that: > \\"Where there is evidence which indicates as a matter of probability that the > applicant, if granted bail, will not stand his trial or will interfere with > witnesses, the right to liberty must yield to the public interest in the > administration of justice. It is in that context that hearsay evidence may > become admissible, where the court hearing the application is satisfied that > there are sufficient grounds for not requiring the witnesses to give viva > voce evidence.\\". This was referenced in Justice Denham's opinion, In The > McLoughlin case, no direct viva voce evidence was given by witnesses of > intimidation, meaning that these witnesses could not be cross examined. In > the words of Hardiman J, \\"the admission of hearsay evidence effectively > stymies cross-examination because; one cannot hope to shake a witness who > can repeat that they are only saying what they were told, these difficulties > are compounded by the lack of opportunity on the part of the court to > observe the demeanour of the hearsay declarant under cross-examination.\\" Overall, in the McLoughlin case the admissibility of the hearsay evidence in this case was allowed but it was reiterated that this was an exception to the rule, \\"The result of this is that hearsay evidence may be admissible in a bail application, but quite exceptionally, and when a specific, recognised, ground for its admission has been properly established by ordinary evidence\\".

The spirit of the Supreme Court's judgement was that frozen embryos were not extended the same right to life as given to embryos protected in the womb. With an increase in IVF (in vitro fertilisation) among couples, legal issues arise when the couple decide to separate or divorce. This is a landmark case as it gave a judgement on such a circumstance where a couple has separated but there are surplus embryos frozen at a clinic. The Court made its decision by ultimately taking into account the right to reproduce.  Facts of the case  The Roches (Mary and Thomas) were married in 1992. Mary gave birth to a son in 1997. Subsequently she underwent surgery for an ovarian cyst and she lost part of an ovary. Again she had a fertility treatment in 2001 which proved to be unsuccessful. In July of the same year, the couple underwent in-vitro fertilization (IVF) at Sims Clinic Limited. As a result of this treatment, six viable embryos were created. Three embryos were used; three were frozen. As a result, Mary became pregnant and gave birth to a girl in 2002. Both signed consent forms and various other forms involving egg retrieval and embryo freezing. They both took full responsibility for the cyro-preserved embryos. The relationship between the couple broke down towards the end of the second pregnancy. They entered into judicial separation but they were still legally married. The Plaintiff wished to have the remaining embryos implanted into her uterus but Thomas objected to having another child with the Plaintiff and refused consent. As a result, Sims Clinic was unwilling to release them. In 2005, Sims Clinic informed both parties that they had \\"not received any payment\\" for the embryos since 2003 and that this failure resulted in a breach of unit policy which rendered the storage contract as void. With this in mind, Mary initiated proceedings in the court. = Issues = The court had to resolve a number of issues: # Are frozen embryos considered \\"unborn\\" in the context of Article 40.3.3 of the Irish Constitution (this has since been updated by the abortion referendum in 2018 to Article 40.3 of the Constitution). # Did the consent requirement end with the judicial separation. # Did Mary Roche have a right to the embryos. = Constitutional interpretation = Article 40.3.3¬∞ of the Irish Constitution stated that: > \\"The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard > to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, > and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.\\" Today this section has been removed altogether by Article 40.3 which states \\"provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.\\" As Article 40.3.3¬∞ did not define what was meant by \\"unborn\\" it was left to the courts to define the term and what it needed to protect. = Judgment of the High Court = The High Court decision was delivered by McGovern J on the 18th July 2006 in which he held that Mr Roche did not give express or implied consent to the implantation of the remaining embryos into Mrs Roche's uterus. It was not specified in the contract what should happen if a situation like the present one arises. To say Mr Roche is required by the contract to give consent to the implantation is false as there is nothing in the contracts binding him to do so. The most important issue before the Court was whether the embryos were 'unborn' for the purpose of Article 40.3.3¬∞ of the Irish Constitution. Witnesses were called to the stand, some of whom argued that from the moment an egg is fertilized by a sperm new human life begins. Others argued that human life only began once the embryo was implanted into the uterus. Another group of witnesses said that it was impossible to say when human life begins. Ultimately, the Court decided that since frozen embryos were not \\"unborn\\" within the meaning of Article 40.3.3, the rights arising under Article 41 were invalid. Also, it is not the Court's duty to explain the legal status of an embryo outside the womb. This matter is exclusively for the Oireachtas to decide on. The decision was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court where the appeal was dismissed.  Holding of the Supreme Court  The main issue that the Court dealt with is whether the frozen embryos stored in Sims Clinic can be protected under Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution by falling within the scope of an unborn as mentioned in the subsection. This is an issue under the rubrics of public law. Whereas the dispute about implied consent in the contractual arrangements between both parties falls within the realm of private law. In any case, the Appellant essentially argued that the frozen embryos did have a right to life despite the Defendant's objection. Appellant maintained this claim on foot of Article 40.3.3. The Court ruled against Mary and upheld the decision of the High Court. It concluded that frozen embryos were not \\"unborn\\" until they are actually implanted in a uterus. The court chided the legislature for failing to pass laws regarding embryos. Nevertheless, the Court did state that if a woman's only chance of having a child was access to frozen embryos then consent by an ex-partner could not be refused.  Subsequent developments  The Eighth Amendment was placed into the Irish Constitution in 1983 which made abortion illegal in Ireland. In May 2018 the Irish population voted to repeal this amendment and it was signed into law on September 25th 2018.

A \\"inordinate\\" delay of seven years before the man was charged, coupled with the nature of the offences being described as \\"a form of sexual experimentation between two children under the age of ten\\" led to the decision of the court.  Background  The appellant was nine years old when the \\"sexual experimentation\\" began with his sister, who was aged seven at the time. This carried on until shortly after the appellant reached the age of adult responsibility. In 1991, the appellant's mother expressed concern that her youngest daughter (J), then aged three, might have been sexually abused by the appellant. A social worker and psychologist reported their findings of these accusations to the Garda S√≠och√°na (the police) in January 1992. The appellant's sister (the complainant) was reluctant to make a complaint until April 1998, but decided to do so eventually out of concern for her younger sister (J). The complainant \\"made it clear that the only reason she made a complaint in 1992, and again in 1998, was because of her concern that the [appellant] might have been abusing her younger sister.\\" The appellant was not charged until 25 May 1999. The case was brought to the High Court in 2002, where the granting of an order preventing further prosecution of the appellant was refused. During the High Court hearing the DPP decided not to proceed with charges that occurred before the appellant was fourteen years old, as Irish law at the time did not recognise that a male under that age was capable of sexual intercourse. The DPP proceeded with all other charges. The High Court judge noted that > The fact that a young person commits a crime and delay occurs does not of > itself per se confer immunity from prosecution. If the delay does not occur > through any fault of the State and is explicable and reasonable from the > point of view of the alleged victim and if the accused's ability to defend > himself is not so impaired that [there] would be a real and serious risk of > an unfair trial, then the trial should go ahead. In this case I find no > reason why the trial should be prohibited. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.  Holding of the Supreme Court  Keane CJ delivered the only written judgment for the Supreme Court (with which the other judges agreed). The court stated that a period of \\"inordinate delay\\" existed in the seven year period from when an Garda S√≠och√°na were aware of the allegations in 1992 until 25 May 1999 when the man was charged. The nature of the offences were described as \\"as a form of sexual experimentation between two children under the age of ten and continued for a relatively short time after the applicant had reached the stage at which, in the eyes of the law, his actions attracted the same degree of criminal responsibility as adults.\\" It was also noted that the alleged activities did not cause the appellant's sister to suffer significant long-term psychological damage, according to a psychologists' report. Mr Justice Keane also noted the \\"bewildering contradiction\\" between the statement of the appellant, in which it was stated that sexual intercourse continued with his sister until she was nineteen years of age, and the statement of the appellant's sister, in which it was stated that the alleged activity ceased when she was twelve years old. Emphasising the importance of a speedy trial, the court concluded: > I am satisfied that, in this case, the nature of the offences with which the > [appellant] is now charged coupled with the inordinate and wholly > unjustifiable delay in bringing them to trial renders this a case in which > the constitutional right of the applicant to a reasonably expeditious trial > outweighs any conceivable public interest there might be in the prosecution > of the alleged offences. The court allowed the appeal and substituted the High Court's order for an order prohibiting the DPP from proceeding with the prosecution. External links *\`P.M. v.

Background  Kelly (a student of Trinity College Dublin at the time) made a complaint of bullying against a member of staff. Following internal investigations which rejected his complaint, Kelly appealed to the Visitors to Trinity College Dublin (\\"Visitors\\" are part of the oversight structure of Trinity College Dublin).See The 2010 Consolidated Statutes of Trinity College Dublin and of the University of Dublin, https://www.tcd.ie/registrar/assets/pdf/Statutes_incorporating_changes_22_May_2019.pdf. The Visitors decided that they had no jurisdiction to consider the complaint. Kelly sought to apply for the judicial review of this decision of the Visitors on the basis of the \\"composition of the Visitors and alleges bias\\".Kelly v Trinity College Dublin The application for judicial review was dismissed in the High Court (Abbot J) and was appealed directly to the Supreme Court pursuant to Order 58, Rule 13 of the Rules of the Superior Courts. Amongst the grounds on which judicial review was sought was that one of the Visitors, Professor Sagarra, was disqualified from the role by reason of objective bias as she had previously been employed by the university and had become a Pro- Chancellor of the university in 1999. Kelly claimed on Professor Sagarra's appointment as Pro-Chancellor she had sworn that she would \\"uphold the best interests of the University\\" and so by reason of her career and background, Professor Sagarra would be naturally biased in favour of the university. In making the claim of objective bias, Kelly relied on the test set out by Keane CJ in He relied on Orange Communications Ltd. v. Director of Telecoms (No. 2) [2000 IESC 79; [2000] 4 IR 159] in which Keane C.J. defined objective bias as the apprehension \\"that the decision will be set aside on the ground of objective bias where there is a reasonable apprehension or suspicion that the decision maker might have been biased, i.e. where it is found that, although there was no actual bias, there is an appearance of bias.\\"  Holding of the Supreme Court  Fennelly J delivered the sole written judgment, with whom the other judges agreed. The Supreme Court held that Kelly had not established an arguable case of objective bias against the decision of Professor Sagarra in her role as a Visitor. Noting that \\"former employments or association\\" are not sufficient in and of themselves to disqualify someone from participating in a disciplinary or similar tribunal and that Professor Sagarra's position as Pro- Chancellor did not undermine her ability to bring a \\"fresh and independent mind\\" to the matters before the Visitors, the Supreme Court cautioned against attempting to list the factors that may or may not give rise to a risk of bias. Citing from the English Court of Appeal case, Locabail (U.K.) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd [2000] 2 WLR 870; [2000 QB 451], the Supreme Court noted that \\"[e]verything will depend on the facts\\"Locabail (U.K.) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd [2000] 2 WLR 870; [2000] QB 451 [25], cited in Kelly v Trinity College Dublin The Supreme Court therefore held that it would not be a justified step to disqualify an otherwise qualified person from performing an adjudicative role merely because of that person's previous profession, social links or background. During the hearing Kelly also objected to the presence of Macken J on the Supreme Court bench for this case on the basis that Macken J was a graduate of Trinity College Dublin and had been a law lecturer there. This fact was raised by the judges prior to the hearing, but it was only after the hearing had commenced that Kelly raised an objection. The Supreme Court rejected this objection on the basis that past associations by themselves are not sufficient to establish objective bias and do not disqualify judges from performing their professional duties.  Subsequent developments  This case was subsequently cited with approval in O'Reilly v Lee [2008 IESC 21, [2008] 4 IR 269] where the Supreme Court in this case to establish that the fact that the President of the High Court appoints certain persons to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal does not, of itself, render the President of the High Court objectively biased. It was also cited with approval in R.V.

The court found that a European extradition can be applied if the offense is very similar to an offense in Irish statute.  Background  Mr. Damian Dolny of Wielkopolska , Poland was arrested and charged under the Polish penal code articles 156 ¬ß 1, 157 ¬ß 1 and 158 ¬ß 1 following a violent assault he carried out against Mr. Andrzej Lnka on June 20 2004. Mr Rafal Berger and Mr Tomasz Wyrwa assisted in this assault. Mr. Dolny was sentenced to a four year suspended sentence. He committed a similar offense during this probation period on May 6 2006. The District Court in Trzcianka sentenced him to ten months for this breach of probation order on August 11 2006. However, Mr. Dolny promptly fled the jurisdiction. The suspension of his sentence was lifted by Poznan District Court. Subsequently, he became subject to a European arrest warrant on March 17 2007. Mr. Dolny had traveled to the Republic of Ireland, where the arrest warrant was endorsed by the High Court on February 27 2008. This led to Mr. Dolny's arrest on April 23 2008. Mr. Dolny appealed the extradition order, and was brought before the High Court. There, the order was successfully upheld. The Counsel for the Minister of Justice Equality and Law Reform stated that the offense Mr. Dolny committed corresponded to s.3(1) of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997. However, the Counsel for Mr. Dolny rejected this. He submitted that Mr. Dolny's offense corresponded to s.2(1) of the Act of 1997. Furthermore, he claimed that the description of the offense did not contain all the necessary ingredients to constitute a criminal offense under Irish law. Mr. Dolny appealed the court's decision.  Holding of the Supreme Court  Mr. Dolny (the appellant) appealed on two grounds: Firstly, he argued that there were insufficient particulars stated on the European arrest warrant. Secondly, he disputed that there was a corresponding offense under Irish law, similar to the details of his own offense, he said, did not match s.3(1) of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, the Irish statute under which he had been charged. Miche√°l P. O'Higgins, S.C., counsel for the appellant, submitted that the learned High Court judge had erred in holding that the offenses of assault in s.2 of the Act of 1997 and of assault causing harm in s.3 of the Act are separate and distinct offenses and that it is not the case that s.2 is intended to define the concept of assault for all purposes of the Act. Furthermore, counsel for the appellant held that the European arrest warrant held insufficient detail to charge Mr. Dolny under s.3 of the 1997 Act. Robert Barron S.C., counsel for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform rejected the appellant's two arguments. In response to the appellant's claim that the European arrest warrant lacked particulars, counsel for the Minister referred to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in the warrant, and submitted that the learned High Court judge had been correct. As well as this, the counsel for the Minister noted that the arrest warrant was approved under s.5 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, which states: For the purposes of this Act, an offense specified in a European arrest warrant corresponds to an offense under the law of the State, where the act or omission that constitutes the offense so specified would, if committed in the State on the date on which the European arrest warrant is issued, constitute an offense under the law of the State. The court held that the statute that would be applied to Mr. Dolny's offense would be s.3 of the 1997 Act, and that the appellant's submission that s.2 of the 1997 act covered all aspects of assault was incorrect. On the issue of the arrest warrant, the court agreed that s.5 of the European Arrest Warrant Act applied in this case. They agreed with the counsel for the Minister that the content was clear if read naturally and could hence be used effectively as the original charge against Mr. Dolny. The court concluded that it upheld the decision of the High Court in its sentencing of Mr. Dolny.

It empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Location The Piashti River flows in a north-south direction for from Lake Piashti via Little Lake Piashti into Johan-Beetz Bay. The river basin covers . It is between the basins of the Corneille River to the west and the Quetachou River to the east. The basin is partially in the unorganized territory of Lac- J√©r√¥me. The river flows into Lake Sal√© (Salt Lake) about from its mouth over a dramatic waterfall. This lake receives the fresh water of the river, but also receives the salt water of the Saint Lawrence during high tides. The river enter the Johan-Beetz Bay, an arm of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, in the municipality of Baie-Johan-Beetz, in the Minganie Regional County Municipality. The village of Piastrebaie at the river's mouth was founded around 1860 by Joseph Tanguay and his wife Marguerite Murdock, who made their living by fishing for salmon. The present inhabitants are still mainly engaged in fishing and hunting. The village and bay were renamed in 1918 after the Belgian naturalist Johan Beetz. In 1898 Beetz had an imposing 12-room wooden house built on a rocky prominence looking over the Piashti River. The doctor's \\"castle\\" was classified as a historical monument in 1979. There is a hiking trail from the village to the falls on the river. Name The name \\"Piashti\\" originally applied only to the bay, and was later used for the river and the lakes. It means \\"dry bay\\", and perhaps refers to the fact that the bay is only accessible at high tide for vessels of average draft. The 1685 map by Jean- Baptiste-Louis Franquelin shows \\"Piastebe\\" as a place frequented by the Innu. In 1908 Eug√®ne Rouillard sometimes wrote \\"Rivi√®re Piasthi Bay\\" or \\"Rivi√®re Piashbe Bay. The 1913 Regional Map of the North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence named it \\"Piashtibaie River\\". In 1914 the Geography Commission used the form \\"Piashtih\\" for the bay. Description According to the Dictionnaire des rivi√®res et lacs de la province de Qu√©bec (1914), Environment A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the river in sub-regions 6j-T and 6m-T of the east spruce/moss subdomain. The north of the Piashti valley has potential for use by moose (Alces alces), and traces of moose were found in the region in 1978 and 1979. Lake Sal√© has large beds of aquatic grass, and is frequented by several species of seabirds. A banding station for migratory birds operated at Lake Sal√© until 2004, and held the record for the highest concentration of green-winged teal (Anas carolinensis) in North America. Birds of prey include the merlin (Falco columbarius) and bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). The river has clear water and a bed of dark-colored gravel and large pebbles. The last are accessible to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Other species of fish are brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), landlocked salmon and American eel (Anguilla rostrata). Baie-Johan-Beetz Outfitter has exclusive fishing rights to Lake Sal√© and the Piashti River. There are eight pools where salmon may be caught from a boat or wading. In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, Aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations.

The result of this decision was to broaden the use of fraud and specifically to rule that the charge of \\"conspiracy to defraud\\" is constitutional.\\"Report: Inchoate Offences,\\" Law Reform Commission, November 2010, ISSN 1393-3132  Background  = Case details = The case involved the efforts of an individual to resist extradition to the United States to face charges for wire fraud. The defendant argued that because there was no \\"wire fraud\\" crime in Ireland he could not be extradited. His argument hinged on the point at which he became involved in the fraudulent enterprise. The fraud involved two phases. The first phase involved obtaining money from banks under false pretenses.[2000] 4 IR 593 at 595 The second phase consisted of a \\"lulling phase\\" where the fraudsters assured the bank that the enterprise was legitimate. The first phase of the scheme corresponded to existing Irish laws, but the second did not, according to a lower court. The defendant in this case was involved in the second phase, but not the first phase. As such the court had to rule if there was, in fact, a corresponding Irish law and if so, whether or not extradition was permitted. In the U.S. , Oldridge was indicted for carrying out the scheme to obtain loans from the three banks by means of false and fraudulent pretences, representation and promises. He was charged with wire fraud and abetting wire fraud on various dates in order to execute the scheme in contrary to the United States Code. = The District Court & High Court = On 26 November 1997, the District Court (Judge Gerard J. Haughton) heard the application for the extradition of Oldridge to the U.S. in pursuant to Part II of the Extradition Act 1965 to 1995. On 17 December 1997, the District Judge held that he could not find a statutory equivalent in Ireland to the statutory offences in the United States with which the respondent was charged. The case then went to the High Court to determine if there was an Irish law that corresponded to the U.S. charge of wire fraud.[2000] IESC 29 at 2 In the High Court, prosecution argued that the \\"lulling phase\\" was essential to the fraudulent scheme, and because of this one could establish conspiracy to defraud as the corresponding offence. However, the High Court judge rejected this argument and ruling against the applicant, turned to the Washington Treaty. Under Article 2 (1) of the Treaty: > \\"An offence shall be an extraditable offence only if it is punishable under > the law of both Contracting Parties by imprisonment for a period of more > than one year, or by a more severe penalty. When the request for extradition > relates to a person who is wanted for the enforcement of a sentence of > imprisonment, extradition shall be granted only if the duration of the > sentence still to be served amounts to at least four months.\\"[2000] IESC 29 > at 9 The Court Judge held that conspiracy to defraud had no prescribed minimum sentencing and thus the requirement had not been met. On 10 November 1999, in the High Court, Kearns J. answered the first question in the negative and submitted that there was no corresponding offence. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted by the High Court on 20 December 1999 which resulted in the applicant appealing the case to the Supreme Court on 13 January 2000.  Holding of the Supreme Court  = Findings of the Supreme Court = The court agreed that participation in the \\"lulling phase\\" did not correspond to the Irish crime \\"obtaining money by false pretense.\\" However, citing Scott v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, the court ruled that the Irish law \\"conspiracy to defraud\\" was applicable. The court then affirmed the constitutionality of this charge in the context of extradition (and the Washington Treaty specifically), agreeing with the High Court case of Myles v. Sreenan [1999] 4 I.R. 294.[2000] 4 IR 593 at 600 = Conclusion = On 19 December 2000, in a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal and substituted the High Court order holding that there was a corresponding offence and that the corresponding offence in Irish law was conspiracy to defraud, contrary to common law.[2000] IESC 29 at 16  Subsequent developments  The case of AG v Oldridge was considered in AG v Burns [2003] in the High Court. The case was referred to in Egan v O'Toole [2005] in the Supreme Court and DPP v Bowe [2017] in the Court of Appeal. The case was cited in AG v Oles [2003] in the High Court and Minister for Justice v Fallon Aka O Falluin [2005] in the High Court.

Facts of the Case  Donal De Roiste served as a lieutenant in the Irish Defence Forces. He was commissioned on the 27th of February 1965 as second lieutenant and promoted to Lieutenant on the 27th of September 1967. He was assigned to the signal corps in Athlone. In April 1969, De Roiste claimed he was put under close service arrest by his superior officer. Upon release, De Roiste maintained he saw a solicitor about his detention yet proceedings were never initiated. In 1969, the director of military intelligence received a report. The report alleged that De Roiste was part of 'an IRA splinter group' whilst attending an auction in Clancy Barracks. Whilst interrogated, De Roiste maintained that he did not know why he was being interrogated. He also maintained that he was not aware of these people's activities. De Roiste was never arrested nor placed under court martial. De Roiste was then abruptly retired from his position under section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954. De Roiste then emigrated to Britain after his dismissal. He subsequently emigrated to America. He returned to Ireland in the mid 1980s. During the 1997 Irish presidential election, Adi Roche who is Donal De Roiste's sister was one of the five presidential candidates. During the election, the media began to release stories of her brother's dismissal from the Defence Forces and the controversy surrounding it.  High Court  Donal De Roiste took legal action against the State for judicial review into his retirement from the Defence Forces. Mr Justice Geoghegan gave leave to De Roiste so that he can seek judicial review regarding the circumstances of his dismissal. De Roiste took his appeal to the High Court. On the 28th of June 1999 the High Court Judge, McCracken J dismissed De Roiste's proceedings stating \\"In summary, therefore, it is my view that the applicant, while undoubtedly having suffered a traumatic experience, has not shown that he was so affected by that experience that he was unable to issue these proceedings over such a lengthy period.\\" De Roiste did suffer a traumatic experience, due to the report that claimed he was part of the IRA. He maintained his innocence yet he was wrongfully dismissed. However, there was a significant time delay in bringing the case against the State. After this decision De Roiste appealed to the Supreme Court.  Holding of the Supreme Court  The Supreme Court agreed that the time delay in bringing the case against the State amounted to a necessary dismissal of the appeal. In the nearly thirty years after his dismissal from the army, De Roiste had not brought his case to court. Hence, his appeal for certiorari had been in vain. An order of certiorari means a higher court reviews a case from the lower court, to determine whether an unlawful decision has been made. 'The State (Furey) v Minister of Defence' also involved an army member being dismissed from service. De Roiste had relied on the obiter dictum set out in Furey. Obiter dictum is a Latin phrase meaning 'by the way'. It is an opinion or non-necessary remark made by a judge. It does not form the legal judgment. It is of persuasive authority that may be used in other cases. McCarthy J delivered the obiter dictum in 'The State (Furey) v Minister of Defence': \\"... I see no logical reason why delay, however long, should, of itself, disentitle to certiorari any applicant for the remedy who can demonstrate that a public wrong has been done to him - that, for instance, a conviction was obtained without jurisdiction, or that, otherwise, the State has wronged him and that the wrong continues to mark his life.\\" One may consider that this is a fair evaluation, as a wrongful conviction, despite how long a delay, should be dealt with sufficiently. Denham J disavowed the dicta in Furey reasoning the time difference in both cases in her judgement: \\"These words were obiter dicta. Further, they appear in a judgement where the delay was one of four years. That is of an entirely different magnitude to the delay in this case of 29 years\\" The obiter dicta was not enough to persuade the court that there was a wrongful conviction\\". Fennelly J agreed: \\"In the nature of things a short delay might require only slight explanation. The judicial review time limit is not a limitation period. Prompt pursuit of remedy is, however a requirement of judicial review application\\". Denham J also stated in the facts of the case what could be used to extend time of a claim. However, these rules are not exclusive: > (i) \\"the nature of the order or actions the subject of the application; (ii) > the conduct of the applicant; (iii) the conduct of the respondents; (iv) > the effect of the order under review on the parties subsequent to the order > being made and any steps taken by the parties subsequent to the order to be > reviewed; (v) any effect which may have taken place on third parties by the > order to be reviewed; (vi) public policy that proceedings relating to the > public law domain take place promptly except when good reason is furnished.\\" Denham J conceded the actions that happened to De Roiste where serious and affected his life however his subsequent actions and delay in seeking relief justified the refusal of seeking an extension to judicial review.  Subsequent developments  The De Roiste case was an important case in terms of its clear and unanimous decision by the Supreme Court as to what constitutes a considerable delay in bringing legal proceedings against a defendant. Any and all proceedings must be brought in a swift and timely manner.

Climbing history Isolated, steep and protected by significant snow and ice Link Sar remained one of the world's highest unclimbed peaks until 2019. Attempts were made by Japanese teams in the mid-1970s. After this time few permits to access the mountain from the east were available due to the proximity to the contested border between Pakistan and India. Steve Swenson was granted a permit with others in 2001 and they made some limited progress from this side of the mountain. Attempts to obtain permits over the next decade for a return were denied. Jon Griffith made attempts on the western side of the mountain from 2011 with different climbing partners, scaling the Northwest Face in 2015 with Andy Houseman to reach the subsidiary peak of Link Sar West (6,938m). Illness and a narrowing window in the weather led to a decision not to press on the further 1 km to the main summit. Link Sar West, Northwest Face American Alpine Journal Swenson was eventually able to return to the eastern side in 2017 with Graham Zimmerman and Chris Wright. In atrocious weather they only reached a height of 5,900m on the Southwest Face but the experience enabled them to identify a possible safe route to the summit.
